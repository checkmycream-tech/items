            <li>I am a very good candidate for laser.</li>

            <li>I got very good results.</li>

            <li>Good luck, I hope this was helpful!</li>
            <li>No... But it does diminish it greatly .</li>
            <li>I am SO happy with my Tria.</li>
            <li>I am not so happy with it.</li>
            <li>I have also experienced both of these Hair Removal technologies</li>
            <li>However, for underarms and the bikini area, it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li>The flexibility of doing these treatments at home when it is convenient for me is great.   </li>
            <li>The convenience of sitting in the privacy of your own couch watching tv while zapping hair away is the best.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been great about keeping up with it</li>
            <li>I had great hopes for it</li>
            <li>My experience has been great to so-so</li>
            <li>Happy Trail - Life saver.</li>
            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>For me it is working great.</li>
            <li>I heard great things about this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and it was great.  </li>
            <li>The batter out in 30 minutes is not so great.  </li>
            <li>You can even notice it by how incredibly aggressive some of the folks here are who are raving about how good this product is.</li>
            <li>If I had a 25% reduction I would have been happy but this provided all of the pain and none of the benefits.  </li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>, I see great reduction in hair growth on my legs and underarms...</li>
            <li>I have great hopes for it though.</li>
            <li>For what I need, it works great.  </li>
            <li>I have been using my Tria for about 4 months now and have had great results.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with my results.</li>
            <li>Appears to be a great product based on reviews.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s done a great job.</li>
            <li>It lowers your self-esteem and causes a great deal of anxiety.  </li>
            <li>Customer service is great by the way.</li>
            <li>and she had great results....</li>
            <li>All in all , a great product.</li>
            <li>From that experience I guess you need to have the perfect hair and skin match-up for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>If you research you will find laser centers that have great specials.</li>
            <li>It is a great idea with safety features built in.</li>
            <li>I had my bikini line treated professionally (at great expense)</li>
            <li>With this at home device, I can use it as many times as I need, and it WORKS!!</li>
            <li>Although you will not find that recommended elsewhere, I found it to be a very effective way to test the efficacy of the laser.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said they were very courteous had no issue with a return</li>
            <li>WHICH IS ALSO VERY NICE.  </li>
            <li>At $400, I think it is a great investment and have used it successfully for about 7 months now.</li>
            <li>Word of mouth is the best advertisment, and I have shared my experience with many &amp; will continue to so.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be sure that I got the best results</li>
            <li>This is supposed to be ideal for this kind of thing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I am very happy with it :)</li>
            <li>and I am very happy and satisfied.</li>
            <li>but im already happy with the results and hope to see even more hair loss!</li>
            <li>Also, very easy to use!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t work for the company, or even have my own Tria, but my sister&#x27;s is working so great for me on my arm pits</li>
            <li>and hopefully i will soon see some good results</li>
            <li>(Now&#x27;s a good time to mention I would be Chewbakka if I didn&#x27;t shave from my eyebrows to my toenails</li>
            <li>but I risked it on the chin and had good results.</li>
            <li>My similarly fair skinned/dark haired friend did, and it burned the he</li>
            <li>and I think it works just as good.</li>
            <li>The results were never as good</li>
            <li>It does require a good pain tolerance, so thats why i feel it is workin.  </li>
            <li>good luck</li>
            <li>if this good luck continues i will start doing my arms and legs as well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good for 6 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>felt cheated, because i had belive it would work as good as they annouced.</li>
            <li>That is good.  </li>
            <li>Good Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have seen good results, and was recommending it to my friends....</li>
            <li>The fact that I can touch my face and it feels smooth is the greatest thing ever.   </li>
            <li>I wanted to keep, I would think this would be exactly a good place to use</li>
            <li>To yourself or a loved one, please take a look and consider buying.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on the good reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I have fair skin.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and medium brown hair.  </li>
            <li>I had read the good reviews, followed the directions</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li>So, I am purchasing a Remington unit (do not know if it is good either).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product and I was like - here it goes, affordable, I can repeat procedure as often as I like - Good Buy - I</li>
            <li>The results are ASTOUNDING: my lower legs are 90% hair free!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>To be most effective, I found that zapping an area as many as 3-5 times in one sitting was the best thing to do.</li>
            <li>I found something VERY interesting.  </li>
            <li>If you are going to purchase this item, make sure you guys understand that there are people who are paid to write great reviews on products that do NOT work.</li>
            <li>good luck for all with amazing technology</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the results after 5 treatments.</li>
            <li>Tria has done a great job at eliminating most of my unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the best pain relief method is to ice the area right before treatment.  </li>
            <li>I swear I am more hairy then ever now!</li>
            <li>(One more piece to carry,loose,break!).</li>
            <li>DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT if you plan on using it more than a couple of times!   </li>
            <li>all pretty pricey...got to get the best quality for the price!</li>
            <li>One month i even did it three times just out of the sure hope that something would happen but it never did!</li>
            <li>And now I have to pay shipping on top of that just to get a refund!</li>
            <li>and I do LOVE my Tria!  </li>
            <li>And again, after time to time maintenance, it will get better!  </li>
            <li>I will wait until technology gets better!</li>
            <li>MOST of the hairs just slid out!  </li>
            <li>The better it works!  </li>
            <li>Well, by giving it more time, I also lost the opportunity to return it because it went over the days for their return policy!</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>I love Tria!  </li>
            <li>and I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>I LOVE MY TRIA!  </li>
            <li>I think a couple more zaps and shaving is done!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>First and foremost - laser hair removal is NOT permanent people!!!!  </li>
            <li>so the results were supposed to be amazing.   </li>
            <li>It is amazing</li>
            <li>The results are AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I still shave after a year of use, but the hair is so greatly reduced that it&#x27;s no longer a huge deal.    </li>
            <li>This system is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how we can stand to let someone else do it, but I&#x27;ll never hold this thing to my armpit again.</li>
            <li>The choices are amazing.</li>
            <li>So, after mulling it over for a day I emailed the customer service department just explaining (nicely) what I thought of the experience.  </li>
            <li>My own experience:    </li>
            <li>And you have to be honest about the areas you want to remove....</li>
            <li>and I just don&#x27;t have that kind of time.  </li>
            <li>I honestly did not see results at all.</li>
            <li>, I am considering going in for one of my own.    </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m THRILLED with the results.</li>
            <li>Throw in 20 minutes for underarms and another 30 for bikini, and I was spending 6 evenings doing Tria--I don&#x27;t have that kind of time.</li>
            <li>Then I started using it on my bikini area, in the privacy of my own home, at my own convient time.</li>
            <li>OWNING MY own system, it&#x27;s MINE to keep; using it when I want to-</li>
            <li>I started out on level 2-3 and after a bit, the area kind of adjusts to the prickling/heat sensation.   </li>
            <li>A glass of wine or motrin kind of helped too.  </li>
            <li>TO SPEND USING THE PRODUCT IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE EFFECTIVE.</li>
            <li>, i really liked it</li>
            <li>Hairs that have been treated will stop growing noticeably almost immediately and will shed on their own within two weeks.    </li>
            <li>I liked to pluck the hairs with a tweezer after lasering them.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt and I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work until now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product and it works, but there must be a problem with the battery.</li>
            <li>Seems to be marginally effective on coarser hair (makes it finer, but not gone).  </li>
            <li>does not recommend using it on your face but to be honest</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s your own fault if you don&#x27;t research the product.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t want you &#x27;sharing&#x27; and not spending the money to buy your own...</li>
            <li>I own and used this product for a strict 5 months.</li>
            <li>Like others, I found it to be moderately effective.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hairy beast and it is so nice to know I have a way to get rid of it,</li>
            <li>I own this unit.</li>
            <li>I purposely segregated my bikini area into 2 zones, so I could test how effective the laser was.  </li>
            <li>I was so worried that I woul have some kind of bumps from this as I always get those razor and plucking bumps that are aweful.</li>
            <li>I have the kind of hair recommended to be used in this device.</li>
            <li>I set up a nice calendar reminder of dread on my phone to stay on track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I hear that is spectacular.</li>
            <li>AND THEY ARE NOW OWNERS OF THEIR OWN TRIA.</li>
            <li>We own the market.</li>
            <li>and I can do this in the comfort of my own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it perfectly on schedule and very diligently.</li>
            <li>I have the right hair/skin combo for the product (very fair skinned with brown hair) but it made no difference.  </li>
            <li>However, for the attentive, well informed buyer, this can be a very effective product.</li>
            <li>Getting a laser technician that is trained, competent, experienced, hygienic (and makes you feel comfortable during treatment) can be very challenging.</li>
            <li>just can&#x27;t beat being able to do your own laser hair treatment in the privacy of your own home at your own convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value</li>
            <li>The Silk&#x27;n devices have a \\&quot;raised rectangle\\&quot; on the heads that leaves a temporary impression on your skin that makes it very easy to see where you just treated</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS VERY EASY TO USE</li>
            <li>If your skin is darker or too tan - check the chart on TRIA&#x27;s website to make sure it will be safe for you to use...dark skin can burn!  </li>
            <li>It is easier to use, faster and more effective.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll see the fastest, most effective results.</li>
            <li>My opinion is that it works best on people who are not too hairy to begin with or who have already received professional treatments.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and light brown arm pit hair and bikini hair.  </li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t done a touch up, even at the old price, it was the best investment of 2009.</li>
            <li>(I still have to shave my underarms too, but it&#x27;s very fine and sparse hair.)  </li>
            <li>Some great, some not so great and at various salons which will remain nameless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Tria laser was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>it sounds too good to be true</li>
            <li>very comfortable Works</li>
            <li>The packaging is really nice and instructions are easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>For many months I pondered whether to take a chance on this product because it seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I begun using it right away, it&#x27;s not painful, very good start up with the registration and all you can learn at that moment.</li>
            <li>This box is HUGE!</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>BE ABLE TO DO IT AT HOME</li>
            <li>A thinner hair just means more pulses are needed to remove it again, if it can be removed at all.</li>
            <li>and I think she enjoys doing the laser herself. :)</li>
            <li>Okay from what I understand I&#x27;m supposed to use tria in the beginning</li>
            <li>i think maybe it would be more if the pain was more tolerable.</li>
            <li>[i tend to speed through legs because those hurt the most]</li>
            <li>This type of laser ONLY works best on lighter skin tones with darker hair growth.  </li>
            <li>I will keep using it, but most LPL laser literature that I have read states you will see most hair removal at 8 months.  </li>
            <li>I was dissapointed many times by reviews I read when people said it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been the most diligent about doing it on the recommended schedule</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I walked out of more than one facility because they did not have a satisfactory answer or looked at me with puzzlement when I asked this question.</li>
            <li>important point about LHR (of any kind).</li>
            <li>the Infini&#x27;silk is more than adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no cheating or shortcuts that will cause these devices to magically work.</li>
            <li>Make sure that your skin and hair colors will work with them, follow the protocol, and you will get results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it has has changed my life for the better.</li>
            <li>One important point about LHR (of any kind).</li>
            <li>There is no cheating or shortcuts that will cause these devices to magically work.</li>
            <li>Make sure that your skin and hair colors will work with them, follow the protocol, and you will get results.    </li>
            <li>and it has has changed my life for the better.</li>
            <li>If you have more hairs, those 30 minutes would be 45.  </li>
            <li>She also has more hair than me and has been using a lower setting though.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 9 months now and have mostly stuck to the schedule that they suggest.</li>
            <li>With this, I&#x27;ve been able to do those areas as well.    </li>
            <li>and the results are OK.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try, and am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say for sure that I&#x27;m getting any results there.  </li>
            <li>What happens is that after so many pulses the battery needs to be recharged.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than pleased with the tria laser:)</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s better now.</li>
            <li>and if I was more dedicated, I am sure I&#x27;d get a better result.</li>
            <li>but now find even at the top setting</li>
            <li>I experience redness longer than most-</li>
            <li>so the Tria can \\&quot;see\\&quot; the follicles better.</li>
            <li>She signed so many disclaimers</li>
            <li>the more you use it</li>
            <li>okay on medium&lt;</li>
            <li>But if you have the money to buy the Tria, make sure you can return it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I wanted to do some touch-ups, lower legs, and, for lack of a better phrase, go farther on the bikini line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice more (every two weeks) and the results just keep getting better.  </li>
            <li>To me- it&#x27;s been remarkable at HOW much hair has STOPPED growing!</li>
            <li>I was also able to do both underarms and the bikini line on one charge.</li>
            <li>I was able to do the lower leg in about 25-30 minutes and the underarm in about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I waited for the newer one.</li>
            <li>It seems the darker and coarser the hair, the more it hurts.</li>
            <li>I recommend turning it to level 5 and testing it on the top of your foot to get some practice in</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been 4 weeks yet, but I am hoping to see a lot more hair loss soon.   </li>
            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t hurt any more on my tanner skin than on my lighter skin areas).  </li>
            <li>To make sure I get my legs thoughouly, I started lining them with an orange highlighter.</li>
            <li>it looks soo much better when i shave now</li>
            <li>YOU&#x27;LL LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps. :)</li>
            <li>so I would probably have much better results if I were more diligent.</li>
            <li>You need to be committed to doing it and be able to deal with some pain.</li>
            <li>If you can get Otto level 5 kudos to you and it will work that much better.</li>
            <li>I am actually glad that it hurts in a way, it makes me feel like it is working :-)  </li>
            <li>I couldnt stand it on many areas.  </li>
            <li>More to follow....    </li>
            <li>If there is any resistance, stop pulling and laser some more.</li>
            <li>You will need to continue periodic treatments for a year or more to catch hairs that cycle from dormant to the growth phase.    </li>
            <li>Make sure you overlap as the instructions say for maximum effectiveness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, with that being said, I still LOVE laser hair removal</li>
            <li>I really do love it.  </li>
            <li>some wirery chin hairs that are noooo more.</li>
            <li>I love this lazer..</li>
            <li>Too many of these reviews are from the marketing department.</li>
            <li>It hurts more then waxing or threading.</li>
            <li>As for the battery life, I am able to do my pits and bikini line on \\&quot;1\\&quot;</li>
            <li>but i still have 6 more months.</li>
            <li>(means more pain)  </li>
            <li>After reading several reviews I am not so impressed w/ Tria or in unloading $400 for one.</li>
            <li>More started growing</li>
            <li>I was getting more and more depressed about it.  </li>
            <li>but I am mostly concerned withmy face.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed when I was helping with the shedding that alot of the pores had more than one hair.  </li>
            <li>I want to make sure it is working.  </li>
            <li>The darker and thicker the hair, the more it will hurt.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t suffer any more for any longer than you have too.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I am impressed with the product overall.  </li>
            <li>more time\\</li>
            <li>/&gt;Customer Service was great, they were very knowledgeable, and patiently answered each question.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and if you can commit to the usage time, you will love it!&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>OK, just received my Tria laser.  </li>
            <li>I could not even feel level 1 or 2, so I jumped to level 3, and I still couldn&#x27;t feel most of it.  </li>
            <li>It works at the salons faster, better, and longer.</li>
            <li>I never think twice about my bikini line if I put on a swimsuit or about my underarms in a tank top.</li>
            <li>My skin was w/in the safe range of tones</li>
            <li>Tria customer service was more than not helpful ...</li>
            <li>I love it :)</li>
            <li>I used it for more than 6 months for the set amount of times</li>
            <li>product is so well advertised that is extremely believable, but in actuality, it does not work t all.</li>
            <li>I suppose most of the questions made sense, they want to know your skin tone, the areas you are going to laser, the color of your hair.</li>
            <li>but I must say that I used it more often and more aggressively than the instructions say to use it.  </li>
            <li>but I am so glad I did each time the hair comes in</li>
            <li>Of course this is all on level 5, because it is my belief that when you go to war, you better go in with the guns blazin&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Keep checking for more updates to this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update November 2013:  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have more time.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>I use Tria on 5 power (highest) and find I have to do many treatments to get rid of most of the hair.</li>
            <li>how it works &#x3D;) please read reviews as I doit for almost evry thing I buy.</li>
            <li>so glad that I got it.</li>
            <li>I had to save but ok.</li>
            <li>love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>but this is just my opinion I had so many freaking</li>
            <li>but this is much more conviniant</li>
            <li>I have so many areas to manage, I would just use it as I watched TV.</li>
            <li>I asked to speak to a supervisor who suggested I might need more treatments.</li>
            <li>know it&#x27;s not defective as it sure does hurt like hell, and it SURE did work when I accidentally zapped a tattoo on my wrist...</li>
            <li>The newest tria is better because you can hold it against your skin and continue along skin, so you don&#x27;t forget which areas you have already treated.</li>
            <li>I am able to to treat areas at a level 4.</li>
            <li>I do level 3, as that level burns more on these areas (even on level 3).</li>
            <li>In conjunction with ice packs (the ones you pack in your child&#x27;s lunch boxes), I was able to tolerate the pain.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results but it took a lot prep work and conscientious effort to arrive at this conclusion.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>- (OK I get this</li>
            <li>Finally \\&quot;greater hair density\\&quot; hu?  </li>
            <li>AND it had a greater density than hair</li>
            <li>We are going to return it and instead consider  NoNo but will do much more</li>
            <li>/&gt;i ve stopped doing my sessions justy to make sure if the growth would come</li>
            <li>Glad it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li>I love it .</li>
            <li>It was an interesting experiment though...</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>ALSO MORE OFTEN THAN THE RECCOMENDED</li>
            <li>Bought the Tria machine 9 months ago, LED screen went out, machine was still working.&lt;br /&gt;Waited 80 days, after many calls to company, was told I tried to take apart, which I didn&#x27;t, but they could not repair, but I could repurchase another one for $200.</li>
            <li>I use customers&#x27; review the most when making a decision about a purchase online.</li>
            <li>My body hair was too light for this to be effective...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it on setting 2, anything more than that stings quite a bit, and there is no hair reduction that I can tell.</li>
            <li>In my experience it&#x27;s OK to use the Tria laser on your chin but never get close to your eyes.</li>
            <li>Now my legs are smooth and the skin quality is amazing, as if hair never was there.</li>
            <li>and it starts working on finer hairs as my face has had many of those.</li>
            <li>The important points to remember is that you must fall within the hair color and skin pigment scale that this laser will be effective for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product Design: 3 stars out of 5.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Weight: 3 stars out of 5.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life: 3 stars out of 5.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recharge Time: 3 stars out of 5.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Noise Level: 3 stars out of 5.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would love to return the item and  have my money refunded.  </li>
            <li>Ive never been able to wear a baseball hat or a ponytail because the hair would be off</li>
            <li>love, love, love this product and have already recommended it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Please do a better job of making sure your customers are fully informed before they order a product.  </li>
            <li>but then decided to get more aggressive with the treatments.  </li>
            <li>I AM ABLE TO TOLERATE LEVEL 5 FOR ALL AREAS BEING TREATED JUST AS YOU ARE INSTRUCTED TO DO.  </li>
            <li>I AM GOING TO DO ONE MORE TREATMENT</li>
            <li>I am so glad I took the risk to order this as it saves me having to drive an hour to a laser hari removal spa.  </li>
            <li>&quot; just tweezed the hair out &amp; you end up with courser hair and more hair than you started with.  </li>
            <li>I used it on the highest setting most of the time, knowing that even though it hurt more, this was supposed to be more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt; on more than one grade&lt;</li>
            <li>Ok so I have read ALL of the reviews on this product.</li>
            <li>The darker your hair the better.</li>
            <li>Hello, When I boot up this machine, it ask to press the power button till count to 6, I follow the step of guide, but the machine shows error, and I reboot many time they alway shows error, what can I do?</li>
            <li>This would be more affordable.</li>
            <li>I treated 2 more times and the hair is gone (4 months now with no shaving.)  </li>
            <li>I bought this thing for a gift and the person is really satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m like - ok</li>
            <li>me 2 years to be able to pronounce myself YES</li>
            <li>If I am happy with my machine for the whopping original price of $1,000 the price they are selling it for now is absolutely worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Overall, I LOVE THE TRIA!!!</li>
            <li>so i have a pretty good tolerance for pain, but this thing hurts.</li>
            <li>The TRIA might take a while to work fully, but honestly I&#x27;d buy it at full price for the results I see now.</li>
            <li>controls are very easy and straightforward.</li>
            <li>I am already excited about my hairless underarms!</li>
            <li>I am already excited about my hairless underarms!</li>
            <li>I really happy with my new device.  </li>
            <li>Bought it new, but wasn&#x27;t totally happy.  </li>
            <li>but our thiker hair needs more sessions, its really easy to use and even the instruction book helped me understand it more easily.    </li>
            <li>have called a couple times just to ask questions, and they are always really helpful and pleasant, which i appreciate, as the&lt;br</li>
            <li>Afteryou treat it with the laser, you will be able to pull the hair out of your skin with a tweezer (or even your fingers) and it will easily slip out of the skin as it will no longer be attached at the root.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda easy to use, safe</li>
            <li>I have bought Lumea Philips, which really gives me good results, mostly on my face and legs.</li>
            <li>Tria&#x27;s product is, at best, on par with other companies&#x27; product that demonstrate much greater concern for their customers, their reputation, and the environment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;According to many forums and friends, the Tria hair laser works better than my experience, so hoping that my original was somehow defective, I contacted Tria and they were very easy to work with; they sent a replacement quickly.</li>
            <li>My use on the rest of my body got more infrequent as time went on, but there&#x27;s a huge reduction in hair on all areas mentioned- 80-90%, I would say.    </li>
            <li>So far, I am happy with this purchase, and will try to remember to update.  </li>
            <li>I went ahead and bought it anyway, because laser hair removal (professional) worked well for me before and the idea of using it at home sounded great.  </li>
            <li>so the Tria has a harder job to do and therefore, you will not get the best results either.  </li>
            <li>The crack of her ass has been as smooth as glass since she started using this--no more crack hairs to worry about.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the TRIA laser for one month now and so far I&#x27;m happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>The skin is silky smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>For my legs, I was able to comfortably use the level 4 power setting and around the bikini area a level 3 without discomfort.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing that I will be hair free after three more treatments.</li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;m getting great results with the Tria.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li>Too much money for not getting good results.</li>
            <li>Get a good razor until the technology can really be counted on.  </li>
            <li>But if you are determined and don&#x27;t mind, it really could be a good decision.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super happy with results, and I&#x27;ll start on my legs probably very soon for summertime.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product---it would be great for other girls with my problem.</li>
            <li>Pain can easily be managed using an ice pack (best choice) or emla cream (not very useful alone).</li>
            <li>Love it, totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Excited to see more results as I continue to use the TRIA Laser Hair Removal 4X&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li>it easy to use and easy to carry.</li>

            <li>I think this is easy to use.</li>

            <li>The 90 day return period sounds good, but doesn&#x27;t really give a true indication.</li>
            <li>I am a good candidate for using this type of hair removal, as I have fair skin and dark hair.  </li>
            <li>My freckles were fine and did not burn at all.</li>
            <li>and it was fine- no redness or bumps.</li>

            <li>easily so I was excited for that reason too.</li>
            <li>I have seen a HUGE difference in my under arm hair.  </li>
            <li>and I will update the review over the course of treatments to accurately reflect its quality.  </li>
            <li>I can now go 2 weeks without shaving my lower legs which is huge for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also hugely time consuming.</li>
            <li>And I am not hair free.</li>
            <li>I bought the advanced \\&quot;new\\&quot; version, with 5 levels.</li>
            <li>I waited for a satin smooth res-q pain relief product to arrive.    </li>
            <li>I have brown hair and light skin.  </li>
            <li>If you think this will be a problem for you, you might consider if the greater expense of the Silk&#x27;n might be worth it for your needs.   </li>
            <li>Tria is a great product that I have extensively used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic for the nose hairs because that part of your skin never sees the sun, and so that is my whitest skin and darkest hair.</li>
            <li>The laser has done a fantastic job in that area.    </li>
            <li>So I am happy that after only 1 1/2 months I am noticing some improvement.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my upcoming wedding and overall am happy I did.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m wearing skirts, showing off these legs that haven&#x27;t seen the light of day in years.     </li>
            <li>This is important as after waiting hours for the tria to charge up again you lose your place.</li>
            <li>I searched the uswoop and groupon deals for months hoping to find something ridiculously cheap.   </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s why we can get it cheaply.</li>
            <li>I used it as recommended on my bikini area on the highest or 2nd to highest setting and I am happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>This is borne out by the specifications if you look on any credible hair removal website as well as reviews from people who used it and then eventually *stopped* using it.</li>
            <li>and it is not critical to remove it, but it is great for touch up.     </li>
            <li>I purchased the Tria about 3 years ago when it just became available in the US.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for smooth skin with no re-growth of the hair.  </li>
            <li>It needs more power.it doesnt worth a try.and</li>
            <li>So, if you shaved before, your hair root might be light color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done my arms 3 times and they are almost smooth.  </li>
            <li>You can do your whole body for $400 at your own pace.  </li>
            <li>Tria cheerfully replaced the product in 2 weeks for mail time with free shipping both ways.  </li>
            <li>, if it breaks after a year don&#x27;t expect a free replacement because that&#x27;s their warranty period.</li>
            <li>, they give you a free one year warranty, which is standard.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>It does feel like you&#x27;ve been lightly snapped with a rubber band.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t always get a smooth stubble-free shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve had laser hair removal several times and it works great with my skin/hair color (medium/olive tone and brown hair).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t enjoy wasting money</li>
            <li>but this is still relevant).</li>
            <li>If you sound like me, buy this thing.</li>
            <li>I am hair free.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>These points were not listed on information available when you place your order.</li>
            <li>Since I am light skin, I have to look closely for bald hair areas.  </li>
            <li>To shed some light on whether or not you should try it, here&#x27;s an explanation as to how these devices work and whether or not it will work for you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After charging close to $600 for the product they use one of the slowest shipping methods available to process returns and warranties.</li>
            <li>I was able to use the product once, and thought although time consuming to use, will be worth it if the product does what is says.  </li>
            <li>so it is very cost effective in that sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nonetheless I&#x27;m pleased with the results on my hands and butt, so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought the Tria in 2011 ( about a year ago) and have used it primarily on my face</li>
            <li>and I have light skin.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that I now have some smooth &amp; hairy patches on my neck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Laser hair removal has become more affordable and you can buy packages on groupon etc for actual laser, which is more effective.</li>
            <li>I have no dount that I will be hair free in the recommended 3 months of treatment.</li>
            <li>I did not expect to have my skin NOT feel smooth &amp; silky despite of exfoliating before lasering, and creaming &amp; lotioning after.  </li>
            <li>Is it cheap?</li>
            <li>Works great, takes several times.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t make you hair free in 6 months as they claim, but it does work.  </li>
            <li>All accessories available.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;NoNo does not look so good as far as reviews</li>
            <li>I know some have mentioned that the battery life eventually wears out, but in comparison to the cost of professional treatments, I still think the Tria is a good value.</li>
            <li>Best price on the net the item work very well .</li>
            <li>I was soooooooo excited to be hair free when I ordered this</li>
            <li>I have first to let you all girls know that I did a professional laser treatment in my lower legs with incredible success.</li>
            <li>I originally thought I&#x27;d do my treatments while watching a movie, but when the fan turns on, I have to turn up the sound on the t.v. which can be distracting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a wonderful, highly trained technician with multiple training certifications and significant experience with a state of the art machine.</li>
            <li>I had a wonderful, highly trained technician with multiple training certifications and significant experience with a state of the art machine.</li>
            <li>that is much more honest, since in reality I have learned that even professional laser hair removal is NOT permanent....unless you are lucky.  </li>
            <li>I was in shock the first time I got a \\&quot;red\\&quot; no-go light, but also pleased that I&#x27;d gotten over winter.</li>
            <li>Nice n bare n smooth!</li>
            <li>Also very easy to use - I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>and she love it so much ,and it is easy to use</li>
            <li>Original review:      </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are some significant differences between the two Infini&#x27;silk devices.</li>
            <li>There are some significant differences between the two Infini&#x27;silk devices.</li>
            <li>The untreated leg has significant stuble.  </li>
            <li>This system is well worth the price I paid already!</li>
            <li>And since I bought the original over 18 months ago, the replacement isn&#x27;t under warranty.      </li>
            <li>probably about 75% of the original # of follicles</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Defiantly worth it!</li>
            <li>When I called the company, the customer service representative was neither helpful nor friendly.</li>
            <li>Over all, so far I am very pleased with my purchase and am even happier with its cost savings compared to going to a salon.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working, after 3 treatments I didn&#x27;t notice any hair loss-</li>
            <li>I started reading some of the higher 4 stars reviews and most of them say \\&quot;I&#x27;ve just started using it</li>
            <li>and I believe that I see a significant reduction in hair numbers.  </li>
            <li>WORTH it!</li>
            <li>br /&gt;i m a long time user of tria and am so happy i purchased it ..</li>
            <li>I was sooo excited to receive this.</li>
            <li>but I think its worth waiting because it will be improved!</li>
            <li>all it does work for me really happy with the money time and effort that the Tria L.H.R gives me, one thing is that you have to have really dark hair for it to work and medium to light skin tone if not the system has a lock that if you dont have the right skin tone it wont unlock that means that you would not be able to use it, its not recomended that you do if it dosent unlock.</li>
            <li>I have heard but cannot confirm that actual lasers are more effective than IPL, which this Tria is.</li>
            <li>I use it on the highest setting, which is pain-free if you are totally clean shaven.  </li>
            <li>for me it&#x27;s more of an investment to spend what seems to be a lot, $395 for multiple sessions at your own privacy and convienence rather than $300 per session at an office.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done both and would recommend this since you&#x27;re able to direct it to all the areas you need LHR, use it as you need it, and it&#x27;s one cost for a year or more of treatment.</li>
            <li>These areas may have more sensitive skin, a darker tone and/or a greater hair density and using the TRIA there</li>
            <li>I can see that nipples or genitals would be more sensitive skin but would not think the outer ear or chin would be more &#x60;sensitive\\&quot; than an underarm.</li>
            <li>Every once in a while I would shave to get the light whispy blond hairs that you don&#x27;t really notice grow until you get rid of all your dark ones :D  </li>
            <li>You aren&#x27;t going to see perfect results after a year of use, but if you&#x27;re consistent over a few years, you&#x27;ll begin to take for granted the fact that you are so maintenence free.  </li>
            <li>At first, the results were really good, so I kept on using it until I finished the 6 month period to make sure it would last.  </li>
            <li>To gather this data, the original suggestion of epilating prior to using TRIA should not be followed, since the best way to check if TRIA is working is to use tweezers, or even your fingers to check if the hair can be easily removed several seconds after finishing the series of pulses.    </li>
            <li>But I certainly didnt expect to pay more money to find another solution at this point at time</li>
            <li>I am more than pleased with this product and highly recommend it to anyone with skin/hair type like mine, who wants to get rid of any unwanted hair!</li>
            <li>This is going to be a huge confidence booster &amp; already worth every dolloar in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>months!This is going to be a huge confidence booster &amp; already worth every dolloar in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and you can feel something, but it is too early to tell just how effective it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only as good as the operator.  </li>
            <li>medical spas, I have had superior results with Pulsed Diode Lasers.</li>
            <li>&quot; results with true Laser hair removal and \\&quot;good\\&quot; results with IPL.</li>
            <li>&quot; results with true Laser hair removal and \\&quot;good\\&quot; results with IPL.</li>
            <li>So just doing my lower legs was a full weekend project.  </li>
            <li>It contains the same lidocaine and the aloe is good for you.</li>
            <li>I love that it works fast and in the privacy in my home.</li>
            <li>At an office using a diode laser just for a full Brazilian bikini</li>
            <li>However,  my initial impressions of the product are good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve yet to manage a full underarm treatment for that reason.</li>
            <li>Not painful anymore.  </li>
            <li>Amazon won&#x27;t give you a full refund after one month.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless of if it&#x27;s ultimately effective, I&#x27;d recommend people go to a professional for legs.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of questions about optimum timing and the strength of the laser ( e.g. is it possible that the strength of the pulse is continually decreasing with use?)&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li>I had to use it full strength to get results.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t think it will take much more.  </li>
            <li>Just to be free of that mirror and tweezers was worth $395.  </li>
            <li>A product that costs this much money should have WAY better reviews.</li>
            <li>If anyone wants the hair gone and on a budget, then  your better off going to groupon or livingsocial and getting a deal on a package.</li>
            <li>&amp; I mostly stayed in the house for 3-4 straight</li>
            <li>a peek at my full review here:  </li>
            <li>but much more easier to shave much much</li>
            <li>but if you really whant the hair to be gone its better to doit on.</li>
            <li>In my own experience if you&#x27;re overlapping correctly it takes one complete charge to do each lower leg.</li>
            <li>but as promised it really is permanent ..:)</li>
            <li>The product is true to its advertising and claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>almost Snow White, fair skin.  </li>
            <li>Am the ideal pale skin/dark hair candidate.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that the more hair you lose, the less it hurts.</li>
            <li>I am the right demographic for the system (light skin, darker hair), so I can&#x27;t say it didn&#x27;t work because of that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a risk to buy because you don&#x27;t know if your hair will be the right fit.</li>
            <li>I wish people wouldn&#x27;t give decent reviews until they&#x27;ve tried it for many months.    </li>
            <li>The method of testing ease of removal seems to be the most reliable way to know how many pulses are needed, but currently for meother areas have priority.    </li>
            <li>It will only do 1-2 pulses and will not do any more unless you plug it in again where it will tell you it is Recharged but AGAIN will not do more than 2 Pulses.  </li>
            <li>I have been told by more than one facility, that not too many people ask the questions I ask, such as \\&quot;How</li>
            <li>Because of it&#x27;s tiny area, you needso many more zaps--</li>
            <li>I was pregnant</li>
            <li>Also fewer hair follicles meant my pits didn&#x27;t get ripe as quickly as before.</li>
            <li>but that is where my hair is the darkest, the most dense, and the most coarse.</li>
            <li>Purchased a Tria Laser in April 2011; it was no longer working at all by April 2012 ( started losing the charge quickly by January).</li>
            <li>Probably, since it takes more than 30 days to see results but most electronics only have 1 year warranties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also if you decide to take a break in between body parts, the system charges rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to see results but it wasn&#x27;t fast enough for me.</li>
            <li>It is important for potential buyers to be honest with themselves about their hair and skin coloring.</li>
            <li>I have some pigment in my skin &amp; couldn&#x27;t get a super close shave for some reason</li>
            <li>and I saw significant reduction right away.</li>
            <li>I give 4 stars because I like it and have high expectations but won&#x27;t know for sure until I&#x27;ve completed the regimen.</li>
            <li>Im glad I bought this, despite the high cost, because it works.</li>
            <li>I have had laser treatments done by a doctor on the bikini area &amp; was able to withstand high levels but with the Tria</li>
            <li>BUT I NOTICE SOME SMALL ONE ALREADY , VERY GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I have black hair and beige skin, so it&#x27;s pretty close to ideal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a genuine review based on my first hand experience with the Tria and Veet products and my accumulated knowledge of LHR.</li>
            <li>This is a genuine review based on my first hand experience with the Tria and Veet products and my accumulated knowledge of LHR.</li>
            <li>And I hope you are a very very very patient person!</li>
            <li>used it often and found that it works great on dark hair</li>
            <li>I am very consistent, so I will have to wait and see.</li>
            <li>I advanced to level 4.. for first day.  </li>
            <li>I believe that it is important for users to know that the higher power settings will bring about faster results.</li>
            <li>I have also been using the tria laser on my legs, but sporadically since it takes so long, and have not seen good results.  </li>
            <li>Not as easy to use as it says and very high priced.  </li>
            <li>This is a great gift for Black Friday or for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Newest lasers have a great cooling system for less pain.</li>
            <li>but this laser work on the correct skin tipe, in only 3 treatments even the first one I saw good reluts that I saw at a Laser Hair Removal Clinic</li>
            <li>easy purchase thanks for the service</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and dark hair, so I fit the profile of people for whom it should work.</li>
            <li>For the first eight weeks it really worked well, I was pleased and thought I was seeing results on level 3.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to use my Tria for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I saw significant results after the first three months.  </li>
            <li>I am not hair free, but since the hair reduction is so significant I just have to highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice size, it covers more area than typical at-home lasers for hair removal.</li>
            <li>I have had more treatments than is typical because my esthetician believes I have PCOS-will this product still be effective for me?</li>
            <li>For areas like my thighs, which have very light, soft blond hair, this product doesn&#x27;t work nor did I expect it to.</li>
            <li>First of all, many of these reviews on here are of the older model.</li>
            <li>And, it is equally important to be realistic about the time frame for realizing the true results of the product.</li>
            <li>I am happy to share my hard earned knowledge with others and I do this freely.</li>
            <li>I am happy to share my hard earned knowledge with others and I do this freely.</li>
            <li>I have very dark hair and light olive skin, so I seemed to be a good candidate.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to read all the positive reviews and</li>
            <li>I have a \\&quot;Tria\\&quot; (Pulsed Diode Laser) and now both, a \\&quot;Veet Infini&#x27;silk PRO\\&quot; and a \\&quot;Veet Infini&#x27;silk\\&quot; made by \\&quot;Silk&#x27;n\\&quot; (Intense Pulsed Light &#x3D; IPL) for at-home hair removal.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not comfortable doing laser treatments at a medspa this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li>its only been 2 months and already they look amazing. .</li>
            <li>While the most popular review by \\&quot;work of life\\&quot; was fairly accurate, she left out the ENORMOUS FAULTS of this device.</li>
            <li>And it has more of a bite than when you go to get it done professionally.</li>
            <li>Whether or not the TRIA laser is effective depends on several factors&amp;#8212;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227;</li>
            <li>i honestly did not think it would work but to my surprise, my hair has been reduced after only two months of use!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll put 5 stars because I have personally seen the Tria be effective, but this is not a review.</li>
            <li>I started LHR in my early 20s and have experienced all forms of Laser Hair Removal (LHR) in medical settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The powerful equipment they use is not as fool-proof as the at-home devices are.</li>
            <li>And well worth the money, to me.</li>
            <li>What can I say beauty is a pain, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>I was ready to dedicate my whole summer to the Tria treatment schedule, expecting it to take many months.</li>
            <li>I dont mind buying silkn bulbs as the speed and ease of using the silkn is worth it.</li>
            <li>Also, it says to use on a fresh shave.</li>
            <li>But so far I love it and it is just how I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to take longer because it&#x27;s not as powerful</li>
            <li>So for me, spending the money for that is totally worth it even though I still have to shave.</li>
            <li>Better off spending the money on professional treatment.</li>
            <li>After 30 days, my underarms are hair free and bikini line is nearly hair free.</li>
            <li>After a fair amount of research, including the OK from a relative who used to design medical devices and dealt with the FDA, I bought the Tria about a month ago.  </li>
            <li>The nerves are more sensitive.</li>
            <li>And their so called \\&quot;guarrentee\\&quot; isn&#x27;t worth anything.</li>
            <li>AND I rarely get ingrown hairs, which means that some of the tougher one are gone.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to me though.  </li>
            <li>It is so worth it if it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Even if it isn&#x27;t permanent it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I was worried because of the cost of it, would it be worth it</li>
            <li>Until you&#x27;re completely done with treatments, you spend time shaving plus time using the TRIA &amp; you can&#x27;t save yourself time by using more long-lasting hair removal methods (i.e. waxing, plucking).&lt;br</li>
            <li>It hurt the most on the mons pubis (I think stubble &#x3D; intense pain) rather than hurting more the further in yougo.</li>
            <li>I thought the product worked well, however, I am just touching up a professional laser job on bikini and underarms.</li>
            <li>That sounds tolerable except that it both hurts more than going to a salon for a laser hair removal treatment AND the head is basically the size of your thumb which means it will take you forever to complete what ever area</li>
            <li>But it was well worth the time commitment.  </li>
            <li>but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have been embarrassed by it since I was in elementary school.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% worth it.</li>
            <li>will be worth it.  </li>
            <li>will be worth it.  </li>
            <li>But isn&#x27;t it worth it when you think of the chance of permanent hair removal????</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin for sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid for professional hair removal (LFR) and if you can afford it, it is more powerful.  </li>
            <li>The most you can get out of the machine is 22j and its fixed at 1cm.</li>
            <li>you are not really gonna get good results,</li>
            <li>Perhaps because the skin is more sensitive, or that these areas are darker.</li>
            <li>but until then I don&#x27;t see how anyone has any success with this.</li>
            <li>The product packaging is nicely designed and visually attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convenience: 5 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does hurt, though--not on the legs, but on the more sensitive areas like the bikini area and underarms.</li>
            <li>If it worked it would be worth the pain, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>It did not even worth of s</li>
            <li>Go to a Spa, a Laser Center or good doctor.</li>
            <li>For $500 (the price I paid when I purchased) I would not at all say that is worth it.</li>
            <li>100% worth it.</li>
            <li>had heard about laser hair removal and it sounded painless and seemed an exciting</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high quality product, easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to get it activated with the skin test sensor (so only &#x27;appropriate&#x27; skin types can use the machine...darker skin types could burn) once you call the company to turn activate the unit for the first use.</li>
            <li>you have light skin and dark hair, the machine can \\&quot;find\\&quot; the pigment more easily and send energy all the way to the root.  </li>
            <li>So far I have been able to do complete full legs, underarms, bikini area (full), stomach, toes, fingers and lower arms on  full BATTERY.</li>
            <li>My advice is to focus more on where you want the hair gone most and then use the rest of the battery to do other areas.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough that it&#x27;s best to use a sharp razor and to shave right before using it.</li>
            <li>Instead of being excited, I was apprehensive about 3 weeks straight in a bikini.</li>
            <li>Overall Value: As long as your expectations are reasonable, the Tria provides excellent value for the money.</li>
            <li>I called up the customer service line hoping there was some unlock or advice they could give to help right away.  </li>
            <li>Right now, one is a pair of red-orange \\&quot;Bynovel Laser Eye Protection Safety Glasses\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I hope they reverse their decision and do the right thing...</li>
            <li>I tried it all over my body right away.  </li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>even right after i shave it</li>
            <li>would recommend this device to any woman suffering with this issue if you have the right hair and skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Why on earth, right?</li>
            <li>I start out with my right lower leg, then thigh, arm, then under arm.</li>
            <li>Instead of owning up to the issue they are unwilling to do right by their customers.</li>
            <li>I have to shave EVERY DAY &amp; it even leaves a shadow right after (eeewww).</li>
            <li>Although I need it right now</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and thick black hair which makes me an ideal user for all forms of Laser Hair Removal (LHR).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cause you can&#x27;t see them and if you do they look like normal fine body hair.  </li>
            <li>It is a pain to only be able to use it for 20 min on full power and have to wait another 3 hours for it to charge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The directions warn not to go further than the bikini line, but the technology should be safe for a full Brazilian.</li>
            <li>I was able to do 4 on my bikini and 5 on my underarms without more than a slight discomfort.</li>
            <li>The charges are more than adequate for an entire setting of underarms and pubic region.  </li>
            <li>So my results may be seen more quickly than if you have a ton of hair or a different skin type.  </li>
            <li>However, because its been recommended by Good Housekeeping and countless other magazines, I am fairly confident that it will be worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used for the first time, pits and legs just for fun.  </li>
            <li>TRIA is worth it if you&#x27;re willing to put in the time and effort required.</li>
            <li>have dark hair and fair skin</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and dark hair.</li>
            <li>even more excited that I was an ideal hair removal candidate-  very light, pale skin and coarse, black</li>
            <li>The hair that does grow back is very fine.  </li>
            <li>Again, Tria cheerfully replaced the product and send me another brand new unit.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly keep at it to be hair-free by summer!</li>
            <li>I have tried them all - literally, all of them (purely laser, gel treatments, on skin, away from skin)!  </li>
            <li>I am pretty fair skinned with dark hair.  </li>
            <li>and I also get razor burn with more frequent shaving no matter how much I spend on quality razors and shaving gel.  </li>
            <li>According to the Tria website, I have the perfect skin and hair color combination for the laser and yet after 10 months and hours spent using the device I have seen absolutely no reduction in hair growth.</li>
            <li>So far so good, its only been 2 months</li>
            <li>The Tria is easy to use and the directions are clear.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and black hair.  </li>
            <li>If it wasnt so painful...or the laser area was bigger AND the battery was much better it would maybe be worth the money.</li>
            <li>Tria&#x27;s product would be great if the warranty was longer than 1 year (especially since I paid the $700 retail price in 2010), and they actually had helpful customer service.</li>
            <li>If you have light hair (or light roots), then the laser will not send enough energy through the hair to kill it at the root, and hence it will not work.  </li>
            <li>I would have had more success but note to the makers of TRIA, MAKE THE LASER BIGGER!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, but intense.</li>
            <li>I tried a few sessions at the dermatologists office (at $200 per session), and needed many more sessions to see a difference.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold, aim, and pulse and no little parts that you have to worry about keeping track of.  </li>
            <li>my sister who is also fair skinned with dark hair has not had as much rapid success as I have.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied since I had no higher expectations.</li>
            <li>Cordless is nice, but a long cord would allow convenient use with better, longer lasting</li>
            <li>The possibility of burns is very real</li>
            <li>I was very, very motivated.  </li>
            <li>A very intense heat that makes you automatically yank away.</li>
            <li>I guess I can now say I was blessed with a dark happy trail, because it&#x27;s nearly gone, and what has grown back is very fine.</li>
            <li>It takes a significant amount of repetition; it&#x27;s far from completely effective, and I have been using it on very dark hair with very pale skin which is the ideal condition.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product and was only able to use it once before it quit working.  </li>
            <li>but many (40~70%) regrew at a similar or thinner width.</li>
            <li>*First Update, 22 May 2011</li>
            <li>I Called customer Service and ask them to either a FIX the product or a simple REPLACEMENT and nothing more.</li>
            <li>First of all, you have to understand the why and how lasers work to remove hair.  </li>
            <li>First</li>
            <li>I am almost completely hair free.</li>
            <li>This would help future buyers make a more informed decision.  </li>
            <li>but this laser really does hurt!  </li>
            <li>and I had a whole body that needed treatments!</li>
            <li>and I had a whole body that needed treatments!</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li>First, some background.</li>
            <li>I just purchased this product and followed the directions exactly to unlock the device</li>
            <li>They suggest shaving first and then using the product.  </li>
            <li>Let me tell you that it has been 10 days since my first treatment</li>
            <li>Hairs are beginning to fall away and the skin is smooth and clear.  </li>
            <li>It really takes the whole weekend plus say monday and tuesday after work to get my full legs and bikini done.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using tria for about 3 months and so far I see fantastic results.</li>
            <li>I will update in 8months when the results are suppose to be evident.</li>
            <li>First of all, I still experience pain while using it no matter</li>
            <li>It might be ok for people wanting to do just under arms or bikini, but the charge only lasts about 20-30 minutes and at that rate, it took me 4 sessions just to do my lower legs.</li>
            <li>Leave laser hair removal to the professionals with the real machines!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize at first</li>
            <li>it was too intense for me!</li>
            <li>It really works and I noticed a difference after just one use!</li>
            <li>If you are willing to put in the time and effort, go for it.</li>
            <li>It stings quite a bit on the highest setting from the laser head getting hot.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time and here are my thoughts on it.</li>
            <li>I just purchased the product yesterday and completed the first treatment</li>
            <li>But as most people interested in the product, I was attracted by the overall cost benefit when compared to purchasing a series of treatments.  </li>
            <li>I am a man and purchased it for precisely that reason to deal with the stray hairs that the professional laser may have missed.  </li>
            <li>Everywhere else it pretty tolerable though</li>
            <li>It was just too hot, i tried it but could not take the heat.</li>
            <li>This IS worth the short-lived pain, if exessive hair bothers you so much like it did me.  </li>
            <li>But thank you Tria for making such a product available to anyone at  home!</li>
            <li>, I have to say that I do love the Tria because it actually does work as maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something to get rid of most of the hair but what hair grows back to be lighter &amp; softer</li>
            <li>so I was interested in how this would work.  </li>
            <li>That said despite consistent and meticulous use, the results were just temporary.</li>
            <li>I used it today for the first time.</li>
            <li>I can not yet say whether or not it works because I just did the first treatment today.</li>
            <li>First off, it DOES hurt.</li>
            <li>once then had a medical emergency and was hospitilazed for a month and wasn&#x27;t able to use it anymore.</li>
            <li>The reason I bought it through Amazon instead of directly from Tria was for the Hassle Free return policy.</li>
            <li>When I first got it and wasn&#x27;t seeing results on the lighter settings, I sucked it up and tried the higher setting.</li>
            <li>That is one thing I am sorry to say but in most spots this thing HURTS!!!!  </li>
            <li>I was willing to take any pain to get rid of that.  </li>
            <li>On the chin I used a level 1 but could never do more than three pulses because the pain actually brought me to tears.</li>
            <li>On the upper lip, I was able to tolerate a 2, but again with tears.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly as I saw on the TV</li>
            <li>First off, the system works...somewhat.  </li>
            <li>The occasional snap of pain more startled me than anything.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the time/money for more LHR in a different med spa - hence,</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t given up; next stop: electrolysis! :)</li>
            <li>The first time the battery charge diminished, I called customer service and they told me to charge the laser overnight.</li>
            <li>First the TRIA mentions nothing about shaving the area beforehand.</li>
            <li>The results were consistent in that there were NO results.</li>
            <li>My under arms are almost completely hair free.</li>
            <li>Also areas that had no hair in the first place now grow hair.</li>
            <li>First off, it hurts like hell.</li>
            <li>Like others have reported, feels like a hot rubber band popping your skin.  </li>
            <li>I will more than likely return the unit for another replacement; hopefully, it will be quicker</li>
            <li>I used the tria relgiously for the first 6 months - as instructed every TW0 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Although I was not as consistent, I have also used on my arms, bikini area, stomach, arms and toes and have also seen results there.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, the results were sub par at best.</li>
            <li>researched this item a lot before i bought and somehow i missed the part about having to shave the hair first.</li>
            <li>During the first session, it quit and had a \\&quot;error\\&quot; message.  </li>
            <li>&quot; and I waited for more than 3 months with regular treatment of every 2week</li>
            <li>Another issue is the battery, you can only zap about 1 sq/ft at the most, at its maximum power level before the laser shuts off and you have to recharge.</li>
            <li>fearing that first kiss instead of looking forward to it...</li>
            <li>The remaining hairs are extremely soft and light</li>
            <li>My first one after 5 months stopped holding a charge.</li>
            <li>probablyis the same amount of money (depending on how many body sections you want lasered).</li>
            <li>It is completely painless on light skin.</li>
            <li>so we will just stay a hairy family ;)</li>
            <li>Well if used properly you should not need to use it more than a year...  </li>
            <li>And after they receive it there is another up to 2 more WEEKS waiting period before they will process your return or get a replacement piece back out.</li>
            <li>A manager would not talk with me and the representative that I spoke with continued to spout the company line- \\&quot;out of warranty, just doing my job\\&quot; Do not buy this product unless you are willing to throw away $400.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>and you have to be consistent with the process.</li>
            <li>and then it wont hurt as much!</li>
            <li>I have used this product exactly as suggested by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I used it every 2 weeks like clockwork exactly as instructed on setting 5.</li>
            <li>After about a year I notice a couple tiny bald spots but for the most part I&#x27;m still just as hairy as before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say save your money for the always available groupon for laser done by a professional.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit -- there&#x27;s quite a sting on higher settings.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You know that feeling when you accidentally touch a scolding hot pot on the stove?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I REALLY hope this works!</li>
            <li>How sad that Tria can&#x27;t even repair its own product!!!</li>
            <li>So, you have to balance pain with the time investment you are willing to make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first started, I could get both legs done before the battery would need to be recharged.</li>
            <li>the risk.*&lt;br /&gt;It has been exactly 2 weeks since my 1st treatment.</li>
            <li>I used this machine consistently as directed for 4 months and saw no results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the cost as it was I couldnt purchase more sessions and the hair, because it wasnt all targeted, came back.</li>
            <li>I did the treatments exactly as they said to and the amount of times they said to but was  just not seeing any difference.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to cover enough area before having to charge it</li>
            <li>To make sure it worked I only started with one leg.  </li>
            <li>There is no doubt in my mind that the Tria works - and works really, really well!</li>
            <li>The first thing I want to point out is that a lot of people who said the Tria did not work also said that they had \\&quot;brownish\\&quot; hairs or \\&quot;fine\\&quot; hairs.</li>
            <li>Wish I had put the money towards a salon in the first place.</li>
            <li>( he didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t shave first )</li>
            <li>I bought one of these about 9 months ago, used it exactly as directed from the first day</li>
            <li>After my first use on my underarms, I had virtually no regrowth.  </li>
            <li>but I am willing to put in the time because Tria works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m East Asian with thick black hair and fair skin, which is great for the top of my head but not so much on the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with my tria and if it gives out in a year I will order a new one the same day, if I still have hair to get rid of that is..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy the new model, I opted for the Gen 3 because it didn&#x27;t sound like there was much difference in the models.  </li>
            <li>Tria did replace it for no charge, but the new unit didn&#x27;t work any better than the old one.</li>
            <li>I have a high pain tollerance, but it hurt and seemed to get very hot at first.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li>They told me \\&quot;\\&quot;NO\\&quot; and told me I would have to PURCHASE a new one at the Full Retail Price.  </li>
            <li>so people wouldn&#x27;t see my new cool \\&quot;tattoo\\&quot; between charges.    </li>
            <li>I was so excited about this product because I have very course dark hair and pale skin which made me the perfect candidate for the Tria.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read the instructions and personally I have a great attention to detail, borderline OCD, and I don&#x27;t have the patience to do every single square millimeter of skin as this thing requires, not once</li>
            <li>I believe for buyers who abide by the previous two suggestions, you will be very satisfied with this product just like I have been.</li>
            <li>It may be related to the particular light wavelengths, the light filter(s) on the cartridge,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s most appropriate for dealing with armpits, forearms, bikini, feet/toes, and while they say it&#x27;s not suitable for the face or neck</li>
            <li>I have very dark, thick, coarse hair and fair skin, which makes me an excellent candidate for laser hair removal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>there is fine, light and not much .</li>
            <li>you could also use a highlighter because it is important to overlap and make sure you are thorough to zap every little hair.</li>
            <li>Although pretty painful on the highest setting, I am seeing excellent results and am already about 90% hair free in the areas which I have treated.  </li>
            <li>It feels warm but other than that, no discomfort.   </li>
            <li>I conducted my own experiment on my legs due to the time involved to do them.  </li>
            <li>I like to use the Tria for quick spot treatments on new hairs on easy-to-see/ easy-to-reach areas.</li>
            <li>With Intense Pulsed Light, the areas I had professionally treated have regrown by about 50% over the years.</li>
            <li>keep some Visine Advanced Relief in the fridge and apply to clean, dry skin.</li>
            <li>Now have several test patches, which required as many as 6~8 pulses (with cooling prior and once during) for the targeted hairs to be easily removed with no resistance.  </li>
            <li>they are equal (Tria at highest setting) and if that&#x27;s any kind of measure of effectiveness vis-a-vis professional lasers</li>
            <li>BUT after only TWO treatments I noticed much more hair loss than the Tria and it was much faster to use.  </li>
            <li>You will be better off spending this money for a REAL hair removal procedure at your local beauty salon.</li>
            <li>If I could devote several days each month for 6-8 months to using TRIA I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s ok, but in real life I&#x27;m a full-time student &amp; work part-time.</li>
            <li>Then I discovered that there are similar products, for equal or lower prices, that offer replaceable \\&quot;pulse\\&quot; modules and, based on reviews, identical to superior performance.  </li>
            <li>I then decided I would just do my bikini area since it&#x27;s smaller and more reasonable</li>
            <li>Also at level 5 the charge doesn&#x27;t last the whole lower leg, more like 75%.</li>
            <li>It is a bit top heavy and the handle is comfortable, but</li>
            <li>I was very hopefully after reading positive reviews, but I now I am starting to suspect that most of these reviews have been written by paid marketers.     </li>
            <li>So far I am impressed, but unfortunately won&#x27;t know 100% for sure until probably a few more months if the Tria really does provide permanent hair removal.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to vastly underestimate how much time may be needed to permanently remove hairs using the TRIA!</li>
            <li>what degree of improvement those people with the positive reviews had.</li>
            <li>As a consumer, read up to see if your area and color is within the specifications the product claims will positively affect hair</li>
            <li>and they were overwhelmingly positive.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand where all of these positive reviews come from.</li>
            <li>I have no idea where any of the positive reviews would ever come from</li>
            <li>You will see positive results.</li>
            <li>It is pretty much fool proof.  </li>
            <li>away,&lt;br /&gt;you should be pretty much done by then anyway</li>
            <li>its pretty much useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a ripoff kids.</li>
            <li>so I pretty much know the pain and</li>
            <li>but I read the reviews first, after that i&#x27;m really suspicious now whether to buy it or</li>
            <li>and LHR is much more affordable now, but sadly, there is still no training or license required to operate or own one of these powerful lasers.</li>
            <li>and LHR is much more affordable now, but sadly, there is still no training or license required to operate or own one of these powerful lasers.</li>
            <li>The instructions said that you will see visible results in at least 3 months so I will have to post later results; My wife is pleased with the battery time since it holds quite a good charge.</li>
            <li>I got this system from QVC for three payments to complete full purchase price.  </li>
            <li>you can see the dark black dots, luckily this is the desirable condition for the laser to be most effective.</li>
            <li>but last week they offered another $50 off special!  </li>
            <li>If you are trying to completely remove even the smaller hairs, be sure to appropriately increase the number of pulses according to size of the hairs being treated as a smaller hair root both absorbs less heat and dissipates it more quickly between pulses.</li>
            <li>And what&#x27;s more, even if you withstand a full treatment of the area, it will have virtually no effect since not enough light is reaching the follicles despite a similar intensity working perfectly fine to remove hair on other areas of your body.</li>
            <li>preface, I have had about 12 sessions of professional laser hair removal on several parts of my body over the last 6 years (5 sessions every 6 weeks followed by touch ups - no hormone problems, I just have more hair than most women).</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s hard to part with almost $500 without hearing about some good results first, so here they are.</li>
            <li>After reading the people who said it doesn&#x27;t really work and the people who are writing positive reviews are being paid by the company, I wanted to put in my 2 cents on my positive experience.    </li>
            <li>Would that make that less effective?</li>
            <li>Very simple and easy to use instructions.</li>
            <li>but they admit is is less effective to blond hairs.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and cheaper than the multiple and not at all discrete spa vists.  </li>
            <li>When I started I was surprised how effortless and quick the results came, the pain was pretty mild, moderate along the bikini line, it got much better after the third session, you have to be patient!!</li>
            <li>3~5 full-power pulses on a single hair takes a while if you&#x27;re not dedicated, even if it is mostly permanent.</li>
            <li>if a Tria employee reads this, is there any guarantee that the product will work, is there a certain warranty, will it be replaced if it breaks</li>
            <li>It does take time to cover large areas.  </li>
            <li>Considering the amount of times it must be recharged to finish a large area, 300 charges will eat up in no time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this: forget about using it for large areas, perhaps underarms, or</li>
            <li>I still see some hair if I look at a certain angle</li>
            <li>DO NOT KNOW IF I CAN USE IT ON CERTAIN PARTS OF MY BODY OR NOT.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s just not efficient for large areas.</li>
            <li>works great use once a week hair is getting less and less shipped fast will be hair free in no time</li>
            <li>Maybe ther are more angled, which makes full exposure more difficult?</li>
            <li>I bought one of the very first TRIAs on the market directly from TRIA Beauty.  </li>
            <li>However, it is extremely effective on dark, coarse hair on light skin.</li>
            <li>Tria could have easily designed this into their product, eliminating many of the negative reviews and transforming my opinion of them.</li>
            <li>However, as my dark hair ladies will see - having light blond hairs grow in that you can&#x27;t see is SO worth over time!  </li>
            <li>Several of those, fine.  </li>
            <li>but they are so fine and blonde that the Tria won&#x27;t get those.  </li>
            <li>During the first session, you get all excited about using it and find out a couple weeks later that your hair growth hasn&#x27;t changed.</li>
            <li>But I think this would only work on light skin and dark hair, as the laser on the highest setting (5) kills only about 30% of my hair when following the directions perfectly.</li>
            <li>Using the Tria is very time-consuming for large areas - takes forever to do your legs</li>
            <li>It is not as strong as the professional devices for obvious reasons, but it does a good job at maintaining the results I got (it helps me zap those few unwanted hairs here and there).</li>
            <li>I would say to anyone interested in purchasing the product that you must be completely realistic about what you&#x27;re looking to achieve and what this sort of technology is capable of.  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty high pain tolerance</li>
            <li>, my bikini hair is gone, a third of light fine underarm and lower leg hair is left, but I&#x27;m hopeful that too will soon be gone.</li>
            <li>It seems that the laser head gets very hot to the touch &amp; might be burning more than the actual laser; I have even tried letting it cool down for awhile before continuing.</li>
            <li>I used it exactly as directed, and cranked that sucker as high as it would go (I am good with pain).</li>
            <li>The hair is much lighter and much less coarse than I originally had, but I&#x27;d still like to be smooth again without spending thousands more on professional laser treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tria may not be permanent hair removal, but it HAS made my hair grow back finer, and that makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>it works really well.</li>
            <li>and I was ready for our trip in April.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t see results</li>
            <li>I hope I get the opportunity to see if this product really works....    </li>
            <li>; Do the hairs come straight out, or are they slanted making the roots closer to the skin surface?  </li>
            <li>Tried TRIA on lowest setting and it hurt so much</li>
            <li>And it really hurts so using a level 3..</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>, I just do it when I have time, but I really haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in hair density.  </li>
            <li>I have spent more on the dermatologists trying to get rid of the rash than I did with tria.</li>
            <li>Really I didnt even want a refund</li>
            <li>To my surprise - it really does work.  </li>
            <li>The real surprise has been on my leg.  </li>
            <li>Already I have a reduction of about 60%, and the hair that is growing in is growing much slower.  </li>
            <li>i am a very disassified customer and will share my feedback online with others.</li>
            <li>It works really well for my skin and hair type.</li>
            <li>I just started using it and really like it.  </li>
            <li>This really does work.</li>
            <li>After spending so much money and not seeing result</li>
            <li>and it works everywhere, not just on your feet, at a much lower cost than the \\&quot;soufflé\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>The ice pack really limits how much heat you feel from the laser head.</li>
            <li>On my arms and legs I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference, just that the hair is growing in finer</li>
            <li>i had some much chin hair i was depressed.  </li>
            <li>I am a licensed Esthetician and have worked in Dermatology where we used an IPL type hair removal laser, much like the silk&#x27;n</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t return it thinking it would just take longer to work for me, but now I am just out $400 and very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>i started using the tria laser over my whole body</li>
            <li>AREAS(THINK ONE WHOLE LEG...OR BIKINI AND ARMPITS</li>
            <li>I still have to shave, but there are patches where hair doesn&#x27;t grow, and the areas where the hair still grows is much finer and sparser than before.  </li>
            <li>This product really does work.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on professional lasor treatments.</li>
            <li>there is no red light (laser) coming from the window</li>
            <li>I did not buy mine here, but straight from the company.  </li>
            <li>You can till feel like pricks of the laser, but very tolerable.   </li>
            <li>What I got was the hair grew back lighter &amp; softer, not the smooth hairless skin that I wanted.  </li>
            <li>my man wants me to do his hairy ears, but idk.  </li>
            <li>I am supposed to have hair, ust not this much hair.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed much of a difference yet on my arm pits.  </li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t yet noticed any real reduction regrowth.  </li>
            <li>There is so much area to cover!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have seen some reviews stating that the old style is still being sold, so I thought the review was worth it.</li>
            <li>After reading the online reviews and watching the videos that were available at the time, I thought a Tria laser might actually work for me.</li>
            <li>(I think it was a Gentle Yag machine).</li>
            <li>I have battled hair my whole life but around the time I turned 30</li>
            <li>but I got more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>REALLY?</li>
            <li>Especially under the chin, I could NEVER even with a razor get that to feel totally smooth.</li>
            <li>and I really advise all people to have one.</li>
            <li>so I used it every 2 weeks the whole 9 months.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t spend that much money on something if it might  not work.</li>
            <li>I and absolutely swear by this</li>
            <li>could notice the results, now it is really paying off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have no words to describe how much I feel scammed by this company.</li>
            <li>Another plus - get rid of all your underarm hair, and you don&#x27;t sweat as much there.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s very noisy.</li>
            <li>B000EMWFBQ Tweezerman  Stainless Steel Slant Tweezer]]).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy about it, although must say I can&#x27;t even imaging starting treatments on my legs since it takes forever to treat both underarms,and btw,the battery lasts for underarms treatment only, so if you are doing a larger area, be prepared to recharge (takes about 3 hrs) and remember where you stopped.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been meaning to review this product for a while because it&#x27;s helped me so much.</li>
            <li>I have been wanting to buy a laser hair removal system but was waiting for a system that I thought would REALLY work.  </li>
            <li>I know I really appreciated reviews from real people about their experience with Tria.</li>
            <li>I could not afford $10,000 for laser treatments, but really wanted them.</li>
            <li>I will be more careful.</li>
            <li>Now its much easier to use</li>
            <li>It still hurts but the pain is much easier to manage.</li>
            <li>so it doesent have to hurt as much</li>
            <li>really</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, and frankly, I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>Now I have been wearing skirts and dresses comfortably since the hair grows in so much finer and so much more slowly.  </li>
            <li>but i would say stick with the real thing.</li>
            <li>really hurt on level 3 (and I can tolerate pain very well).  </li>
            <li>It also hurts like hell especially near the bony areas.</li>
            <li>works, it really does.</li>
            <li>The rest of the hair the laser either misses, doesn&#x27;t pass enough energy through, or the hair is too light.  </li>
            <li>, what they really need to be asking is \\&quot;did</li>
            <li>and they confirmed it can not be used in the areas noted above.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing i didn&#x27;t like about the Tria laser is how fast the battery runs out.</li>
            <li>and you can go in straight lines the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll post an update once I have treated longer and seen if there really are long-lasting results.</li>
            <li>because I really wanted it to work.  </li>
            <li>Was really hopeful this would work as advertised, so I went ahead and bought and used it as instructed.  </li>
            <li>Very suspect that they accused me of tampering with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, too; it work great when it&#x27;s working, but, why have a warranty if you&#x27;re not going to stand behind.</li>
            <li>With my face, much slower going.</li>
            <li>.) The head of this laser is absolutely TINY.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Each pulse takes about 5 seconds to fire (doesn&#x27;t sound like a big deal, but those 5 seconds add up).</li>
            <li>so it might not hurt as much if you have lighter, finer hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really does feel like that.</li>
            <li>I really want this to work.  </li>
            <li>After much research, I purchased the Tria Laser Hair Removal system in August 2012.</li>
            <li>I can absolutely see a difference.</li>
            <li>After four weeks I can see some improvement, but not as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>have high hopes for this machine &amp; can&#x27;t wait to see what the progress will be in 6 months!</li>
            <li>Well, since the cycle varies treating weekly is absolutely the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I really need something to get rid of this hair:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really hope this can help somebody out there.</li>
            <li>I can attesst that the Tria has worked very well for me to use for touch ups.  </li>
            <li>Also generates too much of heat to make it bearable on the skin.</li>
            <li>The lazer did absolutely nothing to remove the hair.</li>
            <li>I am really upset that they didn&#x27;t approve my review.</li>
            <li>If I had the funds to spend I would seek legal advise on the issues of this deceptive advertisement.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!  </li>
            <li>The battery time seems to go quite fast.  </li>
            <li>It really does make  difference when it comes to the pain factor.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my friend and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>contact me at period945@gmail.com, thanks</li>
            <li>As a woman it is very embarrassing, I used to wax, shave you name it.</li>
            <li>I know it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>my wrist and my ankles and feet, I have sat 4 straight hours with a tattoo needle pounding at my flesh that I could stand this laser</li>
            <li>I really thought the safety feature wouldn&#x27;t let zap him, but it did</li>
            <li>If it really worked, wouldn&#x27;t that still be up?</li>
            <li>It def feels like the real deal.</li>
            <li>The next generation for this product is already available.</li>
            <li>I decided to really work on my legs</li>
            <li>So in theory this might be equal to or better than the professional treatments I got 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>That being said the reason I chose the Tria is because it&#x27;s a diode laser which is proven to have far better lasting results and fewer treatments.</li>
            <li>It took at least 6 months for me to see some good results.  </li>
            <li>It is OK for those who have done several laser treatments with a professional and are looking for a \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; device.  </li>
            <li>At first I considered electrolysis, because I understand that it&#x27;s the only true hair removal.</li>
            <li>Had I not followed directions and taken so long to try to get good results, I would have returned it long ago.  </li>
            <li>light skin with dark hair, and have had tremendous success with professional treatments.  </li>
            <li>I am still using the product to get rid of these last stubborn areas, but the overall result is very nice and trouble free.  </li>
            <li>Yesterday I noticed little hairs on my wash cloth as I was washing my face, so with great excitement I spent a good 5 mins pulling little hairs out of my neck!</li>
            <li>Those who do not have ideal skin tones should consider the following on whether to epilate prior to TRIA laser use:  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; Is the area of skin being treated darker than other areas of your body?  </li>
            <li>All I am going to say is that after two treatments I noticed results when doing it the professional way, also smelled right away the burnt follicles.</li>
            <li>If the hairs slid right out with no resistance at all, they would come out with the bulb just as they do in electrolysis, and that suggests the follicle is completely destroyed.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, the areas that I had professionally treated with true lasers (same technology as Tria device) have remained nearly hair free for the duration of my post treatment years (7-15 years depending on when the treatments were performed).</li>
            <li>Alternatively, the areas that I had professionally treated with true lasers (same technology as Tria device) have remained nearly hair free for the duration of my post treatment years (7-15 years depending on when the treatments were performed).</li>
            <li>Hairs using a smaller number of pulses have taken significantly longer to regrow than from epilation (2 months as opposed to 3 weeks) and are thinner than before, but the area still has to be redone.</li>
            <li>I must say I was skeptical about the home laser treatments but the return policy was too good not to try it!  </li>
            <li>By this, I mean that more hair follicles died and has not regrown significantly (about 5% regrowth).</li>
            <li>Customer service is unwilling to ship a replacement and apparently no repair is available.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so I just got my tria the other day.</li>
            <li>Which is significantly faster than the last model.</li>
            <li>I used setting one most of the time, and two at other times.</li>
            <li>Hopefully other customers have had better experiences.</li>
            <li>Sure, I still have dark, coarse hair that needs treatment, but just the fact that I don&#x27;t have to shave every day is fantastic.</li>
            <li>not TRIA, any other advises?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks:)</li>
            <li>&quot; they are still enough to significantly increase my quality of life.</li>
            <li>This was worth the money saving me thousands from having it done professionally - not to mention much more private which is what I like!  </li>
            <li>The problem is this:  The only one who can use 1 year warranty is original owner...who has to call or enter serial # when they purchase the unit.  </li>
            <li>I have dark course hairs and very light skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very light skinned with dark hair.</li>
            <li>It does NOT work on red, blonde and specially white body hair, so this is my own and personal experience review on Tria Laser Hair Removal &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>But to me $500 (now less than $400) is worth it since professional LHR costs much more and requires appointments.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;ve gently pulled them out with a tweezer to help things along, because who needs MORE dark pores looking like grody blackheads?    </li>
            <li>i bought the tria for christmas , gift to my self, i have not been able to use it more than 4 times until now, is just hard when you have a 11 month old home, so this is my 4 treatment and so far i have not seen any difference, the hair continues to grow and i havent notice any hair reductions yet,, I will continue using it</li>
            <li>and I confidently say that because I was really let down.</li>
            <li>Using too few pulses will lead to no reduction in hair growth, or at best thinner hairs, because insufficient heat was absorbed to destroy all hair-producing cells, even if it was enough to weaken the hair root allowing the hair to fall out.</li>
            <li>I have dark hair and pale skin, so I&#x27;m supposed to be the ideal candidate</li>
            <li>This has really changed my life, I spent so much work and effort to try to handle unwanted growth, and fitting in professional laser treatments</li>
            <li>This little laser made my entire vacation more pleasurable and a fantastic experience.</li>
            <li>the underarm hair bothers me the most because even when i shave you can still see the black roots and it looks very unattractive.</li>
            <li>I have black hair and very light -</li>
            <li>Also this laser is made in China, and it shows, most parts creaks, the metal grills don&#x27;t fit very well, poor design and workmanship for a $400 product.</li>
            <li>so I was surprised at how much it hurt!</li>
            <li>I have been using the laser exactly as the instructions suggest for that 10-month period, but I have so far not seen any results whatsoever.</li>
            <li>If you do order a Tria laser, definitely return it for the full refund within the 90 day period if you see no results during that time.</li>
            <li>I purchased the unit more as a supplement to the professional treatments that I am getting and to reduce(not completely remove/retard) hair growth in different areas.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my wife; she recently started a laser treatment for removing armpit hair and the full treatment (6 sessions) were $500.00</li>
            <li>To be honest I shave EVERYDAY!</li>
            <li>Even though I purchased with a 90 day money back guarantee, they did not refund the full price.</li>
            <li>I am a full grown man and have had back problems</li>
            <li>The latter is not painful however removing every hair with this product  feels like electrolysis which is burning off each hair one by one.</li>
            <li>If you have too dark of skin, the laser will not be able to differentiate hair from skin, and will not work.  </li>
            <li>Only after using the Better Business Bureau, did I see TRIA customer service offer any sort of reasonable solution to my issue above.</li>
            <li>I put on make up as usual &amp; there was no shadow which was nice for a change.</li>
            <li>and keep treatments on schedule, the hair will re grow a few times,  after the tenth session I was about 95% hair free, the hair left is pretty fine,</li>
            <li>That means that I was able to do my legs from the knees down, bikini line, and underarms all for under $400.</li>
            <li>permanent but new ones can grow in!  </li>
            <li>new hair follicles!  </li>
            <li>they said you have to buy a new unit!</li>
            <li>I am seeing wonderful results, my legs have about 40% less hair, my underarms probably about 60% less, and my bikini has almost no hair left at all.</li>
            <li>thing that blew my mind is that the battery gave out (won&#x27;t do more than 3-4 pulses) after slightly over a year</li>
            <li>Well Spent, easily saved me over $2k</li>
            <li>This is a decent product .</li>
            <li>Be generous and give an extra laser pulse more than what&#x27;s necessary for the hair to simply fall out, to make sure enough heat reaches all of the epithelial cells of the hair matrix.</li>
            <li>i have read many mixed reviews and after two years of research i finally decided to buy the tria.</li>
            <li>I have the older version</li>
            <li>With the older version you use it every 2 weeks</li>
            <li>A lot of people are saying it&#x27;s a piece of junk, but people need to be realistic.</li>
            <li>and we always had patients coming back in for way more treatments than should&#x27;ve been necessary.</li>
            <li>I am about two months in, and have seen decent results.  </li>
            <li>I have used so many different methods such as sugar waxing and using epilators</li>
            <li>The energy density of the laser isn&#x27;t strong enough to do the sort of damage required for extensive hair follicle reduction and your results even with a medical grade laser won&#x27;t leave you entirely smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have a medium complection my underarms and bikini are light, but my legs and arms get pretty dark tan over the summer.   </li>
            <li>just wasn&#x27;t realistic for me.</li>
            <li>I started only the top part of binki the same time I started my underamrs and my bikini area</li>
            <li>I mark my leg where it quits with an ink pen, put it on quick charge and finish later.</li>
            <li>few visible blank spots where you can tell hair is gone for good  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to call them back until just recently, feb 2013</li>
            <li>I always used the highest setting which is 3 on my older version.  </li>
            <li>I hope Tria comes up with a bigger treatment head and more power for the next product.</li>
            <li>The device demonstrates moderate efficacy at hair removal for mild cases of excess hair growth.  </li>
            <li>I got this as a gift from my husband and then got pregnant shortly after</li>
            <li>I thought the more expensive the better it would be.</li>
            <li>I like Tria because it is much cheaper than the spa and even if the hair grows back eventually (although some is gone permanently) you have no hair for a long period of time (better than shaving).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having this at home to do maintenance as opposed to going back to the salon (scheduling appointments, waiting, driving there, back, doing the treatments - you waste the same amount of time) - having it is awesome!  </li>
            <li>- Keep it in the high setting.  </li>
            <li>I think I have a high pain tolerance</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>also, have a fairly high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>have high hopes for this machine &amp; can&#x27;t wait to see what the progress will be in 6</li>
            <li>I also have an extremely high pain tolerance.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, $550 unit is only good as long as the limited life batteries work and only for the original purchaser.  </li>
            <li>The second effect can be mitigated by cooling the skin and continuing to direct laser pulses towards the follicle; but the first, of damage at the surface around hairs, can only be addressed by removing the hairs to prevent them from absorbing laser light at the skin&#x27;s surface.    </li>
            <li>I suspect after a few more sessions, as there are less follicles to zap, I will be able to increase it to the maximum \\&quot;5\\&quot; setting.  </li>
            <li>happened to see the Tria on TV one day and researched it a little more.  </li>
            <li>So prepare to spend a lot more time with this pre-historic little Tria gun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other pro is that it is REALLY easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Though it seems a little pricey at time of purchase, when I compare the $450 I wasted at a medical salon, the Tria is an excellent investment.</li>
            <li>I had LASER Hair Removal done prior at a Dermatologist&#x27;s Office on my underarms, and WOW- Talk about PAIN FACTOR!!!!!</li>
            <li>With the large treatment areas and no need to overlap pulses, the Silk&#x27;n Pro allows me to treat larger and hard to see areas MUCH more quickly than the Tria.</li>
            <li>The hair that is still growing is more fine and less dark.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than going to get it professionally done--which I tried on my face and underarms.</li>
            <li>Use the money to pay for real laser hair removal that offers GUARANTEED RESULTS.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve had professional laser treatments done and this one hurts just as much</li>
            <li>I have had professional lasering on my stomach and face and even after two treatments of that, my hair was over 50% gone and the hair that continued to come in was much, much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months and so far can&#x27;t tell much difference.  </li>
            <li>and finally I am seeing huge areas where no hair is present and the areas that do have hair, that hair is so sparse it shouldn&#x27;t be much longer before it&#x27;s all gone.  </li>
            <li>This means knowing how many pulses are enough to simply make the hair fall out, and then exceeding that number to ensure the follicle is completely destroyed.</li>
            <li>that i normally shave off [legs, stomach, chest, arms] and wax any hair on my face/neck.</li>
            <li>so I end up having to use it on the lowest setting in those areas, which is the least effective setting.  </li>
            <li>I went through a couple of years worth of monthly treatments on several areas of my body with IPL</li>
            <li>I expected it to work well for me as I have fair skin and dark hair, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
            <li>I expect I will be done using it in a few more months.</li>
            <li>I think this item is worth the money especially if i can use it as often as i want.</li>
            <li>You can have mine for next to nothing, since that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>you know it is very possible to get heat and blisters  -- and the TRIA is not that powerful.</li>
            <li>It is so worth it to me to have my life and confidence back.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought the Silk&#x27;n Bellalite product and will proceed with that - with the confidence that I can replace the pulse module if needed again and not throw away another $400 nor have an electronic product that is going to end up in a landfill (I&#x27;m searching for recycling) after a very short useful life.  </li>
            <li>But I red years worth of reviews</li>
            <li>I have read the customers reviews from various sites to ascertain the validity or worth of this product and in the end</li>
            <li>I have gotten success only for leg hair on lower legs.</li>
            <li>In some smaller areas, the hair pretty is much gone.  </li>
            <li>With the adjustable power settings, in more sensitive areas I dropped down one power level and felt no pain or discomfort.</li>
            <li>How gross, right?</li>
            <li>Just be careful to shave first and go gently over scars because the laser is attracted to dark pigment and will hurt more.  </li>
            <li>When I first got the Tria it would hold a charge for a half an hour, now I am lucky to get 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I use it every other week and have seen a huge reduction in hair.  </li>
            <li>Actually, well over a year, and it&#x27;s pretty safe to say I wasted that money.  </li>
            <li>6 months ago I was having to shave my lower legs once per week to keep smooth, now its every other week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suspect the thick dark hairs just conduct more heat, hence the greater pain.</li>
            <li>Because even if it never rids the hair completely, at the very least, I know I look good when I use it.   </li>
            <li>An agonizing session a week beforehand had lead to practically zero reduction of growth and even a slight burn due to over-application of laser light &gt;.&lt; Even when using ice to cool!</li>
            <li>(I have been burned... by a doctor who was trying out his new laser without training).</li>
            <li>Brand new TRIA to finish off my legs, I thought.  </li>
            <li>I believe the new version is quicker.</li>
            <li>and they just tell you to buy a new one from them.</li>
            <li>The new TRIA holds a charge longer, you can glide it (</li>
            <li>On October 29, 2010, I contacted the company and the representative authorized a return for a new one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again I will buy a new one when this one gives out.</li>
            <li>and i called the costumer care they told me they will replace it by new one</li>
            <li>and I Will wait for new one ,,,,</li>
            <li>and they sent me a brand new Tria.</li>
            <li>But I began taking pills to even out my hormones and prevent any new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>and it needed to be returned for a new product</li>
            <li>So we got 6 uses out of this system then were told we could buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I called Tria&#x27;s customer service and they told me that there is a new upcoming model on January</li>
            <li>But if you can see your dark hair follicle even after you shave your legs (or wherever) - it should work just fine.  </li>
            <li>on the main page, Amazon shows three items \\&quot;frequently bought together...\\&quot; with the Tria.</li>
            <li>By that time I could see very sparse, coin size patches of hair that weren&#x27;t growing back as fast or at all.</li>
            <li>that being said, I was almost completely hair-free by swimsuit season, which was my main reason for purchasing the unit.  </li>
            <li>Sent back because in instructions said that it doesn&#x27;t work on light hair and nowhere in prior reading before ordering was that mentioned.</li>
            <li>It has some major ergonomic and usability flaws that make it an absolute pain to use.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has light skin and even medium brown to black hair.</li>
            <li>Not sure if the new one is any better</li>
            <li>i notice when i pull my skin tight, it doesn&#x27;t find the hair as easily as when i let the nozzle sink into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I would still be willing to try it again, if they get rid of the third piece(put</li>
            <li>Currently testing 4~6 pulses in rapid succession with ice beforehand and wetting the skin, which seems to be enough to remove most hairs in the correct growth phase (thinner hairs that aren&#x27;t growing and don&#x27;t hurt when lasered are just pulled out after several pulses to avoid confusion and wasting pulses).  </li>
            <li>According to the instructions epilation should be avoided for 4~6 weeks prior to the first use of TRIA laser.</li>
            <li>I have light skin and dark hair.</li>
            <li>Please know two things: 1) the Tria is designed for use without safety glasses (just don&#x27;t use it anywhere near your eyes!)</li>
            <li>First, I have only been using the Tria for about 1 1/2 months.  </li>
            <li>The head of the tria is small and it requires alot of patience to move from spot to spot so that you are sure to not miss any patches.  </li>
            <li>A complete ripoff!</li>
            <li>Plus I have a light skin and dark hair</li>
            <li>Sensitive pits!)</li>
            <li>Cons: exactly the same as laser hair removal in a salon or med spa.</li>
            <li>Even if I never lost any more hair, it would be worth the 400$ because I don&#x27;t have to deal with the constant ingrown hairs, razor burn, and stubble that came from how thick and dense the hair was.  </li>
            <li>Dark hair and medium light skin.</li>
            <li>Only completed about 1/2 of my chest the first time out.   </li>
            <li>At first I was only planning on doing my legs</li>
            <li>but since I had battery power left the first time, I&#x27;ve decided to do my arm pits as well.  </li>
            <li>As long as I can go for weeks at a time without dealing with unwanted hair and embarrassment, it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I was doing a small area, so this was okay for me.</li>
            <li>The instructions for the machine tell you to use it every 2 weeks for the first 3 months and only once a month afteward up to 8 months for maximum results.  </li>
            <li>I am a prime candidate for laser hair removal with light skin and dark, course hair.  </li>
            <li>but companies can define their warranty periods to be almost exactly the actual life of the product.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time and money on Tria!</li>
            <li>After the first time using it, I noticed that the hair wasn&#x27;t growing back.  </li>
            <li>After the first treatment, the hair started growing back after 3 days.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The sensitive areas like toes, fingers, breasts, and belly are already without hair!  </li>
            <li>My hair is dark and my skin is light in the area being treated...</li>
            <li>I have light olive skin and dark hair.</li>
            <li>I feel like my unit now doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as well as my first or second unit</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m dark haired with a light- medium skin tone.</li>
            <li>I used the 3 setting the first time, 4 the second time after I tried mixing oral analgesic (20% benzocaine) with collagen gel.</li>
            <li>some hairs appear dark, but the roots may be too light for laser.</li>
            <li>bought this for my wife and she used it consistently at the highest setting she could tolerate (which was only 2 or 3) and it never made any noticeable reduction.</li>
            <li>I sent it back in it&#x27;s original packaging in pristine condition following all of their \\&quot;rules\\&quot; for returns.  </li>
            <li>That actually took two phone calls - the first time, they promised to e-mail the info</li>
            <li>I have been to med spas and spent a lot of money on Brazilian and full leg hair removal-successfully.  </li>
            <li>Again, if this is something they want to market for small areas, then fine, but they should not be marketing this as something to use for your whole body, or even your legs.  </li>
            <li>By far the most significant factors in applying enough heat to the follicle are wetting the skin, which both provides cooling from evaporation and also moderates the temperature increase of the outer skin surface preventing burns; cooling with ice, beforehand and possibly between TRIA pulses; and applying all pulses to a specific hair follicle in rapid succession, instead of moving away from the area and later returning multiple times to overlap coverage.</li>
            <li>My hair is dark brown, by the way, and I have pale skin, so unless if I had black hair, I should be the perfect canidate.</li>
            <li>I am East Indian with a light beige-ish skin tone and black hair.    </li>
            <li>Please note that you have to have a light skin pigment with black body hair color to work.</li>
            <li>i have porcelain colored skin and black hair, so I fit the required m.o.</li>
            <li>I have light skin and black hair on my underarms.</li>
            <li>Their customer service is not available during hours when I have easy access to wait on hold for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually, I totally cheated; if I were as good about the overlapping as the directions recommend I estimate 1 round would&#x27;ve taken at least 10 hours of treatment time (more than one week of treatments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While using the TRIA (same as w/med spa LHR)</li>
            <li>I pretty much surrendered after keeping up the regime for 8 months with absolutely no results.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it remove hair, I have also been able to laser off some dark freckles.  </li>
            <li>It is very heavy--if you plan on doing hard to reach areas, the weight will get to your arm very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This, of course, may be due to not completing the full year.</li>
            <li>wonder if the new on is just a different color or has some real differences?</li>
            <li>this will cost Tria more than it would to repair my device or at least offer me a discount towards a new one.    </li>
            <li>this should be a very basic protocol, but many facilities don&#x27;t even bother with sanitizing the devices, much less sterilizing them between patients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this should be a very basic protocol, but many facilities don&#x27;t even bother with sanitizing the devices, much less sterilizing them between patients.    </li>
            <li>The pain is much more bearable, much less than when I initially started using the Tria.</li>
            <li>I started out using topical numbing cream- applying it 45 mins prior to using TRIA; quick wipeoff of it- and setting of a 5.</li>
            <li>Some More Suggestions: The treatment head is small and the battery lasts a decently long time but you will need multiple treatments to cover a full area.</li>
            <li>it is exactly like those in the profisonal salon excet its small and easy to carry with the same effects.</li>
            <li>To prevent this from happening, it is essential to use enough pulses to completely remove the hair follicle on the first try, since later passes in the months following will both consume a large amount of time, and will have lower chances of success if the hair has become thinner.</li>
            <li>if you want to use it on legs or large areas it might not be the answer but for smaller areas like your face it works wonders.</li>
            <li>then after i let the hairs grow out I actually saw that quite a large amount of the hair wasn&#x27;t coming in.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who needs to treat a large area of skin.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a girl like me who is a little too hairy for society&#x27;s liking, this is a fabulous investment.</li>
            <li>When I use it on the fine dark hairs I barely feel it</li>
            <li>When I called to ask for a solution to this very common problem, they make NO provision for any kind of repair.  </li>
            <li>bikini line is about as useful as this gets if you don&#x27;t want to waste days on end trying to finish a large area.</li>
            <li>While this did reduce SOME hair growth on my lower legs this certainly cannot be described as similar in any way to professional laser hair treatment.</li>
            <li>sometimes I had little red bumps and it hurt not any more</li>
            <li>Mustache area is the most reduced, hard to find hair there anymore.</li>
            <li>This may not seem like much, but if you are treating large areas of your body, this extra size makes a big difference in treatment times,</li>
            <li>This may not seem like much, but if you are treating large areas of your body, this extra size makes a big difference in treatment times,</li>
            <li>Laser/\\&quot;PDL\\&quot; and Intense Pulsed Light/\\&quot;IPL\\&quot;) at Medical Spas with professional grade machines.</li>
            <li>They also recommend that you begin on the lowest setting so that you gradually adjust to the pain, but even at the highest setting, the power of the laser is far below what the standard medspa laser is shooting, so suck it up anddeal with the pain of setting 5 if you&#x27;re looking to achieve real results.  </li>
            <li>If you come across very stubborn hairs then I would suggest a home electrolysis or second hand professional electrolysis machine to take them out.</li>
            <li>I only do it when I feel I need it because the hair is much thiner and soft</li>
            <li>I have had professional laser hair removal that actually worked very well on me.  </li>
            <li>winter, clearly I did not shave my legs.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>By comparison there was clear</li>
            <li>So far, no noticeable difference in hair growth and/or appearance in any of the treated areas (underarms, bikini line and legs).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had professional laser hair removal before</li>
            <li>Their product was defective and they aren&#x27;t (so far) honoring their warranty.    </li>
            <li>I would advise finding a professional laser hair removal place.</li>
            <li>i would say its about 20% so far gone/thinner.</li>
            <li>So far though my wife has used it once</li>
            <li>I have been using it at the highest level - which does hurt much like a big rubber band snap.  </li>
            <li>But you learn to break it up and maybe start early on a Saturday so that you can get house chores done, etc.</li>
            <li>The pain from the Tria can only be described as intense.</li>
            <li>and I have not needed any cooling or numbing for them even on sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>LHR is the only method that really made a difference</li>
            <li>LHR is the only method that really made a difference</li>
            <li>Because so much hair was reduced over time I never saw the point in going back</li>
            <li>I put the sensor against my skin correctly, the green light came on</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thankfully I already had my bikini area done professionally, because I don&#x27;t think this laser would have done anything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen results from professional treatment</li>
            <li>My underarm hair is nearly gone.</li>
            <li>I do not have any affiliation with this company and have never had professional hair removal performed.  </li>
            <li>For the rest of us, it is something you need to keep up with, whether you do it at home or get it professionally done.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for one month and haven&#x27;t seen results yet, but it&#x27;s way too early to tell.  </li>
            <li>So far I think this product is everything that it was promised to be.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only writing this review to confirm it really does work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now early spring</li>
            <li>Do not waste your $.</li>
            <li>I did try tyhe professional laser hair removal and it does work  also and</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product direct from Tria, 1st generation if you will.</li>
            <li>As an aside, I&#x27;ve never had professional laser.</li>
            <li>It is a lot cheaper than getting professional laser hair removal</li>
            <li>Have used it for a month now and can already see a difference, my hair isn&#x27;t growing back as fast</li>
            <li>Of course it didn&#x27;t work and the real kicker is that the warranty had expired days earlier (even though it hadn&#x27;t been activated</li>
            <li>I am surprised Ididn&#x27;t expect to see results this early</li>
            <li>This is a 400 dollar product when getting it done professionally would cost thousands.</li>
            <li>but eventually you won&#x27;t have to treat as much, then only touch ups every year or so.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done one treatment so far and will update.</li>
            <li>it looks completely hairless.</li>
            <li>my friend emailing told me this  tool is not warranty and also can&#x27;t be fixed.</li>
            <li>one square foot takes about 45 minutes to complete the laser process and about 3 to charge it.  </li>
            <li>was reviewed well by professional companies.</li>
            <li>I have had one professional laser hair treatment and at the level 10</li>
            <li>It is completely embarrassing.  </li>
            <li>I bought TRIA laser hair removal system to maintain the results after getting professional treatments.</li>
            <li>That is enough to put me off, so I don&#x27;t use it as much as I should...</li>
            <li>However, looking back to how much I&#x27;ve had to shave and the razor burn</li>
            <li>Go to a professional.  </li>
            <li>Plus it zaps the hair folicle that is alive.</li>
            <li>Too early to know if the hair removal will be permanent</li>
            <li>If you want to try it go directly through Tria</li>
            <li>and so I was surprised that I stopped at \\&quot;4\\&quot; for my legs.  </li>
            <li>(though so far, I&#x27;ve soldiered</li>
            <li>But so far, I can&#x27;t vouch that it&#x27;s accomplishing what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li>If you have had professional lasering</li>
            <li>Just to feel my face and feel soft skin instead of stubble and scars(which are fading as well).  </li>
            <li>even did my sons very hairy back with this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a product of the early &#x27;90s, 5&#x27;2\\&quot; (158 cm), size 2,</li>
            <li>However, I was hoping for near hairlessness of areas for which I had already had LHR.</li>
            <li>I bought this product direct from the company, not Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to do on my legs and soon realized that was completely unreasonable.</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting laser done professionally.</li>
            <li>I have had professional laser hair removal from a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office and it does work on my body.</li>
            <li>I have used the Tria 3 times so far</li>
            <li>I really hoped to do the legs, but I only have time for underarms, because I have a 1 year  </li>
            <li>Mostly on sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>My doubts were completely squished after using if for two months.</li>
            <li>I sent a message through their contact form directly on the website, and sent an email as well.</li>
            <li>This takes me about 2 weeks to complete, then I get a week off.</li>
            <li>My results so far are as follows: 2 treatments from dec 27-jan 21  legs</li>
            <li>when you see such fast results, it is quite motivating.  </li>
            <li>WOW,</li>
            <li>So far it feels like I&#x27;ve just been ripped off.</li>
            <li>I do it when I whant and it really does the same job as salon lasers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if anybody has doubts that this machine actually works, I can vouch that it absolutely does.  </li>
            <li>I even used it to finish what 9 treatments of professional LHR ($1000) didn&#x27;t accomplish on my underarms</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product, just pay the money and go to a professional.</li>
            <li>Do Not Waste Your money.  </li>
            <li>she wanted it for her birthday, and so far she loves it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had professional laser hair removal before and before that I tried electrolysis.</li>
            <li>If you have had professional laser, then you know a shot feels like</li>
            <li>I had to wait for the area to completely heal then</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed the hair to grow back slower, as I am a very hairy person, in fact some areas done on my stomach</li>
            <li>are completely hairless thus far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not paid by Tria, this is just my experience so far.</li>
            <li>This device is nowhere&#x27;s near powerful enough to get the job done without multiple sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This device will not kill the root of the hair like professional machines</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would not recommend this product to people who have never had laser professionally.  </li>
            <li>We just received the  unit from Tria and while removing the plastic cover noticed the following warnings  which I cannot find on Tria web site so think they are very disingenuous.  </li>
            <li>And how could your head be sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Since I did buy it direct from them they are sending me a return label etc.</li>
            <li>The level i can tolerate depends on the area i use it for and how sensitive it is.</li>
            <li>I recommend you save your money and have this done professionally.</li>
            <li>i well complete to see how the hair grow up</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE I WAS SEEKING PROFESSIONAL LASER HAIR REMOVAL</li>
            <li>No noticeable results so far after 3 laserings.</li>
            <li>Sure, I could set aside the time, but the problem is, that on Level 5, it dies within 15-20 minutes and you have to charge it for 2 hours at least.</li>
            <li>, so Level 5 is tolerable) for about 10 sessions, every two weeks to the leftover hairs that I had after the professional lasering.</li>
            <li>Once I hear about 3-5 beeps, I tweeze off that hair as it falls off naturally and that hair doesn&#x27;t reappear from what I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>And, secondly, much like medical salon laser treatments</li>
            <li>was the prefect candadite for laser hair removal and did 6 professional sessions about 12 years ago.</li>
            <li>This is a weekly treatment, unlike professional treatments which make you go every 6 weeks because of the hair growth cycles.</li>
            <li>I am guessing that is just an attempt at some legal protection in case someone hurts themselves, but choosing not to include that same warning here on a $400 item is deceptive.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Hair really stops growing back within the sixth week.</li>
            <li>SO FAR</li>
            <li>Hair has grown back, but as I say, much much finer than before.</li>
            <li>A professional you can see.</li>
            <li>I am unsure about this product so far I haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
            <li>I had about 4 sessions of professional laser hair removal for my underarms and bikini about 4 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I also use on the bikini area and found that you really need to read the directions before using and shave as close a possible before use.  </li>
            <li>my whole back is tattooed,</li>
            <li>I treated my bikini line and after the 4th time, I now see a marked decrease in hair growth.  </li>
            <li>using even more pulses per hair a few months later when the hairs in that area regrow!    </li>
            <li>It may even be necessary to use tweezers, which may take several hours but as you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s worth it...    </li>
            <li>went through a couple of years worth of monthly treatments on several areas of my body with IPL exclusively (same technology as the Infini&#x27;silk devices).</li>
            <li>I have also used it on my upper lip a few times and it looks better too.</li>
            <li>After six months, my leg hair was growing in more slowly and patchier, but still needed to shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very time consuming because the laser needs to be recharged often and allowed multiple breaks to cool down</li>
            <li>Test the effectiveness by pulling out a representative hair after using TRIA on it, or risk having to do the same area again (having fewer hairs in the 1cm window does not mean it goes faster!)</li>
            <li>And you can cool down your skin immediately after to stop this.  </li>
            <li>I think that they should offer previous owners a special deal, a trade in, based upon the overblown promises of hair elimination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I have tried to do arms several times, ranging from several pulses on power 4 (out of 5) with cooling to a full-power pulse with no cooling to 2 pulses per hair without cooling, this significantly underestimated the number of pulses necessary for hairs of this size.</li>
            <li>I went to pull the first long hair and to my surprise, it wasn&#x27;t even attached!</li>
            <li>First let me start by saying that I have been treated with laser treatmens for very long time</li>
            <li>Had I not purchased a home system, there are other areas, toes and fingers for example, that I would not have spent the time or money to have laser hair removal on, because there aren&#x27;t that many hairs there.</li>
            <li>It does have a small \\&quot;zap\\&quot; area, but it moves along VERY quickly since there is no time needed between each zap.  </li>
            <li>However, despite the overall temperature of the area of skin feeling very warm and pain relief cream to the point that a tiny amount seeped inside the treatment head to the other side of the transparent window forming a small, clear yellow spot, the pain was still intense and despite using the entire battery charge with a power setting of 3~4 and repeating areas as dictated by the instructions, there was no noticeable reduction in hair growth except at the very edges of the area where hairs grew slanted with the roots close to the skin&#x27;s surface.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;It might kill hair but the real deal-breaker was the major time suck (&amp; not whenever convenient, but in regular intervals).</li>
            <li>A nearby region with slightly less dark skin (registering green on sensor) with slanting hairs and follicles close to the surface and equivalent density seemed to not have resulted in significant reduction prior to epilation, but a month afterwards that particular area is down 60~80% from normal (patchy) despite not having gone over that area a second time, but this unexpected result was due to the direction of hair growth allowing much more of the light to reach the hair roots instead of just being absorbed at the surface.      </li>
            <li>Your existing hair follicles will disappear but it is absolutely possible that new ones can grow in!  </li>
            <li>However, if you have experienced pale dots on skin from loss of melanin, you might want to just accept that small hairs might remain where larger ones were.</li>
            <li>If you have serious hair issues and want to try,negotiating a price for 2 would make your work more efficient.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am currently testing having used 3~4 pulses in rapid succession, with both ice (which cools the follicle as well) and wetting the skin (which mainly prevents burns).  </li>
            <li>Oh, they&#x27;re hairy, but about one in thirty is really dark and blissfully in sun, they turn light blonde</li>
            <li>The laser head is pretty narrow and unless you&#x27;re a very diligent and patient person, purchasing this to do your legs</li>
            <li>It seems the laser has made alot of improvements from the older reviews i read, it is light, easy to turn on and use, i do wish it lasered larger areas and the charging is annoying, but its worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Just in case only the older version was discontinued, I&#x27;m posting to warn everyone off.&lt;br /&gt;In fairness, it does what it says.....</li>
            <li>My first session I could only do level 3, but the second one I tolerated level 4.</li>
            <li>I shaved a small area and treated it, then shaved some more and went about it like that (no markers necessary).  </li>
            <li>I am light skin (African amer/Cuban) with dark hair about 135pounds at height 5&#x27;2 (to give an idea of amount of laser treatment)  </li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, the hair has come back</li>
            <li>I bought this product mainly to eliminate fuzz on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to do large areas like your legs, save your money and find a Groupon or Living Social deal for a local laser hair removal place.  </li>
            <li>The ease of adjusting the power is very easy, making pain and discomfort unnecessary.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this hurt pretty much the same as the salon treatments - repeated sharp snapping sensations, like a rubber band snapping against the skin.  </li>
            <li>I do not recommend this product, especially at such a high cost.</li>
            <li>So overall if you are patient, don&#x27;t have too high of expectations, and can use the laser on the highest setting I would recommend this for you.</li>
            <li>I paid the enormous amount of money for this system with high hopes.  </li>
            <li>The last time I used it, I got about 7 pulses on high power, before the battery died.</li>
            <li>so I  zapped him on his arm with it one day on high and it left a circle burn on him</li>
            <li>&quot; It&#x27;s possible the laser IS working, slowly but surely, but you just have so much hair that it requires several treatment sessions.  </li>
            <li>Heat dissipates very quickly from a hair to the surrounding area, but the follicle only needs to be at a high enough temperature for a few moments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this thing for months now and so far I have barely seen any results.</li>
            <li>Used it on the most powerful setting (5) twice and after 29 days and seeing zero results I had to return it since it&#x27;s such an expensive item to purchase to \\&quot;see if it</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t finish all the treatments with the dr as it took too long and cost too much.</li>
            <li>hair removal is generally said to feel like a rubber band snapping on your skin and professional lasering</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though there are some minor improvements that could be made, the results are very pleasing.</li>
            <li>I did notice a small decrease in the amount of hair in each area, but by no means am I hair free.</li>
            <li>Other things to keep in mind:  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; While using ice to cool the entire area does reduce pain, it also increases the number of pulses that must be applied per unit area.  </li>
            <li>Other wise save up and go to a professional hair removal treatment center!!!!!!</li>
            <li>The two main reasons that this temperature is not reached are the sections of hairs at the surface of the skin heating to the point of causing localized damage, or a general rise in temperature of the entire area of skin being treated to the point that damage results.    </li>
            <li>I gave it to my daughter as a gift, she said so far it is working, after four treatments, she is noticing less regrowth, but true enough you need to be patient since it is a lot of work and dedication for her to achieve her goal.</li>
            <li>so far, ive been treating small areas only with this laser but will move on to larger ones when i have more time.  </li>
            <li>You have to overlap the pulses (the directions show you a &#x27;map&#x27; for your pulses, which is circles representing the treatment head, overlapping half way on top of each other (just like a Venn Diagram).</li>
            <li>&amp;nbsp; - For legs, applying pulses in overlapping lines (moving about half the diameter of treatment window after each pulse, so each follicle receiving 2~3 pulses during a pass) lead to significant reduction of growth for several months,</li>
            <li>, everything grew back the way it was on my underarms, OK, maybe 10% reduction, kinda hard to tell).</li>
            <li>I noticed after the very first time that it grew back much slower than usual.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than waxing and it is slowly working, just not as fast as some other reviews had led me to believe.</li>
            <li>IPL or laser will eventually kill all of your current hair follicles, but your body will form new ones over time.</li>
            <li>IPL or laser willeventually kill all of your current hair follicles, but your body will form new ones over time.</li>
            <li>New hair follicles will CONSTANTLY grow in!  </li>
            <li>so I called back to get the \\&quot;discounted\\&quot; new system.  </li>
            <li>: I just came back here to read my review because it just went live.</li>
            <li>So am I lasering the same hairs, or new hairs-</li>
            <li>They sent out the authorization, FedEx picked it up, and a new unit arrived a couple of weeks later.  </li>
            <li>I used to think I had a really high pain threshold, but apparently not after this, it was almost embarrassing.</li>
            <li>more or less brand new having wasted 2,500 of my currency (TT Dollars) and still paying for laser treatments.</li>
            <li>I was only able to tolerate on the third level on sensitive areas (bikini and underarm) but on my legs I was able to use the highest setting without it hurting too bad.</li>
            <li>- the Tria actually came back to life for a while - then really</li>
            <li>it way it was supposed to with pinprick hot sensations and some redness, but it hasn&#x27;t been long enough for the hair to start shedding.</li>
            <li>After my second treatment, the hair did not grow back as fast and after 1 months</li>
            <li>The hair that still remains on my legs is growing back more slowly and the hair itself is whispy and softer.</li>
            <li>they are soft and pretty down their...</li>
            <li>was a tiny new hair much smaller than the original, due to the hair production cells which did not receive enough heat when the area was treated.</li>
            <li>In all that time I probably spent a total of $2250 for about 10-11 hair removal sessions on each of the following areas: bikini, underarms, full legs, plus a few sessions on the back of my neck to smooth out my hairline.</li>
            <li>I have very pale skin and light to medium brown hair.</li>
            <li>First and foremost: some pain is necessary, but most pain is unnecessary!    </li>
            <li>my Tria (first generation) died the other day.  </li>
            <li>yes, you MUST be patient for results, you MUST overlap areas, you HAVE to get a schedule going, I used mine every other day- for the first 4-6 weeks; then I started \\&quot;shedding hairs\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>One major difference between this laser and what you will get done in a spa is the lack of a cooling device.  </li>
            <li>My bikini - forget it - been bare for years!  </li>
            <li>I am a light skinned white dude (not glow in the dark white), with brown hair.  </li>
            <li>After 8 months of consistent use I have absolutely no hair on my legs!  </li>
            <li>I also know that the reduced hair growth is not due to the tweezing, because there were some hair that grew out after 2 weeks while the majority did not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also know that the reduced hair growth is not due to the tweezing, because there were some hair that grew out after 2 weeks while the majority did not.     </li>
            <li>if you have other plans  be aware of this.  </li>
            <li>I am light complected with dark hair and of French descent (French &#x3D; furry).  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is that the unit get hot after a bit and the battery only last for about 1-2</li>
            <li>I have done as much research as possible online and have been frustrated by the lack of detailed and fully credible reviews, so I am going to summarize my experience and research here.    </li>
            <li>sure you shave as CLOSE as possible, any extra hair makes it more painful.  </li>
            <li>This was typical when I would go to the clinic as well, so I figured I did something right.</li>
            <li>I used the Tria every other day or so to speed up the process (I guess it doesn&#x27;t really speed it up) and immediately the hairs seemed to crystalize and just fall off, never to regrow again (so far).  </li>
            <li>I also used an older version of the Tria as well 2 or 3 times a long time ago too before returning it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can report that the hair does grow at a significantly lower rate, and I notice that I have bald missing hair patches on the neck, and the belly area seems to have about 25% hair left.  </li>
            <li>Using just 1~2 pulses at full power may take a moderate amount of time comparable to say epilating, but this will be completely ineffective at permanently removing hairs, much less when judging based off the smaller amount of time to cover an area at a lower power setting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but definitely worth it, compared to what you would be paying someone to do it for you.</li>
            <li>AT ALL!!!!My skin is super white and my hair is black</li>
            <li>I have very light skin, dark hair, and the occasional dark freckle.  </li>
            <li>I still have some very minor fine hair in the bikini area and a little hair in the underarms.  </li>
            <li>i realize its a little early to declare this a total success, but after years of struggling with unwanted body hair, i&#x27;m looking forward to wearing a bikini without a coverup.</li>
            <li>When you start zapping you can move reasonably quickly, but after about your 10th zap, the laser starts to slow down to a super, molasses crawl.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for at least one part of my body to be hair free from buying this thing (paid about $600 for it at the time)</li>
            <li>General Product:</li>
            <li>general info</li>
            <li>I find it pretty painful, to be honest.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know</li>
            <li>The box and/or packaging clearly states not to use this above the neck.  </li>
            <li>JUST BECAUSE GOT IT ALMOST A MONTH AGO AND STILL TO EARLY TO SEE BIG CHANGES</li>
            <li>I did break the rules and used it on my chin, but I&#x27;ve had professional treatments in a salon on my chin and upper lip and nothing happened.</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t try to use the Tria near your eyes and assume glasses or goggles designed for a different wavelength would help.  </li>
            <li>It takes me four treatments to get both of my legs completely (thighs to ankles, front and back).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 6th treatment and so far my unwanted facial hair is gone</li>
            <li>But I barely got to use it</li>
            <li>Gee, thanks but no thanks.  </li>
            <li>the hair dosn&#x27;t grow back with the professional laser.  </li>
            <li>But this thing knocked out 70% of the bikini line hair on the first use (on the highest setting on dark hair &amp; beige skin).</li>
            <li>I got professional laser hair removal done on my underarms for over a year and am getting the same results with the tria laser</li>
            <li>I have heard some people treat the same spot about 10 times,  and got some results, along with redden skin, like a professional laser.</li>
            <li>I am a male in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Now, I can go a week without shaving and you can barely notice.  </li>
            <li>It works for her and her sister and apparently works for me as well.</li>
            <li>- I can see spotty bare areas if I let hair grow - not</li>
            <li>I think some are old that are just starting to come to the surface.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had anymore problems and the battery on my third unit</li>
            <li>Apparently some of you don&#x27;t realize that they put limits (30 days) on the guarantee.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old and I have facial hair</li>
            <li>And, professional LHR will charge you for each area - lower legs, upper legs, bikini, etc.</li>
            <li>Makeup didn&#x27;t cover it completely and I couldn&#x27;t afford constant treatment.</li>
            <li>- (This one I do not fully get)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a male I wanted to use it on the wild ear hairs.  </li>
            <li>I have had professional laser treatments and it does take longer but results are the same.</li>
            <li>They offer a \\&quot;risk-free\\&quot; 90 money back guarantee yet you must use it far longer than that to even begin see results.</li>
            <li>I will make future purchase with complete confidence.</li>
            <li>I barely even felt it.</li>
            <li>Apparently not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Safety conscious people are not going to want to use this product on their faces after reading that warning, and I suspect that people with unwanted facial hair are a target market for this</li>
            <li>I can barely handle the level 3 setting and it did nothing.  </li>
            <li>The hair becomes finer with a professional, and eventually is gone if you can afford to continue to do several treatments per area.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should have saved up and went with professional laser treatment, which is what I will likely still end up doing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far.</li>
            <li>No problems have developed from using it on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>I did this once a week for the first few weeks and my chin and neck was almost completely cleared.  </li>
            <li>Give them more money when they don&#x27;t stand behind there product, no thankyou.</li>
            <li>Also, sometimes those \\&quot;zapped\\&quot; hairs look kind of weird</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and use Tria in winter and spring when you&#x27;re at your pastiest, ashen, mousiest self (speaking solely on my own account of course).</li>
            <li>The pain seems to be worse when there are more hairs per area, the darker the hair, and the thicker the hair.  </li>
            <li>Hardly worth the trouble or the time.</li>
            <li>They said they were way behind, yea because so many of their products are in need of repair.</li>
            <li>A simple call back to a customer is not hard to do.</li>
            <li>The highest setting has a very long pulse duration and it really hurts on thick hair, specially on the bikini area.</li>
            <li>New hair follicles always, always comes back - whether you use this product or a different one or go to a salon.  </li>
            <li>So because you have to treat the area every other week for the 1st three months, if you do a large area of your body, like the legs, expect to need to stick around  home on those weekends and invest a lot of time into doing the Tria.</li>
            <li>As the hair has gotten finer the treatments have been less painful which is wonderful!</li>
            <li>2 whole legs I would imagine would take a day and half to complete.  </li>
            <li>This seems like common sense, but once you get going on a big area like your legs, you can easily forget that.</li>
            <li>I think the whole process took a week and half to complete.</li>
            <li>Too large of areas for such a tiny treatment head for a machine with such a short battery life.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve see a few reviews about issues after the warranty expires, but if you do the math, and you start using it right</li>
            <li>This company definitely seems like one that listens to its customers and tries to make positive changes based on customer reviews.</li>
            <li>only area where I truly used the Tria (and no previous salons) were my underarms.  </li>
            <li>I downgraded my review to 2 stars, b/c it does work somewhat, but overall if it is just for use on really small areas, then I think it may not be financially worth it especially with all the pro laser hair removal deals I&#x27;ve seen on Groupon and Living Social (if you live in a major city).  </li>
            <li>I think the main part of the answer to that question is already thoroughly explained in the above review and can be summed up with \\&quot;because hormones and genetics cause brand new follicles to naturally keep forming\\&quot;, but the other part of the answer is that when I first started getting laser hair removal, the cost was $2,800 for a 8 treatments of a small area like \\&quot;lower face\\&quot; (which did not include cheeks or anything under the jawline).</li>
            <li>I think the main part of the answer to that question is already thoroughly explained in the above review and can be summed up with \\&quot;because hormones and genetics cause brand new follicles to naturally keep forming\\&quot;, but the other part of the answer is that when I first started getting laser hair removal, the cost was $2,800 for a 8 treatments of a small area like \\&quot;lower face\\&quot; (which did not include cheeks or anything under the jawline).</li>
            <li>This product is ment for people with very light skin and very dark (like black) coarse hairs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this laser on my underarms for about 8 months now,and it worked, the hair slowly disappearing and whichever ones that grow are very very thin and light ( I am a dark brunette ),and the skin is smooth and light , so for me it worked.</li>
            <li>The negative side is that it really is time consuming for large areas like the legs.  </li>
            <li>If enough laser light is delivered to the hair follicle within a small enough amount of time, it will heat up to the point that the hair follicle is destroyed.</li>
            <li>i ve seen a significant growth reduction where i had thick growth .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used it with ok results it does make the hair come back a little less.  </li>
            <li>am also clear that in certain \\&quot;hairy\\&quot; aread ( upper inner thighs, and underarms, I still have too much hair,  but not so thick</li>
            <li>I have pale skin (but I love to tan in the summer), freckles and dark, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>The company can&#x27;t push us around if we speak with a loud voice about our experience, both good and bad.</li>
            <li>have experienced Amazon not fully disclosing relevant details about products several times, and I find it disturbing with such an expensive product.  </li>
            <li>So, now I really recommend people go to a professional:  $400 + a lot of pain for nothing is a waste to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because you have to overlap, and the laser light is so small, it takes a long time.</li>
            <li>My hair has grown back so much lighter and not nearly as much.</li>
            <li>If you are targeting particular hairs keep in mind you need to hit the root which may not be directly below the hair but slightly to its side under the skin, so laser around it as well.</li>
            <li>My disclaimer for this review is that it is for the old style (the one with the digital setting screen came out shortly after I made my purchase).</li>
            <li>I would recommend Tria and don&#x27;t understand why someone would send it back and go back to professional LHR.  </li>
            <li>Never have I spent so much money on a product and been so thoroughly and utterly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>light skin will not heat up at all, just the dark hair or dark freckles.</li>
            <li>Tria really works,but only minus is,you have to spend all day to do it,because of the battery,which You have to recharge every 20 min</li>
            <li>the most frustrating expirance ever in my entire life!</li>
            <li>If you have thick coarse hair all over your body like a gorilla this device will NOT leave you as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bum.  </li>
            <li>Another full battery charge later, surprisingly with the same amount or less pain due to the numbing action of cold on surrounding nerves, there was again no noticeable reduction of hair in that area.    </li>
            <li>so i usually scratch lines down my leg with my fingernail (lightly!)</li>
            <li>The battery life actually lasts longer if you hold the machine exactly 90 degrees to your skin in the down facing position.</li>
            <li>This is why ALL of these facilities require you to sign a broad medical and liability release that includes burns, disfiguring injuries and poor/ no results.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t agree with these positive reviews less.  </li>
            <li>Within this time, I am able to get about half of one ankle done (I&#x27;m small too).</li>
            <li>I was worried that my skin tone would be too dark or that it would hurt too much because I had tanner skin</li>
            <li>plan to treat other areas that really I didnt think of such as my bikini.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had professional hair removal done in the past, and I know it works on my light skin and dark hair.</li>
            <li>so is no excuse at all why it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>As Stated above i used this product only approximately 15-25 times and they told me that it doesn&#x27;t matter how many times you use it.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty much a waste of money, unless by some miracle it works after a year, but I doubt it.</li>
            <li>I used the laser a few times per week for the first 3 or 4 months-</li>
            <li>First off I don&#x27;t understand how people say this doesn&#x27;t work for them after a few sessions.</li>
            <li>Also, after the first few sessions, the pain subsides significantly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It went dead a year from date of purchase, funny???  </li>
            <li>I got the newer one and for me it did a whole lower leg (from the knee down) on one charge.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much it has come down in price.  </li>
            <li>What did happen, was it seemed oil glands opening on to the hair shafts had been damaged by the intense heat flux, causing a crusty residue around the hairs and other signs of damage to the skin immediately surrounding each hair!</li>
            <li>Starting the fourth treatment today, I can hardly see where to work, the hair is so light and sparse, and I haven&#x27;t shaved since the last treatment.     </li>
            <li>I did my treatment religiously, had high hopes for this thing, and I had absolutely no results.</li>
            <li>I got this product for Christmas of 2011and started using it a little by little, mostly on my arms because I am half italian and I have been shaving my arms since high school.</li>
            <li>And I mean I couldnt go a full day without shaving twice.</li>
            <li>NOT A SINGLE hair fell out a month later, or two, or three...    </li>
            <li>But other than that, if you keep using this, and on the high setting, you WILL get results.  </li>
            <li>It stings, but not as bad as I remember it from the professional, which had me nervous that maybe it wasn&#x27;t powerful enough to be effective, and that I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li>Although there are patches that are less hairy on my legs, I still have to shave just as much.  </li>
            <li>I do believe you have to have very dense stubborn black hair in order for the tria to work it</li>
            <li>Way less, much finer, lighter growth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is worth mentioning that I have a condition called PCOS that causes excessive hair on women(more on this later).</li>
            <li>The treatment head is small so it will take several months to fully feel like it&#x27;s worth it.   </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re probably not selling many any more due to bad reviews and cheaper alternatives, and trying to milk whoever else tries out their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As the technology eventually became more common, prices began to come down</li>
            <li>As the technology eventually became more common, prices began to come down</li>
            <li>I WISH I had just saved my $450 and got a single treatment of professional lasering on my legs.</li>
            <li>I have had professional hair removal on my chin and upper lip in the past that  had a much faster result though.</li>
            <li>I wish the treatment area was larger and the battery life longer, but I am hoping that the money I spent is well work it since the cost was only part of a normal treatment.[[ASIN:B0029OSN4U TRIA Hair Removal Laser]]</li>
            <li>have a lot of hair left, but much less hair in certain areas (like lower legs) where I was a nut about hitting all the area with that tiny head, over and over and over.</li>
            <li>Sometimes a too-close shave takes away too much of my dark hair (which oddly comes out really dark at the ends but is lighter at the follicle itself) and I find it&#x27;s more effective with at least 12 hours growth but not much more.   </li>
            <li>Have only had a short time and have noticed the hair starting to thin out not completely gone yet, but as a side note it got rid of my tattoo quick fast and in a hurry</li>
            <li>Hoping the Remington product I purchased will be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to my review: in case I wasn&#x27;t clear in the above post, I did use it as instructed for a very very very long time</li>
            <li>Though the Tria is obviously less intense, I definitely felt the snap of the laser and could smell the hair burning, which means it was doing something.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;The hair density might be slightly less where I have used it, but it is hardly enough to really notice.</li>
            <li>I zapper (at the highest level) actually do grow much less fast....</li>
            <li>Now five and a half months later my hair is as think as it was before and grows as fast as before.</li>
            <li>year round, never comfortable with my hair \\&quot;situation\\&quot;, ever envious of my girlfriends easy summer skirts and shorts.</li>
            <li>My leg hairs are more reddish brown, so doing my WHOLE leg to hit the percentage that are dark enough is tedious and time-consuming.</li>
            <li>It seems the legs, arms, fingers, and some parts of bikini line hair is growing back slower, but under my arms and other bikini area hair growth is normal (darker areas).  </li>
            <li>I am southeast asian, light tan complexion with very dark coarse black hair.</li>
            <li>anything I think it started to stimulate growth in certain parts.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I shaved both legs with a new razor, then used the Tria on one and not the other.  </li>
            <li>Worth going to a pro.&lt;br /&gt;I learned the hard way.</li>
            <li>I only plan on using this for the bikini area, should be fine for face (since tip is relatively small &amp; have dark coarse hair)</li>
            <li>But now, because of no or very little dark hairs in the follicles below the skin(no huge heatup of area) - I don&#x27;t need the numbing cream- and still use the setting of a 5.</li>
            <li>like the person who gave a bad review after finding out this isn&#x27;t intended for the face ( even though some people tried it anyway with good results)</li>
            <li>Then I worried if the good reviews were paid for and the bad reviews were big warning signs to stay away.</li>

            <li> No... But it does diminish it greatly .</li>
            <li> I am SO happy with my Tria.</li>
            <li> I am not so happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have also experienced both of these Hair Removal technologies</li>
            <li> However, for underarms and the bikini area, it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li> The flexibility of doing these treatments at home when it is convenient for me is great.   </li>
            <li> The convenience of sitting in the privacy of your own couch watching tv while zapping hair away is the best.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been great about keeping up with it</li>
            <li> I had great hopes for it</li>
            <li> My experience has been great to so-so</li>
            <li> Happy Trail - Life saver.</li>
            <li> lol  </li>
            <li> For me it is working great.</li>
            <li> I heard great things about this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> and it was great.  </li>
            <li> The batter out in 30 minutes is not so great.  </li>
            <li> You can even notice it by how incredibly aggressive some of the folks here are who are raving about how good this product is.</li>
            <li> If I had a 25% reduction I would have been happy but this provided all of the pain and none of the benefits.  </li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> , I see great reduction in hair growth on my legs and underarms...</li>
            <li> I have great hopes for it though.</li>
            <li> For what I need, it works great.  </li>
            <li> I have been using my Tria for about 4 months now and have had great results.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with my results.</li>
            <li> Appears to be a great product based on reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s done a great job.</li>
            <li> It lowers your self-esteem and causes a great deal of anxiety.  </li>
            <li> Customer service is great by the way.</li>
            <li> and she had great results....</li>
            <li> All in all , a great product.</li>
            <li> From that experience I guess you need to have the perfect hair and skin match-up for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> If you research you will find laser centers that have great specials.</li>
            <li> It is a great idea with safety features built in.</li>
            <li> I had my bikini line treated professionally (at great expense)</li>
            <li> With this at home device, I can use it as many times as I need, and it WORKS!!</li>
            <li> Although you will not find that recommended elsewhere, I found it to be a very effective way to test the efficacy of the laser.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said they were very courteous had no issue with a return</li>
            <li> WHICH IS ALSO VERY NICE.  </li>
            <li> At $400, I think it is a great investment and have used it successfully for about 7 months now.</li>
            <li> Word of mouth is the best advertisment, and I have shared my experience with many &amp; will continue to so.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be sure that I got the best results</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be ideal for this kind of thing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, I am very happy with it :)</li>
            <li> and I am very happy and satisfied.</li>
            <li> but im already happy with the results and hope to see even more hair loss!</li>
            <li> Also, very easy to use!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t work for the company, or even have my own Tria, but my sister&#x27;s is working so great for me on my arm pits</li>
            <li> and hopefully i will soon see some good results</li>
            <li> (Now&#x27;s a good time to mention I would be Chewbakka if I didn&#x27;t shave from my eyebrows to my toenails</li>
            <li> but I risked it on the chin and had good results.</li>
            <li> My similarly fair skinned/dark haired friend did, and it burned the he</li>
            <li> and I think it works just as good.</li>
            <li> The results were never as good</li>
            <li> It does require a good pain tolerance, so thats why i feel it is workin.  </li>
            <li> good luck</li>
            <li> if this good luck continues i will start doing my arms and legs as well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good for 6 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> felt cheated, because i had belive it would work as good as they annouced.</li>
            <li> That is good.  </li>
            <li> Good Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have seen good results, and was recommending it to my friends....</li>
            <li> The fact that I can touch my face and it feels smooth is the greatest thing ever.   </li>
            <li> I wanted to keep, I would think this would be exactly a good place to use</li>
            <li> To yourself or a loved one, please take a look and consider buying.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the good reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I have fair skin.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and medium brown hair.  </li>
            <li> I had read the good reviews, followed the directions</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li> So, I am purchasing a Remington unit (do not know if it is good either).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product and I was like - here it goes, affordable, I can repeat procedure as often as I like - Good Buy - I</li>
            <li> The results are ASTOUNDING: my lower legs are 90% hair free!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> To be most effective, I found that zapping an area as many as 3-5 times in one sitting was the best thing to do.</li>
            <li> I found something VERY interesting.  </li>
            <li> If you are going to purchase this item, make sure you guys understand that there are people who are paid to write great reviews on products that do NOT work.</li>
            <li> good luck for all with amazing technology</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the results after 5 treatments.</li>
            <li> Tria has done a great job at eliminating most of my unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the best pain relief method is to ice the area right before treatment.  </li>
            <li> I swear I am more hairy then ever now!</li>
            <li> (One more piece to carry,loose,break!).</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT if you plan on using it more than a couple of times!   </li>
            <li> all pretty pricey...got to get the best quality for the price!</li>
            <li> One month i even did it three times just out of the sure hope that something would happen but it never did!</li>
            <li> And now I have to pay shipping on top of that just to get a refund!</li>
            <li> and I do LOVE my Tria!  </li>
            <li> And again, after time to time maintenance, it will get better!  </li>
            <li> I will wait until technology gets better!</li>
            <li> MOST of the hairs just slid out!  </li>
            <li> The better it works!  </li>
            <li> Well, by giving it more time, I also lost the opportunity to return it because it went over the days for their return policy!</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did!  </li>
            <li> I love Tria!  </li>
            <li> and I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> I LOVE MY TRIA!  </li>
            <li> I think a couple more zaps and shaving is done!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> First and foremost - laser hair removal is NOT permanent people!!!!  </li>
            <li> so the results were supposed to be amazing.   </li>
            <li> It is amazing</li>
            <li> The results are AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I still shave after a year of use, but the hair is so greatly reduced that it&#x27;s no longer a huge deal.    </li>
            <li> This system is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how we can stand to let someone else do it, but I&#x27;ll never hold this thing to my armpit again.</li>
            <li> The choices are amazing.</li>
            <li> So, after mulling it over for a day I emailed the customer service department just explaining (nicely) what I thought of the experience.  </li>
            <li> My own experience:    </li>
            <li> And you have to be honest about the areas you want to remove....</li>
            <li> and I just don&#x27;t have that kind of time.  </li>
            <li> I honestly did not see results at all.</li>
            <li> , I am considering going in for one of my own.    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m THRILLED with the results.</li>
            <li> Throw in 20 minutes for underarms and another 30 for bikini, and I was spending 6 evenings doing Tria--I don&#x27;t have that kind of time.</li>
            <li> Then I started using it on my bikini area, in the privacy of my own home, at my own convient time.</li>
            <li> OWNING MY own system, it&#x27;s MINE to keep; using it when I want to-</li>
            <li> I started out on level 2-3 and after a bit, the area kind of adjusts to the prickling/heat sensation.   </li>
            <li> A glass of wine or motrin kind of helped too.  </li>
            <li> TO SPEND USING THE PRODUCT IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE EFFECTIVE.</li>
            <li> , i really liked it</li>
            <li> Hairs that have been treated will stop growing noticeably almost immediately and will shed on their own within two weeks.    </li>
            <li> I liked to pluck the hairs with a tweezer after lasering them.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt and I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work until now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product and it works, but there must be a problem with the battery.</li>
            <li> Seems to be marginally effective on coarser hair (makes it finer, but not gone).  </li>
            <li> does not recommend using it on your face but to be honest</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s your own fault if you don&#x27;t research the product.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t want you &#x27;sharing&#x27; and not spending the money to buy your own...</li>
            <li> I own and used this product for a strict 5 months.</li>
            <li> Like others, I found it to be moderately effective.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairy beast and it is so nice to know I have a way to get rid of it,</li>
            <li> I own this unit.</li>
            <li> I purposely segregated my bikini area into 2 zones, so I could test how effective the laser was.  </li>
            <li> I was so worried that I woul have some kind of bumps from this as I always get those razor and plucking bumps that are aweful.</li>
            <li> I have the kind of hair recommended to be used in this device.</li>
            <li> I set up a nice calendar reminder of dread on my phone to stay on track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hear that is spectacular.</li>
            <li> AND THEY ARE NOW OWNERS OF THEIR OWN TRIA.</li>
            <li> We own the market.</li>
            <li> and I can do this in the comfort of my own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it perfectly on schedule and very diligently.</li>
            <li> I have the right hair/skin combo for the product (very fair skinned with brown hair) but it made no difference.  </li>
            <li> However, for the attentive, well informed buyer, this can be a very effective product.</li>
            <li> Getting a laser technician that is trained, competent, experienced, hygienic (and makes you feel comfortable during treatment) can be very challenging.</li>
            <li> just can&#x27;t beat being able to do your own laser hair treatment in the privacy of your own home at your own convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value</li>
            <li> The Silk&#x27;n devices have a \\&quot;raised rectangle\\&quot; on the heads that leaves a temporary impression on your skin that makes it very easy to see where you just treated</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS VERY EASY TO USE</li>
            <li> If your skin is darker or too tan - check the chart on TRIA&#x27;s website to make sure it will be safe for you to use...dark skin can burn!  </li>
            <li> It is easier to use, faster and more effective.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see the fastest, most effective results.</li>
            <li> My opinion is that it works best on people who are not too hairy to begin with or who have already received professional treatments.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and light brown arm pit hair and bikini hair.  </li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t done a touch up, even at the old price, it was the best investment of 2009.</li>
            <li> (I still have to shave my underarms too, but it&#x27;s very fine and sparse hair.)  </li>
            <li> Some great, some not so great and at various salons which will remain nameless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Tria laser was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> it sounds too good to be true</li>
            <li> very comfortable Works</li>
            <li> The packaging is really nice and instructions are easy to follow.  </li>
            <li> For many months I pondered whether to take a chance on this product because it seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I begun using it right away, it&#x27;s not painful, very good start up with the registration and all you can learn at that moment.</li>
            <li> This box is HUGE!</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> BE ABLE TO DO IT AT HOME</li>
            <li> A thinner hair just means more pulses are needed to remove it again, if it can be removed at all.</li>
            <li> and I think she enjoys doing the laser herself. :)</li>
            <li> Okay from what I understand I&#x27;m supposed to use tria in the beginning</li>
            <li> i think maybe it would be more if the pain was more tolerable.</li>
            <li> [i tend to speed through legs because those hurt the most]</li>
            <li> This type of laser ONLY works best on lighter skin tones with darker hair growth.  </li>
            <li> I will keep using it, but most LPL laser literature that I have read states you will see most hair removal at 8 months.  </li>
            <li> I was dissapointed many times by reviews I read when people said it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been the most diligent about doing it on the recommended schedule</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I walked out of more than one facility because they did not have a satisfactory answer or looked at me with puzzlement when I asked this question.</li>
            <li> important point about LHR (of any kind).</li>
            <li> the Infini&#x27;silk is more than adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no cheating or shortcuts that will cause these devices to magically work.</li>
            <li> Make sure that your skin and hair colors will work with them, follow the protocol, and you will get results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it has has changed my life for the better.</li>

            <li> If you have more hairs, those 30 minutes would be 45.  </li>
            <li> She also has more hair than me and has been using a lower setting though.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 9 months now and have mostly stuck to the schedule that they suggest.</li>
            <li> With this, I&#x27;ve been able to do those areas as well.    </li>
            <li> and the results are OK.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try, and am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say for sure that I&#x27;m getting any results there.  </li>
            <li> What happens is that after so many pulses the battery needs to be recharged.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than pleased with the tria laser:)</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s better now.</li>
            <li> and if I was more dedicated, I am sure I&#x27;d get a better result.</li>
            <li> but now find even at the top setting</li>
            <li> I experience redness longer than most-</li>
            <li> so the Tria can \\&quot;see\\&quot; the follicles better.</li>
            <li> She signed so many disclaimers</li>
            <li> the more you use it</li>
            <li> okay on medium&lt;</li>
            <li> But if you have the money to buy the Tria, make sure you can return it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I wanted to do some touch-ups, lower legs, and, for lack of a better phrase, go farther on the bikini line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice more (every two weeks) and the results just keep getting better.  </li>
            <li> To me- it&#x27;s been remarkable at HOW much hair has STOPPED growing!</li>
            <li> I was also able to do both underarms and the bikini line on one charge.</li>
            <li> I was able to do the lower leg in about 25-30 minutes and the underarm in about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I waited for the newer one.</li>
            <li> It seems the darker and coarser the hair, the more it hurts.</li>
            <li> I recommend turning it to level 5 and testing it on the top of your foot to get some practice in</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been 4 weeks yet, but I am hoping to see a lot more hair loss soon.   </li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t hurt any more on my tanner skin than on my lighter skin areas).  </li>
            <li> To make sure I get my legs thoughouly, I started lining them with an orange highlighter.</li>
            <li> it looks soo much better when i shave now</li>
            <li> YOU&#x27;LL LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps. :)</li>
            <li> so I would probably have much better results if I were more diligent.</li>
            <li> You need to be committed to doing it and be able to deal with some pain.</li>
            <li> If you can get Otto level 5 kudos to you and it will work that much better.</li>
            <li> I am actually glad that it hurts in a way, it makes me feel like it is working :-)  </li>
            <li> I couldnt stand it on many areas.  </li>
            <li> More to follow....    </li>
            <li> If there is any resistance, stop pulling and laser some more.</li>
            <li> You will need to continue periodic treatments for a year or more to catch hairs that cycle from dormant to the growth phase.    </li>
            <li> Make sure you overlap as the instructions say for maximum effectiveness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, with that being said, I still LOVE laser hair removal</li>
            <li> I really do love it.  </li>
            <li> some wirery chin hairs that are noooo more.</li>
            <li> I love this lazer..</li>
            <li> Too many of these reviews are from the marketing department.</li>
            <li> It hurts more then waxing or threading.</li>
            <li> As for the battery life, I am able to do my pits and bikini line on \\&quot;1\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but i still have 6 more months.</li>
            <li> (means more pain)  </li>
            <li> After reading several reviews I am not so impressed w/ Tria or in unloading $400 for one.</li>
            <li> More started growing</li>
            <li> I was getting more and more depressed about it.  </li>
            <li> but I am mostly concerned withmy face.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed when I was helping with the shedding that alot of the pores had more than one hair.  </li>
            <li> I want to make sure it is working.  </li>
            <li> The darker and thicker the hair, the more it will hurt.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t suffer any more for any longer than you have too.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am impressed with the product overall.  </li>
            <li> more time\\</li>
            <li> /&gt;Customer Service was great, they were very knowledgeable, and patiently answered each question.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and if you can commit to the usage time, you will love it!&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> OK, just received my Tria laser.  </li>
            <li> I could not even feel level 1 or 2, so I jumped to level 3, and I still couldn&#x27;t feel most of it.  </li>
            <li> It works at the salons faster, better, and longer.</li>
            <li> I never think twice about my bikini line if I put on a swimsuit or about my underarms in a tank top.</li>
            <li> My skin was w/in the safe range of tones</li>
            <li> Tria customer service was more than not helpful ...</li>
            <li> I love it :)</li>
            <li> I used it for more than 6 months for the set amount of times</li>
            <li> product is so well advertised that is extremely believable, but in actuality, it does not work t all.</li>
            <li> I suppose most of the questions made sense, they want to know your skin tone, the areas you are going to laser, the color of your hair.</li>
            <li> but I must say that I used it more often and more aggressively than the instructions say to use it.  </li>
            <li> but I am so glad I did each time the hair comes in</li>
            <li> Of course this is all on level 5, because it is my belief that when you go to war, you better go in with the guns blazin&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Keep checking for more updates to this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update November 2013:  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have more time.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> I use Tria on 5 power (highest) and find I have to do many treatments to get rid of most of the hair.</li>
            <li> how it works &#x3D;) please read reviews as I doit for almost evry thing I buy.</li>
            <li> so glad that I got it.</li>
            <li> I had to save but ok.</li>
            <li> love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> but this is just my opinion I had so many freaking</li>
            <li> but this is much more conviniant</li>
            <li> I have so many areas to manage, I would just use it as I watched TV.</li>
            <li> I asked to speak to a supervisor who suggested I might need more treatments.</li>
            <li> know it&#x27;s not defective as it sure does hurt like hell, and it SURE did work when I accidentally zapped a tattoo on my wrist...</li>
            <li> The newest tria is better because you can hold it against your skin and continue along skin, so you don&#x27;t forget which areas you have already treated.</li>
            <li> I am able to to treat areas at a level 4.</li>
            <li> I do level 3, as that level burns more on these areas (even on level 3).</li>
            <li> In conjunction with ice packs (the ones you pack in your child&#x27;s lunch boxes), I was able to tolerate the pain.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results but it took a lot prep work and conscientious effort to arrive at this conclusion.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> - (OK I get this</li>
            <li> Finally \\&quot;greater hair density\\&quot; hu?  </li>
            <li> AND it had a greater density than hair</li>
            <li> We are going to return it and instead consider  NoNo but will do much more</li>
            <li> /&gt;i ve stopped doing my sessions justy to make sure if the growth would come</li>
            <li> Glad it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I love it .</li>
            <li> It was an interesting experiment though...</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> ALSO MORE OFTEN THAN THE RECCOMENDED</li>
            <li> Bought the Tria machine 9 months ago, LED screen went out, machine was still working.&lt;br /&gt;Waited 80 days, after many calls to company, was told I tried to take apart, which I didn&#x27;t, but they could not repair, but I could repurchase another one for $200.</li>
            <li> I use customers&#x27; review the most when making a decision about a purchase online.</li>
            <li> My body hair was too light for this to be effective...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on setting 2, anything more than that stings quite a bit, and there is no hair reduction that I can tell.</li>
            <li> In my experience it&#x27;s OK to use the Tria laser on your chin but never get close to your eyes.</li>
            <li> Now my legs are smooth and the skin quality is amazing, as if hair never was there.</li>
            <li> and it starts working on finer hairs as my face has had many of those.</li>
            <li> The important points to remember is that you must fall within the hair color and skin pigment scale that this laser will be effective for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product Design: 3 stars out of 5.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Weight: 3 stars out of 5.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life: 3 stars out of 5.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recharge Time: 3 stars out of 5.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Noise Level: 3 stars out of 5.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would love to return the item and  have my money refunded.  </li>
            <li> Ive never been able to wear a baseball hat or a ponytail because the hair would be off</li>
            <li> love, love, love this product and have already recommended it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please do a better job of making sure your customers are fully informed before they order a product.  </li>
            <li> but then decided to get more aggressive with the treatments.  </li>
            <li> I AM ABLE TO TOLERATE LEVEL 5 FOR ALL AREAS BEING TREATED JUST AS YOU ARE INSTRUCTED TO DO.  </li>
            <li> I AM GOING TO DO ONE MORE TREATMENT</li>
            <li> I am so glad I took the risk to order this as it saves me having to drive an hour to a laser hari removal spa.  </li>
            <li> &quot; just tweezed the hair out &amp; you end up with courser hair and more hair than you started with.  </li>
            <li> I used it on the highest setting most of the time, knowing that even though it hurt more, this was supposed to be more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt; on more than one grade&lt;</li>
            <li> Ok so I have read ALL of the reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> The darker your hair the better.</li>
            <li> Hello, When I boot up this machine, it ask to press the power button till count to 6, I follow the step of guide, but the machine shows error, and I reboot many time they alway shows error, what can I do?</li>
            <li> This would be more affordable.</li>
            <li> I treated 2 more times and the hair is gone (4 months now with no shaving.)  </li>
            <li> I bought this thing for a gift and the person is really satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m like - ok</li>
            <li> me 2 years to be able to pronounce myself YES</li>
            <li> If I am happy with my machine for the whopping original price of $1,000 the price they are selling it for now is absolutely worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Overall, I LOVE THE TRIA!!!</li>
            <li> so i have a pretty good tolerance for pain, but this thing hurts.</li>
            <li> The TRIA might take a while to work fully, but honestly I&#x27;d buy it at full price for the results I see now.</li>
            <li> controls are very easy and straightforward.</li>
            <li> I am already excited about my hairless underarms!</li>
            <li> I am already excited about my hairless underarms!</li>
            <li> I really happy with my new device.  </li>
            <li> Bought it new, but wasn&#x27;t totally happy.  </li>
            <li> but our thiker hair needs more sessions, its really easy to use and even the instruction book helped me understand it more easily.    </li>
            <li> have called a couple times just to ask questions, and they are always really helpful and pleasant, which i appreciate, as the&lt;br</li>
            <li> Afteryou treat it with the laser, you will be able to pull the hair out of your skin with a tweezer (or even your fingers) and it will easily slip out of the skin as it will no longer be attached at the root.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda easy to use, safe</li>
            <li> I have bought Lumea Philips, which really gives me good results, mostly on my face and legs.</li>
            <li> Tria&#x27;s product is, at best, on par with other companies&#x27; product that demonstrate much greater concern for their customers, their reputation, and the environment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;According to many forums and friends, the Tria hair laser works better than my experience, so hoping that my original was somehow defective, I contacted Tria and they were very easy to work with; they sent a replacement quickly.</li>
            <li> My use on the rest of my body got more infrequent as time went on, but there&#x27;s a huge reduction in hair on all areas mentioned- 80-90%, I would say.    </li>
            <li> So far, I am happy with this purchase, and will try to remember to update.  </li>
            <li> I went ahead and bought it anyway, because laser hair removal (professional) worked well for me before and the idea of using it at home sounded great.  </li>
            <li> so the Tria has a harder job to do and therefore, you will not get the best results either.  </li>
            <li> The crack of her ass has been as smooth as glass since she started using this--no more crack hairs to worry about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the TRIA laser for one month now and so far I&#x27;m happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> The skin is silky smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> For my legs, I was able to comfortably use the level 4 power setting and around the bikini area a level 3 without discomfort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that I will be hair free after three more treatments.</li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;m getting great results with the Tria.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li> Too much money for not getting good results.</li>
            <li> Get a good razor until the technology can really be counted on.  </li>
            <li> But if you are determined and don&#x27;t mind, it really could be a good decision.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy with results, and I&#x27;ll start on my legs probably very soon for summertime.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product---it would be great for other girls with my problem.</li>
            <li> Pain can easily be managed using an ice pack (best choice) or emla cream (not very useful alone).</li>
            <li> Love it, totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Excited to see more results as I continue to use the TRIA Laser Hair Removal 4X&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> it easy to use and easy to carry.</li>
            <li> When we received it I have to admit it is easy to operate</li>
            <li> depleting the battery very very quickly.</li>
            <li> I think this is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I found the tria easy to use but as of now, I have had 3 treatments and found no results yet.  </li>

            <li> This may be fine for those with the most ideal skin tones, since most of the laser light can reach the follicle and hairs that are slightly visible after shaving help guide where to use the laser.</li>
            <li> By focusing on one grid at a time, it was easier to get full coverage and be sure of where I&#x27;d treated.  </li>
            <li> , dark hair root (not the hair color) are the perfect combination  How to reduce the pain.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly like the treatments in a salon, and is just as effective.  </li>
            <li> It is better to pay for a reputable, great yelp rated office because I figure with all the time and money spent it</li>
            <li> I have the perfect skin tone and hair type (light/olive skin and dark course hair)</li>
            <li> At the top setting, it&#x27;s not really bad.</li>
            <li> Amazon however did everything right and am very pleased by your quick response and refund.</li>
            <li> I was fine with that and decided it might just take longer for me.      </li>
            <li> just fine</li>
            <li> It works best on light skin with dark hair.</li>
            <li> try.&lt;br /&gt;I seemed to work fine for about a minute or so</li>
            <li> The 90 day return period sounds good, but doesn&#x27;t really give a true indication.</li>
            <li> I am a good candidate for using this type of hair removal, as I have fair skin and dark hair.  </li>
            <li> My freckles were fine and did not burn at all.</li>
            <li> and it was fine- no redness or bumps.</li>
            <li> My doctor then gave me the go-ahead for hair removal and said it should work just fine for</li>
            <li> AND IT IS COMPLETELY FINE.  </li>
            <li> AND IT IS ALSO FINE.  </li>
            <li> My skin tans easily and my hair sun bleaches to a light honey brown in the summer.</li>
            <li> I am the perfect canidate, light skin, dark hair.  </li>
            <li> and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> was fine, highest setting was pinching quite a bit</li>
            <li> the Infini&#x27;silk is more than adequate.    </li>
            <li> I have a quick fix for it ladies (also works when you wax your brows!)-</li>
            <li> So, I quickly returned it through Amazon (Love the service).</li>
            <li> thats ok because after I shave I use the lazer treatement it is quick and painless.</li>
            <li> This Hair removal laser is easy to use and provides great results with simple instructions.</li>
            <li> I ordered it because of the good ratings and the salons really add up quickly for laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> It does feel like rubber bands are snapping at it, some spots are more sensitive than others, but I love this thing!</li>
            <li> easily so I was excited for that reason too.</li>
            <li> I have seen a HUGE difference in my under arm hair.  </li>
            <li> and I will update the review over the course of treatments to accurately reflect its quality.  </li>
            <li> I can now go 2 weeks without shaving my lower legs which is huge for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also hugely time consuming.</li>
            <li> And I am not hair free.</li>
            <li> I bought the advanced \\&quot;new\\&quot; version, with 5 levels.</li>
            <li> I waited for a satin smooth res-q pain relief product to arrive.    </li>
            <li> I have brown hair and light skin.  </li>
            <li> If you think this will be a problem for you, you might consider if the greater expense of the Silk&#x27;n might be worth it for your needs.   </li>
            <li> Tria is a great product that I have extensively used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic for the nose hairs because that part of your skin never sees the sun, and so that is my whitest skin and darkest hair.</li>
            <li> The laser has done a fantastic job in that area.    </li>
            <li> So I am happy that after only 1 1/2 months I am noticing some improvement.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my upcoming wedding and overall am happy I did.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m wearing skirts, showing off these legs that haven&#x27;t seen the light of day in years.     </li>
            <li> This is important as after waiting hours for the tria to charge up again you lose your place.</li>
            <li> I searched the uswoop and groupon deals for months hoping to find something ridiculously cheap.   </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s why we can get it cheaply.</li>
            <li> I used it as recommended on my bikini area on the highest or 2nd to highest setting and I am happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> This is borne out by the specifications if you look on any credible hair removal website as well as reviews from people who used it and then eventually *stopped* using it.</li>
            <li> and it is not critical to remove it, but it is great for touch up.     </li>
            <li> I purchased the Tria about 3 years ago when it just became available in the US.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for smooth skin with no re-growth of the hair.  </li>
            <li> It needs more power.it doesnt worth a try.and</li>
            <li> So, if you shaved before, your hair root might be light color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done my arms 3 times and they are almost smooth.  </li>
            <li> You can do your whole body for $400 at your own pace.  </li>
            <li> Tria cheerfully replaced the product in 2 weeks for mail time with free shipping both ways.  </li>
            <li> , if it breaks after a year don&#x27;t expect a free replacement because that&#x27;s their warranty period.</li>
            <li> , they give you a free one year warranty, which is standard.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> It does feel like you&#x27;ve been lightly snapped with a rubber band.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t always get a smooth stubble-free shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve had laser hair removal several times and it works great with my skin/hair color (medium/olive tone and brown hair).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t enjoy wasting money</li>
            <li> but this is still relevant).</li>
            <li> If you sound like me, buy this thing.</li>
            <li> I am hair free.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> These points were not listed on information available when you place your order.</li>
            <li> Since I am light skin, I have to look closely for bald hair areas.  </li>
            <li> To shed some light on whether or not you should try it, here&#x27;s an explanation as to how these devices work and whether or not it will work for you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After charging close to $600 for the product they use one of the slowest shipping methods available to process returns and warranties.</li>
            <li> I was able to use the product once, and thought although time consuming to use, will be worth it if the product does what is says.  </li>
            <li> so it is very cost effective in that sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nonetheless I&#x27;m pleased with the results on my hands and butt, so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought the Tria in 2011 ( about a year ago) and have used it primarily on my face</li>
            <li> and I have light skin.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that I now have some smooth &amp; hairy patches on my neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Laser hair removal has become more affordable and you can buy packages on groupon etc for actual laser, which is more effective.</li>
            <li> I have no dount that I will be hair free in the recommended 3 months of treatment.</li>
            <li> I did not expect to have my skin NOT feel smooth &amp; silky despite of exfoliating before lasering, and creaming &amp; lotioning after.  </li>
            <li> Is it cheap?</li>
            <li> Works great, takes several times.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t make you hair free in 6 months as they claim, but it does work.  </li>
            <li> All accessories available.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;NoNo does not look so good as far as reviews</li>
            <li> I know some have mentioned that the battery life eventually wears out, but in comparison to the cost of professional treatments, I still think the Tria is a good value.</li>
            <li> Best price on the net the item work very well .</li>
            <li> I was soooooooo excited to be hair free when I ordered this</li>
            <li> I have first to let you all girls know that I did a professional laser treatment in my lower legs with incredible success.</li>
            <li> I originally thought I&#x27;d do my treatments while watching a movie, but when the fan turns on, I have to turn up the sound on the t.v. which can be distracting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a wonderful, highly trained technician with multiple training certifications and significant experience with a state of the art machine.</li>
            <li> I had a wonderful, highly trained technician with multiple training certifications and significant experience with a state of the art machine.</li>
            <li> that is much more honest, since in reality I have learned that even professional laser hair removal is NOT permanent....unless you are lucky.  </li>
            <li> I was in shock the first time I got a \\&quot;red\\&quot; no-go light, but also pleased that I&#x27;d gotten over winter.</li>
            <li> Nice n bare n smooth!</li>
            <li> Also very easy to use - I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> and she love it so much ,and it is easy to use</li>
            <li> Original review:      </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are some significant differences between the two Infini&#x27;silk devices.</li>
            <li> There are some significant differences between the two Infini&#x27;silk devices.</li>
            <li> The untreated leg has significant stuble.  </li>
            <li> This system is well worth the price I paid already!</li>
            <li> And since I bought the original over 18 months ago, the replacement isn&#x27;t under warranty.      </li>
            <li> probably about 75% of the original # of follicles</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Defiantly worth it!</li>
            <li> When I called the company, the customer service representative was neither helpful nor friendly.</li>
            <li> Over all, so far I am very pleased with my purchase and am even happier with its cost savings compared to going to a salon.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working, after 3 treatments I didn&#x27;t notice any hair loss-</li>
            <li> I started reading some of the higher 4 stars reviews and most of them say \\&quot;I&#x27;ve just started using it</li>
            <li> and I believe that I see a significant reduction in hair numbers.  </li>
            <li> WORTH it!</li>
            <li> br /&gt;i m a long time user of tria and am so happy i purchased it ..</li>
            <li> I was sooo excited to receive this.</li>
            <li> but I think its worth waiting because it will be improved!</li>
            <li> all it does work for me really happy with the money time and effort that the Tria L.H.R gives me, one thing is that you have to have really dark hair for it to work and medium to light skin tone if not the system has a lock that if you dont have the right skin tone it wont unlock that means that you would not be able to use it, its not recomended that you do if it dosent unlock.</li>
            <li> I have heard but cannot confirm that actual lasers are more effective than IPL, which this Tria is.</li>
            <li> I use it on the highest setting, which is pain-free if you are totally clean shaven.  </li>
            <li> for me it&#x27;s more of an investment to spend what seems to be a lot, $395 for multiple sessions at your own privacy and convienence rather than $300 per session at an office.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done both and would recommend this since you&#x27;re able to direct it to all the areas you need LHR, use it as you need it, and it&#x27;s one cost for a year or more of treatment.</li>
            <li> These areas may have more sensitive skin, a darker tone and/or a greater hair density and using the TRIA there</li>
            <li> I can see that nipples or genitals would be more sensitive skin but would not think the outer ear or chin would be more &#x60;sensitive\\&quot; than an underarm.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while I would shave to get the light whispy blond hairs that you don&#x27;t really notice grow until you get rid of all your dark ones :D  </li>
            <li> You aren&#x27;t going to see perfect results after a year of use, but if you&#x27;re consistent over a few years, you&#x27;ll begin to take for granted the fact that you are so maintenence free.  </li>
            <li> At first, the results were really good, so I kept on using it until I finished the 6 month period to make sure it would last.  </li>
            <li> To gather this data, the original suggestion of epilating prior to using TRIA should not be followed, since the best way to check if TRIA is working is to use tweezers, or even your fingers to check if the hair can be easily removed several seconds after finishing the series of pulses.    </li>
            <li> But I certainly didnt expect to pay more money to find another solution at this point at time</li>
            <li> I am more than pleased with this product and highly recommend it to anyone with skin/hair type like mine, who wants to get rid of any unwanted hair!</li>
            <li> This is going to be a huge confidence booster &amp; already worth every dolloar in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> months!This is going to be a huge confidence booster &amp; already worth every dolloar in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and you can feel something, but it is too early to tell just how effective it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only as good as the operator.  </li>
            <li> medical spas, I have had superior results with Pulsed Diode Lasers.</li>
            <li> &quot; results with true Laser hair removal and \\&quot;good\\&quot; results with IPL.</li>
            <li> &quot; results with true Laser hair removal and \\&quot;good\\&quot; results with IPL.</li>
            <li> So just doing my lower legs was a full weekend project.  </li>
            <li> It contains the same lidocaine and the aloe is good for you.</li>
            <li> I love that it works fast and in the privacy in my home.</li>
            <li> At an office using a diode laser just for a full Brazilian bikini</li>
            <li> However,  my initial impressions of the product are good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to manage a full underarm treatment for that reason.</li>
            <li> Not painful anymore.  </li>
            <li> Amazon won&#x27;t give you a full refund after one month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless of if it&#x27;s ultimately effective, I&#x27;d recommend people go to a professional for legs.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of questions about optimum timing and the strength of the laser ( e.g. is it possible that the strength of the pulse is continually decreasing with use?)&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> I had to use it full strength to get results.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t think it will take much more.  </li>
            <li> Just to be free of that mirror and tweezers was worth $395.  </li>
            <li> A product that costs this much money should have WAY better reviews.</li>
            <li> If anyone wants the hair gone and on a budget, then  your better off going to groupon or livingsocial and getting a deal on a package.</li>
            <li> &amp; I mostly stayed in the house for 3-4 straight</li>
            <li> a peek at my full review here:  </li>
            <li> but much more easier to shave much much</li>
            <li> but if you really whant the hair to be gone its better to doit on.</li>
            <li> In my own experience if you&#x27;re overlapping correctly it takes one complete charge to do each lower leg.</li>
            <li> but as promised it really is permanent ..:)</li>
            <li> The product is true to its advertising and claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> almost Snow White, fair skin.  </li>
            <li> Am the ideal pale skin/dark hair candidate.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that the more hair you lose, the less it hurts.</li>
            <li> I am the right demographic for the system (light skin, darker hair), so I can&#x27;t say it didn&#x27;t work because of that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a risk to buy because you don&#x27;t know if your hair will be the right fit.</li>
            <li> I wish people wouldn&#x27;t give decent reviews until they&#x27;ve tried it for many months.    </li>
            <li> The method of testing ease of removal seems to be the most reliable way to know how many pulses are needed, but currently for meother areas have priority.    </li>
            <li> It will only do 1-2 pulses and will not do any more unless you plug it in again where it will tell you it is Recharged but AGAIN will not do more than 2 Pulses.  </li>
            <li> I have been told by more than one facility, that not too many people ask the questions I ask, such as \\&quot;How</li>
            <li> Because of it&#x27;s tiny area, you needso many more zaps--</li>
            <li> I was pregnant</li>
            <li> Also fewer hair follicles meant my pits didn&#x27;t get ripe as quickly as before.</li>
            <li> but that is where my hair is the darkest, the most dense, and the most coarse.</li>
            <li> Purchased a Tria Laser in April 2011; it was no longer working at all by April 2012 ( started losing the charge quickly by January).</li>
            <li> Probably, since it takes more than 30 days to see results but most electronics only have 1 year warranties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also if you decide to take a break in between body parts, the system charges rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to see results but it wasn&#x27;t fast enough for me.</li>
            <li> It is important for potential buyers to be honest with themselves about their hair and skin coloring.</li>
            <li> I have some pigment in my skin &amp; couldn&#x27;t get a super close shave for some reason</li>
            <li> and I saw significant reduction right away.</li>
            <li> I give 4 stars because I like it and have high expectations but won&#x27;t know for sure until I&#x27;ve completed the regimen.</li>
            <li> Im glad I bought this, despite the high cost, because it works.</li>
            <li> I have had laser treatments done by a doctor on the bikini area &amp; was able to withstand high levels but with the Tria</li>
            <li> BUT I NOTICE SOME SMALL ONE ALREADY , VERY GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I have black hair and beige skin, so it&#x27;s pretty close to ideal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a genuine review based on my first hand experience with the Tria and Veet products and my accumulated knowledge of LHR.</li>
            <li> This is a genuine review based on my first hand experience with the Tria and Veet products and my accumulated knowledge of LHR.</li>
            <li> And I hope you are a very very very patient person!</li>
            <li> used it often and found that it works great on dark hair</li>
            <li> I am very consistent, so I will have to wait and see.</li>
            <li> I advanced to level 4.. for first day.  </li>
            <li> I believe that it is important for users to know that the higher power settings will bring about faster results.</li>
            <li> I have also been using the tria laser on my legs, but sporadically since it takes so long, and have not seen good results.  </li>
            <li> Not as easy to use as it says and very high priced.  </li>
            <li> This is a great gift for Black Friday or for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Newest lasers have a great cooling system for less pain.</li>
            <li> but this laser work on the correct skin tipe, in only 3 treatments even the first one I saw good reluts that I saw at a Laser Hair Removal Clinic</li>
            <li> easy purchase thanks for the service</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and dark hair, so I fit the profile of people for whom it should work.</li>
            <li> For the first eight weeks it really worked well, I was pleased and thought I was seeing results on level 3.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to use my Tria for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I saw significant results after the first three months.  </li>
            <li> I am not hair free, but since the hair reduction is so significant I just have to highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice size, it covers more area than typical at-home lasers for hair removal.</li>
            <li> I have had more treatments than is typical because my esthetician believes I have PCOS-will this product still be effective for me?</li>
            <li> For areas like my thighs, which have very light, soft blond hair, this product doesn&#x27;t work nor did I expect it to.</li>
            <li> First of all, many of these reviews on here are of the older model.</li>
            <li> And, it is equally important to be realistic about the time frame for realizing the true results of the product.</li>
            <li> I am happy to share my hard earned knowledge with others and I do this freely.</li>
            <li> I am happy to share my hard earned knowledge with others and I do this freely.</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair and light olive skin, so I seemed to be a good candidate.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to read all the positive reviews and</li>
            <li> I have a \\&quot;Tria\\&quot; (Pulsed Diode Laser) and now both, a \\&quot;Veet Infini&#x27;silk PRO\\&quot; and a \\&quot;Veet Infini&#x27;silk\\&quot; made by \\&quot;Silk&#x27;n\\&quot; (Intense Pulsed Light &#x3D; IPL) for at-home hair removal.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not comfortable doing laser treatments at a medspa this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> its only been 2 months and already they look amazing. .</li>
            <li> While the most popular review by \\&quot;work of life\\&quot; was fairly accurate, she left out the ENORMOUS FAULTS of this device.</li>
            <li> And it has more of a bite than when you go to get it done professionally.</li>
            <li> Whether or not the TRIA laser is effective depends on several factors&amp;#8212;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227;</li>
            <li> i honestly did not think it would work but to my surprise, my hair has been reduced after only two months of use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put 5 stars because I have personally seen the Tria be effective, but this is not a review.</li>
            <li> I started LHR in my early 20s and have experienced all forms of Laser Hair Removal (LHR) in medical settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The powerful equipment they use is not as fool-proof as the at-home devices are.</li>
            <li> And well worth the money, to me.</li>
            <li> What can I say beauty is a pain, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I was ready to dedicate my whole summer to the Tria treatment schedule, expecting it to take many months.</li>
            <li> I dont mind buying silkn bulbs as the speed and ease of using the silkn is worth it.</li>
            <li> Also, it says to use on a fresh shave.</li>
            <li> But so far I love it and it is just how I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to take longer because it&#x27;s not as powerful</li>
            <li> So for me, spending the money for that is totally worth it even though I still have to shave.</li>
            <li> Better off spending the money on professional treatment.</li>
            <li> After 30 days, my underarms are hair free and bikini line is nearly hair free.</li>
            <li> After a fair amount of research, including the OK from a relative who used to design medical devices and dealt with the FDA, I bought the Tria about a month ago.  </li>
            <li> The nerves are more sensitive.</li>
            <li> And their so called \\&quot;guarrentee\\&quot; isn&#x27;t worth anything.</li>
            <li> AND I rarely get ingrown hairs, which means that some of the tougher one are gone.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it to me though.  </li>
            <li> It is so worth it if it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Even if it isn&#x27;t permanent it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I was worried because of the cost of it, would it be worth it</li>
            <li> Until you&#x27;re completely done with treatments, you spend time shaving plus time using the TRIA &amp; you can&#x27;t save yourself time by using more long-lasting hair removal methods (i.e. waxing, plucking).&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hurt the most on the mons pubis (I think stubble &#x3D; intense pain) rather than hurting more the further in yougo.</li>
            <li> I thought the product worked well, however, I am just touching up a professional laser job on bikini and underarms.</li>
            <li> That sounds tolerable except that it both hurts more than going to a salon for a laser hair removal treatment AND the head is basically the size of your thumb which means it will take you forever to complete what ever area</li>
            <li> But it was well worth the time commitment.  </li>
            <li> but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have been embarrassed by it since I was in elementary school.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% worth it.</li>
            <li> will be worth it.  </li>
            <li> will be worth it.  </li>
            <li> But isn&#x27;t it worth it when you think of the chance of permanent hair removal????</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin for sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid for professional hair removal (LFR) and if you can afford it, it is more powerful.  </li>
            <li> The most you can get out of the machine is 22j and its fixed at 1cm.</li>
            <li> you are not really gonna get good results,</li>
            <li> Perhaps because the skin is more sensitive, or that these areas are darker.</li>
            <li> but until then I don&#x27;t see how anyone has any success with this.</li>
            <li> The product packaging is nicely designed and visually attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convenience: 5 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does hurt, though--not on the legs, but on the more sensitive areas like the bikini area and underarms.</li>
            <li> If it worked it would be worth the pain, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It did not even worth of s</li>
            <li> Go to a Spa, a Laser Center or good doctor.</li>
            <li> For $500 (the price I paid when I purchased) I would not at all say that is worth it.</li>
            <li> 100% worth it.</li>
            <li> had heard about laser hair removal and it sounded painless and seemed an exciting</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a high quality product, easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to get it activated with the skin test sensor (so only &#x27;appropriate&#x27; skin types can use the machine...darker skin types could burn) once you call the company to turn activate the unit for the first use.</li>
            <li> you have light skin and dark hair, the machine can \\&quot;find\\&quot; the pigment more easily and send energy all the way to the root.  </li>
            <li> So far I have been able to do complete full legs, underarms, bikini area (full), stomach, toes, fingers and lower arms on  full BATTERY.</li>
            <li> My advice is to focus more on where you want the hair gone most and then use the rest of the battery to do other areas.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough that it&#x27;s best to use a sharp razor and to shave right before using it.</li>
            <li> Instead of being excited, I was apprehensive about 3 weeks straight in a bikini.</li>
            <li> Overall Value: As long as your expectations are reasonable, the Tria provides excellent value for the money.</li>
            <li> I called up the customer service line hoping there was some unlock or advice they could give to help right away.  </li>
            <li> Right now, one is a pair of red-orange \\&quot;Bynovel Laser Eye Protection Safety Glasses\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I hope they reverse their decision and do the right thing...</li>
            <li> I tried it all over my body right away.  </li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> even right after i shave it</li>
            <li> would recommend this device to any woman suffering with this issue if you have the right hair and skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Why on earth, right?</li>
            <li> I start out with my right lower leg, then thigh, arm, then under arm.</li>
            <li> Instead of owning up to the issue they are unwilling to do right by their customers.</li>
            <li> I have to shave EVERY DAY &amp; it even leaves a shadow right after (eeewww).</li>
            <li> Although I need it right now</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and thick black hair which makes me an ideal user for all forms of Laser Hair Removal (LHR).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cause you can&#x27;t see them and if you do they look like normal fine body hair.  </li>
            <li> It is a pain to only be able to use it for 20 min on full power and have to wait another 3 hours for it to charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The directions warn not to go further than the bikini line, but the technology should be safe for a full Brazilian.</li>
            <li> I was able to do 4 on my bikini and 5 on my underarms without more than a slight discomfort.</li>
            <li> The charges are more than adequate for an entire setting of underarms and pubic region.  </li>
            <li> So my results may be seen more quickly than if you have a ton of hair or a different skin type.  </li>
            <li> However, because its been recommended by Good Housekeeping and countless other magazines, I am fairly confident that it will be worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used for the first time, pits and legs just for fun.  </li>
            <li> TRIA is worth it if you&#x27;re willing to put in the time and effort required.</li>
            <li> have dark hair and fair skin</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and dark hair.</li>
            <li> even more excited that I was an ideal hair removal candidate-  very light, pale skin and coarse, black</li>
            <li> The hair that does grow back is very fine.  </li>
            <li> Again, Tria cheerfully replaced the product and send me another brand new unit.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly keep at it to be hair-free by summer!</li>
            <li> I have tried them all - literally, all of them (purely laser, gel treatments, on skin, away from skin)!  </li>
            <li> I am pretty fair skinned with dark hair.  </li>
            <li> and I also get razor burn with more frequent shaving no matter how much I spend on quality razors and shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> According to the Tria website, I have the perfect skin and hair color combination for the laser and yet after 10 months and hours spent using the device I have seen absolutely no reduction in hair growth.</li>
            <li> So far so good, its only been 2 months</li>
            <li> The Tria is easy to use and the directions are clear.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and black hair.  </li>
            <li> If it wasnt so painful...or the laser area was bigger AND the battery was much better it would maybe be worth the money.</li>
            <li> Tria&#x27;s product would be great if the warranty was longer than 1 year (especially since I paid the $700 retail price in 2010), and they actually had helpful customer service.</li>
            <li> If you have light hair (or light roots), then the laser will not send enough energy through the hair to kill it at the root, and hence it will not work.  </li>
            <li> I would have had more success but note to the makers of TRIA, MAKE THE LASER BIGGER!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, but intense.</li>
            <li> I tried a few sessions at the dermatologists office (at $200 per session), and needed many more sessions to see a difference.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold, aim, and pulse and no little parts that you have to worry about keeping track of.  </li>
            <li> my sister who is also fair skinned with dark hair has not had as much rapid success as I have.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied since I had no higher expectations.</li>
            <li> Cordless is nice, but a long cord would allow convenient use with better, longer lasting</li>
            <li> The possibility of burns is very real</li>
            <li> I was very, very motivated.  </li>
            <li> A very intense heat that makes you automatically yank away.</li>
            <li> I guess I can now say I was blessed with a dark happy trail, because it&#x27;s nearly gone, and what has grown back is very fine.</li>
            <li> It takes a significant amount of repetition; it&#x27;s far from completely effective, and I have been using it on very dark hair with very pale skin which is the ideal condition.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product and was only able to use it once before it quit working.  </li>
            <li> but many (40~70%) regrew at a similar or thinner width.</li>
            <li> *First Update, 22 May 2011</li>
            <li> I Called customer Service and ask them to either a FIX the product or a simple REPLACEMENT and nothing more.</li>
            <li> First of all, you have to understand the why and how lasers work to remove hair.  </li>
            <li> First</li>
            <li> I am almost completely hair free.</li>
            <li> This would help future buyers make a more informed decision.  </li>
            <li> but this laser really does hurt!  </li>
            <li> and I had a whole body that needed treatments!</li>
            <li> and I had a whole body that needed treatments!</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> First, some background.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product and followed the directions exactly to unlock the device</li>
            <li> They suggest shaving first and then using the product.  </li>
            <li> Let me tell you that it has been 10 days since my first treatment</li>
            <li> Hairs are beginning to fall away and the skin is smooth and clear.  </li>
            <li> It really takes the whole weekend plus say monday and tuesday after work to get my full legs and bikini done.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using tria for about 3 months and so far I see fantastic results.</li>
            <li> I will update in 8months when the results are suppose to be evident.</li>
            <li> First of all, I still experience pain while using it no matter</li>
            <li> It might be ok for people wanting to do just under arms or bikini, but the charge only lasts about 20-30 minutes and at that rate, it took me 4 sessions just to do my lower legs.</li>
            <li> Leave laser hair removal to the professionals with the real machines!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize at first</li>
            <li> it was too intense for me!</li>
            <li> It really works and I noticed a difference after just one use!</li>
            <li> If you are willing to put in the time and effort, go for it.</li>
            <li> It stings quite a bit on the highest setting from the laser head getting hot.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time and here are my thoughts on it.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the product yesterday and completed the first treatment</li>
            <li> But as most people interested in the product, I was attracted by the overall cost benefit when compared to purchasing a series of treatments.  </li>
            <li> I am a man and purchased it for precisely that reason to deal with the stray hairs that the professional laser may have missed.  </li>
            <li> Everywhere else it pretty tolerable though</li>
            <li> It was just too hot, i tried it but could not take the heat.</li>
            <li> This IS worth the short-lived pain, if exessive hair bothers you so much like it did me.  </li>
            <li> But thank you Tria for making such a product available to anyone at  home!</li>
            <li> , I have to say that I do love the Tria because it actually does work as maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to get rid of most of the hair but what hair grows back to be lighter &amp; softer</li>
            <li> so I was interested in how this would work.  </li>
            <li> That said despite consistent and meticulous use, the results were just temporary.</li>
            <li> I used it today for the first time.</li>
            <li> I can not yet say whether or not it works because I just did the first treatment today.</li>
            <li> First off, it DOES hurt.</li>
            <li> once then had a medical emergency and was hospitilazed for a month and wasn&#x27;t able to use it anymore.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought it through Amazon instead of directly from Tria was for the Hassle Free return policy.</li>
            <li> When I first got it and wasn&#x27;t seeing results on the lighter settings, I sucked it up and tried the higher setting.</li>
            <li> That is one thing I am sorry to say but in most spots this thing HURTS!!!!  </li>
            <li> I was willing to take any pain to get rid of that.  </li>
            <li> On the chin I used a level 1 but could never do more than three pulses because the pain actually brought me to tears.</li>
            <li> On the upper lip, I was able to tolerate a 2, but again with tears.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as I saw on the TV</li>
            <li> First off, the system works...somewhat.  </li>
            <li> The occasional snap of pain more startled me than anything.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the time/money for more LHR in a different med spa - hence,</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t given up; next stop: electrolysis! :)</li>
            <li> The first time the battery charge diminished, I called customer service and they told me to charge the laser overnight.</li>
            <li> First the TRIA mentions nothing about shaving the area beforehand.</li>
            <li> The results were consistent in that there were NO results.</li>
            <li> My under arms are almost completely hair free.</li>
            <li> Also areas that had no hair in the first place now grow hair.</li>
            <li> First off, it hurts like hell.</li>
            <li> Like others have reported, feels like a hot rubber band popping your skin.  </li>
            <li> I will more than likely return the unit for another replacement; hopefully, it will be quicker</li>
            <li> I used the tria relgiously for the first 6 months - as instructed every TW0 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Although I was not as consistent, I have also used on my arms, bikini area, stomach, arms and toes and have also seen results there.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, the results were sub par at best.</li>
            <li> researched this item a lot before i bought and somehow i missed the part about having to shave the hair first.</li>
            <li> During the first session, it quit and had a \\&quot;error\\&quot; message.  </li>
            <li> &quot; and I waited for more than 3 months with regular treatment of every 2week</li>
            <li> Another issue is the battery, you can only zap about 1 sq/ft at the most, at its maximum power level before the laser shuts off and you have to recharge.</li>
            <li> fearing that first kiss instead of looking forward to it...</li>
            <li> The remaining hairs are extremely soft and light</li>
            <li> My first one after 5 months stopped holding a charge.</li>
            <li> probablyis the same amount of money (depending on how many body sections you want lasered).</li>
            <li> It is completely painless on light skin.</li>
            <li> so we will just stay a hairy family ;)</li>
            <li> Well if used properly you should not need to use it more than a year...  </li>
            <li> And after they receive it there is another up to 2 more WEEKS waiting period before they will process your return or get a replacement piece back out.</li>
            <li> A manager would not talk with me and the representative that I spoke with continued to spout the company line- \\&quot;out of warranty, just doing my job\\&quot; Do not buy this product unless you are willing to throw away $400.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> and you have to be consistent with the process.</li>
            <li> and then it wont hurt as much!</li>
            <li> I have used this product exactly as suggested by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I used it every 2 weeks like clockwork exactly as instructed on setting 5.</li>
            <li> After about a year I notice a couple tiny bald spots but for the most part I&#x27;m still just as hairy as before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say save your money for the always available groupon for laser done by a professional.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit -- there&#x27;s quite a sting on higher settings.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You know that feeling when you accidentally touch a scolding hot pot on the stove?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I REALLY hope this works!</li>
            <li> How sad that Tria can&#x27;t even repair its own product!!!</li>
            <li> So, you have to balance pain with the time investment you are willing to make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first started, I could get both legs done before the battery would need to be recharged.</li>
            <li> the risk.*&lt;br /&gt;It has been exactly 2 weeks since my 1st treatment.</li>
            <li> I used this machine consistently as directed for 4 months and saw no results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the cost as it was I couldnt purchase more sessions and the hair, because it wasnt all targeted, came back.</li>
            <li> I did the treatments exactly as they said to and the amount of times they said to but was  just not seeing any difference.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to cover enough area before having to charge it</li>
            <li> To make sure it worked I only started with one leg.  </li>
            <li> There is no doubt in my mind that the Tria works - and works really, really well!</li>
            <li> The first thing I want to point out is that a lot of people who said the Tria did not work also said that they had \\&quot;brownish\\&quot; hairs or \\&quot;fine\\&quot; hairs.</li>
            <li> Wish I had put the money towards a salon in the first place.</li>
            <li> ( he didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t shave first )</li>
            <li> I bought one of these about 9 months ago, used it exactly as directed from the first day</li>
            <li> After my first use on my underarms, I had virtually no regrowth.  </li>
            <li> but I am willing to put in the time because Tria works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m East Asian with thick black hair and fair skin, which is great for the top of my head but not so much on the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with my tria and if it gives out in a year I will order a new one the same day, if I still have hair to get rid of that is..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy the new model, I opted for the Gen 3 because it didn&#x27;t sound like there was much difference in the models.  </li>
            <li> Tria did replace it for no charge, but the new unit didn&#x27;t work any better than the old one.</li>
            <li> I have a high pain tollerance, but it hurt and seemed to get very hot at first.  </li>
            <li> WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li> They told me \\&quot;\\&quot;NO\\&quot; and told me I would have to PURCHASE a new one at the Full Retail Price.  </li>
            <li> so people wouldn&#x27;t see my new cool \\&quot;tattoo\\&quot; between charges.    </li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product because I have very course dark hair and pale skin which made me the perfect candidate for the Tria.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the instructions and personally I have a great attention to detail, borderline OCD, and I don&#x27;t have the patience to do every single square millimeter of skin as this thing requires, not once</li>
            <li> I believe for buyers who abide by the previous two suggestions, you will be very satisfied with this product just like I have been.</li>
            <li> It may be related to the particular light wavelengths, the light filter(s) on the cartridge,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s most appropriate for dealing with armpits, forearms, bikini, feet/toes, and while they say it&#x27;s not suitable for the face or neck</li>
            <li> I have very dark, thick, coarse hair and fair skin, which makes me an excellent candidate for laser hair removal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> there is fine, light and not much .</li>
            <li> you could also use a highlighter because it is important to overlap and make sure you are thorough to zap every little hair.</li>
            <li> Although pretty painful on the highest setting, I am seeing excellent results and am already about 90% hair free in the areas which I have treated.  </li>
            <li> It feels warm but other than that, no discomfort.   </li>
            <li> I conducted my own experiment on my legs due to the time involved to do them.  </li>
            <li> I like to use the Tria for quick spot treatments on new hairs on easy-to-see/ easy-to-reach areas.</li>
            <li> With Intense Pulsed Light, the areas I had professionally treated have regrown by about 50% over the years.</li>
            <li> keep some Visine Advanced Relief in the fridge and apply to clean, dry skin.</li>
            <li> Now have several test patches, which required as many as 6~8 pulses (with cooling prior and once during) for the targeted hairs to be easily removed with no resistance.  </li>
            <li> they are equal (Tria at highest setting) and if that&#x27;s any kind of measure of effectiveness vis-a-vis professional lasers</li>
            <li> BUT after only TWO treatments I noticed much more hair loss than the Tria and it was much faster to use.  </li>
            <li> You will be better off spending this money for a REAL hair removal procedure at your local beauty salon.</li>
            <li> If I could devote several days each month for 6-8 months to using TRIA I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s ok, but in real life I&#x27;m a full-time student &amp; work part-time.</li>
            <li> Then I discovered that there are similar products, for equal or lower prices, that offer replaceable \\&quot;pulse\\&quot; modules and, based on reviews, identical to superior performance.  </li>
            <li> I then decided I would just do my bikini area since it&#x27;s smaller and more reasonable</li>
            <li> Also at level 5 the charge doesn&#x27;t last the whole lower leg, more like 75%.</li>
            <li> It is a bit top heavy and the handle is comfortable, but</li>
            <li> I was very hopefully after reading positive reviews, but I now I am starting to suspect that most of these reviews have been written by paid marketers.     </li>
            <li> So far I am impressed, but unfortunately won&#x27;t know 100% for sure until probably a few more months if the Tria really does provide permanent hair removal.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to vastly underestimate how much time may be needed to permanently remove hairs using the TRIA!</li>
            <li> what degree of improvement those people with the positive reviews had.</li>
            <li> As a consumer, read up to see if your area and color is within the specifications the product claims will positively affect hair</li>
            <li> and they were overwhelmingly positive.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand where all of these positive reviews come from.</li>
            <li> I have no idea where any of the positive reviews would ever come from</li>
            <li> You will see positive results.</li>
            <li> It is pretty much fool proof.  </li>
            <li> away,&lt;br /&gt;you should be pretty much done by then anyway</li>
            <li> its pretty much useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a ripoff kids.</li>
            <li> so I pretty much know the pain and</li>
            <li> but I read the reviews first, after that i&#x27;m really suspicious now whether to buy it or</li>
            <li> and LHR is much more affordable now, but sadly, there is still no training or license required to operate or own one of these powerful lasers.</li>
            <li> and LHR is much more affordable now, but sadly, there is still no training or license required to operate or own one of these powerful lasers.</li>
            <li> The instructions said that you will see visible results in at least 3 months so I will have to post later results; My wife is pleased with the battery time since it holds quite a good charge.</li>
            <li> I got this system from QVC for three payments to complete full purchase price.  </li>
            <li> you can see the dark black dots, luckily this is the desirable condition for the laser to be most effective.</li>
            <li> but last week they offered another $50 off special!  </li>
            <li> If you are trying to completely remove even the smaller hairs, be sure to appropriately increase the number of pulses according to size of the hairs being treated as a smaller hair root both absorbs less heat and dissipates it more quickly between pulses.</li>
            <li> And what&#x27;s more, even if you withstand a full treatment of the area, it will have virtually no effect since not enough light is reaching the follicles despite a similar intensity working perfectly fine to remove hair on other areas of your body.</li>
            <li> preface, I have had about 12 sessions of professional laser hair removal on several parts of my body over the last 6 years (5 sessions every 6 weeks followed by touch ups - no hormone problems, I just have more hair than most women).</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s hard to part with almost $500 without hearing about some good results first, so here they are.</li>
            <li> After reading the people who said it doesn&#x27;t really work and the people who are writing positive reviews are being paid by the company, I wanted to put in my 2 cents on my positive experience.    </li>
            <li> Would that make that less effective?</li>
            <li> Very simple and easy to use instructions.</li>
            <li> but they admit is is less effective to blond hairs.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and cheaper than the multiple and not at all discrete spa vists.  </li>
            <li> When I started I was surprised how effortless and quick the results came, the pain was pretty mild, moderate along the bikini line, it got much better after the third session, you have to be patient!!</li>
            <li> 3~5 full-power pulses on a single hair takes a while if you&#x27;re not dedicated, even if it is mostly permanent.</li>
            <li> if a Tria employee reads this, is there any guarantee that the product will work, is there a certain warranty, will it be replaced if it breaks</li>
            <li> It does take time to cover large areas.  </li>
            <li> Considering the amount of times it must be recharged to finish a large area, 300 charges will eat up in no time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this: forget about using it for large areas, perhaps underarms, or</li>
            <li> I still see some hair if I look at a certain angle</li>
            <li> DO NOT KNOW IF I CAN USE IT ON CERTAIN PARTS OF MY BODY OR NOT.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just not efficient for large areas.</li>
            <li> works great use once a week hair is getting less and less shipped fast will be hair free in no time</li>
            <li> Maybe ther are more angled, which makes full exposure more difficult?</li>
            <li> I bought one of the very first TRIAs on the market directly from TRIA Beauty.  </li>
            <li> However, it is extremely effective on dark, coarse hair on light skin.</li>
            <li> Tria could have easily designed this into their product, eliminating many of the negative reviews and transforming my opinion of them.</li>
            <li> However, as my dark hair ladies will see - having light blond hairs grow in that you can&#x27;t see is SO worth over time!  </li>
            <li> Several of those, fine.  </li>
            <li> but they are so fine and blonde that the Tria won&#x27;t get those.  </li>
            <li> During the first session, you get all excited about using it and find out a couple weeks later that your hair growth hasn&#x27;t changed.</li>
            <li> But I think this would only work on light skin and dark hair, as the laser on the highest setting (5) kills only about 30% of my hair when following the directions perfectly.</li>
            <li> Using the Tria is very time-consuming for large areas - takes forever to do your legs</li>
            <li> It is not as strong as the professional devices for obvious reasons, but it does a good job at maintaining the results I got (it helps me zap those few unwanted hairs here and there).</li>
            <li> I would say to anyone interested in purchasing the product that you must be completely realistic about what you&#x27;re looking to achieve and what this sort of technology is capable of.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty high pain tolerance</li>
            <li> , my bikini hair is gone, a third of light fine underarm and lower leg hair is left, but I&#x27;m hopeful that too will soon be gone.</li>
            <li> It seems that the laser head gets very hot to the touch &amp; might be burning more than the actual laser; I have even tried letting it cool down for awhile before continuing.</li>
            <li> I used it exactly as directed, and cranked that sucker as high as it would go (I am good with pain).</li>
            <li> The hair is much lighter and much less coarse than I originally had, but I&#x27;d still like to be smooth again without spending thousands more on professional laser treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tria may not be permanent hair removal, but it HAS made my hair grow back finer, and that makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> it works really well.</li>
            <li> and I was ready for our trip in April.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t see results</li>
            <li> I hope I get the opportunity to see if this product really works....    </li>
            <li> ; Do the hairs come straight out, or are they slanted making the roots closer to the skin surface?  </li>
            <li> Tried TRIA on lowest setting and it hurt so much</li>
            <li> And it really hurts so using a level 3..</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> , I just do it when I have time, but I really haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in hair density.  </li>
            <li> I have spent more on the dermatologists trying to get rid of the rash than I did with tria.</li>
            <li> Really I didnt even want a refund</li>
            <li> To my surprise - it really does work.  </li>
            <li> The real surprise has been on my leg.  </li>
            <li> Already I have a reduction of about 60%, and the hair that is growing in is growing much slower.  </li>
            <li> i am a very disassified customer and will share my feedback online with others.</li>
            <li> It works really well for my skin and hair type.</li>
            <li> I just started using it and really like it.  </li>
            <li> This really does work.</li>
            <li> After spending so much money and not seeing result</li>
            <li> and it works everywhere, not just on your feet, at a much lower cost than the \\&quot;soufflé\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> The ice pack really limits how much heat you feel from the laser head.</li>
            <li> On my arms and legs I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference, just that the hair is growing in finer</li>
            <li> i had some much chin hair i was depressed.  </li>
            <li> I am a licensed Esthetician and have worked in Dermatology where we used an IPL type hair removal laser, much like the silk&#x27;n</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t return it thinking it would just take longer to work for me, but now I am just out $400 and very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> i started using the tria laser over my whole body</li>
            <li> AREAS(THINK ONE WHOLE LEG...OR BIKINI AND ARMPITS</li>
            <li> I still have to shave, but there are patches where hair doesn&#x27;t grow, and the areas where the hair still grows is much finer and sparser than before.  </li>
            <li> This product really does work.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on professional lasor treatments.</li>
            <li> there is no red light (laser) coming from the window</li>
            <li> I did not buy mine here, but straight from the company.  </li>
            <li> You can till feel like pricks of the laser, but very tolerable.   </li>
            <li> What I got was the hair grew back lighter &amp; softer, not the smooth hairless skin that I wanted.  </li>
            <li> my man wants me to do his hairy ears, but idk.  </li>
            <li> I am supposed to have hair, ust not this much hair.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed much of a difference yet on my arm pits.  </li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t yet noticed any real reduction regrowth.  </li>
            <li> There is so much area to cover!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have seen some reviews stating that the old style is still being sold, so I thought the review was worth it.</li>
            <li> After reading the online reviews and watching the videos that were available at the time, I thought a Tria laser might actually work for me.</li>
            <li> (I think it was a Gentle Yag machine).</li>
            <li> I have battled hair my whole life but around the time I turned 30</li>
            <li> but I got more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> REALLY?</li>
            <li> Especially under the chin, I could NEVER even with a razor get that to feel totally smooth.</li>
            <li> and I really advise all people to have one.</li>
            <li> so I used it every 2 weeks the whole 9 months.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t spend that much money on something if it might  not work.</li>
            <li> I and absolutely swear by this</li>
            <li> could notice the results, now it is really paying off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have no words to describe how much I feel scammed by this company.</li>
            <li> Another plus - get rid of all your underarm hair, and you don&#x27;t sweat as much there.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s very noisy.</li>
            <li> B000EMWFBQ Tweezerman  Stainless Steel Slant Tweezer]]).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy about it, although must say I can&#x27;t even imaging starting treatments on my legs since it takes forever to treat both underarms,and btw,the battery lasts for underarms treatment only, so if you are doing a larger area, be prepared to recharge (takes about 3 hrs) and remember where you stopped.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to review this product for a while because it&#x27;s helped me so much.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to buy a laser hair removal system but was waiting for a system that I thought would REALLY work.  </li>
            <li> I know I really appreciated reviews from real people about their experience with Tria.</li>
            <li> I could not afford $10,000 for laser treatments, but really wanted them.</li>
            <li> I will be more careful.</li>
            <li> Now its much easier to use</li>
            <li> It still hurts but the pain is much easier to manage.</li>
            <li> so it doesent have to hurt as much</li>
            <li> really</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, and frankly, I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> Now I have been wearing skirts and dresses comfortably since the hair grows in so much finer and so much more slowly.  </li>
            <li> but i would say stick with the real thing.</li>
            <li> really hurt on level 3 (and I can tolerate pain very well).  </li>
            <li> It also hurts like hell especially near the bony areas.</li>
            <li> works, it really does.</li>
            <li> The rest of the hair the laser either misses, doesn&#x27;t pass enough energy through, or the hair is too light.  </li>
            <li> , what they really need to be asking is \\&quot;did</li>
            <li> and they confirmed it can not be used in the areas noted above.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing i didn&#x27;t like about the Tria laser is how fast the battery runs out.</li>
            <li> and you can go in straight lines the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll post an update once I have treated longer and seen if there really are long-lasting results.</li>
            <li> because I really wanted it to work.  </li>
            <li> Was really hopeful this would work as advertised, so I went ahead and bought and used it as instructed.  </li>
            <li> Very suspect that they accused me of tampering with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, too; it work great when it&#x27;s working, but, why have a warranty if you&#x27;re not going to stand behind.</li>
            <li> With my face, much slower going.</li>
            <li> .) The head of this laser is absolutely TINY.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each pulse takes about 5 seconds to fire (doesn&#x27;t sound like a big deal, but those 5 seconds add up).</li>
            <li> so it might not hurt as much if you have lighter, finer hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> really does feel like that.</li>
            <li> I really want this to work.  </li>
            <li> After much research, I purchased the Tria Laser Hair Removal system in August 2012.</li>
            <li> I can absolutely see a difference.</li>
            <li> After four weeks I can see some improvement, but not as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> have high hopes for this machine &amp; can&#x27;t wait to see what the progress will be in 6 months!</li>
            <li> Well, since the cycle varies treating weekly is absolutely the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I really need something to get rid of this hair:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really hope this can help somebody out there.</li>
            <li> I can attesst that the Tria has worked very well for me to use for touch ups.  </li>
            <li> Also generates too much of heat to make it bearable on the skin.</li>
            <li> The lazer did absolutely nothing to remove the hair.</li>
            <li> I am really upset that they didn&#x27;t approve my review.</li>
            <li> If I had the funds to spend I would seek legal advise on the issues of this deceptive advertisement.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!  </li>
            <li> The battery time seems to go quite fast.  </li>
            <li> It really does make  difference when it comes to the pain factor.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my friend and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> contact me at period945@gmail.com, thanks</li>
            <li> As a woman it is very embarrassing, I used to wax, shave you name it.</li>
            <li> I know it is the real deal.</li>
            <li> my wrist and my ankles and feet, I have sat 4 straight hours with a tattoo needle pounding at my flesh that I could stand this laser</li>
            <li> I really thought the safety feature wouldn&#x27;t let zap him, but it did</li>
            <li> If it really worked, wouldn&#x27;t that still be up?</li>
            <li> It def feels like the real deal.</li>
            <li> The next generation for this product is already available.</li>
            <li> I decided to really work on my legs</li>
            <li> So in theory this might be equal to or better than the professional treatments I got 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> That being said the reason I chose the Tria is because it&#x27;s a diode laser which is proven to have far better lasting results and fewer treatments.</li>
            <li> It took at least 6 months for me to see some good results.  </li>
            <li> It is OK for those who have done several laser treatments with a professional and are looking for a \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; device.  </li>
            <li> At first I considered electrolysis, because I understand that it&#x27;s the only true hair removal.</li>
            <li> Had I not followed directions and taken so long to try to get good results, I would have returned it long ago.  </li>
            <li> light skin with dark hair, and have had tremendous success with professional treatments.  </li>
            <li> I am still using the product to get rid of these last stubborn areas, but the overall result is very nice and trouble free.  </li>
            <li> Yesterday I noticed little hairs on my wash cloth as I was washing my face, so with great excitement I spent a good 5 mins pulling little hairs out of my neck!</li>
            <li> Those who do not have ideal skin tones should consider the following on whether to epilate prior to TRIA laser use:  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; Is the area of skin being treated darker than other areas of your body?  </li>
            <li> All I am going to say is that after two treatments I noticed results when doing it the professional way, also smelled right away the burnt follicles.</li>
            <li> If the hairs slid right out with no resistance at all, they would come out with the bulb just as they do in electrolysis, and that suggests the follicle is completely destroyed.</li>
            <li> Alternatively, the areas that I had professionally treated with true lasers (same technology as Tria device) have remained nearly hair free for the duration of my post treatment years (7-15 years depending on when the treatments were performed).</li>
            <li> Alternatively, the areas that I had professionally treated with true lasers (same technology as Tria device) have remained nearly hair free for the duration of my post treatment years (7-15 years depending on when the treatments were performed).</li>
            <li> Hairs using a smaller number of pulses have taken significantly longer to regrow than from epilation (2 months as opposed to 3 weeks) and are thinner than before, but the area still has to be redone.</li>
            <li> I must say I was skeptical about the home laser treatments but the return policy was too good not to try it!  </li>
            <li> By this, I mean that more hair follicles died and has not regrown significantly (about 5% regrowth).</li>
            <li> Customer service is unwilling to ship a replacement and apparently no repair is available.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so I just got my tria the other day.</li>
            <li> Which is significantly faster than the last model.</li>
            <li> I used setting one most of the time, and two at other times.</li>
            <li> Hopefully other customers have had better experiences.</li>
            <li> Sure, I still have dark, coarse hair that needs treatment, but just the fact that I don&#x27;t have to shave every day is fantastic.</li>
            <li> not TRIA, any other advises?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks:)</li>
            <li> &quot; they are still enough to significantly increase my quality of life.</li>
            <li> This was worth the money saving me thousands from having it done professionally - not to mention much more private which is what I like!  </li>
            <li> The problem is this:  The only one who can use 1 year warranty is original owner...who has to call or enter serial # when they purchase the unit.  </li>
            <li> I have dark course hairs and very light skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very light skinned with dark hair.</li>
            <li> It does NOT work on red, blonde and specially white body hair, so this is my own and personal experience review on Tria Laser Hair Removal &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> But to me $500 (now less than $400) is worth it since professional LHR costs much more and requires appointments.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;ve gently pulled them out with a tweezer to help things along, because who needs MORE dark pores looking like grody blackheads?    </li>
            <li> i bought the tria for christmas , gift to my self, i have not been able to use it more than 4 times until now, is just hard when you have a 11 month old home, so this is my 4 treatment and so far i have not seen any difference, the hair continues to grow and i havent notice any hair reductions yet,, I will continue using it</li>
            <li> and I confidently say that because I was really let down.</li>
            <li> Using too few pulses will lead to no reduction in hair growth, or at best thinner hairs, because insufficient heat was absorbed to destroy all hair-producing cells, even if it was enough to weaken the hair root allowing the hair to fall out.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and pale skin, so I&#x27;m supposed to be the ideal candidate</li>
            <li> This has really changed my life, I spent so much work and effort to try to handle unwanted growth, and fitting in professional laser treatments</li>
            <li> This little laser made my entire vacation more pleasurable and a fantastic experience.</li>
            <li> the underarm hair bothers me the most because even when i shave you can still see the black roots and it looks very unattractive.</li>
            <li> I have black hair and very light -</li>
            <li> Also this laser is made in China, and it shows, most parts creaks, the metal grills don&#x27;t fit very well, poor design and workmanship for a $400 product.</li>
            <li> so I was surprised at how much it hurt!</li>
            <li> I have been using the laser exactly as the instructions suggest for that 10-month period, but I have so far not seen any results whatsoever.</li>
            <li> If you do order a Tria laser, definitely return it for the full refund within the 90 day period if you see no results during that time.</li>
            <li> I purchased the unit more as a supplement to the professional treatments that I am getting and to reduce(not completely remove/retard) hair growth in different areas.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my wife; she recently started a laser treatment for removing armpit hair and the full treatment (6 sessions) were $500.00</li>
            <li> To be honest I shave EVERYDAY!</li>
            <li> Even though I purchased with a 90 day money back guarantee, they did not refund the full price.</li>
            <li> I am a full grown man and have had back problems</li>
            <li> The latter is not painful however removing every hair with this product  feels like electrolysis which is burning off each hair one by one.</li>
            <li> If you have too dark of skin, the laser will not be able to differentiate hair from skin, and will not work.  </li>
            <li> Only after using the Better Business Bureau, did I see TRIA customer service offer any sort of reasonable solution to my issue above.</li>
            <li> I put on make up as usual &amp; there was no shadow which was nice for a change.</li>
            <li> and keep treatments on schedule, the hair will re grow a few times,  after the tenth session I was about 95% hair free, the hair left is pretty fine,</li>
            <li> That means that I was able to do my legs from the knees down, bikini line, and underarms all for under $400.</li>
            <li> permanent but new ones can grow in!  </li>
            <li> new hair follicles!  </li>
            <li> they said you have to buy a new unit!</li>
            <li> I am seeing wonderful results, my legs have about 40% less hair, my underarms probably about 60% less, and my bikini has almost no hair left at all.</li>
            <li> thing that blew my mind is that the battery gave out (won&#x27;t do more than 3-4 pulses) after slightly over a year</li>
            <li> Well Spent, easily saved me over $2k</li>
            <li> This is a decent product .</li>
            <li> Be generous and give an extra laser pulse more than what&#x27;s necessary for the hair to simply fall out, to make sure enough heat reaches all of the epithelial cells of the hair matrix.</li>
            <li> i have read many mixed reviews and after two years of research i finally decided to buy the tria.</li>
            <li> I have the older version</li>
            <li> With the older version you use it every 2 weeks</li>
            <li> A lot of people are saying it&#x27;s a piece of junk, but people need to be realistic.</li>
            <li> and we always had patients coming back in for way more treatments than should&#x27;ve been necessary.</li>
            <li> I am about two months in, and have seen decent results.  </li>
            <li> I have used so many different methods such as sugar waxing and using epilators</li>
            <li> The energy density of the laser isn&#x27;t strong enough to do the sort of damage required for extensive hair follicle reduction and your results even with a medical grade laser won&#x27;t leave you entirely smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have a medium complection my underarms and bikini are light, but my legs and arms get pretty dark tan over the summer.   </li>
            <li> just wasn&#x27;t realistic for me.</li>
            <li> I started only the top part of binki the same time I started my underamrs and my bikini area</li>
            <li> I mark my leg where it quits with an ink pen, put it on quick charge and finish later.</li>
            <li> few visible blank spots where you can tell hair is gone for good  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to call them back until just recently, feb 2013</li>
            <li> I always used the highest setting which is 3 on my older version.  </li>
            <li> I hope Tria comes up with a bigger treatment head and more power for the next product.</li>
            <li> The device demonstrates moderate efficacy at hair removal for mild cases of excess hair growth.  </li>
            <li> I got this as a gift from my husband and then got pregnant shortly after</li>
            <li> I thought the more expensive the better it would be.</li>
            <li> I like Tria because it is much cheaper than the spa and even if the hair grows back eventually (although some is gone permanently) you have no hair for a long period of time (better than shaving).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having this at home to do maintenance as opposed to going back to the salon (scheduling appointments, waiting, driving there, back, doing the treatments - you waste the same amount of time) - having it is awesome!  </li>
            <li> - Keep it in the high setting.  </li>
            <li> I think I have a high pain tolerance</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> also, have a fairly high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> have high hopes for this machine &amp; can&#x27;t wait to see what the progress will be in 6</li>
            <li> I also have an extremely high pain tolerance.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, $550 unit is only good as long as the limited life batteries work and only for the original purchaser.  </li>
            <li> The second effect can be mitigated by cooling the skin and continuing to direct laser pulses towards the follicle; but the first, of damage at the surface around hairs, can only be addressed by removing the hairs to prevent them from absorbing laser light at the skin&#x27;s surface.    </li>
            <li> I suspect after a few more sessions, as there are less follicles to zap, I will be able to increase it to the maximum \\&quot;5\\&quot; setting.  </li>
            <li> happened to see the Tria on TV one day and researched it a little more.  </li>
            <li> So prepare to spend a lot more time with this pre-historic little Tria gun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other pro is that it is REALLY easy to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Though it seems a little pricey at time of purchase, when I compare the $450 I wasted at a medical salon, the Tria is an excellent investment.</li>
            <li> I had LASER Hair Removal done prior at a Dermatologist&#x27;s Office on my underarms, and WOW- Talk about PAIN FACTOR!!!!!</li>
            <li> With the large treatment areas and no need to overlap pulses, the Silk&#x27;n Pro allows me to treat larger and hard to see areas MUCH more quickly than the Tria.</li>
            <li> The hair that is still growing is more fine and less dark.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than going to get it professionally done--which I tried on my face and underarms.</li>
            <li> Use the money to pay for real laser hair removal that offers GUARANTEED RESULTS.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had professional laser treatments done and this one hurts just as much</li>
            <li> I have had professional lasering on my stomach and face and even after two treatments of that, my hair was over 50% gone and the hair that continued to come in was much, much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months and so far can&#x27;t tell much difference.  </li>
            <li> and finally I am seeing huge areas where no hair is present and the areas that do have hair, that hair is so sparse it shouldn&#x27;t be much longer before it&#x27;s all gone.  </li>
            <li> This means knowing how many pulses are enough to simply make the hair fall out, and then exceeding that number to ensure the follicle is completely destroyed.</li>
            <li> that i normally shave off [legs, stomach, chest, arms] and wax any hair on my face/neck.</li>
            <li> so I end up having to use it on the lowest setting in those areas, which is the least effective setting.  </li>
            <li> I went through a couple of years worth of monthly treatments on several areas of my body with IPL</li>
            <li> I expected it to work well for me as I have fair skin and dark hair, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
            <li> I expect I will be done using it in a few more months.</li>
            <li> I think this item is worth the money especially if i can use it as often as i want.</li>
            <li> You can have mine for next to nothing, since that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> you know it is very possible to get heat and blisters  -- and the TRIA is not that powerful.</li>
            <li> It is so worth it to me to have my life and confidence back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the Silk&#x27;n Bellalite product and will proceed with that - with the confidence that I can replace the pulse module if needed again and not throw away another $400 nor have an electronic product that is going to end up in a landfill (I&#x27;m searching for recycling) after a very short useful life.  </li>
            <li> But I red years worth of reviews</li>
            <li> I have read the customers reviews from various sites to ascertain the validity or worth of this product and in the end</li>
            <li> I have gotten success only for leg hair on lower legs.</li>
            <li> In some smaller areas, the hair pretty is much gone.  </li>
            <li> With the adjustable power settings, in more sensitive areas I dropped down one power level and felt no pain or discomfort.</li>
            <li> How gross, right?</li>
            <li> Just be careful to shave first and go gently over scars because the laser is attracted to dark pigment and will hurt more.  </li>
            <li> When I first got the Tria it would hold a charge for a half an hour, now I am lucky to get 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other week and have seen a huge reduction in hair.  </li>
            <li> Actually, well over a year, and it&#x27;s pretty safe to say I wasted that money.  </li>
            <li> 6 months ago I was having to shave my lower legs once per week to keep smooth, now its every other week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suspect the thick dark hairs just conduct more heat, hence the greater pain.</li>
            <li> Because even if it never rids the hair completely, at the very least, I know I look good when I use it.   </li>
            <li> An agonizing session a week beforehand had lead to practically zero reduction of growth and even a slight burn due to over-application of laser light &gt;.&lt; Even when using ice to cool!</li>
            <li> (I have been burned... by a doctor who was trying out his new laser without training).</li>
            <li> Brand new TRIA to finish off my legs, I thought.  </li>
            <li> I believe the new version is quicker.</li>
            <li> and they just tell you to buy a new one from them.</li>
            <li> The new TRIA holds a charge longer, you can glide it (</li>
            <li> On October 29, 2010, I contacted the company and the representative authorized a return for a new one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again I will buy a new one when this one gives out.</li>
            <li> and i called the costumer care they told me they will replace it by new one</li>
            <li> and I Will wait for new one ,,,,</li>
            <li> and they sent me a brand new Tria.</li>
            <li> But I began taking pills to even out my hormones and prevent any new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> and it needed to be returned for a new product</li>
            <li> So we got 6 uses out of this system then were told we could buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I called Tria&#x27;s customer service and they told me that there is a new upcoming model on January</li>
            <li> But if you can see your dark hair follicle even after you shave your legs (or wherever) - it should work just fine.  </li>
            <li> on the main page, Amazon shows three items \\&quot;frequently bought together...\\&quot; with the Tria.</li>
            <li> By that time I could see very sparse, coin size patches of hair that weren&#x27;t growing back as fast or at all.</li>
            <li> that being said, I was almost completely hair-free by swimsuit season, which was my main reason for purchasing the unit.  </li>
            <li> Sent back because in instructions said that it doesn&#x27;t work on light hair and nowhere in prior reading before ordering was that mentioned.</li>
            <li> It has some major ergonomic and usability flaws that make it an absolute pain to use.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has light skin and even medium brown to black hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the new one is any better</li>
            <li> i notice when i pull my skin tight, it doesn&#x27;t find the hair as easily as when i let the nozzle sink into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I would still be willing to try it again, if they get rid of the third piece(put</li>
            <li> Currently testing 4~6 pulses in rapid succession with ice beforehand and wetting the skin, which seems to be enough to remove most hairs in the correct growth phase (thinner hairs that aren&#x27;t growing and don&#x27;t hurt when lasered are just pulled out after several pulses to avoid confusion and wasting pulses).  </li>
            <li> According to the instructions epilation should be avoided for 4~6 weeks prior to the first use of TRIA laser.</li>
            <li> I have light skin and dark hair.</li>
            <li> Please know two things: 1) the Tria is designed for use without safety glasses (just don&#x27;t use it anywhere near your eyes!)</li>
            <li> First, I have only been using the Tria for about 1 1/2 months.  </li>
            <li> The head of the tria is small and it requires alot of patience to move from spot to spot so that you are sure to not miss any patches.  </li>
            <li> A complete ripoff!</li>
            <li> Plus I have a light skin and dark hair</li>
            <li> Sensitive pits!)</li>
            <li> Cons: exactly the same as laser hair removal in a salon or med spa.</li>
            <li> Even if I never lost any more hair, it would be worth the 400$ because I don&#x27;t have to deal with the constant ingrown hairs, razor burn, and stubble that came from how thick and dense the hair was.  </li>
            <li> Dark hair and medium light skin.</li>
            <li> Only completed about 1/2 of my chest the first time out.   </li>
            <li> At first I was only planning on doing my legs</li>
            <li> but since I had battery power left the first time, I&#x27;ve decided to do my arm pits as well.  </li>
            <li> As long as I can go for weeks at a time without dealing with unwanted hair and embarrassment, it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I was doing a small area, so this was okay for me.</li>
            <li> The instructions for the machine tell you to use it every 2 weeks for the first 3 months and only once a month afteward up to 8 months for maximum results.  </li>
            <li> I am a prime candidate for laser hair removal with light skin and dark, course hair.  </li>
            <li> but companies can define their warranty periods to be almost exactly the actual life of the product.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time and money on Tria!</li>
            <li> After the first time using it, I noticed that the hair wasn&#x27;t growing back.  </li>
            <li> After the first treatment, the hair started growing back after 3 days.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The sensitive areas like toes, fingers, breasts, and belly are already without hair!  </li>
            <li> My hair is dark and my skin is light in the area being treated...</li>
            <li> I have light olive skin and dark hair.</li>
            <li> I feel like my unit now doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as well as my first or second unit</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m dark haired with a light- medium skin tone.</li>
            <li> I used the 3 setting the first time, 4 the second time after I tried mixing oral analgesic (20% benzocaine) with collagen gel.</li>
            <li> some hairs appear dark, but the roots may be too light for laser.</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife and she used it consistently at the highest setting she could tolerate (which was only 2 or 3) and it never made any noticeable reduction.</li>
            <li> I sent it back in it&#x27;s original packaging in pristine condition following all of their \\&quot;rules\\&quot; for returns.  </li>
            <li> That actually took two phone calls - the first time, they promised to e-mail the info</li>
            <li> I have been to med spas and spent a lot of money on Brazilian and full leg hair removal-successfully.  </li>
            <li> Again, if this is something they want to market for small areas, then fine, but they should not be marketing this as something to use for your whole body, or even your legs.  </li>
            <li> By far the most significant factors in applying enough heat to the follicle are wetting the skin, which both provides cooling from evaporation and also moderates the temperature increase of the outer skin surface preventing burns; cooling with ice, beforehand and possibly between TRIA pulses; and applying all pulses to a specific hair follicle in rapid succession, instead of moving away from the area and later returning multiple times to overlap coverage.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown, by the way, and I have pale skin, so unless if I had black hair, I should be the perfect canidate.</li>
            <li> I am East Indian with a light beige-ish skin tone and black hair.    </li>
            <li> Please note that you have to have a light skin pigment with black body hair color to work.</li>
            <li> i have porcelain colored skin and black hair, so I fit the required m.o.</li>
            <li> I have light skin and black hair on my underarms.</li>
            <li> Their customer service is not available during hours when I have easy access to wait on hold for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually, I totally cheated; if I were as good about the overlapping as the directions recommend I estimate 1 round would&#x27;ve taken at least 10 hours of treatment time (more than one week of treatments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While using the TRIA (same as w/med spa LHR)</li>
            <li> I pretty much surrendered after keeping up the regime for 8 months with absolutely no results.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it remove hair, I have also been able to laser off some dark freckles.  </li>
            <li> It is very heavy--if you plan on doing hard to reach areas, the weight will get to your arm very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This, of course, may be due to not completing the full year.</li>
            <li> wonder if the new on is just a different color or has some real differences?</li>
            <li> this will cost Tria more than it would to repair my device or at least offer me a discount towards a new one.    </li>
            <li> this should be a very basic protocol, but many facilities don&#x27;t even bother with sanitizing the devices, much less sterilizing them between patients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this should be a very basic protocol, but many facilities don&#x27;t even bother with sanitizing the devices, much less sterilizing them between patients.    </li>
            <li> The pain is much more bearable, much less than when I initially started using the Tria.</li>
            <li> I started out using topical numbing cream- applying it 45 mins prior to using TRIA; quick wipeoff of it- and setting of a 5.</li>
            <li> Some More Suggestions: The treatment head is small and the battery lasts a decently long time but you will need multiple treatments to cover a full area.</li>
            <li> it is exactly like those in the profisonal salon excet its small and easy to carry with the same effects.</li>
            <li> To prevent this from happening, it is essential to use enough pulses to completely remove the hair follicle on the first try, since later passes in the months following will both consume a large amount of time, and will have lower chances of success if the hair has become thinner.</li>
            <li> if you want to use it on legs or large areas it might not be the answer but for smaller areas like your face it works wonders.</li>
            <li> then after i let the hairs grow out I actually saw that quite a large amount of the hair wasn&#x27;t coming in.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who needs to treat a large area of skin.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a girl like me who is a little too hairy for society&#x27;s liking, this is a fabulous investment.</li>
            <li> When I use it on the fine dark hairs I barely feel it</li>
            <li> When I called to ask for a solution to this very common problem, they make NO provision for any kind of repair.  </li>
            <li> bikini line is about as useful as this gets if you don&#x27;t want to waste days on end trying to finish a large area.</li>
            <li> While this did reduce SOME hair growth on my lower legs this certainly cannot be described as similar in any way to professional laser hair treatment.</li>
            <li> sometimes I had little red bumps and it hurt not any more</li>
            <li> Mustache area is the most reduced, hard to find hair there anymore.</li>
            <li> This may not seem like much, but if you are treating large areas of your body, this extra size makes a big difference in treatment times,</li>
            <li> This may not seem like much, but if you are treating large areas of your body, this extra size makes a big difference in treatment times,</li>
            <li> Laser/\\&quot;PDL\\&quot; and Intense Pulsed Light/\\&quot;IPL\\&quot;) at Medical Spas with professional grade machines.</li>
            <li> They also recommend that you begin on the lowest setting so that you gradually adjust to the pain, but even at the highest setting, the power of the laser is far below what the standard medspa laser is shooting, so suck it up anddeal with the pain of setting 5 if you&#x27;re looking to achieve real results.  </li>
            <li> If you come across very stubborn hairs then I would suggest a home electrolysis or second hand professional electrolysis machine to take them out.</li>
            <li> I only do it when I feel I need it because the hair is much thiner and soft</li>
            <li> I have had professional laser hair removal that actually worked very well on me.  </li>
            <li> winter, clearly I did not shave my legs.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> By comparison there was clear</li>
            <li> So far, no noticeable difference in hair growth and/or appearance in any of the treated areas (underarms, bikini line and legs).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional laser hair removal before</li>
            <li> Their product was defective and they aren&#x27;t (so far) honoring their warranty.    </li>
            <li> I would advise finding a professional laser hair removal place.</li>
            <li> i would say its about 20% so far gone/thinner.</li>
            <li> So far though my wife has used it once</li>
            <li> I have been using it at the highest level - which does hurt much like a big rubber band snap.  </li>
            <li> But you learn to break it up and maybe start early on a Saturday so that you can get house chores done, etc.</li>
            <li> The pain from the Tria can only be described as intense.</li>
            <li> and I have not needed any cooling or numbing for them even on sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> LHR is the only method that really made a difference</li>
            <li> LHR is the only method that really made a difference</li>
            <li> Because so much hair was reduced over time I never saw the point in going back</li>
            <li> I put the sensor against my skin correctly, the green light came on</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thankfully I already had my bikini area done professionally, because I don&#x27;t think this laser would have done anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen results from professional treatment</li>
            <li> My underarm hair is nearly gone.</li>
            <li> I do not have any affiliation with this company and have never had professional hair removal performed.  </li>
            <li> For the rest of us, it is something you need to keep up with, whether you do it at home or get it professionally done.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for one month and haven&#x27;t seen results yet, but it&#x27;s way too early to tell.  </li>
            <li> So far I think this product is everything that it was promised to be.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only writing this review to confirm it really does work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now early spring</li>
            <li> Do not waste your $.</li>
            <li> I did try tyhe professional laser hair removal and it does work  also and</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product direct from Tria, 1st generation if you will.</li>
            <li> As an aside, I&#x27;ve never had professional laser.</li>
            <li> It is a lot cheaper than getting professional laser hair removal</li>
            <li> Have used it for a month now and can already see a difference, my hair isn&#x27;t growing back as fast</li>
            <li> Of course it didn&#x27;t work and the real kicker is that the warranty had expired days earlier (even though it hadn&#x27;t been activated</li>
            <li> I am surprised Ididn&#x27;t expect to see results this early</li>
            <li> This is a 400 dollar product when getting it done professionally would cost thousands.</li>
            <li> but eventually you won&#x27;t have to treat as much, then only touch ups every year or so.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done one treatment so far and will update.</li>
            <li> it looks completely hairless.</li>
            <li> my friend emailing told me this  tool is not warranty and also can&#x27;t be fixed.</li>
            <li> one square foot takes about 45 minutes to complete the laser process and about 3 to charge it.  </li>
            <li> was reviewed well by professional companies.</li>
            <li> I have had one professional laser hair treatment and at the level 10</li>
            <li> It is completely embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> I bought TRIA laser hair removal system to maintain the results after getting professional treatments.</li>
            <li> That is enough to put me off, so I don&#x27;t use it as much as I should...</li>
            <li> However, looking back to how much I&#x27;ve had to shave and the razor burn</li>
            <li> Go to a professional.  </li>
            <li> Plus it zaps the hair folicle that is alive.</li>
            <li> Too early to know if the hair removal will be permanent</li>
            <li> If you want to try it go directly through Tria</li>
            <li> and so I was surprised that I stopped at \\&quot;4\\&quot; for my legs.  </li>
            <li> (though so far, I&#x27;ve soldiered</li>
            <li> But so far, I can&#x27;t vouch that it&#x27;s accomplishing what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li> If you have had professional lasering</li>
            <li> Just to feel my face and feel soft skin instead of stubble and scars(which are fading as well).  </li>
            <li> even did my sons very hairy back with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product of the early &#x27;90s, 5&#x27;2\\&quot; (158 cm), size 2,</li>
            <li> However, I was hoping for near hairlessness of areas for which I had already had LHR.</li>
            <li> I bought this product direct from the company, not Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to do on my legs and soon realized that was completely unreasonable.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting laser done professionally.</li>
            <li> I have had professional laser hair removal from a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office and it does work on my body.</li>
            <li> I have used the Tria 3 times so far</li>
            <li> I really hoped to do the legs, but I only have time for underarms, because I have a 1 year  </li>
            <li> Mostly on sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> My doubts were completely squished after using if for two months.</li>
            <li> I sent a message through their contact form directly on the website, and sent an email as well.</li>
            <li> This takes me about 2 weeks to complete, then I get a week off.</li>
            <li> My results so far are as follows: 2 treatments from dec 27-jan 21  legs</li>
            <li> when you see such fast results, it is quite motivating.  </li>
            <li> WOW,</li>
            <li> So far it feels like I&#x27;ve just been ripped off.</li>
            <li> I do it when I whant and it really does the same job as salon lasers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if anybody has doubts that this machine actually works, I can vouch that it absolutely does.  </li>
            <li> I even used it to finish what 9 treatments of professional LHR ($1000) didn&#x27;t accomplish on my underarms</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product, just pay the money and go to a professional.</li>
            <li> Do Not Waste Your money.  </li>
            <li> she wanted it for her birthday, and so far she loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional laser hair removal before and before that I tried electrolysis.</li>
            <li> If you have had professional laser, then you know a shot feels like</li>
            <li> I had to wait for the area to completely heal then</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed the hair to grow back slower, as I am a very hairy person, in fact some areas done on my stomach</li>
            <li> are completely hairless thus far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not paid by Tria, this is just my experience so far.</li>
            <li> This device is nowhere&#x27;s near powerful enough to get the job done without multiple sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This device will not kill the root of the hair like professional machines</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would not recommend this product to people who have never had laser professionally.  </li>
            <li> We just received the  unit from Tria and while removing the plastic cover noticed the following warnings  which I cannot find on Tria web site so think they are very disingenuous.  </li>
            <li> And how could your head be sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Since I did buy it direct from them they are sending me a return label etc.</li>
            <li> The level i can tolerate depends on the area i use it for and how sensitive it is.</li>
            <li> I recommend you save your money and have this done professionally.</li>
            <li> i well complete to see how the hair grow up</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE I WAS SEEKING PROFESSIONAL LASER HAIR REMOVAL</li>
            <li> No noticeable results so far after 3 laserings.</li>
            <li> Sure, I could set aside the time, but the problem is, that on Level 5, it dies within 15-20 minutes and you have to charge it for 2 hours at least.</li>
            <li> , so Level 5 is tolerable) for about 10 sessions, every two weeks to the leftover hairs that I had after the professional lasering.</li>
            <li> Once I hear about 3-5 beeps, I tweeze off that hair as it falls off naturally and that hair doesn&#x27;t reappear from what I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> And, secondly, much like medical salon laser treatments</li>
            <li> was the prefect candadite for laser hair removal and did 6 professional sessions about 12 years ago.</li>
            <li> This is a weekly treatment, unlike professional treatments which make you go every 6 weeks because of the hair growth cycles.</li>
            <li> I am guessing that is just an attempt at some legal protection in case someone hurts themselves, but choosing not to include that same warning here on a $400 item is deceptive.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Hair really stops growing back within the sixth week.</li>
            <li> SO FAR</li>
            <li> Hair has grown back, but as I say, much much finer than before.</li>
            <li> A professional you can see.</li>
            <li> I am unsure about this product so far I haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
            <li> I had about 4 sessions of professional laser hair removal for my underarms and bikini about 4 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I also use on the bikini area and found that you really need to read the directions before using and shave as close a possible before use.  </li>
            <li> my whole back is tattooed,</li>
            <li> I treated my bikini line and after the 4th time, I now see a marked decrease in hair growth.  </li>
            <li> using even more pulses per hair a few months later when the hairs in that area regrow!    </li>
            <li> It may even be necessary to use tweezers, which may take several hours but as you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s worth it...    </li>
            <li> went through a couple of years worth of monthly treatments on several areas of my body with IPL exclusively (same technology as the Infini&#x27;silk devices).</li>
            <li> I have also used it on my upper lip a few times and it looks better too.</li>
            <li> After six months, my leg hair was growing in more slowly and patchier, but still needed to shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very time consuming because the laser needs to be recharged often and allowed multiple breaks to cool down</li>
            <li> Test the effectiveness by pulling out a representative hair after using TRIA on it, or risk having to do the same area again (having fewer hairs in the 1cm window does not mean it goes faster!)</li>
            <li> And you can cool down your skin immediately after to stop this.  </li>
            <li> I think that they should offer previous owners a special deal, a trade in, based upon the overblown promises of hair elimination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I have tried to do arms several times, ranging from several pulses on power 4 (out of 5) with cooling to a full-power pulse with no cooling to 2 pulses per hair without cooling, this significantly underestimated the number of pulses necessary for hairs of this size.</li>
            <li> I went to pull the first long hair and to my surprise, it wasn&#x27;t even attached!</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying that I have been treated with laser treatmens for very long time</li>
            <li> Had I not purchased a home system, there are other areas, toes and fingers for example, that I would not have spent the time or money to have laser hair removal on, because there aren&#x27;t that many hairs there.</li>
            <li> It does have a small \\&quot;zap\\&quot; area, but it moves along VERY quickly since there is no time needed between each zap.  </li>
            <li> However, despite the overall temperature of the area of skin feeling very warm and pain relief cream to the point that a tiny amount seeped inside the treatment head to the other side of the transparent window forming a small, clear yellow spot, the pain was still intense and despite using the entire battery charge with a power setting of 3~4 and repeating areas as dictated by the instructions, there was no noticeable reduction in hair growth except at the very edges of the area where hairs grew slanted with the roots close to the skin&#x27;s surface.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;It might kill hair but the real deal-breaker was the major time suck (&amp; not whenever convenient, but in regular intervals).</li>
            <li> A nearby region with slightly less dark skin (registering green on sensor) with slanting hairs and follicles close to the surface and equivalent density seemed to not have resulted in significant reduction prior to epilation, but a month afterwards that particular area is down 60~80% from normal (patchy) despite not having gone over that area a second time, but this unexpected result was due to the direction of hair growth allowing much more of the light to reach the hair roots instead of just being absorbed at the surface.      </li>
            <li> Your existing hair follicles will disappear but it is absolutely possible that new ones can grow in!  </li>
            <li> However, if you have experienced pale dots on skin from loss of melanin, you might want to just accept that small hairs might remain where larger ones were.</li>
            <li> If you have serious hair issues and want to try,negotiating a price for 2 would make your work more efficient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am currently testing having used 3~4 pulses in rapid succession, with both ice (which cools the follicle as well) and wetting the skin (which mainly prevents burns).  </li>
            <li> Oh, they&#x27;re hairy, but about one in thirty is really dark and blissfully in sun, they turn light blonde</li>
            <li> The laser head is pretty narrow and unless you&#x27;re a very diligent and patient person, purchasing this to do your legs</li>
            <li> It seems the laser has made alot of improvements from the older reviews i read, it is light, easy to turn on and use, i do wish it lasered larger areas and the charging is annoying, but its worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Just in case only the older version was discontinued, I&#x27;m posting to warn everyone off.&lt;br /&gt;In fairness, it does what it says.....</li>
            <li> My first session I could only do level 3, but the second one I tolerated level 4.</li>
            <li> I shaved a small area and treated it, then shaved some more and went about it like that (no markers necessary).  </li>
            <li> I am light skin (African amer/Cuban) with dark hair about 135pounds at height 5&#x27;2 (to give an idea of amount of laser treatment)  </li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, the hair has come back</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly to eliminate fuzz on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to do large areas like your legs, save your money and find a Groupon or Living Social deal for a local laser hair removal place.  </li>
            <li> The ease of adjusting the power is very easy, making pain and discomfort unnecessary.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this hurt pretty much the same as the salon treatments - repeated sharp snapping sensations, like a rubber band snapping against the skin.  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product, especially at such a high cost.</li>
            <li> So overall if you are patient, don&#x27;t have too high of expectations, and can use the laser on the highest setting I would recommend this for you.</li>
            <li> I paid the enormous amount of money for this system with high hopes.  </li>
            <li> The last time I used it, I got about 7 pulses on high power, before the battery died.</li>
            <li> so I  zapped him on his arm with it one day on high and it left a circle burn on him</li>
            <li> &quot; It&#x27;s possible the laser IS working, slowly but surely, but you just have so much hair that it requires several treatment sessions.  </li>
            <li> Heat dissipates very quickly from a hair to the surrounding area, but the follicle only needs to be at a high enough temperature for a few moments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for months now and so far I have barely seen any results.</li>
            <li> Used it on the most powerful setting (5) twice and after 29 days and seeing zero results I had to return it since it&#x27;s such an expensive item to purchase to \\&quot;see if it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t finish all the treatments with the dr as it took too long and cost too much.</li>
            <li> hair removal is generally said to feel like a rubber band snapping on your skin and professional lasering</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though there are some minor improvements that could be made, the results are very pleasing.</li>
            <li> I did notice a small decrease in the amount of hair in each area, but by no means am I hair free.</li>
            <li> Other things to keep in mind:  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; While using ice to cool the entire area does reduce pain, it also increases the number of pulses that must be applied per unit area.  </li>
            <li> Other wise save up and go to a professional hair removal treatment center!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The two main reasons that this temperature is not reached are the sections of hairs at the surface of the skin heating to the point of causing localized damage, or a general rise in temperature of the entire area of skin being treated to the point that damage results.    </li>
            <li> I gave it to my daughter as a gift, she said so far it is working, after four treatments, she is noticing less regrowth, but true enough you need to be patient since it is a lot of work and dedication for her to achieve her goal.</li>
            <li> so far, ive been treating small areas only with this laser but will move on to larger ones when i have more time.  </li>
            <li> You have to overlap the pulses (the directions show you a &#x27;map&#x27; for your pulses, which is circles representing the treatment head, overlapping half way on top of each other (just like a Venn Diagram).</li>
            <li> &amp;nbsp; - For legs, applying pulses in overlapping lines (moving about half the diameter of treatment window after each pulse, so each follicle receiving 2~3 pulses during a pass) lead to significant reduction of growth for several months,</li>
            <li> , everything grew back the way it was on my underarms, OK, maybe 10% reduction, kinda hard to tell).</li>
            <li> I noticed after the very first time that it grew back much slower than usual.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than waxing and it is slowly working, just not as fast as some other reviews had led me to believe.</li>
            <li> IPL or laser will eventually kill all of your current hair follicles, but your body will form new ones over time.</li>
            <li> IPL or laser willeventually kill all of your current hair follicles, but your body will form new ones over time.</li>
            <li> New hair follicles will CONSTANTLY grow in!  </li>
            <li> so I called back to get the \\&quot;discounted\\&quot; new system.  </li>
            <li> : I just came back here to read my review because it just went live.</li>
            <li> So am I lasering the same hairs, or new hairs-</li>
            <li> They sent out the authorization, FedEx picked it up, and a new unit arrived a couple of weeks later.  </li>
            <li> I used to think I had a really high pain threshold, but apparently not after this, it was almost embarrassing.</li>
            <li> more or less brand new having wasted 2,500 of my currency (TT Dollars) and still paying for laser treatments.</li>
            <li> I was only able to tolerate on the third level on sensitive areas (bikini and underarm) but on my legs I was able to use the highest setting without it hurting too bad.</li>
            <li> - the Tria actually came back to life for a while - then really</li>
            <li> it way it was supposed to with pinprick hot sensations and some redness, but it hasn&#x27;t been long enough for the hair to start shedding.</li>
            <li> After my second treatment, the hair did not grow back as fast and after 1 months</li>
            <li> The hair that still remains on my legs is growing back more slowly and the hair itself is whispy and softer.</li>
            <li> they are soft and pretty down their...</li>
            <li> was a tiny new hair much smaller than the original, due to the hair production cells which did not receive enough heat when the area was treated.</li>
            <li> In all that time I probably spent a total of $2250 for about 10-11 hair removal sessions on each of the following areas: bikini, underarms, full legs, plus a few sessions on the back of my neck to smooth out my hairline.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin and light to medium brown hair.</li>
            <li> First and foremost: some pain is necessary, but most pain is unnecessary!    </li>
            <li> my Tria (first generation) died the other day.  </li>
            <li> yes, you MUST be patient for results, you MUST overlap areas, you HAVE to get a schedule going, I used mine every other day- for the first 4-6 weeks; then I started \\&quot;shedding hairs\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> One major difference between this laser and what you will get done in a spa is the lack of a cooling device.  </li>
            <li> My bikini - forget it - been bare for years!  </li>
            <li> I am a light skinned white dude (not glow in the dark white), with brown hair.  </li>
            <li> After 8 months of consistent use I have absolutely no hair on my legs!  </li>
            <li> I also know that the reduced hair growth is not due to the tweezing, because there were some hair that grew out after 2 weeks while the majority did not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also know that the reduced hair growth is not due to the tweezing, because there were some hair that grew out after 2 weeks while the majority did not.     </li>
            <li> if you have other plans  be aware of this.  </li>
            <li> I am light complected with dark hair and of French descent (French &#x3D; furry).  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the unit get hot after a bit and the battery only last for about 1-2</li>
            <li> I have done as much research as possible online and have been frustrated by the lack of detailed and fully credible reviews, so I am going to summarize my experience and research here.    </li>
            <li> sure you shave as CLOSE as possible, any extra hair makes it more painful.  </li>
            <li> This was typical when I would go to the clinic as well, so I figured I did something right.</li>
            <li> I used the Tria every other day or so to speed up the process (I guess it doesn&#x27;t really speed it up) and immediately the hairs seemed to crystalize and just fall off, never to regrow again (so far).  </li>
            <li> I also used an older version of the Tria as well 2 or 3 times a long time ago too before returning it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can report that the hair does grow at a significantly lower rate, and I notice that I have bald missing hair patches on the neck, and the belly area seems to have about 25% hair left.  </li>
            <li> Using just 1~2 pulses at full power may take a moderate amount of time comparable to say epilating, but this will be completely ineffective at permanently removing hairs, much less when judging based off the smaller amount of time to cover an area at a lower power setting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but definitely worth it, compared to what you would be paying someone to do it for you.</li>
            <li> AT ALL!!!!My skin is super white and my hair is black</li>
            <li> I have very light skin, dark hair, and the occasional dark freckle.  </li>
            <li> I still have some very minor fine hair in the bikini area and a little hair in the underarms.  </li>
            <li> i realize its a little early to declare this a total success, but after years of struggling with unwanted body hair, i&#x27;m looking forward to wearing a bikini without a coverup.</li>
            <li> When you start zapping you can move reasonably quickly, but after about your 10th zap, the laser starts to slow down to a super, molasses crawl.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for at least one part of my body to be hair free from buying this thing (paid about $600 for it at the time)</li>
            <li> General Product:</li>
            <li> general info</li>
            <li> I find it pretty painful, to be honest.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know</li>
            <li> The box and/or packaging clearly states not to use this above the neck.  </li>
            <li> JUST BECAUSE GOT IT ALMOST A MONTH AGO AND STILL TO EARLY TO SEE BIG CHANGES</li>
            <li> I did break the rules and used it on my chin, but I&#x27;ve had professional treatments in a salon on my chin and upper lip and nothing happened.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t try to use the Tria near your eyes and assume glasses or goggles designed for a different wavelength would help.  </li>
            <li> It takes me four treatments to get both of my legs completely (thighs to ankles, front and back).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 6th treatment and so far my unwanted facial hair is gone</li>
            <li> But I barely got to use it</li>
            <li> Gee, thanks but no thanks.  </li>
            <li> the hair dosn&#x27;t grow back with the professional laser.  </li>
            <li> But this thing knocked out 70% of the bikini line hair on the first use (on the highest setting on dark hair &amp; beige skin).</li>
            <li> I got professional laser hair removal done on my underarms for over a year and am getting the same results with the tria laser</li>
            <li> I have heard some people treat the same spot about 10 times,  and got some results, along with redden skin, like a professional laser.</li>
            <li> I am a male in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Now, I can go a week without shaving and you can barely notice.  </li>
            <li> It works for her and her sister and apparently works for me as well.</li>
            <li> - I can see spotty bare areas if I let hair grow - not</li>
            <li> I think some are old that are just starting to come to the surface.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had anymore problems and the battery on my third unit</li>
            <li> Apparently some of you don&#x27;t realize that they put limits (30 days) on the guarantee.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old and I have facial hair</li>
            <li> And, professional LHR will charge you for each area - lower legs, upper legs, bikini, etc.</li>
            <li> Makeup didn&#x27;t cover it completely and I couldn&#x27;t afford constant treatment.</li>
            <li> - (This one I do not fully get)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a male I wanted to use it on the wild ear hairs.  </li>
            <li> I have had professional laser treatments and it does take longer but results are the same.</li>
            <li> They offer a \\&quot;risk-free\\&quot; 90 money back guarantee yet you must use it far longer than that to even begin see results.</li>
            <li> I will make future purchase with complete confidence.</li>
            <li> I barely even felt it.</li>
            <li> Apparently not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Safety conscious people are not going to want to use this product on their faces after reading that warning, and I suspect that people with unwanted facial hair are a target market for this</li>
            <li> I can barely handle the level 3 setting and it did nothing.  </li>
            <li> The hair becomes finer with a professional, and eventually is gone if you can afford to continue to do several treatments per area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have saved up and went with professional laser treatment, which is what I will likely still end up doing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far.</li>
            <li> No problems have developed from using it on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I did this once a week for the first few weeks and my chin and neck was almost completely cleared.  </li>
            <li> Give them more money when they don&#x27;t stand behind there product, no thankyou.</li>
            <li> Also, sometimes those \\&quot;zapped\\&quot; hairs look kind of weird</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and use Tria in winter and spring when you&#x27;re at your pastiest, ashen, mousiest self (speaking solely on my own account of course).</li>
            <li> The pain seems to be worse when there are more hairs per area, the darker the hair, and the thicker the hair.  </li>
            <li> Hardly worth the trouble or the time.</li>
            <li> They said they were way behind, yea because so many of their products are in need of repair.</li>
            <li> A simple call back to a customer is not hard to do.</li>
            <li> The highest setting has a very long pulse duration and it really hurts on thick hair, specially on the bikini area.</li>
            <li> New hair follicles always, always comes back - whether you use this product or a different one or go to a salon.  </li>
            <li> So because you have to treat the area every other week for the 1st three months, if you do a large area of your body, like the legs, expect to need to stick around  home on those weekends and invest a lot of time into doing the Tria.</li>
            <li> As the hair has gotten finer the treatments have been less painful which is wonderful!</li>
            <li> 2 whole legs I would imagine would take a day and half to complete.  </li>
            <li> This seems like common sense, but once you get going on a big area like your legs, you can easily forget that.</li>
            <li> I think the whole process took a week and half to complete.</li>
            <li> Too large of areas for such a tiny treatment head for a machine with such a short battery life.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve see a few reviews about issues after the warranty expires, but if you do the math, and you start using it right</li>
            <li> This company definitely seems like one that listens to its customers and tries to make positive changes based on customer reviews.</li>
            <li> only area where I truly used the Tria (and no previous salons) were my underarms.  </li>
            <li> I downgraded my review to 2 stars, b/c it does work somewhat, but overall if it is just for use on really small areas, then I think it may not be financially worth it especially with all the pro laser hair removal deals I&#x27;ve seen on Groupon and Living Social (if you live in a major city).  </li>
            <li> I think the main part of the answer to that question is already thoroughly explained in the above review and can be summed up with \\&quot;because hormones and genetics cause brand new follicles to naturally keep forming\\&quot;, but the other part of the answer is that when I first started getting laser hair removal, the cost was $2,800 for a 8 treatments of a small area like \\&quot;lower face\\&quot; (which did not include cheeks or anything under the jawline).</li>

            <li> This product is ment for people with very light skin and very dark (like black) coarse hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this laser on my underarms for about 8 months now,and it worked, the hair slowly disappearing and whichever ones that grow are very very thin and light ( I am a dark brunette ),and the skin is smooth and light , so for me it worked.</li>
            <li> The negative side is that it really is time consuming for large areas like the legs.  </li>
            <li> If enough laser light is delivered to the hair follicle within a small enough amount of time, it will heat up to the point that the hair follicle is destroyed.</li>
            <li> i ve seen a significant growth reduction where i had thick growth .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used it with ok results it does make the hair come back a little less.  </li>
            <li> am also clear that in certain \\&quot;hairy\\&quot; aread ( upper inner thighs, and underarms, I still have too much hair,  but not so thick</li>
            <li> I have pale skin (but I love to tan in the summer), freckles and dark, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> The company can&#x27;t push us around if we speak with a loud voice about our experience, both good and bad.</li>
            <li> have experienced Amazon not fully disclosing relevant details about products several times, and I find it disturbing with such an expensive product.  </li>
            <li> So, now I really recommend people go to a professional:  $400 + a lot of pain for nothing is a waste to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because you have to overlap, and the laser light is so small, it takes a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown back so much lighter and not nearly as much.</li>
            <li> If you are targeting particular hairs keep in mind you need to hit the root which may not be directly below the hair but slightly to its side under the skin, so laser around it as well.</li>
            <li> My disclaimer for this review is that it is for the old style (the one with the digital setting screen came out shortly after I made my purchase).</li>
            <li> I would recommend Tria and don&#x27;t understand why someone would send it back and go back to professional LHR.  </li>
            <li> Never have I spent so much money on a product and been so thoroughly and utterly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> light skin will not heat up at all, just the dark hair or dark freckles.</li>
            <li> Tria really works,but only minus is,you have to spend all day to do it,because of the battery,which You have to recharge every 20 min</li>
            <li> the most frustrating expirance ever in my entire life!</li>
            <li> If you have thick coarse hair all over your body like a gorilla this device will NOT leave you as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bum.  </li>
            <li> Another full battery charge later, surprisingly with the same amount or less pain due to the numbing action of cold on surrounding nerves, there was again no noticeable reduction of hair in that area.    </li>
            <li> so i usually scratch lines down my leg with my fingernail (lightly!)</li>
            <li> The battery life actually lasts longer if you hold the machine exactly 90 degrees to your skin in the down facing position.</li>
            <li> This is why ALL of these facilities require you to sign a broad medical and liability release that includes burns, disfiguring injuries and poor/ no results.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t agree with these positive reviews less.  </li>
            <li> Within this time, I am able to get about half of one ankle done (I&#x27;m small too).</li>
            <li> I was worried that my skin tone would be too dark or that it would hurt too much because I had tanner skin</li>
            <li> plan to treat other areas that really I didnt think of such as my bikini.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional hair removal done in the past, and I know it works on my light skin and dark hair.</li>
            <li> so is no excuse at all why it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> As Stated above i used this product only approximately 15-25 times and they told me that it doesn&#x27;t matter how many times you use it.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty much a waste of money, unless by some miracle it works after a year, but I doubt it.</li>
            <li> I used the laser a few times per week for the first 3 or 4 months-</li>
            <li> First off I don&#x27;t understand how people say this doesn&#x27;t work for them after a few sessions.</li>
            <li> Also, after the first few sessions, the pain subsides significantly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It went dead a year from date of purchase, funny???  </li>
            <li> I got the newer one and for me it did a whole lower leg (from the knee down) on one charge.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much it has come down in price.  </li>
            <li> What did happen, was it seemed oil glands opening on to the hair shafts had been damaged by the intense heat flux, causing a crusty residue around the hairs and other signs of damage to the skin immediately surrounding each hair!</li>
            <li> Starting the fourth treatment today, I can hardly see where to work, the hair is so light and sparse, and I haven&#x27;t shaved since the last treatment.     </li>
            <li> I did my treatment religiously, had high hopes for this thing, and I had absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> I got this product for Christmas of 2011and started using it a little by little, mostly on my arms because I am half italian and I have been shaving my arms since high school.</li>
            <li> And I mean I couldnt go a full day without shaving twice.</li>
            <li> NOT A SINGLE hair fell out a month later, or two, or three...    </li>
            <li> But other than that, if you keep using this, and on the high setting, you WILL get results.  </li>
            <li> It stings, but not as bad as I remember it from the professional, which had me nervous that maybe it wasn&#x27;t powerful enough to be effective, and that I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> Although there are patches that are less hairy on my legs, I still have to shave just as much.  </li>
            <li> I do believe you have to have very dense stubborn black hair in order for the tria to work it</li>
            <li> Way less, much finer, lighter growth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is worth mentioning that I have a condition called PCOS that causes excessive hair on women(more on this later).</li>
            <li> The treatment head is small so it will take several months to fully feel like it&#x27;s worth it.   </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re probably not selling many any more due to bad reviews and cheaper alternatives, and trying to milk whoever else tries out their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As the technology eventually became more common, prices began to come down</li>
            <li> As the technology eventually became more common, prices began to come down</li>
            <li> I WISH I had just saved my $450 and got a single treatment of professional lasering on my legs.</li>
            <li> I have had professional hair removal on my chin and upper lip in the past that  had a much faster result though.</li>
            <li> I wish the treatment area was larger and the battery life longer, but I am hoping that the money I spent is well work it since the cost was only part of a normal treatment.[[ASIN:B0029OSN4U TRIA Hair Removal Laser]]</li>
            <li> have a lot of hair left, but much less hair in certain areas (like lower legs) where I was a nut about hitting all the area with that tiny head, over and over and over.</li>
            <li> Sometimes a too-close shave takes away too much of my dark hair (which oddly comes out really dark at the ends but is lighter at the follicle itself) and I find it&#x27;s more effective with at least 12 hours growth but not much more.   </li>
            <li> Have only had a short time and have noticed the hair starting to thin out not completely gone yet, but as a side note it got rid of my tattoo quick fast and in a hurry</li>
            <li> Hoping the Remington product I purchased will be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to my review: in case I wasn&#x27;t clear in the above post, I did use it as instructed for a very very very long time</li>
            <li> Though the Tria is obviously less intense, I definitely felt the snap of the laser and could smell the hair burning, which means it was doing something.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;The hair density might be slightly less where I have used it, but it is hardly enough to really notice.</li>
            <li> I zapper (at the highest level) actually do grow much less fast....</li>
            <li> Now five and a half months later my hair is as think as it was before and grows as fast as before.</li>
            <li> year round, never comfortable with my hair \\&quot;situation\\&quot;, ever envious of my girlfriends easy summer skirts and shorts.</li>
            <li> My leg hairs are more reddish brown, so doing my WHOLE leg to hit the percentage that are dark enough is tedious and time-consuming.</li>
            <li> It seems the legs, arms, fingers, and some parts of bikini line hair is growing back slower, but under my arms and other bikini area hair growth is normal (darker areas).  </li>
            <li> I am southeast asian, light tan complexion with very dark coarse black hair.</li>
            <li> anything I think it started to stimulate growth in certain parts.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shaved both legs with a new razor, then used the Tria on one and not the other.  </li>
            <li> Worth going to a pro.&lt;br /&gt;I learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> I only plan on using this for the bikini area, should be fine for face (since tip is relatively small &amp; have dark coarse hair)</li>
            <li> But now, because of no or very little dark hairs in the follicles below the skin(no huge heatup of area) - I don&#x27;t need the numbing cream- and still use the setting of a 5.</li>
            <li> like the person who gave a bad review after finding out this isn&#x27;t intended for the face ( even though some people tried it anyway with good results)</li>
            <li> Then I worried if the good reviews were paid for and the bad reviews were big warning signs to stay away.</li>
            <li> You will probably not have a reason to do so later on as identifying single hairs will become the focus instead of broad swaths of laser pulse application.    </li>
            <li> SO if you&#x27;re like me lucky enough to have dark hair and pale skin</li>
            <li> So I bought this and hoped with all my heart it would work, I followed the directions religiously with slight discomfort stings a little more than a tattoo,  but Isaw little results maybe an extra day or so before shaving.  </li>
            <li> After a time the only thing it left me with is permanent dryer skin, a few spots formed after I stopped use, skin is a little more fragile, and I get hair growing odd in those areas now that can build up collagen.  </li>
            <li> Since then however everything that has ever been treated (including professionally) has grown back in in spades due to my pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> ** out of her and left considerably scarring as one other poster mentioned.</li>
            <li> I would say the hair has decreased by maybe 25%, so I am left with 75% of the original hair in place.</li>
            <li> As a female, it&#x27;s hard to describe exactly how psychologically damaging this has been.  </li>
            <li> After 2 time consuming treatments, it is clear that I need to do the other leg because it is working.  </li>
            <li> The ad shows blonde women in it and one woman says it can be used anywhere on the body and then when you get the product is clearly states on the box that it only works on dark hair and also lists all the areas that it can&#x27;t be used on.</li>
            <li> The hairs might have reduced in size, not sure since nothing to compare them to, but the technique used simply did not apply enough heat, and overlapping coverage just caused pain because there was too much time to dissipate heat between passes.</li>
            <li> , they say its enough to remove arm, leg, back, stomach, bikini, and arm pit hair of one average adult.  </li>
            <li> The laser head can only operate on a mostly flat surface.</li>
            <li> So, underarms, shin bones, and knees can take some negotiation to get a flat enough surface for the laser to fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I originally bought the TRIA laser for 995.00, being a weary bodybuilder tired of shaving</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 1 year of treatment, I definitely saw major hair reduction, but as some other users said it started coming back eventually...</li>
            <li> I am a 25 year old female with dark course hair &amp; ivory/beige (according to Tria) skin.</li>
            <li> Some hairs are stll coarse and dark, but far fewer, maybe just a dozen or so here and there.</li>
            <li> Forget reddish brown, blondish brown, grey, white, blonde...</li>
            <li> laser doesn&#x27;t last long enough for the price</li>
            <li> I went to use it and the battery will only hold a charge long enough for ONE pulse of the laser.  </li>
            <li> It is not really great obviously for your full body like they try to make you believe.  </li>
            <li> I have relatively light skin with dark, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Like I said, I have dark, thick hair and light skin</li>
            <li> I tried using it for my legs, and although I did see some improvement, the laser head is just too small to do large areas.  </li>
            <li> Also, the charge doesn&#x27;t last long on the higher settings, but I found that I am ready to stop by the time it quits as it is quite tedious and there is some pain (though not intolerable).</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m really disapointed in the $$$ we spent on this, as well as the COUNTLESS hours of time I wasted.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get past the 3rd setting on general areas like my thighs, and on sensitive areas the first setting is hard enough.</li>
            <li> I mean if I had so many laser hair removal in the past in salons</li>
            <li> The armpits are more sensitive so it is a little uncomfortable there</li>
            <li> /&gt;Supposedly, going to a professional requires about 6 sessions, is done within 6 months, and because the lasers tend to be bigger, the time per session is less.  </li>
            <li> The second thing I found odd, was that before you can even use the TRIA you have a complete an online survery.</li>
            <li> I have a very high pain tollerance, and could not handle it past the second setting (and this was on my legs, not a sensitive area).</li>
            <li> not sure how well it will work, but in comparision to the laser hair treatments I have had at doctors offices very comparable.  </li>
            <li> However, I am using the lightest setting (\\&quot;1\\&quot;) on my arm pits since it is pretty delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too small to do your legs</li>
            <li> The TRIA requires twice the number of sessions (according to the manual)--i.e. more time &amp; pain, takes at least 8 months, and because the laser is so small, takes a long time per session (if you&#x27;re doing legs).&lt;br</li>
            <li> for those of you wondering what it feels like-i would say like a burn by a flat iron on a setting of 5, the setting of one doesn&#x27;t feel like anything though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for others, but after 6 sessions, and now over 5 years since my last treatment, about 60% of the hair I used to have (chest+stomach) is still gone, and I think after 5 long years one can call it \\&quot;permanent.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I used it as directed for about 5 months, but the process takes entirely too long.</li>
            <li> This way Im not subjected to pain for long, and I actually prefer to do it for 15 mins a day than an hour a day.  </li>
            <li> BUT comparing this to professional lasering - which left hair follicules noticably red and irritated  - this didn&#x27;t - which leads me to think it did not reliably reach the roots to destroy them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The second unit had a strange almost water/oil mark on the treatment window.</li>
            <li> Product does not last long, and customer support is non existent.</li>
            <li> I have not had it long enough to see how it does at removing the hair.</li>
            <li> Only buy it if you can stay dedicated to using it, long term.</li>
            <li> Also, I thought it was working pretty well on my bikini and under arm areas, but after not using it for 4 months, the hair in those areas is just as thick as before I started.</li>
            <li> and I then put the sensor face it and waved it up and down near the indicator lights as instructed and nothing happened.    </li>
            <li> your going to spend on this as a down payment on professional electrolysis.</li>
            <li> I intentionally let the hair grow a wee bit and the few hairs remaining, about 25% or less were much finer, to the point of being barely visible.</li>
            <li> Repeated use will decrease dark hair growth only, Does not work on red white or blonde hair as with any laser.</li>
            <li> old who keeps me so busy I hardly ever have time for myself.</li>
            <li> As many other reviewers have noted, the device fails to function at all after a short time.</li>
            <li> The pain is temporary and I find that the redness doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I doubt it&#x27;s as painful as professional, and even at the top setting IMO</li>
            <li> Although I still have hair i shave it much less frequently.</li>
            <li> I bought the Tria in June 2011, so I have owned it for nearly a year and a half.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed less hair because it&#x27;s still too early to tell.</li>
            <li> The product simply does NOT work and it is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on only my upper lip (I wanted to see some results before I spent the time on my legs)  </li>
            <li> You can just hold down the button as you \\&quot;flash, glide, flash, glide\\&quot; and the devices predictably and consistently flash every 3.5 seconds as you work along.</li>
            <li> BUT even with pro treatments, you may not see a lasting change from limited treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For dark, coarse, thick hair it will generally destroy the follicle or damage it significantly enough that the hair that grows back will be vellus hair (light, fuzzy, and somewhat slower growing).     </li>
            <li> I purchasing it despite of both negative &amp; positive viewpoints.  </li>
            <li> SOME OWNERS OF TRIA COMPLAIN THAT THE BATTERY CHARGE DOES NOT LAST LONG ENOUGH; HOWEVER MY OPINION IS THAT THE BATTERY LASTS LONG ENOUGH TO DUE ONE OR TWO</li>
            <li> I was looking at my legs the other day and noticed I needed to shave but one section was noticeably bare.</li>
            <li> Did my research on the TRIA and decided to try it rather than purchase the expensive full LHR treatments when I just needed a few hairs really.  </li>
            <li> I called again the next Mon. and was told that since it is past the one year warranty...no offer of repair or even a discount towards a new one.  </li>
            <li> The advantages of the Infini&#x27;silk for large and hard to see areas are acceptable trade offs for</li>
            <li> The advantages of the Infini&#x27;silk for large and hard to see areas are acceptable trade offs for me.    </li>
            <li> my bikini area, it was much more painful, so I had to use the same ice technique, but could only use setting 4 or sometimes only setting 2.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s hairs in the same place that appear instead of vellus hairs converting due to hormones, it&#x27;s probably because part of the follicle didn&#x27;t receive enough heat.</li>
            <li> followed the directions religiously, even graphed out the treatment area with a red marker so as to not miss a spot, and zapped my face repeatedly on level 5 every other week for 3 months, all the while taking my hormone suppressant meds.  </li>
            <li> I just completed my second session two days ago, and am following the recommended schedule of every other week as advised by TRIA.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, the battery doesn&#x27;t last long enough to even do both lower legs in a sitting.  </li>
            <li> It still hurt; listening to loud music helped a little.</li>
            <li> I usually have a high tolerence for pain</li>
            <li> I have a pretty high tolerance for pain and even in the areas that are particularly sensitive and somewhat painful, it&#x27;s manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on using it pretty much everywhere, except I&#x27;m a little skeptical of my face, but I would like to use it on my upper lip.    </li>
            <li> I noticed last summer that the unit&#x27;s fan had stopped running, which made sessions very slow as it had to cool down between each pulse.  </li>
            <li> In fact, anyone with 50k can legally buy a used pro-quality laser on the secondary market.    </li>
            <li> Most medspa lasers simultaneously shoot out a spurt of cold air to minimize the pain and heat caused by the laser.  </li>
            <li> I was very worried about buying this product because of all the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> At least use it for a real pro to remove your hair from unwanted areas.</li>
            <li> I would only advise getting a Tria for use on face, but for that price, you can probably get treatments at a salon, so overall probably not worth it.  </li>
            <li> This does not work, only another device to waste your money on, REAL lasers are dangerous and if this was truly powerful enough to work, there is no way it would be allowed in households!</li>
            <li> Now I have to go to a professional to get my toes and chin done because this thing won&#x27;t work on such a small surface space.  </li>
            <li> but, on the plus side, it doesnt take long to use.</li>
            <li> It is a long, long process</li>
            <li> and 2) those specific glasses listed only protect against blue and green lasers.</li>
            <li> I have had mine a few months now, and so far I feel that it is working.  </li>
            <li> My solution, FWIW, was to draw a grid of roughly one to two inch sections on my leg with a white pencil.  </li>
            <li> IN THE LONG RUN, THIS PRODUCT WORKS AS INTENDED.</li>
            <li> The product is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Also, It takes a long time to see change - hairs</li>
            <li> It hurt and took way way too long.  </li>
            <li> But if you are using it on your legs, be prepared to spend a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Save your money and go to a professional hair removal specialist, it might be more expensive but at least you will be hair-free.</li>
            <li> I expected to see SOMEthing different.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s long term capabilities.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too critical about the minimal results</li>
            <li> Long before I&#x27;d expect a $400 product to be end of life, it stopped charging.</li>
            <li> ( you won&#x27;t have to wait long).</li>
            <li> (maybe 4 treatments on highest settings, I kept treating every week even though the last 2 treatments there was not much hair to be shaved)</li>
            <li> so treatment takes a long time</li>
            <li> Yes, it takes a long time for the legs....</li>
            <li> As long as that hair follicle is still in tact, hair will continue to grow from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife planned to use it for some hair on her chin and a  few wild hairs close to nipples.  </li>
            <li> Recommend shaving about a day or two before treatments so the hair is not as long</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about the pain as long as it works.</li>
            <li> but, you are not completely out of luck.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 months and can&#x27;t tell much of a difference yet with my thick manly hair.  </li>
            <li> My thick hair that distressed me so much is no longer an issue.</li>
            <li> Well, when I tried to use it last week I would only get about five or so pulses before it would shut down.</li>
            <li> Well, long story short, it ALL came back in just a month and a half...</li>
            <li> I would recommend looking elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I would highly encourage other customers to take a few minutes to write up your experience.</li>
            <li> It only lasts 15 minutes (I can only treat half a leg during that time frame)</li>
            <li> After years of those aweful red bumps after only 2 treatments I can see lots of bald spots and alot less bumps when I shave.</li>
            <li> I think it has a capacitor inside, and depending how much power the batteries have, it has to charge it, so large area are annoyingly slow!!!</li>
            <li> It works well, but it&#x27;s main drawbacks are the tiny treatment area (about 1/4 inch round), the need to repeatedly lift the device off the skin between pulses (strains wrist/hand after a few minutes), and the need to \\&quot;overlap\\&quot;</li>
            <li> (BTW I no longer see the infomercials, is it because the product is an absolute failure?)</li>
            <li> Professional laser treatments are very expensive and time consuming and if you really want to eliminate all hair I would suggest using the Tria for a long time period and then getting a professional laser treatment or two.</li>
            <li> , I have black body hair which has never been waxed, pretty coarse, and pale skin, you CANNOT tan!!</li>
            <li> I prefer the larger PRO model because the larger treatment area saves me time, but if you are only treating small areas like face, underarms, bikini line, etc.</li>
            <li> I prefer the larger PRO model because the larger treatment area saves me time, but if you are only treating small areas like face, underarms, bikini line, etc.</li>
            <li> Then I just recently started using it again for chin area, and the other day it died.  </li>
            <li> A LOW RATING DUE</li>
            <li> The small window also makes it difficult to be sure you&#x27;re getting every spot, especially on legs (though using freckles and stray hairs as \\&quot;landmarks\\&quot; helps).</li>
            <li> After my pregnancy last year, a little of my hair grew back.  </li>
            <li> but I have been focusing on only one leg over the winter months and will switch to the other one soon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to figure out exactly where you&#x27;ve been and where you need to go next without zapping the same area 3 times.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t plan on passing it on to your sister, daughter, cousin  later on as it sounds like the batteries are pretty lame and even if you \\&quot;maintained\\&quot; the number of charge cycles for the battery is low.  </li>
            <li> If this were to plug into the wall and not take 5 seconds in between each pulse, it might be possible for an extremely patient person.</li>
            <li> I actually went out of the house without shaving and with a baseball hat on because so little is coming back.</li>
            <li> The hair is dark, coarse, thick and grows fast.  </li>
            <li> any good reviews are the manufacturer trying to make all the bad reviews go down!</li>
            <li> have not owned this very long, but will give my thoughts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although they say not to use on face, I was very careful on the upper lip area and chin</li>
            <li> I noticed something that I hadn&#x27;t in a very long time...</li>
            <li> It takes a few months to see gradual improvement at a high setting, minimal spacing, and an extreme amount of patience.</li>
            <li> And of course, as you are zapping away, it is possible that your hormones are working against you and sprouting brand new follicles (not new hairs in the dead follicles that you have killed with the laser).</li>
            <li> And of course, as you are zapping away, it is possible that your hormones are working against you and sprouting brand new follicles (not new hairs in the dead follicles that you have killed with the laser).</li>
            <li> I always had it on setting 2 and after the second month a huge chicken pox like rash appeared everywhere</li>
            <li> I actually found it more painful than some salon lasers.  </li>
            <li> Another plus for those ladies with dry skin, the laser also exfoliates and my skin appears smoother without gallons of lotion.  </li>
            <li> I shaved both legs at the same time and then let them grow back in for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Then a few weeks later, I noticed that I didnt have to do my daily shave anymore.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but I think many people will have trouble with the time commitment required of TRIA for legs.  </li>
            <li> So my hair is mostly gone, but I had a few random hairs here and there.</li>
            <li> And even when I waited another few weeks to do a third treatment, the hair still didn&#x27;t grow back in the capacity that it had before.</li>
            <li> Well, doing several passes on my underarms, going over the same spot twice each time, I&#x27;d say about 30% of the hair each session gets killed at the root.  </li>
            <li> Save your money (wait for a Groupon/Living Social) and go have it professionally done if you&#x27;re serious about results.</li>
            <li> Guidelines:  &amp;nbsp; - The relatively thick hairs found in particular areas can be removed with no resistance with aslittle as 1~2 full-power pulses, but to prevent regrowth this number needs to be increased.</li>
            <li> i know there is no live folicle there.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am not new to laser hair removal..</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is that on the highest level the battery life is not long enough.</li>
            <li> Major waste of 400.  </li>
            <li> the product has a limited amount of zaps.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a time consuming hassle- having to shave every single day, covering it up with makeup, worried your date or boyfriend will notice it-</li>
            <li> It did not remove a SINGLE hair follicle.</li>
            <li> I am brown skinned with dark black hair and do professional laser treatments.</li>
            <li> I have very pale nearly seethru white skin and thick straight black hair.</li>
            <li> This is not for those of you that want that little bit of golden peach fuzz gone, it is for those of us that has a serious hair growth problem that we either inherited or got from a hormone imbalance.</li>
            <li> What you have to remember is that some people don&#x27;t have dark enough hair and some people don&#x27;t use it faithfully.</li>
            <li> it just didn&#x27;t produce results that it promised, and overall was not worth it.  </li>
            <li> It simply is not powerful enough for that.</li>
            <li> My legs, which had dark but finer hair to begin with, look almost no different from when I started.  </li>
            <li> So...this laser is really only for people who have all the time in the world and here is why : The laser window is sooo small that it takes a really long time to properly cover the area you want to treat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Tria for 2 months now on the coarse, dark hairs on my legs and knees and</li>
            <li> But only on dark hair</li>
            <li> hair on my legs is dark enough to be visible through the skin immediately after I shave.</li>
            <li> I bought the Tria to do touch-ups of spots that i&#x27;ve had professionally lasered in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have had professional laser removal done in the past.  </li>
            <li> If you are interested in completely (or almost completely) eradicating the hair, you will be disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> i find that disguisting especially when i spent around GBP600 for it and only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> I bought the Tria a year and a half ago- been using it on my upper lip and chin every week since I bought it - i figured it HAD to work after doing so long but zero results !</li>
            <li> so basically, if a customer buys the tria and it stopps working it is only replaced within the year of warranty, anything after a year, you may as well through your money down the drain.</li>
            <li> When I finally got my routine down it was sept 2012</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not approved for face, but I laser it blindfolded with a sleep mask pulled down low.</li>
            <li> One more thing: it is impossible to keep track of the areas you are treating with it.</li>
            <li> Next: using cold water to cool the skin, without the pain relief product, to try to focus the effect of TRIA laser on the roots of the follicles.</li>
            <li> ; A momentary touch from ice or another cold object can cool the skin surface enough to keep it from being damaged for those with darker skin tones, while not propagating deeper within the skin before the destruction of the hair follicles can occur from repeated laser pulses.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to fully review this product, as it is one that is expected to take time for true results to show.  </li>
            <li> At the second treatment I could see a difference, less hair, but thought it must be my imagination.</li>
            <li> I never got \\&quot;clear\\&quot; but the Tria not only reduced the amount I have to shave, it also of course reduced the shaving irritation and bumps that go along WITH shaving around my bikini line and not having bumpy irritated skin around the pool is one less item I can check off my list of things that make me feel dysmorphic.    </li>
            <li> For me it only took an hour and a half to charge between treatments.</li>
            <li> Dark hair on Caucasian skin; after five weekly treatments, following instructions completely, absolutely no change in hair.</li>
            <li> Doing my shins and calves and feet on \\&quot;4\\&quot; uses about half of the second charge.    </li>
            <li> If you have been shaving regularly in order to use the Tria, you may be making it appear that there is less regrowth than there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting on the lower half of my body soon.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY COARSE BLACK HAIR</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for over a year, but I can really only report a slight reduction in hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this three times every two weeks and have noticed much less facial hair regrowth.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this product to finish the treatment and banish the remaining 30%, since just one follow up visit after the initial block of visits was going to cost over half of what the Tria costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s where it is after just shy of three months&#x27; use, and about six months&#x27; leaving it to sit: I have exactly the same amount of hair on both feet.</li>
            <li> I have a high tolerance for pain, however, this was ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I told my Mom, who thought this was a ridiculous purchase that it would be worth it for me if my body hair was reduced by 10% because I was so tired of plucking and shaving every day (especially my legs, which I shave daily).</li>
            <li> In fact, anyone with 50k can legally buy a used pro-quality laser on the secondary market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> The other big scheme is to wait an excessive amount of time, and then tell the customer it&#x27;s no long under warranty.</li>
            <li> love this one, however I do not know if I will get long term results yet.&lt;br /&gt;I am sick of spending lots of money on hair removal products and the idea of&lt;br /&gt;permenant hair removal may never be achieved, but the disire to remove it will</li>
            <li> it was now that I noticed, my lower half of the legs is covered w/ about 20% hairs than what I normally have.&lt;br /&gt;Upper legs covered as usual.</li>
            <li> have bin using the tria device for seven months and it has not removed one single hair!</li>
            <li> So as you can see, if you are accustomed to epilating before making the choice to invest in the TRIA laser, don&#x27;t hesitate to do so one last time several days before using the TRIA on an area with relatively small follicles such as the leg, or the day before or even the day of for areas with somewhat larger hairs like the delicate zone.</li>
            <li> it was unthinkingable ill send pictures to anyone thats interested if anyone else is having this please tell me if you have found a cure thanx!</li>
            <li> &quot; when there&#x27;s not enough contrast to work with the little test gun that comes with it</li>
            <li> Of course it hurts but only a little.</li>
            <li> I am asian and have really pale white skin with black hair.  </li>
            <li> The result as seen several weeks later...  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; 95% reduction of hairs rate on areas of 2~3 pulses on maximum power average coverage.  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; 60% reduction of hairs (uneven) on areas of 1.5~2 pulses on maximum power, due to bending to reduce the amount of pulses needed to cover the area, instead of trying to stretch the skin to bring roots of the follicles closer to the surface of the skin.    </li>
            <li> It did work, my black hair on the areas I wanted to remove are way way thinner and very very soft to shave, in the past when I shaved</li>
            <li> I do have to admit that it was a little bit more painful than others described, but after three treatments I am seeing a big difference.</li>
            <li> I did my underarms, bikini line/area, both legs (fully), and a few random spots just cuz I was hoping to tolerate the zap a little more...</li>
            <li> The Tria uses an 810 nm near-infrared laser (visually it appears a dull red color), so those glasses would not shield against it.  </li>
            <li> At times, the shape can be difficult to get into hard to reach or more curved areas like under arms.</li>
            <li> Because I was suspicious, I decided to use it on one single foot, using the other foot as a \\&quot;control\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Tria is selling the older 3 setting model here which is notorious for burning skin and produces hardly any difference Avoid !</li>
            <li> When you don&#x27;t even want your husband to look at you any more, you know its bad.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s why it stung so badly.</li>
            <li> and it did take about 18 months before deciding to rear it&#x27;s ugly head once more.   </li>
            <li> It is a lot more painful than I expected.</li>
            <li> Also it will be more painful if your skin is darker or if you use it on darker areas of your body.</li>
            <li> (It is just way too painful if I shave and laser because of the stubble (or maybe I just need to buy a better razor?).  </li>
            <li> (It is just way too painful if I shave and laser because of the stubble (or maybe I just need to buy a better razor?).  </li>
            <li> I have to say that the most painful for me has been my legs.</li>
            <li> I spent $500 and can not even try it.</li>
            <li> I brought this heavy, cumbersome laser with me, because I travel, but not the giant box it came in</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of not using it, it&#x27;s the same as before treatments.  </li>
            <li> BUT the company somehow cannot find us in the system and will not return it until they do (curious since you have to call the company to activate when you receive it.</li>
            <li> but you must read the instructions carefully</li>
            <li> The only hairs that are actually killed are the ones that are zapped in the growth phase.</li>
            <li> The only hairs that are actually killed are the ones that are zapped in the growth phase.</li>
            <li> it is only a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I couldn&#x27;t afford to get my legs done in a center so after doing a lot of research I decided to invest in a Tria.  </li>
            <li> Just making the Tria seem an even bigger waste of time.  </li>
            <li> If it bothers you, don&#x27;t spent a lot of money on pricey lidocaine treatments, get some after-sun aloe lotion.</li>
            <li> I will update in a few months to see how the actual hair removal is going.     </li>
            <li> So I will definitely update after a few months of using it.</li>
            <li> But, now that the density of my hair is so decreased, pain isn&#x27;t really an issue.  </li>
            <li> I tried it again a few days later to see if it was easier.  </li>
            <li> That way you save some money and get rid of a chunk of the hair at minimal cost.     </li>
            <li> I had this lazer for 1 month and used it everyday in different sections.</li>
            <li> Life is too hectic to waste time calling back a company that sells an inferior product.</li>
            <li> She is still completing her legs, but instead of shaving everyday, she only has to shave about every 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li> The hair continued to grow in within the next few days, even faster it seemed.  </li>
            <li> I expected to get home type results from this</li>
            <li> When I realized it was actually working I caught myself crying again but this time in happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would give MINUS 5 stars to it if I could.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money on this</li>
            <li> and I saw absolutely no improvement.</li>
            <li> The area was red for a few days.</li>
            <li> I had only used it a few times when my husband gave me laser hair removal sessions for Christmas.</li>
            <li> So I sent it back a few weeks ago and have not heard as of today.</li>
            <li> None of the hair on my body (arms and legs) have been reduced to minimal amount.</li>
            <li> so I did and kept it out of the return window but got no real results, ended up selling it.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I still am not seeing the results I had expected.</li>
            <li> I also find that it is  harder to get a close shave, so I ended up tweezing the hairs out (it says not to do it, and</li>
            <li> If you want to waste money and possibly damage your skin for life give it a shot.</li>
            <li> not really visible, a year layer</li>
            <li> imagine if i forget to do treatments and this product does not perform as expected.</li>
            <li> So, Guys be careful before you purchase this item because it not $3-4 item, you are spending around $400.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we have several hairs that pass through the same follicle, so that&#x27;s why you often need to have several treatments, because you cannot kill the entire hair follicle with just one session.  </li>
            <li> (the pink one)...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not comfortable, and of course, by only using it twice, there were no effects on hair.&lt;br /&gt;Quality</li>
            <li> followed the instructions, but I did not really see a difference</li>
            <li> Slowly the hair grew back in to about 50% over the course of the next 3-4 years and then stayed that way.</li>
            <li> Slowly the hair grew back in to about 50% over the course of the next 3-4 years and then stayed that way.</li>
            <li> round of treatments took ~5 hours of TREATMENT TIME (actual time spent zapping hairs).</li>
            <li> this really pisses me off false advertising this product gets no stars to</li>
            <li> The instruction for the TRIA on the other hand are a little different.</li>
            <li> It DOES work but it ONLY works well on dark brown to black hair.</li>
            <li> What I mean is, when plugged in it registers a charge, but when unplugged and unlocked, it completely dies.</li>
            <li> What a complete waste of money!!</li>
            <li> other reviewers mention, the laser window is small, so it takes a long time to do larger areas, like legs.</li>
            <li> My mom says that after 8 months of use, her hair is thinner, but certainly not gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not a scam.</li>
            <li> I treated the same small area for about a week every single day with overlapping.</li>
            <li> certainly no change that I can notice easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is just too expensive if you consider that there is a very large population of women it will never work on.</li>
            <li> I am not positive</li>
            <li> /&gt;It heats up only the dark hair follicles or very dark freckles on your skin.  </li>
            <li> After some really bad bleeding, scarring and results from \\&quot;sugaring\\&quot;, epilating, waxing and electrolysis, my parents purchased my first LHR series for me in my early 20s.</li>

            <li> weight isn&#x27;t bad and seems to weigh the same as a full sized hand held hair dryer, but the weight is packed into the size of a travel hair dryer.</li>
            <li> However, I have used it with Dr. Numb (5% Lidocaine) and that took care of the red hot poker feeling.  </li>
            <li> Here is the REAL problem...it has a battery life of about 20 minutes (which considering how painful it is, is probably a good thing) and its impossible to get the results you want unless you do the area probably 10-20 times.</li>
            <li> Professional lasering, which is pretty painful, was cake compared to this.&lt;br /&gt;Laser</li>
            <li> Now that I have so much less area to treat, I can spot treat as needed on a single battery charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have very little to no hair growing back.  </li>
            <li> and I used the Tria over the same area, I felt very little.  </li>
            <li> In terms of pain, very little if you don&#x27;t shave properly.  </li>
            <li> The more you use it, the easier and less painful</li>
            <li> I find the laser to be extremely painful, maybe i have a lower pain tolerance, because i can&#x27;t believe these people saying \\&quot;its not that bad\\&quot;, its definitely not a rubber band snap for me, its like getting quickly burned with a match-</li>
            <li> I think it was partially do to the fact that I tried it in my armpit first, where the skin is very thin.</li>
            <li> I spent 3 weeks in Tahiti and never thought about my bikini line!</li>
            <li> *: minor regrowth in a few areas, though I still haven&#x27;t finished legs.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m usually done in 15 min with my entire body.</li>
            <li> so I can compare it to the other.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s back (like I said, lazy hair remover</li>
            <li> If anyone has any other questions please post comments.</li>
            <li> Then, you need to do this every other week.</li>
            <li> I think it may be because they had a lighter root than the other hairs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve started to work on other parts of my body.  </li>
            <li> (The instructions have since been changed to say use it every other week.)</li>
            <li> lasts longer than the other two.  </li>
            <li> do have to use this consistenly, every other week, and follow their instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that definitely every pulse feels like a small snap.  </li>
            <li> Sent it to the company &amp; was returned with address unknown!</li>
            <li> I just want with this trying to save some money for other areas not already done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had to return my first unit, the circuitry failed.  </li>
            <li> I am writing this review for those who are needing a unbiased opinion from someone who has no affiliation with Tria or any other hair removal device.</li>
            <li> like I said that I only shave in the past 3 months</li>
            <li> Yes, the laser head is small, and the charge only lasts 30 minutes- for $500, that&#x27;s the technology you get.</li>
            <li> the only reason for subtracting a star is because of how small the head is.</li>
            <li> the reduction is 10-20% and this percentage goes for all other areas i mentioned in the beginning</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to the letter, and after 3 months at twice a month (every other week)</li>
            <li> The device is dead no matter how long I try to charge it.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from severe facial hirutism &amp; have done laser hair removal at a dermatologist in the past.</li>
            <li> No irritation anymore because what I am shaving now, compared to before, is such a small amount.</li>
            <li> I had hopes of using it in other areas as well.</li>
            <li> In their review guidelines it says that you cannot promote any other product</li>
            <li> I just said it didn&#x27;t work for me and that you should try other options.</li>
            <li> The device became hot as I used it, almost uncomfortably so.  </li>
            <li> I used it every two weeks like instructed but after 5 months with no results I started using it every time I shaved, now I am trying every other day.</li>
            <li> i am one of those unfortunate individual who is cursed with thick, black, fast growing \\&quot;werewolf\\&quot; hair and pale, extraordinarily sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After an hour with a very generous coat of 4% lidocaine product applied, the area felt somewhat numb and the pain was almost bearable for a moderate power setting with the TRIA laser.</li>
            <li> My skin hurt a billion times worse using the Tria laser than when I got salon laser hair removal treatments several months prior</li>
            <li> well the use ice to numb the area you gonna treat then treat it quickly.</li>
            <li> keep using it every few weeks, hoping it will suddenly start working, but I think I need accept that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be a wuss like I was and waste what is a limited # of zaps (I&#x27;ve had mine two years.</li>
            <li> So far using the Remington is a lot easier because you can use it for like an hour at a time (at least!)</li>
            <li> If a hair doesn&#x27;t do this when you apply the usual number of pulses, try tweezing it out and you&#x27;ll probably see the hair narrowing as it approached the follicle and a pale dot at its end, which didn&#x27;t absorb sufficient laser light to die and means the hair was in the wrong growth phase.  </li>
            <li> Your skin will be very numb with the anesthetic cream  - You may start the torture session:)  </li>
            <li> On a different area with similar hair density, overlapping coverage of 2~3 pulses on cooled skin, one day after epilation, has lead to approximately 90% reduction of hairs at that area four weeks after a single session of TRIA laser, despite that the skin was actually slightly too dark to register as green on the skin sensor compared to skin tone of the surrounding areas.</li>
            <li> The only other complaint I have about the product is I wish you could use the unit when the cord is plugged in.  </li>
            <li> 14 treatments and no positive results at all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not RIGHT after using Tria</li>
            <li> Why not, right?</li>
            <li> Upperlip/chin: Not much yet exept less of that black shadow.</li>
            <li> and I never got around to the other half.  </li>
            <li> but it is much less, I have not used it on other areas yet.</li>
            <li> but it was hard enough to keep track of where I zapped w/o any distractions.</li>
            <li> After a year of use every 2 weeks, I hardly have any hair left on the places I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get the hang of doing it properly on those hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first since there were other options that were more complicated and expensive to choose from.</li>
            <li> This laser does work, LOTS OF PATIENCE is needed and don&#x27;t be afraid to set it up as high as possible and give it hell!!</li>
            <li> Not effective on finer hairs (forearms, upper legs) at all.</li>
            <li> According to the instructions, you aren&#x27;t supposed to see any results until at least the second month.  </li>
            <li> If my hair was all dark, I&#x27;d invest the time and effort.   </li>
            <li> Average rating of 3 stars?</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It says in the instructions that for some people it just takes longer to work, but it is not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> My dark hair causes the pain, and as it went away</li>
            <li> This bulky thing is simply not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and used to have to shave every day, but by 2009, I never shaved anymore.</li>
            <li> w/pink undertones, dark brown (\\&quot;black\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> If I had dark skin, the laser hair removal would not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wanted to know if I could return the Tria 4x in the case that my skintone is too dark</li>
            <li> I am a medium skin tone woman with dark hairs and medium dark hairs and have used this since dec. 27.</li>
            <li> According to the box/instructions Im the \\&quot;ideal\\&quot; skin tone with dark hair.</li>
            <li> forever a costumer ( my skin type is olive skin with dark hair)</li>
            <li> I have polycystic ovaries, and, therefore, dark hair where girls aren&#x27;t &#x27;supposed to.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s not useful at all.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s truthfully, my only complaint.</li>
            <li> After i finished one year of dedication on treating my excessive hair, i was pleasure for the results i have got, but after 6 months of stopping using tria, all my hair grew back again, as i had waste one year with out any results.</li>
            <li> If you burn a freckle, it will get dark and bumpy or even form a scab.  </li>
            <li> it actually did not work for me, I was pretty disappointed after 7 month usements, no real result.</li>
            <li> The laser is so small that I stopped doing my legs because it took way too long -</li>
            <li> if you could hold the laser in your hand and see how small the treatment head is, you&#x27;d understand how long</li>
            <li> I needed at least 3-5 consecutive beeps in the same spot.</li>
            <li> Still need to do my underarms and upper legs, but I know I&#x27;m getting there at least.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair and skin that is medium in tone.</li>
            <li> But at least I have my money back in my pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Growth might be slow, but eventually the hair will grow back.    </li>
            <li> I have spent thousands on medspa laser hair removal and up until a few month ago, I was still going for treatments.  </li>
            <li> However, although it may not look like it is the case, there are vellus hairs already there even in a thick, coarse, hairy area.</li>
            <li> give this 3 stars only because I have not purchased this but was forced to give a rating in order to comment.</li>
            <li> Yes my hair is thick and dark, and my skin is white (ivory or lighter).</li>
            <li> I have used it for a month now and have noticed my hair is not growing back as thick.</li>
            <li> at the salon its the other way around, they want my skin pulled tight...</li>
            <li> I have thick black hair and it has been a constant problem.  </li>
            <li> It knocked em down &amp; gone in 2-3 treatments</li>
            <li> and then my thighs down to just below my knees on \\&quot;4\\&quot; before I run out of battery.  </li>
            <li> and sort of go up and down the lines.</li>
            <li> She loves it and it has cut down on the amount of shaving she has to do.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s helpful; it cuts down on razor burn.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I broke down and bought the Tria.  </li>
            <li> I did not follow the schedule because as other users stated - this laser hurts!  </li>
            <li> It is much less coarse and at least half is gone.  </li>
            <li> Maybe a slight slowing-down of the hair growth cycle, but definitely not worth the pain.</li>
            <li> I am half Armenian with dark hair and olive/light skin</li>
            <li> I bought this for my legs and other areas because I have very dark hair that grows at a lightning speed</li>
            <li> Some states (not most) require that the spa simply must have a \\&quot;doctor\\&quot; that has agreed to put his name behind it, or that a nurse actually operate the laser... but doctors and nurses do not get laser training in med school).</li>
            <li> BUT after only 2 mos of treating very small areas the battery died and won&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> and i was only lasering very small areas.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to only try a VERY small section of my body to see if it even worked.  </li>
            <li> I have done at least 8 session on my underarms, bikini line, toes, feet &amp; upper lip (although not approved for this use) and seen little to NO hair loss.  </li>
            <li> I also tried professional laser treatments( really disappointed with the high cost-over $1500 and virtually NO effect</li>
            <li> I promise you all- other than slight redness for maybe a few minutes to a half hour-</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not anywhere near as bad as plucking a hair from a sensitive place.</li>
            <li> It slows the growth slightly but after months of weekly use there is no difference.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s now been a week and a half since the post office tried delivering it</li>
            <li> The Tria is less potent (at least it&#x27;s less painful) than a salon laser, trust me.</li>
            <li> After two treatments, I&#x27;m noticing less regrowth.  </li>
            <li> The upfront costs for the Silk&#x27;n devices are a couple hundred less than a Tria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would take me 30 minutes to get through 1/2 of my chest, and remember I already had permanent reduction from previous salon treatments.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend$700 to have a SLIGHT reduction.</li>
            <li> The hair seems to be growing in less dense and slower already.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s less hair, but it&#x27;s still there.  </li>
            <li> This really is an idiot-proof (well nearly, there&#x27;s always some idiot out there who might say \\&quot;Hey, will it remove this eyebrow hair?</li>
            <li> Shaving was useless, red bumps &amp; never close enough with a razor;</li>
            <li> so I assumed the pain would be way less.</li>
            <li> DONE 3 BI-WEEEKLY TREATMENTS (LESS THAN 2 MONTHS TIME)</li>
            <li> By the way, the pain was gradually less and less day to day.  </li>
            <li> the only process that truly permanently removes hair is Electrolysis and that is PAINFUL and really expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Typically don&#x27;t even feel it unless it is at the highest setting.</li>
            <li> You may think you are growing less hair until the hair growth cycles catch up</li>
            <li> A half hour of that?  </li>
            <li> Each time it is less hair &amp; less pain.</li>
            <li> and i am a black women</li>
            <li> (They refunded $20 less with no</li>
            <li> I do, however, have less hair on my bikini line than I did when I started.  </li>
            <li> But less pain than tweezing one eyebrow.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll be cheaper than a Tria and a lot less hassle.</li>
            <li> Both devices have serious flaws and do not function properly.  </li>
            <li> I used the laser 3 times on all spots including legs, and each time I used it, the battery lasted less time.</li>
            <li> it is finner and there is less coming in so the hair on my face is less noticabable.</li>
            <li> I do have a somewhat less hairy chest now so that hairs</li>
            <li> Again, I believe that the areas that were treated have less amount of hair.  </li>
            <li> I have caramel skin with black, course, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been two months and the hair on my legs has thinned out to about half the amount of what it is.</li>
            <li> has 90% less hair now (after 4 treatments).  </li>
            <li> I started noticing less hair and also a lot finer.</li>
            <li> the hairs in these areas are coming in less, or finer, or not at all</li>
            <li> Anything less then 30j</li>
            <li> much less any permanant hair removal.  </li>
            <li> I had slightly elevated testosterone, but nothing even close to abnormal.  </li>
            <li> The scab falls off in about a week, leaving less of a freckle.  </li>
            <li> One day I managed to get one and a half legs done</li>
            <li> The result is less or finer hair, but it takes a LOT of patience.</li>
            <li> About a year and a half has passed since I put it aside.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, laser is not permanent, so 10 years later I&#x27;m starting to have to shave again.  </li>
            <li> Now this is my finding from this product that NO ONE has imparted: it does work for ME -- after 3 sessions I saw less hair regrowth on the body parts</li>
            <li> I went and has my underarms done by a spa with a YAG laser and after ONE session, half the hair is gone.  </li>
            <li> I find it odd that this was not designed to function while plugged in.  </li>
            <li> The closer the shave the less pain.  </li>
            <li> We call customer service, they tell us it is out of warranty by less than a week.</li>
            <li> but hey less than</li>
            <li> think I repeated like 20x on my lower half of the legs until again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s because of the color spectrum of light, not the TRIA or any OTHER laser for that matter that it can&#x27;t get those annoying little hairs of other colors.   </li>
            <li> Now after 2 weeks I only have a slight stubble in a few areas with several random hairs here and there.</li>
            <li> The TRIA laser was a huge disappointment!  </li>
            <li> thatsuing was not really an option (she worked in a law firm!).</li>
            <li> I have a few that are dark and accidentally lasered them</li>
            <li> which is not true.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find out after I got it that it was not for use on the neck or face or that it would not work on light or gray hair.  </li>
            <li> About the results there is a result but not good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to drop the Tria ( always keep on floor) as the small screen or the side panel will break...</li>
            <li> Finally resolving to try epilation again, which has problems in similar situations of relatively thick hairs and dense growth except with the added complication of skin tautness being needed to prevent additional (unnecessary) pain.</li>
            <li> Electrolysis is far too slow and expensive for me for all my hair especially since I am a guy</li>
            <li> My only complaint so far, and it is a minor one, is that the unit starts to feel a bit heavy and awkward after awhile.  </li>
            <li> in mind I am pale with dark hair like the product</li>
            <li> I have pale skin and dark hair.  </li>
            <li> I have dark hair and pale skin and am a hairy girl.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin and dark hairs.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a prime candidate with pale skin and dark hair.</li>
            <li> But if it was much larger it may be hard to do the bikini line or toes or small places like that.</li>
            <li> Treatment can be a bit tedious and it can be hard to tell where exactly you&#x27;ve treated and not treated--</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long.</li>
            <li> Just bad genes, lucky me.  </li>
            <li> I was ending up with my worst nightmare and becoming a total homebody.  </li>
            <li> all black people dont waste your money on this product i wish i would of</li>
            <li> In my case, I have pale legs and very thick and coarse and dark black leg hair.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the laser head is small and it does take time</li>
            <li> It is slow - it should work longer on a single charge, or have someway to extend the use at a session ( battery pack?</li>
            <li> I guess the little post office slips saying there is a package at the po are misleading.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product a little over a year ago.</li>
            <li> , it helps to dissipate the pain a little.  </li>
            <li> It still stings a little-</li>
            <li> I have been using my tria laser for a little over a year now.</li>
            <li> Getting a close shave helps a little.  </li>
            <li> The lip hairs are taking a little longer.  </li>
            <li> My little finger and hand hairs cleared in no time.  </li>
            <li> just feel it a little whenI rub my skin.  </li>
            <li> and when I went to shave my legs again, I noticed that that little spot was bald.  </li>
            <li> Also the longer I use it the slower it becomes between pulses - which ends up taking longer than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry - not impressed so far!</li>
            <li> so I know a little about pain.</li>
            <li> Tria, replaced it without issues, however, the shipping could have been a little quicker.  </li>
            <li> It stings a little when you use it.</li>
            <li> It just hurt a little when it happened and after a day or two the scab fell off.</li>
            <li> This is not worth buying AT ALL!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, a little background information:  before even considering laser hair removal I went to see an endocrinologist to determine the underlying cause of my hair growth.  </li>
            <li> 8 Months have gone by with little result</li>
            <li> but I have see little result.</li>
            <li> but I still had to shave a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife a little over a year ago, instead of going to a salon.</li>
            <li> I have black hair and pale skin</li>
            <li> If you are in need of a real laser product, you shouldn&#x27;t be limited to something that only does half the job before cutting out and being a useless lump of plastic</li>
            <li> (And the Tria starts to feel a little heavy after a while.)</li>
            <li> and I have very dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> As mentioned I used to have very dark, noticeable hair</li>
            <li> It worked on very dark hair</li>
            <li> Seems a little lame and if that&#x27;s the case, they should have consumer replaceable batteries or allow use via direct AC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used to get really bad razor burn every time I saved, and now I rarely get that.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s depressing how much time you have to put into it to see no results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just been a lot of pain and wasted money.</li>
            <li> I was told that I would have to ship the broken one back, and then in THREE weeks I should receive the replacement!!!</li>
            <li> But I find if you press the laser window firmly on the skin (not just hovering the skin)</li>
            <li> The product states that after a few months, you should be done.</li>
            <li> The treated leg looks almost as if I just shaved it with just a few stray hairs here and there.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Trai in 2009 and used it for a year for just a few times.</li>
            <li> My batteries dead</li>
            <li> I tried this myself for a few months and it is time consuming as well as the hair falls for a few weeks not forever.</li>
            <li> It was almost 100% gone except for a few hard-to-target stragglers</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a few days after when hairs want to grow in.</li>
            <li> Got my laser a few days ago and have been using it every night.</li>
            <li> I had laser hair removal a few years ago on my armpits and bikini line - to the tune of $2,000.</li>
            <li> All of my grays are sadly left behind.</li>
            <li> It feels like a rubber band popping on you but just for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> and I can go a few days longer without having to shave so it must be growing slower as well.</li>
            <li> I will update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: this product is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> after a few times i saw no results</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> - Don&#x27;t shave but wax after few days.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer mentioned, a few hairs will come out if I tug on them.  </li>
            <li> I would waste hours every day picking and plucking and crying.  </li>
            <li> but I had to keep checking my face everyday after that.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s just a few here and there.</li>
            <li> I have shaved them a few times between sessions</li>
            <li> and I spend everyday at it</li>
            <li> I am going to try using it a few times a week and see what happens.</li>
            <li> round of treatments:&lt;br /&gt;med</li>
            <li> so you end up missing a lot.</li>
            <li> Although, I did see patches of bald spots on my legs a few weeks after I lasered them the three times I could.</li>
            <li> so you do not have to waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line-I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this.</li>
            <li> but this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I let the hairs grow a few days</li>
            <li> I was tired of concealing facial hair and dealing with razor bumps on the bikini area and under arms.    </li>
            <li> I used to shave my hands everyday</li>
            <li> but when I start to use TRIA I shave my hands evrey few months and the hair get thinr</li>
            <li> , I used Tria on my face few time as well and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done YEARS of electrolysis, years of professional laser hair removal(SO expensive), plucking,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Shouldn&#x27;t now waste money like that.</li>
            <li> $400 is nothing to sneeze at, but after a few months of thinking about it, I bought it as a treat for myself after I got a bonus at work.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept at it for a few months, still at level 3, every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> My friend paid twice the amount for a spa treatment and she started a few months before I did</li>
            <li> How do you know if the laser killed the hair at the root?  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I asked to speak to a manager because I could not believe that in 2012 this company had such poor customer service.</li>
            <li> device is heavy</li>
            <li> I wanted to laser off (which was everywhere on my body).After a few months</li>
            <li> AFTER JUST A FEW USES</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> I used it off and on for a few months and then didn&#x27;t need to use it for a while.  </li>
            <li> Supposedly they will have a repair service in a few months, but the CS Rep couldn&#x27;t tell me when that is.  </li>
            <li> I hope you don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this product.</li>
            <li> I think I am impatient  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Worse part as soon as the warranty ended, it only stayed on for a beep/laser or two.</li>
            <li> Then, nothing dead.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> heavy product.</li>
            <li> hours of charging in between (3+ days spent; the time waste sucks</li>
            <li> would give this laser 5 stars since it worked on me, but I wish the laser window was much bigger,so that way you can treat larger area, but for now it&#x27;s just takes forever and gets annoying after a while.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Does this mean that your hair should not grow back, or does this simply mean that you will achieve the maximum benefits from the Tria after a few months?</li>
            <li> There is no way the typical person is going to keep that box around!</li>
            <li> A slight inconvenience, but what should I expect at this price!?  </li>
            <li> I also developed the technique of holding one ice pack underneath my airpit (to numb it) while lasering the other airpit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also pale with darkish hair, which helps.  </li>
            <li> me (pale skin/dark hair)</li>
            <li> pale skin</li>
            <li> other common question/objection I have received is, \\&quot;if</li>
            <li> The other common question/objection I have received is, \\&quot;if</li>
            <li> worst genetic hair combo of fair Swedish skin and heavy and downright aggressive Italian hair, the black diluted with Swedish red- impossible!)</li>
            <li> I just received the Tria  Laser hair removal system for my wife and after she read the instructions on the package it plainly states that DO NOT Use on the FACE HEAD or NECK  </li>
            <li> They quite willingly agreed that they were not the least bit concerned if I was unhappy.  </li>
            <li> i brought this expensive product and i cant even use it because i am dark skin they dont tell you on the commercial that darker tone skin cant use it</li>
            <li> The type of thick black hair when a hair colorist won&#x27;t guarantee color results, the type of hair when you get wax little blood pores are emerging, yes that stubborn type of hair.</li>
            <li> My skin is just about as pale as you can get and my hair is DARK and thick.</li>
            <li> I fully expected to spend money to replace my unit, but the way the company avoids the customer and bully&#x27;s them into purchasing new units is bad practice.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say I did, especially given the serious, serious flaws this product has.</li>
            <li> The enormous head, combined with the tiny laser area makes it almost impossible to see where you have zapped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a patient person, but the head of this laser makes it nearly impossible to do larger areas such as your legs, which is what I hoped to use this for.</li>
            <li> My first laser I bought had a bad battery.  </li>
            <li> , i thought my first session will be painful</li>
            <li> , I find the TRIA pretty painful to use.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if the laser stunted their growth or if it truely killed the hair like it says it does.  </li>
            <li> It still huuurt, even with absolutely no visible hair growth, even while using ice to numb the entire area!</li>
            <li> Was too painful on the lowest setting sent it back the same day.  </li>
            <li> if you have yourself waxed you should wait 6 weeks to shave and laser, but I found it simply too painful to laser after shaving because shaving left course stubbles</li>
            <li> (hopefully for life!)f you have yourself waxed you should wait 6 weeks to shave and laser, but I found it simply too painful to laser after shaving because shaving left course stubbles</li>
            <li> i bought it in october and use it once a week [even though the directions say once every two weeks] i have olive skin and thick black hair.</li>
            <li> The batery life is another complaint - it dies after 45 minutes or so, enogh to do half of my calve.  </li>
            <li> I got this laser about 2 months ago, I have VERY pale skin and very dark</li>
            <li> This thing is not worth $50 much less $400!!!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know why the product has gotten bad reviews unless its just trying to do a large area.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, in fact, I was blessed with very little hair under my arms</li>
            <li> , I have very little sympathy for you.</li>
            <li> Use the laser as recommended, and keep doing it, and eventually you will have very little hair.    </li>
            <li> Guess what still very little to no result.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your hard earned money.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even realize it was as bad as it was because I took so much time hiding it.  </li>
            <li> The biggest drawback, and it&#x27;s one that I&#x27;d considered before buying, is the small size of the laser area.  </li>
            <li> The Tria is also my go-to device for precision work and small bony areas like face, feet, ankles, fingers, etc.</li>
            <li> to my past experience with IPL hair removal in Med spas.</li>
            <li> Ensuring that your laser technician has been properly trained can be difficult (there is no training required in any state.</li>
            <li> I have a condition called PCOS that has caused excessive body hair since puberty.</li>
            <li> I have a condition called PCOS that has caused excessive body hair since puberty.</li>
            <li> There are literally no redeeming qualities to this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tria laser in the past 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I still regret all those wasted weekends of Tria-ing!  </li>
            <li> I have gone to salons in the past and had my underarm hair removed with 100% effectiveness.</li>
            <li> The surface area of the tria device is too small.</li>
            <li> Then I could go over the area again on Level 4 or, usually 5.  </li>
            <li> but it got way too time consuming so that i decided to just do small areas that bothered me.</li>
            <li> Several of our friend had electrolysis hair removal and said it wasn&#x27;t nearly as uncomfortable as the TRIA.</li>
            <li> It will not work on small spots, like toes or fingers because of the design of the tool.</li>
            <li> I have a small scar on my leg that blends in with my skin tone, when I got going I lasered over it</li>
            <li> They charged me 80 dollars to return it because it was past Amazon&#x27;s 1 month return policy date.</li>
            <li> It is like a small sting even at the highest setting.  </li>
            <li> I returned to plucking and I&#x27;m not sure what happened</li>
            <li> It sucks just remembering spending 4-5 hours over the course of a few days zapping away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tria was not effective either and was the biggest waste of money.  </li>
            <li> so small</li>
            <li> which is a small plus.</li>
            <li> the laser area is so small you can&#x27;t get every inch of skin needed for the treatments to work.</li>
            <li> the head is quite small and each session only lasts 20 mintues (but you get bored from doing it any longer).  </li>
            <li> the head is quite small and each session only lasts 20 mintues (but you get bored from doing it any longer).  </li>
            <li> On sensitive areas I use an ice pack before treatment to numb the skin.</li>
            <li> Yes the head is quite small</li>
            <li> I am not sure why.</li>
            <li> ill write back,,</li>
            <li> I received the product today and was anxious to try it out.  </li>
            <li> laser hair removal diferent kinds colors names and it didint remove permantly my hair in the past in salons I dont expect a miracle</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my tria stopped charging properly.</li>
            <li> This was past my warranty and they did not have to do it, but they must value their costumers, so I value them, which is why I took the time to write this review.</li>
            <li> The laser is so small that to do one leg may take an hour</li>
            <li> The spa treatments are so expensive and you only get the areas you pay for whereas the TRIA is yours</li>
            <li> The nozzle is way to small</li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> Im not sure if it helped on legs, but again underarms and bikini area</li>
            <li> often!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> The laser head is SOOOOOO small that it would take hours upon hours, days upon days to get everywhere</li>
            <li> but I was not satisfied.  </li>
            <li> not sure if I&#x27;m going to return it or give as a gift.</li>
            <li> Also as others have mentioned, it does take a lot of time with the small treatment head.  </li>
            <li> Med spas are actually much more affordable now so don&#x27;t bother with this piece of crap!</li>
            <li> laser head is small and it would be nicer if it was about twice the size.</li>
            <li> Yes, if you can afford time and have nothing else to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been doing any treatments for the past six months or so.</li>
            <li> usual charge lasted through the underarm area or the bikini area, but never both together.  </li>
            <li> Wasted time, pain  and money!  </li>
            <li> the pulses (impossible to do on backside areas that you can not directly see and tedious to do on large areas like legs).</li>
            <li> Just because a hair falls out doesn&#x27;t mean the follicle is dead.</li>
            <li> Just because a hair falls out doesn&#x27;t mean the follicle is dead.</li>
            <li> , this laser is very heavy, which can tell you that it&#x27;s not a flimsy product.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t zap very small areas or round areas.  </li>
            <li> No change, whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very optimistic about this product, and was absolutely desperate to at the very least REDUCE my body hair.</li>
            <li> Otherwise the tiny hairs that result could be impossible to laser away, though other methods might work.</li>
            <li> I hate waiting for it to charge because it means I have to schedule different parts of body on different days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> be returning for a refund...too bad, as I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> Also, the head of the laser is so small that one leg would take at least an hour</li>
            <li> Get ready to be disappointed if you decide to buy it.</li>
            <li> Very painful to use, but that is true with with any laser treatment, I guess.</li>
            <li> I noticed these irritating black hairs on my chin and neck.  </li>
            <li> And I will admit it is time consuming, and the charge only lasts about 30 minutes, which was annoying since it takes so long to charge.  </li>
            <li> Limited head size makes use somewhat tedious.</li>
            <li> If you have a hair, it feels like a hard rubberband snap.  </li>
            <li> it is hard to keep track of where you are lasering</li>
            <li> You can hardly see it,</li>
            <li> and I hardly have any hair on my legs.  </li>
            <li> so it is hard for me to tell.  </li>
            <li> and some places are hard to reach by yourself.  </li>
            <li> I worked really hard to like this product.</li>
            <li> The extra piece is a crazy feature.</li>
            <li> please do not let the negative reviews stop you.  </li>
            <li> hope at least to get a refund</li>
            <li> I have had the Tria now for at least eight months.</li>
            <li> I have treated my underarms at least 50 times each side</li>
            <li> After months of painful zapping, each and every hair has returned weeks after completion of lengthy recommended nearly 8 months.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, my review will spare at least one person from losing their money on this junk.</li>
            <li> and I know you will never get rid of all of your hairs forever, but with Tria you can control them at least.</li>
            <li> to deal with this i purchased Dr. Numb a topical cream with lidocaine that numbs the skin, i find that takes the edge off.</li>
            <li> They told me that I was too late and their offer wasn&#x27;t on the table anymore.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not perfect, but its almost the only game in town for home laser use in the US.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At least my face was.  </li>
            <li> The biggest complaint I have is against the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li> but I would say there is at least a 70% reduction there too.  </li>
            <li> at least 30 days so its a scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think its been at least 45 in my neck</li>
            <li> This used to be completely traumatic- painful and time-consuming.</li>
            <li> and nothing changed in the least.  </li>
            <li> It now looks awkward and crooked and I have a permanent raised scar from where the laser zapped the design.  </li>
            <li> I like to charge the laser while I&#x27;m waiting for the numbness to kick in since the ice packs can only numb a section at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stupid thing religiously and I see absolutely no change in my hair quantity or thickness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially I was hesitant about this product because of some of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a desperate female.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the time it takes to charge and only 20 minutes of use just stinks.  </li>
            <li> At least with professionals, I DO KNOW, you get results the 1st time.</li>
            <li> the oldest complaint to the concerned authorities&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; How thick are the hairs at this location?  </li>
            <li> Also, it hurts a lot on the areas with thick, dense hair (bikini and armpits)</li>
            <li> I have thick ichy hair in places i dont want and a rash to go with it.</li>
            <li> Progress is slow on the face</li>
            <li> So if you hate shaving, tweezing, and if the tria is too much money</li>
            <li> And although I do a lot of waxing on my clients, waxing is $50 bucks for a brazilian and is not permanent, yes it may kill a few hair follicles or just thin the hair</li>
            <li> If not, it will be A LOT of wasted time, money, and lots of unnecessary pain.</li>
            <li> but when it&#x27;s those thick hairs, you want to scream.  </li>
            <li> but I hate irritating the area with an electric razor, but I must continue to do so as this was pain for nothing), area just outside inner armpit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So tired of the razor burn everyday.</li>
            <li> Where as other systems charge you the same base price</li>
            <li> I used to have to shave about once every other day, and it would still look miserable thanks to razer burn and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> i purchase this item from Amazon its also my first time using laser product, i was so afraid beacuse i heard from my friends its painful and even expensive when you do it in private clinics</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!</li>
            <li> I mean anywhere theres hair</li>
            <li> On my bikini and underarms I am already seeing small bald spots!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s sorta pointless!</li>
            <li> It is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I decide to return it they said RETURN IS NOT FREE !!</li>
            <li> I was expecting to be left crying and disappointed yet again.  </li>
            <li> Not only did this not remove the black hair on my pale ivory skin, but it was very painful.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the treatment head is very small.</li>
            <li> For me the highest setting can be very uncomfortable, especially on my bikini area.</li>
            <li> For me the trick is to do a very small amount of hair a day.  </li>
            <li> The head on the lasar is very small, so you have to move it about 1/4 of an inch at a time.</li>
            <li> I have used this product about 3 times since purchase and am very anxious to&lt;br /&gt;see</li>
            <li> As I was not pleased with the results, I tired shaving an not shaving before the 2 weeks per area recommended use.</li>
            <li> This is a seriously flawed product which makes laser hair removal a tedious, painful, hugely time consuming endeavor and ultimately an expensive waste of time should it not work, as was in my case.  </li>
            <li> On thick, coarse hair I used the highest setting, which was quite painful.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> may cause serious skin injury.  </li>
            <li> I should mention I&#x27;m rocking a serious Homer Simpson  shadow.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s how long the hair starts to regenerate under the skin) and lasered myself (WAY LESS PAINFUL) and noticed a dramatic decrease in hair growth.  </li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s how long the hair starts to regenerate under the skin) and lasered myself (WAY LESS PAINFUL) and noticed a dramatic decrease in hair growth.  </li>
            <li> I felt little bumps underneath the skin, although not visible but a bit disturbing.  </li>
            <li> I thought that was bad enough...</li>
            <li> Why would you be so pissed off at another customer who left a bad review for a product that didnt work for them?    </li>
            <li> Well let me tell you; on the chest, arms, and upper belly, its not that bad.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also not a good way with the Tria to tell &#x27;where you&#x27;ve been.&#x27;    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use this product at least three times and i would say that results are poor.</li>
            <li> They started off slowly and progressively got worse.  </li>
            <li> Because of my condition there is really never a complete solution unless I can afford a VERY EXPENSIVE laser treatment.</li>
            <li> But I am sick of extra hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Tria last week because I am soooooo sick of having to shave all the time, and get ingrown hairs and razor burn.</li>
            <li> It is also very painful to use on coarse black hair like mine.</li>
            <li> These issues create a slow and laborious treatment experience for some areas and make it nearly impossible to treat other areas.</li>
            <li> At least I can do this at home while watching tv!</li>
            <li> It was extremely tedious because the laser head is small and you have to have overlapping zaps</li>
            <li> Since the laser head is so small it is tedious and time consuming</li>
            <li> I struggled to get to spots that my weak arms just didn&#x27;t want to get to.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Use on my arms was disappointing, but I was less obsessive about them.</li>
            <li> But, I understand why they did it - no need to replace the laser head as in other products (which gets very expensive)</li>
            <li> The Tria on the other hand gives a very uncomfortable burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Instead, the woman came off as very rude and unprofessional instead of helpful.  </li>
            <li> Also, work in patches since this method is very slow and the lack of progress can be discouraging without a visible contrast between completed areas.    </li>
            <li> The arm is taking longer but the hair was very thick</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I give the Tria 4 stars and not 5 is because like other users - the small head is really annoying.  </li>
            <li> It is moderately painful for me, but for anyone who has done waxing, electrolysis, or laser already, it really isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> The type when you shave and a few hours later the dreadful shadow appears.</li>
            <li> I was broken</li>
            <li> I checked one tiny hair stub on my leg that had not fallen out, and attached to its base</li>
            <li> I have also read some reviews that say Tria has poor customer service...</li>
            <li> I had stopped using it for about a year because I got so tired of it.  </li>
            <li> I ended up just getting so tired of it that I stopped using it for a year.  </li>
            <li> And if you are like me and have to keep up with it, the Tria, given how time consuming it is, is not a great purchase to make.  </li>
            <li> and the hair that is there is thin.</li>
            <li> , i realized that my thin hair become thiner then before</li>
            <li> I am also not happy with the length of time</li>
            <li> I listened to music but the TRIA&#x27;s noisiness was irritating.</li>
            <li> I desperately continued off and on with it for about 2 years, giving it another go for a few weeks at a time and then giving up again and losing hope, still with no change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine is out of warranty and the company will not stand behind the product.</li>
            <li> The over lapping that has to be done to make this work made my arm tired.</li>
            <li> so my wrist/arm sometimes gets tired.  </li>
            <li> also used this on my chin on Level 5 (the hair is thin there now</li>
            <li> approximate battery life is around 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is not attractive AT ALL!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery lasts about 40 minutes which is just about the time you get tired of using it for that day.  </li>
            <li> We went to charge it again, but alas, it would not.</li>
            <li> It arrived broken and after reading the enclosed article on how to use this item.....</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference and was NOT happy.  </li>
            <li> had thought about purchasing this system for a few years but was very skeptical and the cost scared me.</li>
            <li> I do not know why the Silk&#x27;n devices are so much less painful, even on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> It is less painful to me than laser in an office.  </li>
            <li> I read that it gets less painful</li>
            <li> But, the difference, after a couple of years, is really dramatic.  </li>
            <li> My hormonal feminizing regimen probably had helped some, but places like my knuckles/hands and my tushy cheeks have shown dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li> The next time I used it on 1 &amp; it was significantly less painful but still very painful.</li>
            <li> and you realize you&#x27;ve wasted painful hours for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is sad that they don&#x27;t stand behind there product.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money :-(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the NO NO, Epilady (very painful), Tri, and Electrolysis (which left scars).</li>
            <li> I purchased this device after hearing recommendations from my sisters, but I was a little disappointed in the efficacy of the machine.  </li>
            <li> and the reduction is not more than 30% for the legs and all the 30% in the quality of the hair not the quantity!!!</li>
            <li> experience was so bad that I have filed a complaint with the FDA.</li>
            <li> but sadly it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> However, it IS tedious to use correctly.  </li>
            <li> $400 failed experiment.</li>
            <li> TRIA do say it will eventually burn out and be rendered useless.</li>
            <li> It is designed to fail.</li>
            <li> Sorry Tria</li>
            <li> Yes, sadly I concur-</li>
            <li> you will NOT be sorry.  </li>
            <li> this thing hurts to use just like the expensive lasers at a spa are said to.  </li>
            <li> I am one of those unfortunate girls with a hormone imbalance.  </li>
            <li> Well I became sad that it seemed like it didnt.  </li>
            <li> but if you go to saloon its really expensive.</li>
            <li> Ours failed after the 5th use.</li>
            <li> For one it was too expensive and</li>
            <li> Sorry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect of course but look at what they are giving you for this price.  </li>
            <li> Expensive &amp; did not work at all.</li>
            <li> Terrible Product &amp; a Hassle to get your money back.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just randomly zap yourself.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought the TRIA.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it requires \\&quot;activation\\&quot; in order to use it.  </li>
            <li> I didint got it before because I is expensive for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I was unable to afford expensive laser hair removal treatments.  </li>
            <li> I WAS SILLY TO BUY SOMETHING  SO COSTLY</li>
            <li> The stuff starts getting expensive</li>
            <li> Asked what happens if it fails after a year and was told..</li>
            <li> I emailed the company 2 times with my concerns and they failed to respond.</li>
            <li> AND IT IS SO EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> Setting it up was weird.  </li>
            <li> (LHR works but it requires routine upkeep) &amp; in some places its even worse!</li>
            <li> I WILL ADD TO MY FAILED LIST.</li>
            <li> What a pathetic excuse for a \\&quot;quality\\&quot; product.</li>

            <li> I was broken so I returned it.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product . Does it eliminate hair permanently? No... But it does diminish it greatly . Takes time and patience. This is my second tria and been using it for 4 years. And I am not hair free. This product just thinned my hair . But it seems some of my hair is growing back again. :( I don&#x27;t think this is permanent hair removal  I guess.  everyone body is different.</li>
            <li> it works really well. it easy to use and easy to carry. love it. definitely should have one at home.</li>
            <li> It works.  You just have to be patient.  And it has more of a bite than when you go to get it done professionally.</li>
            <li> My husband planned a 3 week trip to Tahiti/Bora Bora. Instead of being excited, I was apprehensive about 3 weeks straight in a bikini. I have tried everything to maintain my bikini area and nothing has worked. It&#x27;s just been a lot of pain and wasted money. That&#x27;s when I found the Tria Laser. What a life saver!!! I started using the laser (faithfully every 12 days) in November and I was ready for our trip in April. I spent 3 weeks in Tahiti and never thought about my bikini line! This little laser made my entire vacation more pleasurable and a fantastic experience. Not only did it remove the unwanted hair, it took away all of my embarrassment and worries!</li>
            <li> I was soooooooo excited to be hair free when I ordered this but sadly it doesn&#x27;t work. I swear I am more hairy then ever now! #gorilla 4 life!</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have been using the TRIA for 4 weeks now and have already noticed a difference on my legs and underarms. I will certainly keep at it to be hair-free by summer!</li>
            <li> I used product bi-weekly as tria consultant recommended for over 5 months and had no reduction in hair at all. Tria claims to show results after the 3rd month of treatment. I stopped usage after seeing no results. Do not buy this product. It does not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THE CAN SAVE ME SOME MONEY &amp; IN THE SAME TIME BE ABLE TO DO IT AT HOME SO GOT THE TRIA AND I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY ABOUT IT, AH AND I GIVE IT JUST 4 STAR JUST BECAUSE GOT IT ALMOST A MONTH AGO AND STILL TO EARLY TO SEE BIG CHANGES BUT I NOTICE SOME SMALL ONE ALREADY , VERY GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Before there was hair removal, I dreamed there would come a day. Today is not that day! I bought the advanced \\&quot;new\\&quot; version, with 5 levels. However, now it has an extra piece that you need to unlock and turn it on. (One more piece to carry,loose,break!). Well, my laser shows that it is charged and I \\&quot;tried\\&quot; to \\&quot;unlock\\&quot; the laser. But it won&#x27;t seen to turn on properly! Which piece is the problem? I spent $500 and can not even try it. The extra piece is a crazy feature. #1. There does not seem to be a way to replace the battery. #2.You can&#x27;t use the laser without it! I brought this heavy, cumbersome laser with me, because I travel, but not the giant box it came in and my time is almost up to return it. I would still be willing to try it again, if they get rid of the third piece(put the lock on the laser)!! Make it lighter and/or from what I read, get the charge to last longer! Wish me luck with the return!</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t see results</li>
            <li> I bought this product and was only able to use it once before it quit working.  What I mean is, when plugged in it registers a charge, but when unplugged and unlocked, it completely dies. I called up the customer service line hoping there was some unlock or advice they could give to help right away.  Instead, the woman came off as very rude and unprofessional instead of helpful.  I was told that I would have to ship the broken one back, and then in THREE weeks I should receive the replacement!!! Here I thought the schedule was key and they can&#x27;t even get replacement to you within three weeks. So, after mulling it over for a day I emailed the customer service department just explaining (nicely) what I thought of the experience.  Guess what? NO reply and it&#x27;s been a couple days.  I hope I get the opportunity to see if this product really works....    ***As of May 2011, I have decided to return the product.  It slows the growth slightly but after months of weekly use there is no difference. After a few weeks of not using it, it&#x27;s the same as before treatments.  No difference.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this!! I wish people wouldn&#x27;t give decent reviews until they&#x27;ve tried it for many months.    Also I called and asked for the return process and was told to mail back.  I did, and it&#x27;s now been a week and a half since the post office tried delivering it and no one from the company has even bothered picking up the package.  I called today and they&#x27;re response was they didn&#x27;t know? I guess the little post office slips saying there is a package at the po are misleading.  Oh yeah, and it will take another two weeks for them to return my money.</li>
            <li> **Update 4 July 2011**  Will eventually rewrite this review using long-term results. Using too few pulses will lead to no reduction in hair growth, or at best thinner hairs, because insufficient heat was absorbed to destroy all hair-producing cells, even if it was enough to weaken the hair root allowing the hair to fall out. Growth might be slow, but eventually the hair will grow back.    To prevent this from happening, it is essential to use enough pulses to completely remove the hair follicle on the first try, since later passes in the months following will both consume a large amount of time, and will have lower chances of success if the hair has become thinner. This means knowing how many pulses are enough to simply make the hair fall out, and then exceeding that number to ensure the follicle is completely destroyed. To gather this data, the original suggestion of epilating prior to using TRIA should not be followed, since the best way to check if TRIA is working is to use tweezers, or even your fingers to check if the hair can be easily removed several seconds after finishing the series of pulses.    By far the most significant factors in applying enough heat to the follicle are wetting the skin, which both provides cooling from evaporation and also moderates the temperature increase of the outer skin surface preventing burns; cooling with ice, beforehand and possibly between TRIA pulses; and applying all pulses to a specific hair follicle in rapid succession, instead of moving away from the area and later returning multiple times to overlap coverage. Heat dissipates very quickly from a hair to the surrounding area, but the follicle only needs to be at a high enough temperature for a few moments. Also, work in patches since this method is very slow and the lack of progress can be discouraging without a visible contrast between completed areas.    Guidelines:  &amp;nbsp; - The relatively thick hairs found in particular areas can be removed with no resistance with aslittle as 1~2 full-power pulses, but to prevent regrowth this number needs to be increased. I am currently testing having used 3~4 pulses in rapid succession, with both ice (which cools the follicle as well) and wetting the skin (which mainly prevents burns).  &amp;nbsp; - For legs, applying pulses in overlapping lines (moving about half the diameter of treatment window after each pulse, so each follicle receiving 2~3 pulses during a pass) lead to significant reduction of growth for several months, but many (40~70%) regrew at a similar or thinner width. A thinner hair just means more pulses are needed to remove it again, if it can be removed at all. Currently testing 4~6 pulses in rapid succession with ice beforehand and wetting the skin, which seems to be enough to remove most hairs in the correct growth phase (thinner hairs that aren&#x27;t growing and don&#x27;t hurt when lasered are just pulled out after several pulses to avoid confusion and wasting pulses).  &amp;nbsp; - For arms, while hairs are smaller than on legs they are comparable in size to the thinner hairs that result from insufficient pulses on legs. While I have tried to do arms several times, ranging from several pulses on power 4 (out of 5) with cooling to a full-power pulse with no cooling to 2 pulses per hair without cooling, this significantly underestimated the number of pulses necessary for hairs of this size. Now have several test patches, which required as many as 6~8 pulses (with cooling prior and once during) for the targeted hairs to be easily removed with no resistance.  &amp;nbsp; - Armpits/underarms: Several attempts for the entire areas. The hairs might have reduced in size, not sure since nothing to compare them to, but the technique used simply did not apply enough heat, and overlapping coverage just caused pain because there was too much time to dissipate heat between passes. The method of testing ease of removal seems to be the most reliable way to know how many pulses are needed, but currently for meother areas have priority.    It is easy to vastly underestimate how much time may be needed to permanently remove hairs using the TRIA! Using just 1~2 pulses at full power may take a moderate amount of time comparable to say epilating, but this will be completely ineffective at permanently removing hairs, much less when judging based off the smaller amount of time to cover an area at a lower power setting. Test the effectiveness by pulling out a representative hair after using TRIA on it, or risk having to do the same area again (having fewer hairs in the 1cm window does not mean it goes faster!) using even more pulses per hair a few months later when the hairs in that area regrow!    Hairs using a smaller number of pulses have taken significantly longer to regrow than from epilation (2 months as opposed to 3 weeks) and are thinner than before, but the area still has to be redone. If this regrowth can be prevented by increasing the number of pulses, this review will be updated and condensed to reflect that result.    **end update**  Original review:      First and foremost: some pain is necessary, but most pain is unnecessary!    Whether or not the TRIA laser is effective depends on several factors&amp;#8212;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; The colour of the skin and hair, but also...  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; Depth of the hair follicle from the skin surface.  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; Size of the follicle.  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; Width of the hair at the surface.  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; Number of hairs within the area of the treatment head (hair density).    If enough laser light is delivered to the hair follicle within a small enough amount of time, it will heat up to the point that the hair follicle is destroyed. The two main reasons that this temperature is not reached are the sections of hairs at the surface of the skin heating to the point of causing localized damage, or a general rise in temperature of the entire area of skin being treated to the point that damage results.    The second effect can be mitigated by cooling the skin and continuing to direct laser pulses towards the follicle; but the first, of damage at the surface around hairs, can only be addressed by removing the hairs to prevent them from absorbing laser light at the skin&#x27;s surface.    According to the instructions epilation should be avoided for 4~6 weeks prior to the first use of TRIA laser. This may be fine for those with the most ideal skin tones, since most of the laser light can reach the follicle and hairs that are slightly visible after shaving help guide where to use the laser. Those who do not have ideal skin tones should consider the following on whether to epilate prior to TRIA laser use:  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; Is the area of skin being treated darker than other areas of your body?  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; Do the hairs come straight out, or are they slanted making the roots closer to the skin surface?  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; How thick are the hairs at this location?  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; How dense is the hair growth?    All of these combined, on if you should epilate can be answered with one simple result from using the TRIA laser: It hurts!! And what&#x27;s more, even if you withstand a full treatment of the area, it will have virtually no effect since not enough light is reaching the follicles despite a similar intensity working perfectly fine to remove hair on other areas of your body. This is what tells you of the need to epilate that area for TRIA to work.      My own experience:    Tried TRIA on lowest setting and it hurt so much I waited for a satin smooth res-q pain relief product to arrive.    After an hour with a very generous coat of 4% lidocaine product applied, the area felt somewhat numb and the pain was almost bearable for a moderate power setting with the TRIA laser. However, despite the overall temperature of the area of skin feeling very warm and pain relief cream to the point that a tiny amount seeped inside the treatment head to the other side of the transparent window forming a small, clear yellow spot, the pain was still intense and despite using the entire battery charge with a power setting of 3~4 and repeating areas as dictated by the instructions, there was no noticeable reduction in hair growth except at the very edges of the area where hairs grew slanted with the roots close to the skin&#x27;s surface.    What did happen, was it seemed oil glands opening on to the hair shafts had been damaged by the intense heat flux, causing a crusty residue around the hairs and other signs of damage to the skin immediately surrounding each hair! And yet a week later, those same hairs had seen no reduction in growth rate.    Next: using cold water to cool the skin, without the pain relief product, to try to focus the effect of TRIA laser on the roots of the follicles. Another full battery charge later, surprisingly with the same amount or less pain due to the numbing action of cold on surrounding nerves, there was again no noticeable reduction of hair in that area.    Finally resolving to try epilation again, which has problems in similar situations of relatively thick hairs and dense growth except with the added complication of skin tautness being needed to prevent additional (unnecessary) pain. It may even be necessary to use tweezers, which may take several hours but as you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s worth it...    The next attempt was two days after epilation. It still huuurt, even with absolutely no visible hair growth, even while using ice to numb the entire area! Then again another two days after that. The result as seen several weeks later...  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; 95% reduction of hairs rate on areas of 2~3 pulses on maximum power average coverage.  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; 60% reduction of hairs (uneven) on areas of 1.5~2 pulses on maximum power, due to bending to reduce the amount of pulses needed to cover the area, instead of trying to stretch the skin to bring roots of the follicles closer to the surface of the skin.    On a different area with similar hair density, overlapping coverage of 2~3 pulses on cooled skin, one day after epilation, has lead to approximately 90% reduction of hairs at that area four weeks after a single session of TRIA laser, despite that the skin was actually slightly too dark to register as green on the skin sensor compared to skin tone of the surrounding areas. An agonizing session a week beforehand had lead to practically zero reduction of growth and even a slight burn due to over-application of laser light &gt;.&lt; Even when using ice to cool! A nearby region with slightly less dark skin (registering green on sensor) with slanting hairs and follicles close to the surface and equivalent density seemed to not have resulted in significant reduction prior to epilation, but a month afterwards that particular area is down 60~80% from normal (patchy) despite not having gone over that area a second time, but this unexpected result was due to the direction of hair growth allowing much more of the light to reach the hair roots instead of just being absorbed at the surface.      So as you can see, if you are accustomed to epilating before making the choice to invest in the TRIA laser, don&#x27;t hesitate to do so one last time several days before using the TRIA on an area with relatively small follicles such as the leg, or the day before or even the day of for areas with somewhat larger hairs like the delicate zone. You will probably not have a reason to do so later on as identifying single hairs will become the focus instead of broad swaths of laser pulse application.    Other things to keep in mind:  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; While using ice to cool the entire area does reduce pain, it also increases the number of pulses that must be applied per unit area.  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; A momentary touch from ice or another cold object can cool the skin surface enough to keep it from being damaged for those with darker skin tones, while not propagating deeper within the skin before the destruction of the hair follicles can occur from repeated laser pulses.  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; Just like with electrolysis, when the follicle is destroyed the resistance of the hair to being pulled out weakens drastically. If a hair doesn&#x27;t do this when you apply the usual number of pulses, try tweezing it out and you&#x27;ll probably see the hair narrowing as it approached the follicle and a pale dot at its end, which didn&#x27;t absorb sufficient laser light to die and means the hair was in the wrong growth phase.  &amp;nbsp;&amp;#8227; Aim for the root of the follicle! When cleaning up isolated hairs on your legs this depends on the sub-surface hair length for slanted hairs. May help to not shave for several days so you can see which hairs are still growing.      **First Update, 22 May 2011**: minor regrowth in a few areas, though I still haven&#x27;t finished legs. 3~5 full-power pulses on a single hair takes a while if you&#x27;re not dedicated, even if it is mostly permanent. If it&#x27;s hairs in the same place that appear instead of vellus hairs converting due to hormones, it&#x27;s probably because part of the follicle didn&#x27;t receive enough heat. Be generous and give an extra laser pulse more than what&#x27;s necessary for the hair to simply fall out, to make sure enough heat reaches all of the epithelial cells of the hair matrix. Otherwise the tiny hairs that result could be impossible to laser away, though other methods might work. If you are trying to completely remove even the smaller hairs, be sure to appropriately increase the number of pulses according to size of the hairs being treated as a smaller hair root both absorbs less heat and dissipates it more quickly between pulses. However, if you have experienced pale dots on skin from loss of melanin, you might want to just accept that small hairs might remain where larger ones were. I checked one tiny hair stub on my leg that had not fallen out, and attached to its base was a tiny new hair much smaller than the original, due to the hair production cells which did not receive enough heat when the area was treated.</li>
            <li> Have been using as directed since January 2011.  Using the Tria is very time-consuming for large areas - takes forever to do your legs and you must recharge often.  So far, no noticeable difference in hair growth and/or appearance in any of the treated areas (underarms, bikini line and legs).  I do not recommend this product, especially at such a high cost.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom for Christmas in 2010. I couldn&#x27;t resist trying it out before wrapping it up for her. It&#x27;s easy to get it activated with the skin test sensor (so only &#x27;appropriate&#x27; skin types can use the machine...darker skin types could burn) once you call the company to turn activate the unit for the first use. I&#x27;ve had professional laser hair removal before so I have a basis for comparison. Though the Tria is obviously less intense, I definitely felt the snap of the laser and could smell the hair burning, which means it was doing something.     It&#x27;s a nice size, it covers more area than typical at-home lasers for hair removal. It feels strong. And it seems solidly built.    However, it&#x27;s only 8 months later and my mom has said the product no longer works. It is still under warranty BUT the company somehow cannot find us in the system and will not return it until they do (curious since you have to call the company to activate when you receive it. How could we not be in their system?). They&#x27;ve been giving my mom the run around for 4 weeks now. I found the receipt from Amazon and hopefully that will fix this problem. However, the store claims that we need the box itself to get an exchange. This box is HUGE! There is no way the typical person is going to keep that box around! Basically, I question the professionalism of the store. Their product was defective and they aren&#x27;t (so far) honoring their warranty.    My mom says that after 8 months of use, her hair is thinner, but certainly not gone. If you are interested in completely (or almost completely) eradicating the hair, you will be disappointed in this product. I would advise finding a professional laser hair removal place. In my mom&#x27;s case, however, this is a &#x27;hobby&#x27; of hers and I think she enjoys doing the laser herself. :)</li>
            <li> Okay from what I understand I&#x27;m supposed to use tria in the beginning then end of the month, is that it ? And it really hurts so using a level 3.. Will or will not help me ? Sometimes I even go to a 1.. Would that make that less effective? Should I just toughen up and stick with a 4.. Thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this product a little over a year ago. I have used it with ok results it does make the hair come back a little less.  The PROBLEM is that after about 15-25 uses it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge and is worthless. It will only do 1-2 pulses and will not do any more unless you plug it in again where it will tell you it is Recharged but AGAIN will not do more than 2 Pulses.  I Called customer Service and ask them to either a FIX the product or a simple REPLACEMENT and nothing more. They told me \\&quot;\\&quot;NO\\&quot; and told me I would have to PURCHASE a new one at the Full Retail Price.  As Stated above i used this product only approximately 15-25 times and they told me that it doesn&#x27;t matter how many times you use it.  Regardless.. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT if you plan on using it more than a couple of times!   Sadly Disappointed,  K</li>
            <li> let me just start by saying i never write reviews unless the product surpasses my expectations of it. i have read many mixed reviews and after two years of research i finally decided to buy the tria. i bought it in october and use it once a week [even though the directions say once every two weeks] i have olive skin and thick black hair. i honestly did not think it would work but to my surprise, my hair has been reduced after only two months of use! i bought the tria because i have hair EVERYWHERE. that i normally shave off [legs, stomach, chest, arms] and wax any hair on my face/neck. i just recently started to notice the reduction in the hair. i would say its about 20% so far gone/thinner. i think maybe it would be more if the pain was more tolerable. i have two tattoos so i have a pretty good tolerance for pain, but this thing hurts. i can only stand using it on a setting of 3 on my chest/face. everywhere else i can only use a 1 or 2. but, on the plus side, it doesnt take long to use. i&#x27;m usually done in 15 min with my entire body. [i tend to speed through legs because those hurt the most] for those of you wondering what it feels like-i would say like a burn by a flat iron on a setting of 5, the setting of one doesn&#x27;t feel like anything though. hope this review helps those of you who are on the fence.</li>
            <li> When we received it I have to admit it is easy to operate but you must read the instructions carefully there are very specific proceedures to follow to activate the machine. If not followed properly then the macine will not function at all. So far though my wife has used it once and you can feel something, but it is too early to tell just how effective it is.</li>
            <li> I must say I was skeptical about the home laser treatments but the return policy was too good not to try it!  First of all, you have to understand the why and how lasers work to remove hair.  This type of laser ONLY works best on lighter skin tones with darker hair growth.  And you have to be honest about the areas you want to remove....the hair on your head may be brown but the hair on your legs may be blonde.  If you are looking to remove your blonde leg hair - it is not going to work. If your hair is mostly red or blonde or gray - it is probably not gonna reduce your hair growth to satisfaction.  But if you can see your dark hair follicle even after you shave your legs (or wherever) - it should work just fine.  If your skin is darker or too tan - check the chart on TRIA&#x27;s website to make sure it will be safe for you to use...dark skin can burn!  If your skin and hair tone is in the &#x27;laser zone&#x27; - then all you gotta do is STAY ON SCHEDULE and be patient!  First 3 months - you must do your areas every two weeks.  After that - it is only once a month.  My hairless bottom line is that it is working for me!  I did my legs, bikini line, and underarms after 4 months of being on schedule and I have very little to no hair growing back.  The hair that does grow back is very fine.  I have been using it at the highest level - which does hurt much like a big rubber band snap.  But I find if you press the laser window firmly on the skin (not just hovering the skin), it helps to dissipate the pain a little.  I will keep using it, but most LPL laser literature that I have read states you will see most hair removal at 8 months.  Also, it will eat up a day if you are doing several body areas at once.  This is because it takes about 1.5 hours to recharge the battery after about 20 mins at the highest level.  But you learn to break it up and maybe start early on a Saturday so that you can get house chores done, etc. while you are waiting for the recharge.  A slight inconvenience, but what should I expect at this price!?  I will post my results after 8 months!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Tria through Amazon in mid February 2012. It is now March 25th and I have used the Tria a handful of times on my chin. I am almost completely hair free. I did break the rules and used it on my chin, but I&#x27;ve had professional treatments in a salon on my chin and upper lip and nothing happened. The Tria is less potent (at least it&#x27;s less painful) than a salon laser, trust me. I have brown hair and light skin.  I was paying somewhere around $200 per session in the salon so I could only go about two or three times which wasn&#x27;t enough to do the job. I used the Tria every other day or so to speed up the process (I guess it doesn&#x27;t really speed it up) and immediately the hairs seemed to crystalize and just fall off, never to regrow again (so far).  I am SO happy with my Tria. I can go out with confidence now and not stubble or redness from plucking. For this reason alone I would purchase it again if I had to. The only dissapointment is that I do NOT have the patience to even start lasering a leg. It is a long, long process and I just don&#x27;t have that kind of time.  I am ALL leg anyway at 5&#x27;10\\&quot;. Maybe during the summer when I&#x27;m off I can work on that. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has light skin and even medium brown to black hair. I was dissapointed many times by reviews I read when people said it didn&#x27;t work. What you have to remember is that some people don&#x27;t have dark enough hair and some people don&#x27;t use it faithfully. It&#x27;s only as good as the operator.  I wish people could post pictures of their skin/hair color. This would help future buyers make a more informed decision.  Overall, I LOVE THE TRIA!!!</li>
            <li> I just have some questions about this product. I have read a lot of reviews, as well as the product description. The product states that after a few months, you should be done. Does this mean that your hair should not grow back, or does this simply mean that you will achieve the maximum benefits from the Tria after a few months? I have also read some reviews that say Tria has poor customer service...if a Tria employee reads this, is there any guarantee that the product will work, is there a certain warranty, will it be replaced if it breaks-I would like some written statement from someone from the company in case there is a problem with the product. I am not positive this is the product for me. I have light skin and dark hair. I have been getting traditional laser hair removal on my underarms and such, but want to treat my legs at home. I have had more treatments than is typical because my esthetician believes I have PCOS-will this product still be effective for me? Can anyone tell me if they have used the Silk&#x27;n or the NoNo, and how they might compare to this product. I want to do my homework before I make a decision-all pretty pricey...got to get the best quality for the price! Thanks so much. Oh, and ignore my rating-I had to do that in order to place these questions on amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put 5 stars because I have personally seen the Tria be effective, but this is not a review. I just felt compelled to point out something misleading: on the main page, Amazon shows three items \\&quot;frequently bought together...\\&quot; with the Tria. Right now, one is a pair of red-orange \\&quot;Bynovel Laser Eye Protection Safety Glasses\\&quot;. Please know two things: 1) the Tria is designed for use without safety glasses (just don&#x27;t use it anywhere near your eyes!) and 2) those specific glasses listed only protect against blue and green lasers. The Tria uses an 810 nm near-infrared laser (visually it appears a dull red color), so those glasses would not shield against it.  Please don&#x27;t try to use the Tria near your eyes and assume glasses or goggles designed for a different wavelength would help.  Note: I do have a physics background, and I do work with Tria lasers.</li>
            <li> I have had it for about 5 months, and have lasered about 15 times, but I have to admit, I haven&#x27;t been the most diligent about doing it on the recommended schedule, I just do it when I have time, but I really haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in hair density.  Also, it hurts a lot on the areas with thick, dense hair (bikini and armpits) so I end up having to use it on the lowest setting in those areas, which is the least effective setting.  I don&#x27;t have a particularly low threshold for pain (plucking doesn&#x27;t hurt me) but this laser really does hurt!  I am not so happy with it.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to fully review this product, as it is one that is expected to take time for true results to show.  I have had mine a few months now, and so far I feel that it is working.  After two treatments, I&#x27;m noticing less regrowth.  The biggest drawback, and it&#x27;s one that I&#x27;d considered before buying, is the small size of the laser area.  It does take time to cover large areas.  If you think this will be a problem for you, you might consider if the greater expense of the Silk&#x27;n might be worth it for your needs.   There&#x27;s also not a good way with the Tria to tell &#x27;where you&#x27;ve been.&#x27;    My solution, FWIW, was to draw a grid of roughly one to two inch sections on my leg with a white pencil.  By focusing on one grid at a time, it was easier to get full coverage and be sure of where I&#x27;d treated.  I checked off the grids as I completed them, so I&#x27;d know which sections were done.  So far, I am happy with this purchase, and will try to remember to update.  :)</li>
            <li> I have a \\&quot;Tria\\&quot; (Pulsed Diode Laser) and now both, a \\&quot;Veet Infini&#x27;silk PRO\\&quot; and a \\&quot;Veet Infini&#x27;silk\\&quot; made by \\&quot;Silk&#x27;n\\&quot; (Intense Pulsed Light &#x3D; IPL) for at-home hair removal. I have also experienced both of these Hair Removal technologies (Pulsed Diode Laser/\\&quot;PDL\\&quot; and Intense Pulsed Light/\\&quot;IPL\\&quot;) at Medical Spas with professional grade machines. I have fair skin and thick black hair which makes me an ideal user for all forms of Laser Hair Removal (LHR).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth mentioning that I have a condition called PCOS that causes excessive hair on women(more on this later). I have battled this since I was a teenager and I am 39 now. I started LHR in my early 20s and have experienced all forms of Laser Hair Removal (LHR) in medical settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In medical spas, I have had superior results with Pulsed Diode Lasers. By this, I mean that more hair follicles died and has not regrown significantly (about 5% regrowth). With Intense Pulsed Light, the areas I had professionally treated have regrown by about 50% over the years. Having said that, I have found that the Tria and the Silk&#x27;n products are suited to different uses for me. I will explain...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tria is a great product that I have extensively used. It works well, but it&#x27;s main drawbacks are the tiny treatment area (about 1/4 inch round), the need to repeatedly lift the device off the skin between pulses (strains wrist/hand after a few minutes), and the need to \\&quot;overlap\\&quot; the pulses (impossible to do on backside areas that you can not directly see and tedious to do on large areas like legs). It is also very painful to use on coarse black hair like mine. These issues create a slow and laborious treatment experience for some areas and make it nearly impossible to treat other areas. I like to use the Tria for quick spot treatments on new hairs on easy-to-see/ easy-to-reach areas. The Tria is also my go-to device for precision work and small bony areas like face, feet, ankles, fingers, etc. Unlike the Veet Infini&#x27;Silk Pro (Silk&#x27;n), the Tria has an onboard battery so you can do your treatments on your bed or sofa or where ever you like. The disadvantage to this is that the battery is not replaceable and will eventually wear out (however, mine is still working after 6 years). The Silk&#x27;n devices have to be plugged in so you are tethered to a 6 ft cord, but there is no battery to wear out. Only the bulb cartridge wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some advantages to the Veet Silk&#x27;n products. The PRO version boasts a much larger treatment surface of approx. 1/2in x 1 1/4in (1.3cm x 3cm) while the smaller Infini&#x27;silk has a treatment area of .9cm x 3cm. These are MUCH larger treatment areas than the Tria (which has a treatment area about 1/3 the size of the smaller Infini&#x27;silk). Unlike the Tria, the Veet devices do not need to be lifted from the skin between pulses and the pulses do not need to be overlapped. You can just hold down the button as you \\&quot;flash, glide, flash, glide\\&quot; and the devices predictably and consistently flash every 3.5 seconds as you work along. The Silk&#x27;n devices have a \\&quot;raised rectangle\\&quot; on the heads that leaves a temporary impression on your skin that makes it very easy to see where you just treated so you neither overlap or leave gaps between pulses. With the large treatment areas and no need to overlap pulses, the Silk&#x27;n Pro allows me to treat larger and hard to see areas MUCH more quickly than the Tria. The upfront costs for the Silk&#x27;n devices are a couple hundred less than a Tria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use both the Tria and the Silk&#x27;n devices on their highest settings (5). The pain from the Tria can only be described as intense. I use both ice packs and numbing cream with it. The pain from the Silk&#x27;n devices(IPL) is negligible by comparison and I have not needed any cooling or numbing for them even on sensitive areas. This was not my experience with IPL in Medical Spas. With both IPL and Laser (Ruby and Diode) Hair removal, I needed numbing before treatmentand ice packs during treatment. I do not know why the Silk&#x27;n devices are so much less painful, even on the highest setting. It may be related to the particular light wavelengths, the light filter(s) on the cartridge, the wattage, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to my past experience with IPL hair removal in Med spas. With only a couple of exceptions, I dreaded going to a facility to have my treatments done. For those of you that have never been for laser hair removal in a derm or med spa, it can be a harrowing experience. The powerful equipment they use is not as fool-proof as the at-home devices are. The possibility of burns is very real (I have been burned... by a doctor who was trying out his new laser without training). If you want to see what what it looks like to get burns, do a google search of \\&quot;laser hair removal burns\\&quot; to see what untrained technicians have done to people. Ensuring that your laser technician has been properly trained can be difficult (there is no training required in any state. Some states (not most) require that the spa simply must have a \\&quot;doctor\\&quot; that has agreed to put his name behind it, or that a nurse actually operate the laser... but doctors and nurses do not get laser training in med school). This is why ALL of these facilities require you to sign a broad medical and liability release that includes burns, disfiguring injuries and poor/ no results. Getting a laser technician that is trained, competent, experienced, hygienic (and makes you feel comfortable during treatment) can be very challenging. I have been told by more than one facility, that not too many people ask the questions I ask, such as \\&quot;How do you sterilize the laser tip in between patients?\\&quot;. I walked out of more than one facility because they did not have a satisfactory answer or looked at me with puzzlement when I asked this question. With all LHR, there is a part of the device that touches the skin (genitals, butts, arm pits, faces, lips, hands, feet, wounds, rashes, skin afflictions, etc.) and can transmit disease if not sterilized between each patient. Hello! this should be a very basic protocol, but many facilities don&#x27;t even bother with sanitizing the devices, much less sterilizing them between patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went through a couple of years worth of monthly treatments on several areas of my body with IPL exclusively (same technology as the Infini&#x27;silk devices). I had a wonderful, highly trained technician with multiple training certifications and significant experience with a state of the art machine. The areas I had treated with IPL lost about 70-90% of the existing hair and kept it that way for about 2 years. Slowly the hair grew back in to about 50% over the course of the next 3-4 years and then stayed that way. Alternatively, the areas that I had professionally treated with true lasers (same technology as Tria device) have remained nearly hair free for the duration of my post treatment years (7-15 years depending on when the treatments were performed). So I had \\&quot;superior\\&quot; results with true Laser hair removal and \\&quot;good\\&quot; results with IPL. If I was going back to a Med Spa for treatment, I would not do IPL again, but for home use, Yes. The advantages of the Infini&#x27;silk for large and hard to see areas are acceptable trade offs for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important point about LHR (of any kind). The only hairs that are actually killed are the ones that are zapped in the growth phase. Just because a hair falls out doesn&#x27;t mean the follicle is dead. Getting hairs to fall out and actually killing them are two different things. This is the biggest reason why repeated treatments are necessary. Not all the hairs you zap are in the \\&quot;growth phase\\&quot;. You will have to go over the same areas several times over the course of months to eventually catch all of the hairs in their growth phase. And of course, as you are zapping away, it is possible that your hormones are working against you and sprouting brand new follicles (not new hairs in the dead follicles that you have killed with the laser). IPL or laser will eventually kill all of your current hair follicles, but your body will form new ones over time. Future treatments will be needed to maintain the results. Hair growth is controlled by hormones (and genetics). In my case, because of PCOS, I will likely be doing hair removal to some degree for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some significant differences between the two Infini&#x27;silk devices. The biggest difference is the size of the treatment area. The Infini&#x27;silk PRO has a treatment area about 1/3 LARGER than the Infini&#x27;silk model. This may not seem like much, but if you are treating large areas of your body, this extra size makes a big difference in treatment times, i.e. The Infini&#x27;silk PRO will take you only 20 minutes to do a lower leg, while the Infini&#x27;silk will take 30 minutes to do the same area. The second big difference is that the PRO model has a replaceable bulb that lasts 5,000 pulses and the smaller Infini&#x27;silk bulb can not be replaced, but lasts 50,000 pulses. Keep in mind that the smaller unit has a smaller treatment area so it will need 3 pulses to cover the same area as 2 pulses from the PRO model. Otherwise, the units function the same way. They look different and are sized differently, but the wavelength, power and pulse duration are the same. I prefer the larger PRO model because the larger treatment area saves me time, but if you are only treating small areas like face, underarms, bikini line, etc. the Infini&#x27;silk is more than adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t follow the protocols, you won&#x27;t get satisfactory results. There is no cheating or shortcuts that will cause these devices to magically work. Make sure that your skin and hair colors will work with them, follow the protocol, and you will get results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a genuine review based on my first hand experience with the Tria and Veet products and my accumulated knowledge of LHR. I have a condition called PCOS that has caused excessive body hair since puberty. After some really bad bleeding, scarring and results from \\&quot;sugaring\\&quot;, epilating, waxing and electrolysis, my parents purchased my first LHR series for me in my early 20s. I am 37 now. Over the course of my life, I have researched and tried every method of hair removal out there including every type of LHR. LHR is the only method that really made a difference and it has has changed my life for the better. I am happy to share my hard earned knowledge with others and I do this freely. I hope this review is helpful for folks looking for at-home laser hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other common question/objection I have received is, \\&quot;if you have been getting laser hair removal done for years, why do you still need a Tria or Veet?\\&quot;. I think the main part of the answer to that question is already thoroughly explained in the above review and can be summed up with \\&quot;because hormones and genetics cause brand new follicles to naturally keep forming\\&quot;, but the other part of the answer is that when I first started getting laser hair removal, the cost was $2,800 for a 8 treatments of a small area like \\&quot;lower face\\&quot; (which did not include cheeks or anything under the jawline). At such prices, I could only budget to do one such area per year and I had a whole body that needed treatments! As you can imagine, such a costly process takes \\&quot;years\\&quot;. As the technology eventually became more common, prices began to come down and LHR is much more affordable now, but sadly, there is still no training or license required to operate or own one of these powerful lasers. In fact, anyone with 50k can legally buy a used pro-quality laser on the secondary market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading! I hope this review is helpful.

            <li> First, some background. I went through about 6 IPL sessions back in 2004/2005 and I simply ran out of money to keep paying $250 per session. For those that say that ALL hair grows back after some point with laser treatments, this is not the case for ME. I don&#x27;t know for others, but after 6 sessions, and now over 5 years since my last treatment, about 60% of the hair I used to have (chest+stomach) is still gone, and I think after 5 long years one can call it \\&quot;permanent.\\&quot; Because so much hair was reduced over time I never saw the point in going back (I also didn&#x27;t want to spend on it!) since shaving what was left was easier.  So here I am 5 years later and I saw this and I said why not?! For $495 I&#x27;ll finish the job finally. I have heard but cannot confirm that actual lasers are more effective than IPL, which this Tria is. So in theory this might be equal to or better than the professional treatments I got 5 years ago. If I go by the pain...they are equal (Tria at highest setting) and if that&#x27;s any kind of measure of effectiveness vis-a-vis professional lasers then I think I can be optimistic!  UPDATE:  I did about 5 sessions total on my chest and stomach and the verdict is this: it did not work for me. I honestly did not see results at all. I wish I could say I did, especially given the serious, serious flaws this product has. Even if it had worked, I would still NOT recommend this product. Why? It has some major ergonomic and usability flaws that make it an absolute pain to use. At times you would rather stay hairy than go through the motions with this product. Where to begin?  1. It is very heavy--if you plan on doing hard to reach areas, the weight will get to your arm very quickly.  2. The covered area is 1cm squared--literally tiny. It would take me 30 minutes to get through 1/2 of my chest, and remember I already had permanent reduction from previous salon treatments. If you have more hairs, those 30 minutes would be 45.  3. Because of it&#x27;s tiny area, you needso many more zaps--depleting the battery very very quickly. You are left with having to wait 3 hours while it charges until you can continue your treatment. 2 whole legs I would imagine would take a day and half to complete.  4. The enormous head, combined with the tiny laser area makes it almost impossible to see where you have zapped. I had to draw a grid with white eye liner to keep up, this helped.  4.300 uses and then it&#x27;s out to the garbage since the battery dies. Considering the amount of times it must be recharged to finish a large area, 300 charges will eat up in no time.  Conclusion: This is a seriously flawed product which makes laser hair removal a tedious, painful, hugely time consuming endeavor and ultimately an expensive waste of time should it not work, as was in my case.  There are literally no redeeming qualities to this product. None. If you STILL want to give it a try I&#x27;d say this: forget about using it for large areas, perhaps underarms, or bikini line is about as useful as this gets if you don&#x27;t want to waste days on end trying to finish a large area. And I hope you are a very very very patient person!</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product and followed the directions exactly to unlock the device and it doesn&#x27;t work.  I activated it correctly, I charged it correctly, unplugged it as instructed and hit the power button to turn the device on and nothing happens.  What indicates the power is on?    I put the sensor against my skin correctly, the green light came on and I then put the sensor face it and waved it up and down near the indicator lights as instructed and nothing happened.    I already wrote to customer service and have not heard back from them.  Thank you  Diane</li>
            <li> While this did reduce SOME hair growth on my lower legs this certainly cannot be described as similar in any way to professional laser hair treatment. Don&#x27;t spend$700 to have a SLIGHT reduction. Not effective on finer hairs (forearms, upper legs) at all. Only marginal efficacy on darker hairs. Don&#x27;t spend the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully I already had my bikini area done professionally, because I don&#x27;t think this laser would have done anything. I&#x27;ve seen results from professional treatment so I know the difference. :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe i got a dud and another unit would be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Not Jason.

            <li> It didn&#x27;t help me at all with my leg hare. it is only a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am using my sister&#x27;s Tria and have done 3 treatments (at setting 3) on my armpits.  I am pretty fair skinned with dark hair.  I have seen a HUGE difference in my under arm hair.  It is much less coarse and at least half is gone.  I don&#x27;t work for the company, or even have my own Tria, but my sister&#x27;s is working so great for me on my arm pits, I am considering going in for one of my own.    After reading the people who said it doesn&#x27;t really work and the people who are writing positive reviews are being paid by the company, I wanted to put in my 2 cents on my positive experience.    A footnote- my sister who is also fair skinned with dark hair has not had as much rapid success as I have.  She also has more hair than me and has been using a lower setting though.  I do think because of seeing our different results that it all depends on the person, their pain thresholds and their coloring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional hair removal done in the past, and I know it works on my light skin and dark hair. But it&#x27;s very expensive. And it&#x27;s very inconvenient to make appointments and drive across town to have it done. I decided to try the TRIA.    I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it. I&#x27;ve had it for 9 months now and have mostly stuck to the schedule that they suggest. My underarm hair is nearly gone. Had I not purchased a home system, there are other areas, toes and fingers for example, that I would not have spent the time or money to have laser hair removal on, because there aren&#x27;t that many hairs there. With this, I&#x27;ve been able to do those areas as well.    My biggest complaint is that the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long. I cannot treat both arms on one battery charge, and it takes several hours for the battery to charge up again. It takes me four treatments to get both of my legs completely (thighs to ankles, front and back). I like to use the TRIA while I&#x27;m watching TV, so that means that to do both legs, that&#x27;s four consecutive evenings.    However, for underarms and the bikini area, it&#x27;s been great. The instructions say not to use it on your face. I have not used it on my eyebrows because I don&#x27;t want the laser to damage my eyes. However, I have used it on my upper lip and for my nose hairs. It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic for the nose hairs because that part of your skin never sees the sun, and so that is my whitest skin and darkest hair. The laser has done a fantastic job in that area.    I think this is easy to use. And well worth the money, to me.</li>
            <li> have bin using the tria device for seven months and it has not removed one single hair! ive bin using it 2 month for seven months nothing and i am the perfect candidate its bin the most frustrating expirance ever in my entire life! I have very pale nearly seethru white skin and thick straight black hair.One month i even did it three times just out of the sure hope that something would happen but it never did! I always had it on setting 2 and after the second month a huge chicken pox like rash appeared everywhere I used it yet no hair came out. The professionals a tria kept advising me to keep with it and it would eventually fall out and not to worry. To this day I can not get rid of the rash. And now im in a worst boat that i started in I have thick ichy hair in places i dont want and a rash to go with it. 14 treatments and no positive results at all! I have spent more on the dermatologists trying to get rid of the rash than I did with tria. And now seven months later ive had to fight my way just to get a refund. And now I have to pay shipping on top of that just to get a refund! Really I didnt even want a refund i just wanted my hair to be gone by now as promised. But I certainly didnt expect to pay more money to find another solution at this point at time it was unthinkingable ill send pictures to anyone thats interested if anyone else is having this please tell me if you have found a cure thanx! my email is spec.tech.ular1@gmail.com look foward to hear from you</li>
            <li> I have been using Tria laser in the past 3 weeks. It seems like it is working and the results are OK. One problem that Tria has is that you have to charge it for 3 hours but it only works for 15 to 20 minutes. This is a big problem because you can never finish a leg or arm in one day and basically the machine dies when you just started the process.  You can finish both underarms in one session but that is about it</li>
            <li> I have spent thousands on medspa laser hair removal and up until a few month ago, I was still going for treatments.  I decided to give this a try, and am I glad I did.  To my surprise - it really does work.  I started just doing 1 arm, 1 leg, and my chin/upper lip.  It has been almost 2 months.  Progress is slow on the face and I can&#x27;t say for sure that I&#x27;m getting any results there.  On the arm, I have noticed incremental reductions of about 20%.     The real surprise has been on my leg.  Already I have a reduction of about 60%, and the hair that is growing in is growing much slower.  I shaved both legs at the same time and then let them grow back in for a few days.  The untreated leg has significant stuble.  The treated leg looks almost as if I just shaved it with just a few stray hairs here and there.  These results in this area are motivating me to keep going with the rest.    Unlike the medspa LHR, this doesn&#x27;t singe the hairs and cause them to fall out in the same way.  They suggest shaving first and then using the product.  I did that on my leg, but not my arm or face - perhaps that is somehow related to my results.</li>
            <li> I do not have any affiliation with this company and have never had professional hair removal performed.  After looking at prices for salon treatment and searching for a reliable home laser hair removal device I decided to invest in the TRIA System.  Let me tell you that it has been 10 days since my first treatment I have already seen favorable results.  Hairs are beginning to fall away and the skin is smooth and clear.  The red bumps and ingrown hairs I used to see after plucking or shaving have diminished.  My skin looks and feels great.  I am very pleased.  I have dark course hairs and very light skin. Just follow the directions and the TRIA does what it claims. The flexibility of doing these treatments at home when it is convenient for me is great.   This system is well worth the price I paid already!</li>
            <li> This product will take away the hair for a short period of time. It&#x27;s not permanent. Nothing on the market works for hirsutism (which I&#x27;ve got). I&#x27;ve purchased the NO NO, Epilady (very painful), Tri, and Electrolysis (which left scars). Not only did the hair come back but it also increased.</li>
            <li> I bought the Trai in 2009 and used it for a year for just a few times. my use was vey low and it suddenly stopped working just after the year after. when i had called to see how i could get my device repaired, i was told that the Tria does not come with any replacement parts, no repair service.   i find that disguisting especially when i spent around GBP600 for it and only used it a few times. i find that terrible and i have been cheated out of my money.     so basically, if a customer buys the tria and it stopps working it is only replaced within the year of warranty, anything after a year, you may as well through your money down the drain. No repairs service, No replacement parts, NOTHING!   And after a year, your device will stop working. i am a very disassified customer and will share my feedback online with others.</li>
            <li> First, I have only been using the Tria for about 1 1/2 months.  I bought this for my legs and other areas because I have very dark hair that grows at a lightning speed and I also get razor burn with more frequent shaving no matter how much I spend on quality razors and shaving gel.  Anyways, I couldn&#x27;t afford to get my legs done in a center so after doing a lot of research I decided to invest in a Tria.  According to the instructions, you aren&#x27;t supposed to see any results until at least the second month.  To my surprise, I believe I am already seeing results.  The hair seems to be growing in less dense and slower already.  However it definitely is no where close to being hair-free yet.  Tria instructions do state you wont see visible reduction until after 3 months and that you wont see permanent results until 8 months.  So I am happy that after only 1 1/2 months I am noticing some improvement.  So far, the pros are the amazingly low cost compared to going to a center (it would be thousands of dollars to get this done at a center) and it seems to be working so far.  It is less painful to me than laser in an office.  I immediately started using Tria on the highest setting on my legs.  It is moderately painful for me, but for anyone who has done waxing, electrolysis, or laser already, it really isn&#x27;t that bad. The negative side is that it really is time consuming for large areas like the legs.  If you overlap like you&#x27;re supposed to, it would take 3 charges to do 1 lower leg (sometimes I cheat and get 1 lower leg done in 2 charges).  What happens is that after so many pulses the battery needs to be recharged.  So because you have to treat the area every other week for the 1st three months, if you do a large area of your body, like the legs, expect to need to stick around  home on those weekends and invest a lot of time into doing the Tria. It really takes the whole weekend plus say monday and tuesday after work to get my full legs and bikini done.  However, its not like you&#x27;re spending this entire amount of time doing tria.  It takes about 20-30 minutes for each treatment and then 3 hours in between treatments to charge the battery.  The other pro is that it is REALLY easy to use.  It is pretty much fool proof.  So far I am impressed, but unfortunately won&#x27;t know 100% for sure until probably a few more months if the Tria really does provide permanent hair removal.  However, because its been recommended by Good Housekeeping and countless other magazines, I am fairly confident that it will be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 3/17/12:&lt;br /&gt;Well my Tria (first generation) died the other day.  I had stopped using it for about a year because I got so tired of it.  I tried using it for my legs, and although I did see some improvement, the laser head is just too small to do large areas.  And the battery only lasted about 20 minutes of use on highest setting (which you need to do to make a difference) and then I had to charge it for 2-3 hours before I could use it again.  So just doing my lower legs was a full weekend project.  I ended up just getting so tired of it that I stopped using it for a year.  Then I just recently started using it again for chin area, and the other day it died.  I was hoping for at least one part of my body to be hair free from buying this thing (paid about $600 for it at the time) but no such luck.  Although there are patches that are less hairy on my legs, I still have to shave just as much.  I have purchased a Remington i-light pro because I could not deal anymore with using something that needs to be charged after 20 minutes of use.  So far using the Remington is a lot easier because you can use it for like an hour at a time (at least!) but I don&#x27;t know what the results will be yet.  I would only advise getting a Tria for use on face, but for that price, you can probably get treatments at a salon, so overall probably not worth it.  I downgraded my review to 2 stars, b/c it does work somewhat, but overall if it is just for use on really small areas, then I think it may not be financially worth it especially with all the pro laser hair removal deals I&#x27;ve seen on Groupon and Living Social (if you live in a major city).  It is not really great obviously for your full body like they try to make you believe.  Obviously the thing has died before I could even attempt getting rid of all leg hair with it, and I got so fed up with how time consuming it is for legs that I stopped using it for a while.  Overall I&#x27;m really disapointed in the $$$ we spent on this, as well as the COUNTLESS hours of time I wasted.  Hoping the Remington product I purchased will be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to my review: in case I wasn&#x27;t clear in the above post, I did use it as instructed for a very very very long time, thats all i did every weekend for months and months.  it just didn&#x27;t produce results that it promised, and overall was not worth it.  Again, if this is something they want to market for small areas, then fine, but they should not be marketing this as something to use for your whole body, or even your legs.  Too large of areas for such a tiny treatment head for a machine with such a short battery life.  Also, to give you an update on my progress with the Remington I-light, I used it twice on my legs and then found out I was pregnant so I had to stop, BUT after only TWO treatments I noticed much more hair loss than the Tria and it was much faster to use.  Since then however everything that has ever been treated (including professionally) has grown back in in spades due to my pregnancy.  Just making the Tria seem an even bigger waste of time.  After I have the baby in November I will be getting my Remington I-light up and running again and will update my review of that product.  I still regret all those wasted weekends of Tria-ing!  And I do like how the Remington only promises results for 6 months, that is much more honest, since in reality I have learned that even professional laser hair removal is NOT permanent....unless you are lucky.  For the rest of us, it is something you need to keep up with, whether you do it at home or get it professionally done.  And if you are like me and have to keep up with it, the Tria, given how time consuming it is, is not a great purchase to make.  Take it or leave it.</li>
            <li> i bought the tria for christmas , gift to my self, i have not been able to use it more than 4 times until now, is just hard when you have a 11 month old home, so this is my 4 treatment and so far i have not seen any difference, the hair continues to grow and i havent notice any hair reductions yet,, I will continue using it and hopefully i will soon see some good results and i will update again,,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using tria for about 3 months and so far I see fantastic results. I am southeast asian, light tan complexion with very dark coarse black hair. The type when you shave and a few hours later the dreadful shadow appears. The type of thick black hair when a hair colorist won&#x27;t guarantee color results, the type of hair when you get wax little blood pores are emerging, yes that stubborn type of hair. I use tria everywhere on my face, body, bikini line. I mean anywhere theres hair I will be using it there. What can I say beauty is a pain, but well worth it. I&#x27;m on my 6th treatment and so far my unwanted facial hair is gone, my bikini hair is gone, a third of light fine underarm and lower leg hair is left, but I&#x27;m hopeful that too will soon be gone. The convenience of sitting in the privacy of your own couch watching tv while zapping hair away is the best. I do believe you have to have very dense stubborn black hair in order for the tria to work it wonders. It works really well for my skin and hair type. I&#x27;m more than pleased with the tria laser:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for one month and haven&#x27;t seen results yet, but it&#x27;s way too early to tell.  The packaging is really nice and instructions are easy to follow.  I like this product for ease of use and the fact that it saves money and doesn&#x27;t require me to make appointments and make the effort to drive to a salon.  However, it IS tedious to use correctly.  The head of the tria is small and it requires alot of patience to move from spot to spot so that you are sure to not miss any patches.  I use it on the highest setting, which is pain-free if you are totally clean shaven.  If you have a hair, it feels like a hard rubberband snap.  The batery life is another complaint - it dies after 45 minutes or so, enogh to do half of my calve.  You can&#x27;t use it while plugged in, so it&#x27;s a bummer to stop and let it charge before using it again.  I bought this for my upcoming wedding and overall am happy I did.  I have read that it does work, so to me it&#x27;s worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> Decided on The Tria after comparing with the Silk&#x27;n by SensEpil.  I like not needing to purchase anything additional.  With The Tria, you just need to recharge but with The Silk&#x27;n, you need to replace the cartridges.  I just started using it and really like it.  I will update in 8months when the results are suppose to be evident. I give 4 stars because I like it and have high expectations but won&#x27;t know for sure until I&#x27;ve completed the regimen.</li>
            <li> So far I think this product is everything that it was promised to be.  I do have to admit that it was a little bit more painful than others described, but after three treatments I am seeing a big difference.</li>
            <li> I bought a TRIA over 18 months ago, and used it according to the directions.  After six months, my leg hair was growing in more slowly and patchier, but still needed to shave.  I was fine with that and decided it might just take longer for me.      Then, the TRIA stopped turning on and charging about 6 months after I bought it.  I contacted the company, and they replaced it since it was still under warranty.  Great!  Brand new TRIA to finish off my legs, I thought.  Used it for about 8 months, and the second unit stopped charging, too.  And since I bought the original over 18 months ago, the replacement isn&#x27;t under warranty.      I still have to shave all the parts I&#x27;ve treated with the TRIA.  There&#x27;s less hair, but it&#x27;s still there.  I expected it to work well for me as I have fair skin and dark hair, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.  $400 failed experiment.</li>
            <li> This really does work. I have the older version so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s better now. With the older version you use it every 2 weeks and it takes months (probably 6) to finish. I haven&#x27;t been great about keeping up with it so I&#x27;m about 1/2 way done. I believe the new version is quicker. I&#x27;m only writing this review to confirm it really does work. If you&#x27;re not comfortable doing laser treatments at a medspa this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> This has been the best investment I&#x27;ve made, ever. I&#x27;m the girl who hid in jeans year round, never comfortable with my hair \\&quot;situation\\&quot;, ever envious of my girlfriends easy summer skirts and shorts. I have relatively light skin with dark, thick hair. I&#x27;m in the 8th week about to start my fourth treatment on my legs and I&#x27;m THRILLED with the results. At the second treatment I could see a difference, less hair, but thought it must be my imagination. So I chose not to shave until my next treatment, yes that&#x27;s two weeks without shaving, and I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference. Way less, much finer, lighter growth. Starting the fourth treatment today, I can hardly see where to work, the hair is so light and sparse, and I haven&#x27;t shaved since the last treatment.     This product is giving me my legs back. I was ready to dedicate my whole summer to the Tria treatment schedule, expecting it to take many months. It&#x27;s now early spring and I&#x27;m wearing skirts, showing off these legs that haven&#x27;t seen the light of day in years.     I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product and hope others hiding in embarrassment have the same results I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I used it as defined in the instructions and it seemed to be working well on my facial and body hair. BUT after only 2 mos of treating very small areas the battery died and won&#x27;t hold a charge. TRIA do say it will eventually burn out and be rendered useless. But I barely got to use it and i was only lasering very small areas. A complete ripoff! I see numerous others have this same issue and TRIA will not respond to my questions. I might try a different product where you only have to replace the cartridge and don&#x27;t have to worry about the battery dying before its&#x27; time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for months now and so far I have barely seen any results. I have been working on one underarm so I can compare it to the other. First of all, I still experience pain while using it no matter how well I shave.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind I am pale with dark hair like the product recommends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair density might be slightly less where I have used it, but it is hardly enough to really notice. It is pretty much a waste of money, unless by some miracle it works after a year, but I doubt it.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in the \\&quot;CARE\\&quot; Tria gives it&#x27;s customers.  I did get my laser and it didn&#x27;t work.  I got a second laser sent to me that did work but as I was paying on the payment plan (I had made 3 payments by this time), they lowered the price by $150!  I thought that was bad enough... but last week they offered another $50 off special!  I felt a price adjustment was in order, but I wasn&#x27;t given one.  I had to send 3 emails to get a simple phone call.  I did call the customer \\&quot;service\\&quot; line and they told me that they would have to give my file to a manager and she would call me back by the end of the day because she was &#x27;going into a meeting.&#x27;  I never got a phone call that day.  Surprise!  I did get an email the next day telling me that I would have this issue addressed in 2-3 days.  It wasn&#x27;t until I sent my 3rd email that I finally did get my issue addressed 6 days later.  There will be no adjustment and I was offered a sunscreen or bodywash as a consolation gift. Gee, thanks but no thanks.  I&#x27;ll pass...I would so rather have my $150 back.  Never will I do business with this company again!  Buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> After emailing and talking on the phone with a customer service rep. they couldnt help me. My batteries dead and I am out of warenty. It is sad that they don&#x27;t stand behind there product. They don&#x27;t even sell repacement parts. Bottom line is it breaks after one year and they just tell you to buy a new one from them. Give them more money when they don&#x27;t stand behind there product, no thankyou. It is designed to fail. Why else is it battery powered instead of just plugging it into a wall outlet. The results on my legs where patchy. I am a perfect canidate. I have gone to salons in the past and had my underarm hair removed with 100% effectiveness. The surface area of the tria device is too small. I have since bought a silk&#x27;n at costco. It is easier to use, faster and more effective. It plugs into the wall, you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to recharge and you have an unlimited treatment time (unlike tria&#x27;s 20 minute treatment time). This is important as after waiting hours for the tria to charge up again you lose your place. I dont mind buying silkn bulbs as the speed and ease of using the silkn is worth it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0029OSN4U TRIA Laser Hair Removal System]]Both my husband and I have used laser for over 2 months with no results. After 2 months the laser gave us an Error message and Tria would not refund the product. They would only do an exchange that takes 2 to 3 weeks. Do not waste your $.</li>
            <li> I tried this myself for a few months and it is time consuming as well as the hair falls for a few weeks not forever. I did try tyhe professional laser hair removal and it does work  also and the hair dosn&#x27;t grow back with the professional laser.  Do not waste your money.  Sorry Tria</li>
            <li> I was wanting laser hair removal but didn&#x27;t want to spend thousands of dollars, so I bought the Tria almost a year ago. I used it as directed for about 5 months, but the process takes entirely too long. It might be ok for people wanting to do just under arms or bikini, but the charge only lasts about 20-30 minutes and at that rate, it took me 4 sessions just to do my lower legs. Throw in 20 minutes for underarms and another 30 for bikini, and I was spending 6 evenings doing Tria--I don&#x27;t have that kind of time. Also, I thought it was working pretty well on my bikini and under arm areas, but after not using it for 4 months, the hair in those areas is just as thick as before I started. This, of course, may be due to not completing the full year. I found a group price for lazer at a medspa ($180/6 lower leg treatments) and will try it instead.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk....any good reviews are the manufacturer trying to make all the bad reviews go down! This does not work, only another device to waste your money on, REAL lasers are dangerous and if this was truly powerful enough to work, there is no way it would be allowed in households! Leave laser hair removal to the professionals with the real machines!</li>
            <li> I bought Tria Laser hair removal in hope to get rid of my hair on legs and underarms. I have read all the reviews in their webpage and consulted with their reps. Everything looked favourable towards a purchase. Plus I have a light skin and dark hair so the results were supposed to be amazing.   I had great hopes for it so decided to spend that amount of money. But after doing 12 procedures according to the schedule that they recommend nothing dissapeared. After spending so much money and not seeing result I&#x27;m just aggravated!!! I tried to get a hold of customer service and wrote emails to them but they never got back to me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 months now. I do notice some reduction in some areas (the areas with thicker hair, like underarms), but I dont see how it will ever eliminate hair. Also on arms or upper thighs where hair is thinner, I see no reduction at all. Maybe a slight slowing-down of the hair growth cycle, but definitely not worth the pain.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve definitely noticed a change in the amount of hair that grows back.   The battery life actually lasts longer if you hold the machine exactly 90 degrees to your skin in the down facing position. If you are holding it vertically it will die faster. The treatment head is small so it will take several months to fully feel like it&#x27;s worth it.   i used to go to a salon but this is way better and convenient!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product direct from Tria, 1st generation if you will. It DOES work but it ONLY works well on dark brown to black hair. Forget reddish brown, blondish brown, grey, white, blonde... you get the point. It&#x27;s because of the color spectrum of light, not the TRIA or any OTHER laser for that matter that it can&#x27;t get those annoying little hairs of other colors.   My experience has been great to so-so but I will add that I&#x27;m a \\&quot;lazy\\&quot; user and if I was more dedicated, I am sure I&#x27;d get a better result. This really is an idiot-proof (well nearly, there&#x27;s always some idiot out there who might say \\&quot;Hey, will it remove this eyebrow hair? and blind themselves...) and safe way to get rid of hair. I started on my armpits where I know my hair is darkest and skin lightest. I did a treatment once every third day for about two weeks. I used it on the 4th setting ( I had to work up to it. Sensitive pits!) but now find even at the top setting it&#x27;s not anywhere near as bad as plucking a hair from a sensitive place. I didn&#x27;t realize at first how well it worked... until by the end of week two, I didn&#x27;t have to shave my pits EVERY day! (or else!!! (Now&#x27;s a good time to mention I would be Chewbakka if I didn&#x27;t shave from my eyebrows to my toenails every day- worst genetic hair combo of fair Swedish skin and heavy and downright aggressive Italian hair, the black diluted with Swedish red- impossible!)) I intentionally let the hair grow a wee bit and the few hairs remaining, about 25% or less were much finer, to the point of being barely visible. Also fewer hair follicles meant my pits didn&#x27;t get ripe as quickly as before. Great side effect! Don&#x27;t be a wuss like I was and waste what is a limited # of zaps (I&#x27;ve had mine two years. It&#x27;s still going). At the top setting, it&#x27;s not really bad. I was overly cautious. The more you use it, the easier and less painful it is just like any treatment.   Legs? I still shave in the winter, wax/shave combo in the Spring. My leg hairs are more reddish brown, so doing my WHOLE leg to hit the percentage that are dark enough is tedious and time-consuming. If my hair was all dark, I&#x27;d invest the time and effort.   Arms- Also, not enough to bother. Oh, they&#x27;re hairy, but about one in thirty is really dark and blissfully in sun, they turn light blonde and I just Nair those babies off.   Happy Trail - Life saver. I guess I can now say I was blessed with a dark happy trail, because it&#x27;s nearly gone, and what has grown back is very fine. 6 weeks before pool season, I&#x27;ll hit it again and it should be gone.   Bikini area. I never got \\&quot;clear\\&quot; but the Tria not only reduced the amount I have to shave, it also of course reduced the shaving irritation and bumps that go along WITH shaving around my bikini line and not having bumpy irritated skin around the pool is one less item I can check off my list of things that make me feel dysmorphic.    Face- ya I know we&#x27;re not supposed to, but I risked it on the chin and had good results. I have a generous layer of chunk under my chin, figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt, and it didn&#x27;t. Two years now, no damage.   REGROWTH- Yes, sadly I concur- there&#x27;s NO such thing as permanent. The armpit hair snuck back up on me. It&#x27;s back (like I said, lazy hair remover here)- probably about 75% of the original # of follicles but it IS still finer than before TRIA.  However, I know it works, and well, so when I get around to it, I&#x27;ll redo it. It was almost 100% gone except for a few hard-to-target stragglers and it did take about 18 months before deciding to rear it&#x27;s ugly head once more.   Bumps/Issues. I experience redness longer than most- I have this condition that makes me dermographic and drives my allergist crazy- my skin reacts to everything and stays redder longer. I have a quick fix for it ladies (also works when you wax your brows!)- keep some Visine Advanced Relief in the fridge and apply to clean, dry skin. Closes up those capillaries, so you can get out of the house faster without your face saying \\&quot;I just rug-burned my chin!!!! Wanna Guess Howwwww???!!!\\&quot;  Hair follicles- occasionally, I&#x27;ll get a bump, pimple-type. It&#x27;s not RIGHT after using Tria it&#x27;s a few days after when hairs want to grow in. I need lots of exfoliation and found that if I apply a lotion with alpha-hydroxy acid in it (I used the Alpha-Hydrox brand foot cream, it&#x27;s got 12% AHA and it works everywhere, not just on your feet, at a much lower cost than the \\&quot;soufflé\\&quot;). Also, sometimes those \\&quot;zapped\\&quot; hairs look kind of weird (how I can tell Tria got them- they look thicker, flatter) and on occasion they&#x27;ve either popped out like a pimple or I&#x27;ve gently pulled them out with a tweezer to help things along, because who needs MORE dark pores looking like grody blackheads?    Also, it says to use on a fresh shave. I disagree. Shave the night before and use in the morning or vice versa so the Tria can \\&quot;see\\&quot; the follicles better. Sometimes a too-close shave takes away too much of my dark hair (which oddly comes out really dark at the ends but is lighter at the follicle itself) and I find it&#x27;s more effective with at least 12 hours growth but not much more.   Do yourself a favor and use Tria in winter and spring when you&#x27;re at your pastiest, ashen, mousiest self (speaking solely on my own account of course). You&#x27;ll see the fastest, most effective results. Once you start getting that sun on you it won&#x27;t work as well and it \\&quot;knows\\&quot; when there&#x27;s not enough contrast to work with the little test gun that comes with it you MUST use to turn it on every time (don&#x27;t cheat. you&#x27;re just cheating yourself). I was in shock the first time I got a \\&quot;red\\&quot; no-go light, but also pleased that I&#x27;d gotten over winter. Point is, plan accordingly and use winter to transform you like Fuzzy Wuzzy.   As an aside, I&#x27;ve never had professional laser. My similarly fair skinned/dark haired friend did, and it burned the he** out of her and left considerably scarring as one other poster mentioned. She signed so many disclaimers thatsuing was not really an option (she worked in a law firm!). That scared the bejesus out of me, so I gave up ever considering it unless I had the time to invest in finding someone with 100% patient satisfaction (um.... it&#x27;s been 20 years now). The TRIA doesn&#x27;t operate on the same extremes. I doubt it&#x27;s as painful as professional, and even at the top setting IMO it&#x27;s about like having an elastic snapped on a tiny spot on your skin. It&#x27;s no big deal. If it bothers you, don&#x27;t spent a lot of money on pricey lidocaine treatments, get some after-sun aloe lotion. It contains the same lidocaine and the aloe is good for you. When this one dies on me, I&#x27;ll buy another. Further, based on my experience with the company and device, I&#x27;d considering buying their blue-light treatment for skin.</li>
            <li> Got my laser a few days ago and have been using it every night. It is a lot more painful than I expected. I usually have a high tolerence for pain so I was surprised at how much it hurt! I think it was partially do to the fact that I tried it in my armpit first, where the skin is very thin. I could use it at level one just fine but when I tried to increase to level two it was too intense for me! But so far I love it and it is just how I thought it would be. I read that it gets less painful the more you use it so I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> I bought the tria about a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;I used it often and found that it works great on dark hair okay on medium&lt;br /&gt;hair, but red and blond not at all. I did get results, but the tria no longer&lt;br /&gt;works, the laser on it is out. I can&#x27;t return it, so I desided to try Nono hair removal&lt;br /&gt;I love this one, however I do not know if I will get long term results yet.&lt;br /&gt;I am sick of spending lots of money on hair removal products and the idea of&lt;br /&gt;permenant hair removal may never be achieved, but the disire to remove it will&lt;br /&gt;always be. So if you hate shaving, tweezing, and if the tria is too much money&lt;br /&gt;try nono. But if you have the money to buy the Tria, make sure you can return it.&lt;br /&gt;The laser doesn&#x27;t last long enough for the price it cost.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s my experience with the tria.</li>
            <li> I love this. It really works and I noticed a difference after just one use! This product is not for everyone though. It takes A LOT of time and commitment. If you are willing to put in the time and effort, go for it. If not, it&#x27;s best not to buy this.</li>
            <li> Average rating of 3 stars? Who could be disappointed with this product? Sasquatch?  I had laser hair removal a few years ago on my armpits and bikini line - to the tune of $2,000. I wanted to do some touch-ups, lower legs, and, for lack of a better phrase, go farther on the bikini line. I searched the uswoop and groupon deals for months hoping to find something ridiculously cheap.   Then I saw the TRIA on Amazon. The math is a no brainer. The only question is: does it work? Trust me, I was a skeptic. But this thing knocked out 70% of the bikini line hair on the first use (on the highest setting on dark hair &amp; beige skin). I&#x27;ve used it twice more (every two weeks) and the results just keep getting better.  Pros: it works! it&#x27;s cost-effective! you will NOT be sorry.  Cons: exactly the same as laser hair removal in a salon or med spa. It stings quite a bit on the highest setting from the laser head getting hot. It works best on light skin with dark hair. All of my grays are sadly left behind. Looks like electrolysis for that! lol  Hints: I place an ice pack on my skin for about 10 seconds, wipe any moisture away, and then ZAP. The ice pack really limits how much heat you feel from the laser head. I also take some ibuprofen about 30 minutes before zapping. Now if I can just figure out what to do about those pesky gray hairs. . .</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with it. Of course it hurts but only a little. It feels like a rubber band popping on you but just for a few seconds. The armpits are more sensitive so it is a little uncomfortable there but nothing unbearable. I love that it works fast and in the privacy in my home. It is a lot cheaper than getting professional laser hair removal and I think it works just as good. Have used it for a month now and can already see a difference, my hair isn&#x27;t growing back as fast and I have very dark brown hair. Defiantly worth it!</li>
            <li> I purchased the TRIA about 6 months ago- and have been shocked at how well it has worked! I had LASER Hair Removal done prior at a Dermatologist&#x27;s Office on my underarms, and WOW- Talk about PAIN FACTOR!!!!! I did 3 treatments and between the cost( I could have bought 2 TRIAs for those 3 laser treatments) &amp; the pain- I never went back! I use the TRIA now to zap any hairs that pop up from prior treatments... It knocked em down &amp; gone in 2-3 treatments and I&#x27;m back to NO hair underarms!! Nice n bare n smooth! Then I started using it on my bikini area, in the privacy of my own home, at my own convient time. To me- it&#x27;s been remarkable at HOW much hair has STOPPED growing! Shaving was useless, red bumps &amp; never close enough with a razor; Plus- thinking of going back to have my bikini area done by the Derm&#x27;s Office made me breakout in hives &amp; sweat- JUST to think of it- after my underarms sent me into orbit! But with the TRIA- yes, you MUST be patient for results, you MUST overlap areas, you HAVE to get a schedule going, I used mine every other day- for the first 4-6 weeks; then I started \\&quot;shedding hairs\\&quot;. So, now I use it every 2-3 weeks or so as a \\&quot;upkeep\\&quot; for my NO hair bikini area. I started out using topical numbing cream- applying it 45 mins prior to using TRIA; quick wipeoff of it- and setting of a 5. But now, because of no or very little dark hairs in the follicles below the skin(no huge heatup of area) - I don&#x27;t need the numbing cream- and still use the setting of a 5. I must say it goes alot faster now. It still stings a little- but between the $$$ I was spending for ALL that pain in a Dermatologist&#x27;s Office VS. OWNING MY own system, it&#x27;s MINE to keep; using it when I want to- not when I can get an appointment; It&#x27;s a no-brainer for me. I&#x27;m super happy with results, and I&#x27;ll start on my legs probably very soon for summertime.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for my wife about a year ago,  she never used it until this weekend when we finally opened the box and activated it....Of course it didn&#x27;t work and the real kicker is that the warranty had expired days earlier (even though it hadn&#x27;t been activated yet)....Customer service is unwilling to ship a replacement and apparently no repair is available.  So I reccommend you don&#x27;t buy this as it may just end up being a $500 paper weight!  I hope they reverse their decision and do the right thing...but i&#x27;m not counting on it.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I just got my tria the other day. I used it for the first time and here are my thoughts on it. First of all, many of these reviews on here are of the older model. So you have to take that into account when considering buying this. I got the newer one and for me it did a whole lower leg (from the knee down) on one charge. I was also able to do both underarms and the bikini line on one charge. Tria has made the laser treatment time faster. I was able to do the lower leg in about 25-30 minutes and the underarm in about 5-10 minutes. They have also made it charge faster. For me it only took an hour and a half to charge between treatments. Which is significantly faster than the last model. I&#x27;m glad I waited for the newer one. Yes, the treatment head is very small. I will agree with that. But if it was much larger it may be hard to do the bikini line or toes or small places like that. Yes, it does hurt. I was only able to tolerate on the third level on sensitive areas (bikini and underarm) but on my legs I was able to use the highest setting without it hurting too bad. It seems the darker and coarser the hair, the more it hurts. Tria has also changed the return policy so it can now be returned after 90 days so you have longer to try it and see if it is working for you. This company definitely seems like one that listens to its customers and tries to make positive changes based on customer reviews. So those are my thoughts on using the tria...I will update in a few months to see how the actual hair removal is going.     Update time!!  I have now completed 4 treatments on my arms, legs, bikini, and underarms and I wanted to update and let you guys know how it&#x27;s going. On my arms and legs I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference, just that the hair is growing in finer and I can go a few days longer without having to shave so it must be growing slower as well. Let&#x27;s hope that means its working! On my bikini and underarms I am already seeing small bald spots! I am surprised Ididn&#x27;t expect to see results this early but that is where my hair is the darkest, the most dense, and the most coarse. As the hair has gotten finer the treatments have been less painful which is wonderful! So my advise to everyone is stick to it!! Consistency is key!    Another update  I have now been using this for about 4 months, every two weeks, on my legs, underarms, and bikini area. I am seeing wonderful results, my legs have about 40% less hair, my underarms probably about 60% less, and my bikini has almost no hair left at all. I expect I will be done using it in a few more months. A lot of people are saying it&#x27;s a piece of junk, but people need to be realistic. This is a 400 dollar product when getting it done professionally would cost thousands. You have to think about that. It&#x27;s going to take longer because it&#x27;s not as powerful and that&#x27;s why we can get it cheaply. Also they tell you on the website that it is time consuming and that the battery only lasts for about 30-40 minutes on the highest setting. For me it is working great.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know why the product has gotten bad reviews unless its just trying to do a large area.  i will tell you were it works wonders is on my face.  i was desperate for help and did not want to pay the money to go get laser treatments.  i have used the trio for several months now and 90% of the hair is gone from my face.  i can tell you it has been wonderful.  i had some much chin hair i was depressed.  please do not let the negative reviews stop you.  if you want to use it on legs or large areas it might not be the answer but for smaller areas like your face it works wonders.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. I have purchased two and neither have worked. The customer service is terrible and they wouldn&#x27;t replace either product. Not worth the money. I repeat do not buy!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I just ordered this and although I haven&#x27;t used it yet I can tell you this. I am a licensed Esthetician and have worked in Dermatology where we used an IPL type hair removal laser, much like the silk&#x27;n at home IPL laser. The results were never as good and we always had patients coming back in for way more treatments than should&#x27;ve been necessary. That being said the reason I chose the Tria is because it&#x27;s a diode laser which is proven to have far better lasting results and fewer treatments. At an office using a diode laser just for a full Brazilian bikini it&#x27;s a crazy $300 per treatment. And although I do a lot of waxing on my clients, waxing is $50 bucks for a brazilian and is not permanent, yes it may kill a few hair follicles or just thin the hair but it&#x27;s not permanent like a laser would be, so for me it&#x27;s more of an investment to spend what seems to be a lot, $395 for multiple sessions at your own privacy and convienence rather than $300 per session at an office. Also, this takes patience, you have to know it might be months before you see an actual result but eventually you won&#x27;t have to treat as much, then only touch ups every year or so.  I only plan on using this for the bikini area, should be fine for face (since tip is relatively small &amp; have dark coarse hair) and I might even do my underarms. I&#x27;ll save the waxing for my legs and arms for now. So I will definitely update after a few months of using it.</li>
            <li> I am about two months in, and have seen decent results.  Only about a 5% reduction, but this is stated to happen until about two months in.  It does require a good pain tolerance, so thats why i feel it is workin.  I will write every couple months to update everyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased the newer TRIA from Nordstrom&#x27;s for $395 + tax. They have a 3 month commitment before you can return it, but since I CAN return it hassle-free if it does not work, I decided to check it out. I&#x27;ve done one treatment so far and will update. I am East Indian with a light beige-ish skin tone and black hair.    I used to think I had a really high pain threshold, but apparently not after this, it was almost embarrassing. Also, make note, you CANNOT do this while watching tv and stuff...you have to see where it goes.     The new TRIA holds a charge longer, you can glide it (but I can&#x27;t always tolerate that pain on some parts of my body), and is $100 less than the older version. I&#x27;m hoping it works. I am very consistent, so I will have to wait and see. I&#x27;m planning on using it pretty much everywhere, except I&#x27;m a little skeptical of my face, but I would like to use it on my upper lip.    I gave it a 3 because it was definitely not as time consuming as I&#x27;d thought it would be. I did my underarms, bikini line/area, both legs (fully), and a few random spots just cuz I was hoping to tolerate the zap a little more...it didn&#x27;t happen.    I used setting one most of the time, and two at other times. I&#x27;m planning on upping it next time and just toughing it out to see if the thing actually works or not. I have used so many different methods such as sugar waxing and using epilators so I assumed the pain would be way less. But I&#x27;m guessing those things did take time to get used to as well, so hope this is the same...good luck if you purchase this. I will update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Tria laser about 10 months ago. I have been using the laser exactly as the instructions suggest for that 10-month period, but I have so far not seen any results whatsoever. According to the Tria website, I have the perfect skin and hair color combination for the laser and yet after 10 months and hours spent using the device I have seen absolutely no reduction in hair growth. When I called the company, the customer service representative was neither helpful nor friendly. Bottom line: this product is a waste of money. If you do order a Tria laser, definitely return it for the full refund within the 90 day period if you see no results during that time. It says in the instructions that for some people it just takes longer to work, but it is not worth the risk. I didn&#x27;t return it thinking it would just take longer to work for me, but now I am just out $400 and very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the product yesterday and completed the first treatment and I will update the review over the course of treatments to accurately reflect its quality.  However,  my initial impressions of the product are good.  I am the ideal candidate for laser hair removal,  light skin with dark hair, and have had tremendous success with professional treatments.  But as most people interested in the product, I was attracted by the overall cost benefit when compared to purchasing a series of treatments.  The physical product itself seems well-crafted and sturdy.  Easy to hold, aim, and pulse and no little parts that you have to worry about keeping track of.  I would say to anyone interested in purchasing the product that you must be completely realistic about what you&#x27;re looking to achieve and what this sort of technology is capable of.  If you have thick coarse hair all over your body like a gorilla this device will NOT leave you as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bum.  The energy density of the laser isn&#x27;t strong enough to do the sort of damage required for extensive hair follicle reduction and your results even with a medical grade laser won&#x27;t leave you entirely smooth.  I purchased the unit more as a supplement to the professional treatments that I am getting and to reduce(not completely remove/retard) hair growth in different areas.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s most appropriate for dealing with armpits, forearms, bikini, feet/toes, and while they say it&#x27;s not suitable for the face or neck I am a man and purchased it for precisely that reason to deal with the stray hairs that the professional laser may have missed.  The laser head is pretty narrow and unless you&#x27;re a very diligent and patient person, purchasing this to do your legs might not bed the best option.  They also recommend that you begin on the lowest setting so that you gradually adjust to the pain, but even at the highest setting, the power of the laser is far below what the standard medspa laser is shooting, so suck it up anddeal with the pain of setting 5 if you&#x27;re looking to achieve real results.  Settings 1-3 will garner you NOTHING. I recommend turning it to level 5 and testing it on the top of your foot to get some practice in before you start treating your problem areas.  One major difference between this laser and what you will get done in a spa is the lack of a cooling device.  Most medspa lasers simultaneously shoot out a spurt of cold air to minimize the pain and heat caused by the laser.  This is not a feature of Tria therefore I recommend filling a ziptop bag with ice and as you pulse the area you place the bag of ice immediately over the area.  Hope that helps people who are contemplating purchasing the item.  I&#x27;ll let you know in the long-term what my thoughts are.</li>
            <li> I have thick black hair and it has been a constant problem.  Even when I shaved, the hair was visible under my skin.  I was always fighting ingrown hairs, stubble, and razor burn.  After 2 weeks, about 40-60% of my hair began falling out.   It hasn&#x27;t been 4 weeks yet, but I am hoping to see a lot more hair loss soon.   I am still shaving every 4 days, but I used to have to shave every day.   Even if I never lost any more hair, it would be worth the 400$ because I don&#x27;t have to deal with the constant ingrown hairs, razor burn, and stubble that came from how thick and dense the hair was.  I have a medium complection my underarms and bikini are light, but my legs and arms get pretty dark tan over the summer.   I was worried that my skin tone would be too dark or that it would hurt too much because I had tanner skin (it doesn&#x27;t hurt any more on my tanner skin than on my lighter skin areas).  I have a high pain tollerance, but it hurt and seemed to get very hot at first.  I started out on level 2-3 and after a bit, the area kind of adjusts to the prickling/heat sensation.   Then I could go over the area again on Level 4 or, usually 5.  A glass of wine or motrin kind of helped too.  But, now that the density of my hair is so decreased, pain isn&#x27;t really an issue.  To make sure I get my legs thoughouly, I started lining them with an orange highlighter.</li>
            <li> i started using the tria laser over my whole body but it got way too time consuming so that i decided to just do small areas that bothered me. the underarm hair bothers me the most because even when i shave you can still see the black roots and it looks very unattractive. so i started using the tria on my armpits. . . after a few times i saw no results so i was going to quit using it alltogthor. . but however i kept with the program. and instead of just lasering it once, i would do each underarm twice. so thats when i started to see results. now, there are patches of no hair. and the hair that is there is thin. it looks soo much better when i shave now it looks completely hairless. it is almost hairless after all. its only been 2 months and already they look amazing. . if this good luck continues i will start doing my arms and legs as well.</li>
            <li> I heard great things about this product so I decided to try it. I have a high tolerance for pain, however, this was ridiculous.  Even on the lowest setting. I tried it on my legs and underarms and there is absoloutely no way I could even keep it on there until the timer finished. Very disappointed!! Horribly painful! Also, the head of the laser is so small that one leg would take at least an hour and I&#x27;m talking below the knee.</li>
            <li> I bought this tool at April 2011 from Amazon, then last December 2011 I went to LA for holiday and I took this tool to fix through a friend who lives there, because  the tool used twice and now the power is off.  Then at January14th my friend emailing told me this  tool is not warranty and also can&#x27;t be fixed. I was very angry and upset with your after sales service .</li>
            <li> IF YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE BUYING...YOU&#x27;LL LOVE THIS PRODUCT. THIS PRODUCT IS EVERYTHING IT CLAIMS TO BE. I THINK SOME PEOPLE GIVE THIS PRODUCT A LOW RATING DUE THE AMOUNT OF TIME ONE NEEDS TO SPEND USING THE PRODUCT IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE EFFECTIVE. IF YOU READ ALL THE PRODUCT INFORMATION, YOU WILL SEE THAT YOU NEED TO DO 3 MONTHS OF BI-WEEKLY TREATMENTS AND THEN 3 MONTHLY TREATMENTS. SOME OWNERS OF TRIA COMPLAIN THAT THE BATTERY CHARGE DOES NOT LAST LONG ENOUGH; HOWEVER MY OPINION IS THAT THE BATTERY LASTS LONG ENOUGH TO DUE ONE OR TWO AREAS(THINK ONE WHOLE LEG...OR BIKINI AND ARMPITS...ETC.)ONCE YOU&#x27;VE COMPLETED THE AREA, YOU CHARGE, TAKE AN HOUR OR TWO BREAK (THINK HOUSEWORK OR DINNER) THEN DO THE NEXT AREA. TAKE ANOTHER BREAK OR SAVE THE NEXT AREA FOR THE NEXT DAY. EITHER WAY...YOU PAID $400, DON&#x27;T EXPECT TO GET A $1500 PRODUCT (IN THE SHORT RUN). IN THE LONG RUN, THIS PRODUCT WORKS AS INTENDED. I&#x27;VE DONE 3 BI-WEEEKLY TREATMENTS (LESS THAN 2 MONTHS TIME) AND ALREADY HAVE GREAT RESULTS, ABOUT 50% DECREASE IN REGROWTH AND THICKNESS!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using my tria laser for a little over a year now. It took at least 6 months for me to see some good results.  I used it as recommended on my bikini area on the highest or 2nd to highest setting and I am happy with the results.  I still have to shave, but there are patches where hair doesn&#x27;t grow, and the areas where the hair still grows is much finer and sparser than before.  I used to get really bad razor burn every time I saved, and now I rarely get that.  So for me, spending the money for that is totally worth it even though I still have to shave. I got professional laser hair removal done on my underarms for over a year and am getting the same results with the tria laser (I still have to shave my underarms too, but it&#x27;s very fine and sparse hair.)  I have also been using the tria laser on my legs, but sporadically since it takes so long, and have not seen good results.  So overall if you are patient, don&#x27;t have too high of expectations, and can use the laser on the highest setting I would recommend this for you. For me the highest setting can be very uncomfortable, especially on my bikini area. Hope this helps. :)</li>
            <li> one square foot takes about 45 minutes to complete the laser process and about 3 to charge it.  machine has a short life rechargeable battery that I was not expecting.  this thing hurts to use just like the expensive lasers at a spa are said to.  I hope it works.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 months and can&#x27;t tell much of a difference yet with my thick manly hair.  was reviewed well by professional companies.</li>
            <li> I bought my Tria about 9 months ago. I&#x27;ll admit that I totally forget to use it for months at a time so I would probably have much better results if I were more diligent. I&#x27;ve used it thoroughly probably 5 or 6 times and I would say I have about a 70% reduction. The hair that has come back it WAY thinner and lighter. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. It&#x27;s certainly not a scam. I find it pretty painful, to be honest. I&#x27;ve yet to manage a full underarm treatment for that reason. Everywhere else it pretty tolerable though and I&#x27;ve had very good results.</li>
            <li> I have first to let you all girls know that I did a professional laser treatment in my lower legs with incredible success. Dark hair and medium light skin. I could not be happier!!!  I wanted to do just some parts of my thighs and I bought Tria Laser...humm, what can I say? Used it on the most powerful setting (5) twice and after 29 days and seeing zero results I had to return it since it&#x27;s such an expensive item to purchase to \\&quot;see if it works\\&quot;.   I am a very good candidate for laser. I am a \\&quot;living proof\\&quot; that it works! But since Amazon has a month return policy, I could not wait longer to see if Tria Laser would work on me. All I am going to say is that after two treatments I noticed results when doing it the professional way, also smelled right away the burnt follicles. Nothing happened with Tria Laser. Only the pain while using the 5 setting so I reduced it by placing ice 1 min before doing it.  Sorry people! I wish it would have worked!</li>
            <li> This product really does work. I bought this about 4 months ago and I saw significant reduction right away. I am half Armenian with dark hair and olive/light skin so I am an ideal candidate. My hair has grown back so much lighter and not nearly as much. I have used it on my bikin line and armpits.. Although I still have hair i shave it much less frequently. You need to be committed to doing it and be able to deal with some pain. I can only keep it at level 3 sometimes level 2 or 4. If you can get Otto level 5 kudos to you and it will work that much better. Definitely worth the money if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on professional lasor treatments.</li>
            <li> I read a lot up on this product until deciding to finally purchase it.  I had utilized the laser 1-2 times per week for about 6 months.  At first, the results were really good, so I kept on using it until I finished the 6 month period to make sure it would last.  Well, long story short, it ALL came back in just a month and a half...I actually think it became coarser.  I have no desire to go through the time and pain all over again.  Better off spending the money on professional treatment.</li>
            <li> I have used Tria for two weeks and I already have results!!! In my bikini area I have hairs falling out all over! It blows my mind that I already am seeing results this soon!! I have to say that I use the laser on the highest level, or the 8/10 level. It is unbelievably PAINFUL! I just tried Dermoplast spray( a benzocaine numbing spray) and that helped a lot. I am actually glad that it hurts in a way, it makes me feel like it is working :-)  I have had one professional laser hair treatment and at the level 10 the Tria feels the same. The only complaint that I have is that on the highest level the battery life is not long enough. I can treat my under arms and one ankle on a charge or my bikini area (just sides) on one charge.</li>
            <li> After 6 months of use, at its highest setting, #5. It has not removed any hair.  No hair ever shed. I have heard some people treat the same spot about 10 times,  and got some results, along with redden skin, like a professional laser. But  overlapping shots, every 2 weeks, hasn&#x27;t done squat for me :(</li>
            <li> i purchase this item from Amazon its also my first time using laser product, i was so afraid beacuse i heard from my friends its painful and even expensive when you do it in private clinics even one of my friends got burned, but this product changed everything, i thought my first session will be painful but it wasnt, i really liked it it been a week now and im waiting for the second session, i realized that my thin hair become thiner then before but our thiker hair needs more sessions, its really easy to use and even the instruction book helped me understand it more easily.    i also recommened this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I am one of those unfortunate girls with a hormone imbalance.  I have unwanted hair growth on my face:  upper lip and two patches (quarter-sized) on both sides of my chin.  As well as hair growth on my toes and navel.  It is completely embarrassing.  The hair is dark, coarse, thick and grows fast.  I was very worried about buying this product because of all the negative reviews.  I was also concerned because you are not suppose to use this product on your face.  I went ahead and bought it anyway, because laser hair removal (professional) worked well for me before and the idea of using it at home sounded great.  I use the product on my chin and upper lip.  It stings, but not as bad as I remember it from the professional, which had me nervous that maybe it wasn&#x27;t powerful enough to be effective, and that I wasted my money.  However, after 6 weeks the hair is 70% gone.  It&#x27;s such a relief!  The hair that is still growing is more fine and less dark.  I am very pleased with this product---it would be great for other girls with my problem.</li>
            <li> It was just too hot, i tried it but could not take the heat. I returned it without a hitch. Try it and if you don&#x27;t like it you can return it without any risk.</li>
            <li> I got my Tria Laser Hair Removal in the mail today, but I think it is not working...there is no red light (laser) coming from the window and the screen shows an error message after the 4th try.&lt;br /&gt;I seemed to work fine for about a minute or so and then it just stopped. I followed the manual carefully.&lt;br /&gt;I am so dissapointed, I&#x27;ve been waiting for this item in the mail for about 20 days or more.&lt;br /&gt;I hope at least to get a refund</li>
            <li> I did not buy mine here, but straight from the company.  I tried it all over my body right away.  It hurt me.  I couldnt stand it on many areas.  But I am sick of extra hair.  So I kept trying all parts of my body to see what each felt like.  I tried for maybe 15 mins because it was all I could stand.  I tried it again a few days later to see if it was easier.  It wasnt.  Then I decided to only try a VERY small section of my body to see if it even worked.  Why go through the pain if not, right?  Well I became sad that it seemed like it didnt.  Then a few weeks later, I noticed that I didnt have to do my daily shave anymore.  Why, now its been three weeks and counting.  My thick hair that distressed me so much is no longer an issue. I see nothing there. This IS worth the short-lived pain, if exessive hair bothers you so much like it did me.  For me the trick is to do a very small amount of hair a day.  This way Im not subjected to pain for long, and I actually prefer to do it for 15 mins a day than an hour a day.  By the way, the pain was gradually less and less day to day.  My dark hair causes the pain, and as it went away and I used the Tria over the same area, I felt very little.  Not painful anymore.  Its great!!  Im glad I bought this, despite the high cost, because it works.</li>
            <li> My wife and I purchased the TRIA hair removal system and it is PAINFUL. Several of our friend had electrolysis hair removal and said it wasn&#x27;t nearly as uncomfortable as the TRIA. However, I have used it with Dr. Numb (5% Lidocaine) and that took care of the red hot poker feeling.  Put a lot on, cover with plastic wrap, wait 45-60 minutes and it was great.  You can till feel like pricks of the laser, but very tolerable.   The batter out in 30 minutes is not so great.  Only completed about 1/2 of my chest the first time out.   I&#x27;ll edit this review in a couple weeks as I see how well this actually works.   For now... buy with a numbing agent (I recommend Dr. Numb and get the one that&#x27;s Amazon Prime eligible).    More to follow....    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</li>
            <li> I bought TRIA laser hair removal system to maintain the results after getting professional treatments. It is not as strong as the professional devices for obvious reasons, but it does a good job at maintaining the results I got (it helps me zap those few unwanted hairs here and there). My opinion is that it works best on people who are not too hairy to begin with or who have already received professional treatments. However, the battery life is terrible. It only lasts 15 minutes (I can only treat half a leg during that time frame) and then you have to charge it for another three hours.  That is enough to put me off, so I don&#x27;t use it as much as I should...</li>
            <li> I am a male in my early 20&#x27;s. I purchased the Tria three months ago in the hope that it would eliminate or reduce my body hair on everywhere except my head legs and eyebrows. I have done as much research as possible online and have been frustrated by the lack of detailed and fully credible reviews, so I am going to summarize my experience and research here.    1. Effectiveness: The Tria is not going to permanently eliminate all hair in any area. It simply is not powerful enough for that. This is borne out by the specifications if you look on any credible hair removal website as well as reviews from people who used it and then eventually *stopped* using it. However, it is extremely effective on dark, coarse hair on light skin. For dark, coarse, thick hair it will generally destroy the follicle or damage it significantly enough that the hair that grows back will be vellus hair (light, fuzzy, and somewhat slower growing).     However, although it may not look like it is the case, there are vellus hairs already there even in a thick, coarse, hairy area. The Tria will not eliminate these vellus hairs and will not eliminate lighter and thinner hairs. It will however often cause them to shed temporarily. This is why it is considered permanent hair reduction, and not permanent removal.     Hairs that have been treated will stop growing noticeably almost immediately and will shed on their own within two weeks.    2. Pain: On thick, coarse hair I used the highest setting, which was quite painful. I often used a combination of Advil, Vicodin, and an ice pack to make it tolerable. Then again I have a low pain tolerance, and you can use a lower setting. I just prefer to bear the pain to maximize the effectiveness.    3. Technique: To be most effective, I found that zapping an area as many as 3-5 times in one sitting was the best thing to do. I liked to pluck the hairs with a tweezer after lasering them. Although you will not find that recommended elsewhere, I found it to be a very effective way to test the efficacy of the laser. If the hairs slid right out with no resistance at all, they would come out with the bulb just as they do in electrolysis, and that suggests the follicle is completely destroyed. If there is any resistance, stop pulling and laser some more. If you cannot pull the hair with no resistance, give up, and don&#x27;t pluck it - it will probably fall out but does not seem to be permanent, although it will damage the hair and make it finer.    You will need to continue periodic treatments for a year or more to catch hairs that cycle from dormant to the growth phase.    4. Overall Value: As long as your expectations are reasonable, the Tria provides excellent value for the money. Professional laser treatments are very expensive and time consuming and if you really want to eliminate all hair I would suggest using the Tria for a long time period and then getting a professional laser treatment or two. That way you save some money and get rid of a chunk of the hair at minimal cost.     5. Some More Suggestions: The treatment head is small and the battery lasts a decently long time but you will need multiple treatments to cover a full area. Make sure you overlap as the instructions say for maximum effectiveness. If you are targeting particular hairs keep in mind you need to hit the root which may not be directly below the hair but slightly to its side under the skin, so laser around it as well. If you come across very stubborn hairs then I would suggest a home electrolysis or second hand professional electrolysis machine to take them out. Electrolysis is far too slow and expensive for me for all my hair especially since I am a guy and it is not critical to remove it, but it is great for touch up.     Do not use this on moles. Also it will be more painful if your skin is darker or if you use it on darker areas of your body. It targets melanin, which is what causes skin and hair color.     If anyone has any other questions please post comments. Also check the comment section as I will post follow ups to this review.</li>
            <li> This has really changed my life, I spent so much work and effort to try to handle unwanted growth, and fitting in professional laser treatments just wasn&#x27;t realistic for me. I had to get mine replaced, and I don&#x27;t like that theres no option to turn off the sounds, so it cant be used just anywhere. But other than that, if you keep using this, and on the high setting, you WILL get results.  I&#x27;m also pale with darkish hair, which helps.  But thank you Tria for making such a product available to anyone at  home! It takes away the shame and introversion I had been living with!</li>
            <li> First and foremost - laser hair removal is NOT permanent people!!!!  This is no one&#x27;s fault but the salon&#x27;s and products like Tria who sell you this idea, when in fact, it is not permanent!  Your existing hair follicles will disappear but it is absolutely possible that new ones can grow in!  That&#x27;s the trick - the existing ones are permanent but new ones can grow in!  (ah ha - the truth!  I got it out of technician finally!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with that being said, I still LOVE laser hair removal and I do LOVE my Tria!  Here is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started going to laser hair removal salons about seven years ago.  I have pale skin (but I love to tan in the summer), freckles and dark, coarse hair.  I have tried them all - literally, all of them (purely laser, gel treatments, on skin, away from skin)!  Some great, some not so great and at various salons which will remain nameless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 1 year of treatment, I definitely saw major hair reduction, but as some other users said it started coming back eventually...new hair follicles!  Tried the next salon, felt the same thing...the treatment wasn&#x27;t working.  New hair follicles will CONSTANTLY grow in!  However, looking back to how much I&#x27;ve had to shave and the razor burn I&#x27;ve gotten over the years, I have to say that I do love the Tria because it actually does work as maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is the thing with this product!  You have to keep using it!  New hair follicles always, always comes back - whether you use this product or a different one or go to a salon.  But, the difference, after a couple of years, is really dramatic.  I used to shave my legs and have spikey hair hours later.  Now, I can go a week without shaving and you can barely notice.  I&#x27;m Spanish - I have a lot of hair - everywhere!  My bikini - forget it - been bare for years!  Hairs start growing in?  Zap with the Tria and I&#x27;m good for 6 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I give the Tria 4 stars and not 5 is because like other users - the small head is really annoying.  But, I understand why they did it - no need to replace the laser head as in other products (which gets very expensive) so you truly get the best money for an at home system.  Where as other systems charge you the same base price but then you constantly have to replace the laser heards - not the Tria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only area where I truly used the Tria (and no previous salons) were my underarms.  I did not follow the schedule because as other users stated - this laser hurts!  I actually found it more painful than some salon lasers.  However, my hair has definitely gotten softer.  It&#x27;s not fully gone because I couldn&#x27;t take the pain, but if you stick with it, this laser does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  And again, after time to time maintenance, it will get better!  I promise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, I&#x27;m hairy, I&#x27;ve done my homework over the years...the only process that truly permanently removes hair is Electrolysis and that is PAINFUL and really expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you&#x27;re a former waxer and are now converting to the Tria - be warned that this may not work well for you!  Waxing, over time, damages the hair follicles!  (Waxing salons won&#x27;t tell you that) so the Tria has a harder job to do and therefore, you will not get the best results either.  However, as I started - keep using the Tria.  I know it&#x27;s painful ladies, but this is the price of beauty unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t expect these mind blowing hair eliminating results...everyone person is different, and everyone has a different rate of hair follicles growing back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having this at home to do maintenance as opposed to going back to the salon (scheduling appointments, waiting, driving there, back, doing the treatments - you waste the same amount of time) - having it is awesome!  I really do love it.  But you will still have to shave!  However, as my dark hair ladies will see - having light blond hairs grow in that you can&#x27;t see is SO worth over time!  I haven&#x27;t hadrazor burn in years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck everyone!</li>
            <li> I have had the Tria now for at least eight months. I couldn&#x27;t agree with these positive reviews less.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Go to a professional.  Trying to unlock the machine each time is such a pain.  It will not work on small spots, like toes or fingers because of the design of the tool. You can&#x27;t use it on your face or chin or moustache hairs.  Had I known that before I bought it, I would have thought twice.  Now I have to go to a professional to get my toes and chin done because this thing won&#x27;t work on such a small surface space.  This bulky thing is simply not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Tria about 3 years ago when it just became available in the US.  I purchased mine for almost $1000.  I have pale skin and dark hair.  I was looking for smooth skin with no re-growth of the hair.  What I got was the hair grew back lighter &amp; softer, not the smooth hairless skin that I wanted.  I have treated my underarms at least 50 times each side and I still get hair growing back.  There are spots where there is no hair re-growth but then you have the hairs that grow in lighter &amp; softer.  So you still have to shave anyway because some of the hair grows back.  I am also not happy with the length of time it stays charged.  When I first got the Tria it would hold a charge for a half an hour, now I am lucky to get 10 minutes.  If you are looking for something that will take all of the hair away forever this will not work.  If you are looking for something to get rid of most of the hair but what hair grows back to be lighter &amp; softer this will work for you.</li>
            <li> I had this lazer for 1 month and used it everyday in different sections. I repeated underarms regularly. After 30 days, my underarms are hair free and bikini line is nearly hair free. I think i might have over used the device bc it stopped recharging after day 29. &#x27;Defective&#x27; So, I quickly returned it through Amazon (Love the service). When I called to reorder- I found out they have a newer model #2 that has a longer charge time and is cheaper. So of course, I ordered it and it is Fedex today.  Not recommended for the face, but I had &#x27;HAD&#x27; some wirery chin hairs that are noooo more. I love this lazer.. my man wants me to do his hairy ears, but idk.  It does hurt to zap the hair away, but waxing is too expensive and painful- And i always get those bumpy ingrown hairs that &#x27;were&#x27; nasty.  I think this item is worth the money especially if i can use it as often as i want. The pain is not so bad with a glass of wine. Plus it zaps the hair folicle that is alive. The places where hair is gone doesn&#x27;t hurt so i know there is no live folicle there.  If you want to get rid of hair-darker hair- the blonde hairs remain. I just pluck them pluss they are soft and pretty down their...</li>
            <li> I would rather do this at home than at a spa so I was interested in how this would work.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks - once a week - and it seems to be working.  Too early to know if the hair removal will be permanent but I am hopeful.  In terms of pain, very little if you don&#x27;t shave properly.  Typically don&#x27;t even feel it unless it is at the highest setting.</li>
            <li> After months of painful zapping, each and every hair has returned weeks after completion of lengthy recommended nearly 8 months.  My skin tone and hair color suggest that I am the ideal candidate for laser hair removal.  That said despite consistent and meticulous use, the results were just temporary. You may think you are growing less hair until the hair growth cycles catch up and you realize you&#x27;ve wasted painful hours for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;According to many forums and friends, the Tria hair laser works better than my experience, so hoping that my original was somehow defective, I contacted Tria and they were very easy to work with; they sent a replacement quickly.</li>
            <li> Dark hair on Caucasian skin; after five weekly treatments, following instructions completely, absolutely no change in hair. You can have mine for next to nothing, since that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Just to sum it up: the product simply does NOT work.     I followed ALL the directions including trimming the hair prior to the use. I treated the same small area for about a week every single day with overlapping. NOT A SINGLE hair fell out a month later, or two, or three...    The product simply does NOT work and it is a complete waste of money. I was very hopefully after reading positive reviews, but I now I am starting to suspect that most of these reviews have been written by paid marketers.     You can even notice it by how incredibly aggressive some of the folks here are who are raving about how good this product is. Why would you be so pissed off at another customer who left a bad review for a product that didnt work for them?    The product is a complete waste of money. You will be better off spending this money for a REAL hair removal procedure at your local beauty salon. Hopefully, my review will spare at least one person from losing their money on this junk.</li>
            <li> I borrowed my friends when I was back in the US about a month ago. I was looking at my legs the other day and noticed I needed to shave but one section was noticeably bare. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why until I remembered that I sat on her couch one day and just zapped that one area. It didn&#x27;t hurt and I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work until now. I am definitely buying one of these! It works for her and her sister and apparently works for me as well. Much cheaper than going to get it professionally done--which I tried on my face and underarms. I didn&#x27;t finish all the treatments with the dr as it took too long and cost too much. At least I can do this at home while watching tv!</li>
            <li> It needs more power.it doesnt worth a try.and plus they just came up with the newer laser mac which is 100 usd cheaper?!!!!&lt;br /&gt;well it wasnt for me so returned it back</li>
            <li> I bought the Tria last week because I am soooooo sick of having to shave all the time, and get ingrown hairs and razor burn. I used it today for the first time. I can not yet say whether or not it works because I just did the first treatment today. However, there are some things I can say about it. First off, it DOES hurt. I have a very high pain tollerance, and could not handle it past the second setting (and this was on my legs, not a sensitive area). Second, it takes FOREVER!!!!!!!!!! It took me 3 hours just to do one leg below the knee. Because you have to overlap, and the laser light is so small, it takes a long time. Then, just when you are getting into it, the battery will die and you have to re-charge it for 2 hours. I do not understand how they can not make one of these without a longer lasting battery. My goal was to do my legs, underarms, and bikini area. However, that would take me a couple of days!!! Then, you need to do this every other week. I just dont have the time for that. I am keeping my fingers crossed that this works. If not, it will be A LOT of wasted time, money, and lots of unnecessary pain. PS: Keep in mind that you can NOT laser over moles or scars. This seems like common sense, but once you get going on a big area like your legs, you can easily forget that. I have a small scar on my leg that blends in with my skin tone, when I got going I lasered over it and it HURTS!!! It also left a burn mark on the scar.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say if this product works or not. Bought it for my wife and she used it once then had a medical emergency and was hospitilazed for a month and wasn&#x27;t able to use it anymore. I decided to return it before the 3 month trial period expired to get my money back and try it again at a later date. Amazon won&#x27;t honor the manufacturers 3 month money back guarentee. They charged me 80 dollars to return it because it was past Amazon&#x27;s 1 month return policy date. The reason I bought it through Amazon instead of directly from Tria was for the Hassle Free return policy. If you want to try it go directly through Tria because by the time you find out it doesn&#x27;t work(if it doesn&#x27;t), even though it is within the manufacturers return date Amazon won&#x27;t give you a full refund after one month.</li>
            <li> I found the tria easy to use but as of now, I have had 3 treatments and found no results yet.  i am using it at maximum output of 5.   It feels warm but other than that, no discomfort.   I guess I need to be patient because the TV ad said you can see results in 6 treatments.  I have had professional hair removal on my chin and upper lip in the past that  had a much faster result though.</li>
            <li> I have only just started using it so not sure how well it will work, but in comparision to the laser hair treatments I have had at doctors offices very comparable.  It is like a small sting even at the highest setting.  I wish the treatment area was larger and the battery life longer, but I am hoping that the money I spent is well work it since the cost was only part of a normal treatment.[[ASIN:B0029OSN4U TRIA Hair Removal Laser]]</li>
            <li> i am one of those unfortunate individual who is cursed with thick, black, fast growing \\&quot;werewolf\\&quot; hair and pale, extraordinarily sensitive skin. i have tried EVERYTHING to minimize my hair growth but nothing has ever helped. this of course has led to a lot of self esteem issues.   that being said, after two treatments with the tria system i am overjoyed to report that i am already seeing a reduction in hair growth! no more swollen, painful and unsightly ingrown hairs! i realize its a little early to declare this a total success, but after years of struggling with unwanted body hair, i&#x27;m looking forward to wearing a bikini without a coverup.</li>
            <li> If you are a guy and your body produces hormones, there is no way to get rid of your hairs forever. you can only do waxing(lasts for 2-3 weeks),shaving (1 week) or go to laser hair removal (lasts for 3 months). Laser is the best option but if you go to saloon its really expensive. I suggest Tria because it is the cheapest laser option and I know you will never get rid of all of your hairs forever, but with Tria you can control them at least.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product. The warranty is too short to prove the company&#x27;s claims. Also, independent reviewers used this for over a year and did not see promised results. Too many of these reviews are from the marketing department.</li>
            <li> The tria laser says it is &#x27;sold by tria beauty&#x27; and tria has a 90 day return policy. However if you buy it through amazon the customer service reps will tell you that you are not eligible for the 90 day return. Your only option is amazons return policy which is only 30 days. Major waste of 400.  I am a guy. I am supposed to have hair, ust not this much hair. So my expectations of the tria unit wasn&#x27;t to make me hairless, it was only to reduce the hair. If I had a 25% reduction I would have been happy but this provided all of the pain and none of the benefits.  Get ready to be disappointed if you decide to buy it.</li>
            <li> Was too painful on the lowest setting sent it back the same day.  It hurts more then waxing or threading.</li>
            <li> After a fair amount of research, including the OK from a relative who used to design medical devices and dealt with the FDA, I bought the Tria about a month ago.  Per the instructions, I have used it twice.  At first I was only planning on doing my legs but since I had battery power left the first time, I&#x27;ve decided to do my arm pits as well.  I am already noticing a decrease in the hair growth on my legs.  I have not noticed much of a difference yet on my arm pits.  However, I am using the lightest setting (\\&quot;1\\&quot;) on my arm pits since it is pretty delicate skin.  I also use \\&quot;1\\&quot; on the bikini line.  I have a pretty high pain tolerance and so I was surprised that I stopped at \\&quot;4\\&quot; for my legs.  I suspect after a few more sessions, as there are less follicles to zap, I will be able to increase it to the maximum \\&quot;5\\&quot; setting.  The description of it feeling like a rubber band being snapped against your skin is a very good one.  Several of those, fine.  A half hour of that?  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m at \\&quot;4.\\&quot;  As for the battery life, I am able to do my pits and bikini line on \\&quot;1\\&quot; and then my thighs down to just below my knees on \\&quot;4\\&quot; before I run out of battery.  Doing my shins and calves and feet on \\&quot;4\\&quot; uses about half of the second charge.    The size of the treatment area is about the size of a dime.  My second session went faster, with about 30 minutes for the pits and upper legs and maybe 15 for the lower legs.  My only complaint so far, and it is a minor one, is that the unit starts to feel a bit heavy and awkward after awhile.  Over all, so far I am very pleased with my purchase and am even happier with its cost savings compared to going to a salon.</li>
            <li> BEWARE!!! It worked for about 4 months, then I did not use it for 6 months and went to use it and it would not turn on.  I called TRIA customer service 2 times and was advised a supervisor would contact me. I have never heard from them.  For this price, it should work, and their customer service is null.  Life is too hectic to waste time calling back a company that sells an inferior product. A simple call back to a customer is not hard to do. Word of mouth is the best advertisment, and I have shared my experience with many &amp; will continue to so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product and it works, but there must be a problem with the battery. Ours failed after the 5th use. Will have to ship back for fixing the problem.</li>
            <li> I got this laser about 2 months ago, I have VERY pale skin and very dark hair- even right after i shave it you can see the dark black dots, luckily this is the desirable condition for the laser to be most effective. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working, after 3 treatments I didn&#x27;t notice any hair loss- then after i let the hairs grow out I actually saw that quite a large amount of the hair wasn&#x27;t coming in. I&#x27;ve now done about 5 treatments and alot of the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back or if it does its finer and lighter, there are some stragglers but i still have 6 more months. I find the laser to be extremely painful, maybe i have a lower pain tolerance, because i can&#x27;t believe these people saying \\&quot;its not that bad\\&quot;, its definitely not a rubber band snap for me, its like getting quickly burned with a match- my lady parts and underarms are excruciating and i can only put it up to a 3 there and 4 on my legs. to deal with this i purchased Dr. Numb a topical cream with lidocaine that numbs the skin, i find that takes the edge off. It seems the laser has made alot of improvements from the older reviews i read, it is light, easy to turn on and use, i do wish it lasered larger areas and the charging is annoying, but its worth it in my opinion. it is hard to keep track of where you are lasering so i usually scratch lines down my leg with my fingernail (lightly!) and sort of go up and down the lines. you could also use a highlighter because it is important to overlap and make sure you are thorough to zap every little hair. So far so good, its only been 2 months but im already happy with the results and hope to see even more hair loss!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using TRIA for over a year. I got very good results. Here are the constraints.  - Works perfect if you waxed before. When you wax, the roots of the hair gets thicker and darker. TRIA could see my leg hair which I waxed over 20 years, but it didn&#x27;t see the hair on my arms. So, if you shaved before, your hair root might be light color. TRIA might not see it.  - No pain, no gain. If you don&#x27;t feel any pain, then TRIA doesn&#x27;t work on you  - White skin, dark hair root (not the hair color) are the perfect combination  How to reduce the pain.  - Apply some Anesthetic cream an hour before starting(LMX 4 is the best. You can find in CVS drugstore).   - Put some ice for 15 mins. Your skin will be very numb with the anesthetic cream  - You may start the torture session:)  My tips:  - Don&#x27;t do any sessions during your period. The nerves are more sensitive. (means more pain)  - Keep it in the high setting.  - Don&#x27;t shave but wax after few days. Each time it is less hair &amp; less pain.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife; she recently started a laser treatment for removing armpit hair and the full treatment (6 sessions) were $500.00 so if this machine can help her get rid of the hair from her legs and bikini line for the same price is a plus. The instructions said that you will see visible results in at least 3 months so I will have to post later results; My wife is pleased with the battery time since it holds quite a good charge. (different posts claim that the battery lasts 15 minutes) she has been using it on highest setting and it does last over 1/2 hour..</li>
            <li> I paid the enormous amount of money for this system with high hopes.  After only one year and after the warranty was over the thing just stopped working.  I called customer service and they basically told me that I was out of luck and had to purchase another one at a discounted rate.  So I said that I couldn&#x27;t at that time and would call back if I could.  I am desperate to get rid of the unwanted hair so I called back to get the \\&quot;discounted\\&quot; new system.  They told me that I was too late and their offer wasn&#x27;t on the table anymore.  What a complete waste of money!! And their so called \\&quot;guarrentee\\&quot; isn&#x27;t worth anything.</li>
            <li> ***Update 4/14/2012***&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been following the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions now for 7 months (biweekly treatment for 3 mos., then monthly for 5 months). Seems to be marginally effective on coarser hair (makes it finer, but not gone).  My legs, which had dark but finer hair to begin with, look almost no different from when I started.  So, now I really recommend people go to a professional:  $400 + a lot of pain for nothing is a waste to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Earlier review: Dec. 2011***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not owned this very long, but will give my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me (pale skin/dark hair), I find the TRIA pretty painful to use.  I can&#x27;t use it on the highest setting in some areas.  Taking a painkiller beforehand doesn&#x27;t help.  Getting a close shave helps a little.  The pain is a big deterrent to treating on schedule (though so far, I&#x27;ve soldiered through).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the pain, I haven&#x27;t yet noticed any real reduction regrowth.  As another reviewer mentioned, a few hairs will come out if I tug on them.  But so far, I can&#x27;t vouch that it&#x27;s accomplishing what it&#x27;s supposed to.  (Thus the one star.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers mention, the laser window is small, so it takes a long time to do larger areas, like legs. (And the Tria starts to feel a little heavy after a while.) The small window also makes it difficult to be sure you&#x27;re getting every spot, especially on legs (though using freckles and stray hairs as \\&quot;landmarks\\&quot; helps). As other reviewers have mentioned, the battery doesn&#x27;t last long enough to even do both lower legs in a sitting.  And recharging takes hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly, going to a professional requires about 6 sessions, is done within 6 months, and because the lasers tend to be bigger, the time per session is less.  The TRIA requires twice the number of sessions (according to the manual)--i.e. more time &amp; pain, takes at least 8 months, and because the laser is so small, takes a long time per session (if you&#x27;re doing legs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of if it&#x27;s ultimately effective, I&#x27;d recommend people go to a professional for legs.  It&#x27;s expensive, but I think many people will have trouble with the time commitment required of TRIA for legs.  $400 for unfinished treatment is even more expensive, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I begun using it right away, it&#x27;s not painful, very good start up with the registration and all you can learn at that moment. Excellent product I already started to see its work.</li>
            <li> Purchased a Tria Laser in April 2011; it was no longer working at all by April 2012 ( started losing the charge quickly by January). Am the ideal pale skin/dark hair candidate. To make this really simple, after using this regularly, painstakingly, on legs, bikini area, arms, underarms and under chin, on the highest setting:&lt;br /&gt;1) it did reduce some hair growth - I can see spotty bare areas if I let hair grow - not spotty hairy areas;&lt;br /&gt;2) I have a lot of hair left, and still must shave;&lt;br /&gt;3) The 90 day return period sounds good, but doesn&#x27;t really give a true indication. If you have been shaving regularly in order to use the Tria, you may be making it appear that there is less regrowth than there is;&lt;br /&gt;4) I have a lot of questions about optimum timing and the strength of the laser ( e.g. is it possible that the strength of the pulse is continually decreasing with use?)&lt;br /&gt;5) It is slow - it should work longer on a single charge, or have someway to extend the use at a session ( battery pack? Cord?) If you have serious hair issues and want to try,negotiating a price for 2 would make your work more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;6) BUT comparing this to professional lasering - which left hair follicules noticably red and irritated  - this didn&#x27;t - which leads me to think it did not reliably reach the roots to destroy them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2013 - came back to update - the Tria actually came back to life for a while - then really died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of hair left, but much less hair in certain areas (like lower legs) where I was a nut about hitting all the area with that tiny head, over and over and over. There is so much area to cover!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also clear that in certain \\&quot;hairy\\&quot; aread ( upper inner thighs, and underarms, I still have too much hair,  but not so thick AND I rarely get ingrown hairs, which means that some of the tougher one are gone.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use on my arms was disappointing, but I was less obsessive about them. Maybe ther are more angled, which makes full exposure more difficult? Tria should know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been thinking -  despite the limitations - about getting another - which say quite a bit. I think that they should offer previous owners a special deal, a trade in, based upon the overblown promises of hair elimination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not agree with those who see it as dangerous. If you have had professional lasering you know it is very possible to get heat and blisters  -- and the TRIA is not that powerful. And you can cool down your skin immediately after to stop this.  You do have to shave close before using it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wonder about some who said that it did nothing - a couple of reviews said this but also said they only used it at the 1 or 2 strength. I had to use it full strength to get results. Also, It takes a long time to see change - hairs do not just \\&quot;disappear\\&quot; as they do with pro laser treatments. BUT even with pro treatments, you may not see a lasting change from limited treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s not perfect, but its almost the only game in town for home laser use in the US.&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if the new on is just a different color or has some real differences?</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews I am not so impressed w/ Tria or in unloading $400 for one. I will wait until technology gets better!</li>
            <li> Bought this for the wife.  She loves it and it has cut down on the amount of shaving she has to do.  She is still completing her legs, but instead of shaving everyday, she only has to shave about every 3-4 days.  She seems happy with it, so I am happy with it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this piece of junk about a year ago. They state on their website \\&quot;results guaranteed!\\&quot; Total lie. Yeah, they offer a returns within 90 days, but that does not in no way give you enough time to realize that this laser DOES NOT WORK. Treatment takes 6-8 months. I did my treatment religiously, had high hopes for this thing, and I had absolutely no results. I had no idea it wouldn&#x27;t work after only 90 days, it took me 8 months to realize this thing was a piece of junk. Now the company won&#x27;t give me a refund. Why? Because they don&#x27;t care, they simply DON&#x27;T STAND BY THEIR PRODUCTS. They know they&#x27;re crappy, they know they don&#x27;t work, they use Kim Kardashian to endorse them, heck I guess I was stupid to fall for this stupid scam.  Use the money to pay for real laser hair removal that offers GUARANTEED RESULTS.  DON\\&quot;T BUY FROM TRIA.</li>
            <li> My disclaimer for this review is that it is for the old style (the one with the digital setting screen came out shortly after I made my purchase). I have seen some reviews stating that the old style is still being sold, so I thought the review was worth it. After reading the online reviews and watching the videos that were available at the time, I thought a Tria laser might actually work for me. At this point there were only a handful of Amazon reviews, and they were a mixed bag. I bought the laser for $495 ($538.31 after tax), received the laser on October 26, 2010, and started using it. It was extremely tedious because the laser head is small and you have to have overlapping zaps so you go over the same spot a couple of times. I should have returned it then just for how time consuming it was. The laser charged twice then died. On October 29, 2010, I contacted the company and the representative authorized a return for a new one. I had to ship the laser back and wait for a replacement. After getting the replacement (at this point the price had dropped to $395) and continuing to put forth the effort for several months as instructed, I gave up. When I first got it and wasn&#x27;t seeing results on the lighter settings, I sucked it up and tried the higher setting. My skin hurt a billion times worse using the Tria laser than when I got salon laser hair removal treatments several months prior (I think it was a Gentle Yag machine). I never saw a reduction in hair or the shedding of hair that I got with the salon treatment. I thought maybe I was being a baby and tried a spot on the arms of my husband and brother without telling them what the laser even was, and they pulled away in pain.  If I had the money, I would have stuck with the salon treatments. The Tria laser was too good to be true.  Why hasn&#x27;t science brought us an at home cream to permanently kill hair follicles yet?</li>
            <li> Ok.  I am writing this review for all the girls like me out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I debated over whether or not to even buy this.  I was expecting to be left crying and disappointed yet again.  I am a hairy, medium complected, brunette Southern girl.  I have battled hair my whole life but around the time I turned 30 I noticed these irritating black hairs on my chin and neck.  They started off slowly and progressively got worse.  All my picking and plucking didn&#x27;t help but I didn&#x27;t realize it at the time.  More started growing and I started getting funky scars from picking and they were so course that they would make a spot every place they started growing.  I was getting more and more depressed about it.  I felt like a monster.  I&#x27;d try not to look in the mirror and then cry when I did.  I would waste hours every day picking and plucking and crying.  I was a slave to it and felt hopeless.  When you don&#x27;t even want your husband to look at you any more, you know its bad.  He never said anything about it.  Didn&#x27;t even realize it was as bad as it was because I took so much time hiding it.  I finally decided to try electrolysis.  It hurt and took way way too long.  I went several times and never had a clearing and it just didn&#x27;t look like it was making any progress.  I returned to plucking and I&#x27;m not sure what happened but I had a big surge in hair growth in that area too.  I was ending up with my worst nightmare and becoming a total homebody.  I stopped living my life because I didn&#x27;t want anyone to see me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went on the hunt for something else to try.  I looked into going to the salon for laser.  For one it was too expensive and two, I was too embarrassed.&lt;br /&gt;I happened to see the Tria on TV one day and researched it a little more.  I was upset when I saw that it wasn&#x27;t for the face because that&#x27;s what I wanted it for.  I continued reading and saw that ALOT of people were using it for this purpose.  Everything else is hairy too but I am mostly concerned withmy face.  I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to use my Tria for the first time.  I immediately used it on my upper lip, neck and chin.  I knew I wasn&#x27;t supposed to expect immediate results but I had to keep checking my face everyday after that.  The hair continued to grow in within the next few days, even faster it seemed.  I got mad and got out my trusty mirror and tweezers.  I went to pull the first long hair and to my surprise, it wasn&#x27;t even attached! WOW!!!!  I kept going.  MOST of the hairs just slid out!  Some I could feel were still attached so I just left them to shave and laser again.  I did this once a week for the first few weeks and my chin and neck was almost completely cleared.  The lip hairs are taking a little longer.  I think it may be because they had a lighter root than the other hairs.  It is 90% gone too though. I am continuing about once a week and am still losing hairs.  I think some are old that are just starting to come to the surface. But it&#x27;s just a few here and there. I still see some hair if I look at a certain angle but they are so fine and blonde that the Tria won&#x27;t get those.  I don&#x27;t even care cause you can&#x27;t see them and if you do they look like normal fine body hair.  After the hell I&#x27;ve been through, that is NOTHING!  I wish I had before and after pictures.  But, I would have NEVER took a picture of that stuff before.  It was too traumatizing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started to work on other parts of my body.  I&#x27;ve done my hands and arms.  My little finger and hand hairs cleared in no time.  The arm is taking longer but the hair was very thick and I noticed when I was helping with the shedding that alot of the pores had more than one hair.  I&#x27;ve done my arms 3 times and they are almost smooth.  I noticed after the very first time that it grew back much slower than usual.  I have shaved them a few times between sessions and I really don&#x27;t think it will take much more.  You can hardly see it, just feel it a little whenI rub my skin.  I&#x27;ve done stray hairs on my belly, chest and cleavage.  All gone.  My underarms are almost done.  It hurts and I always use the highest setting cause I want to make sure it is working.  I&#x27;m starting on the lower half of my body soon.  I know it&#x27;s going to work on my legs because I did a test spot last week and when I went to shave my legs again, I noticed that that little spot was bald.  I&#x27;ve been putting it off because it HURTS!!!  That is one thing I am sorry to say but in most spots this thing HURTS!!!!  The darker and thicker the hair, the more it will hurt.  BUT!!!  The better it works!  When I use it on the fine dark hairs I barely feel it but when it&#x27;s those thick hairs, you want to scream.  Sorry.  It&#x27;s worth it to me though.  At least my face was.  I was willing to take any pain to get rid of that.  The good thing is that the more hair you lose, the less it hurts. Just to be free of that mirror and tweezers was worth $395.  I hope it lasts but I would buy one of these a year if I had to.  It is so worth it if it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this device to any woman suffering with this issue if you have the right hair and skin tone.  It is so worth it to me to have my life and confidence back.  People complain about the price, the size of the laser, and the battery life.  I expected to get home type results from this but I got more than I expected.  It&#x27;s not perfect of course but look at what they are giving you for this price.  No one even has to know you are doing this and it works!!  You can do your whole body for $400 at your own pace.  Even if it isn&#x27;t permanent it is worth it.  As long as I can go for weeks at a time without dealing with unwanted hair and embarrassment, it is worth it.  Just to feel my face and feel soft skin instead of stubble and scars(which are fading as well).  It&#x27;s awesome.  When I realized it was actually working I caught myself crying again but this time in happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this reviewhelps someone out there like me.  I know I can&#x27;t be the only one.  Don&#x27;t suffer any more for any longer than you have too.</li>
            <li> the product has a limited amount of zaps.  If you are in need of a real laser product, you shouldn&#x27;t be limited to something that only does half the job before cutting out and being a useless lump of plastic</li>
            <li> Yes it does work. I was worried because of the cost of it, would it be worth it etc. I have been using Tria for 3 weeks now and have noticed a difference. I know the manf. does not recommend using it on your face but to be honest that&#x27;s the reason I bought it for. I have dark hair and pale skin and am a hairy girl. I&#x27;m 44 and think if I did nothing I could grow a form of beard and mustache. The straw that broke the camels back was noticing I was getting a soul patch, REALLY? That was enough for me. I have noticed a 75 percent reduction in my facial hair. Especially under the chin, I could NEVER even with a razor get that to feel totally smooth. I am thrilled with my tria and if it gives out in a year I will order a new one the same day, if I still have hair to get rid of that is..lol. SO if you&#x27;re like me lucky enough to have dark hair and pale skin BUY IT!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 01/20/13 - Almost one year of using Tria. So do I still have facial hair? Yes. I try to use the tria once a week on my face, mustache, chin and under chin. Mustache area is the most reduced, hard to find hair there anymore. Without using it on my chin it would be crazy but it&#x27;s still there. To be honest I shave EVERYDAY! How gross, right? I had to slack off using it during the summer, since we have a pool and I spend everyday at it, you&#x27;re not supposed to do the tria and be in the sun. Now that it&#x27;s winter I am going to try using it a few times a week and see what happens. So going area by area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face - Mustache area not even enough hair to talk about. Chin, 50% reduction still shaving every day.&lt;br /&gt;Legs - I only use it occasionally on my legs but I only have to shave them once a week.&lt;br /&gt;Underarms - Same with legs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even did my sons very hairy back with this and he said he noticed a slowing in the growth of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again I will buy a new one when this one gives out. FYI, at a level 5 it stings a bit on the face, not unbearable but you will feel it.</li>
            <li> i brought this expensive product and i cant even use it because i am dark skin they dont tell you on the commercial that darker tone skin cant use it and i am a black women this really pisses me off false advertising this product gets no stars to all black people dont waste your money on this product i wish i would of known this before i purchased this item</li>
            <li> General Product: The Tria is easy to use and the directions are clear. The head on the lasar is very small, so you have to move it about 1/4 of an inch at a time. I was doing a small area, so this was okay for me. But if you are using it on your legs, be prepared to spend a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Success (or lack thereof): The product did nothing to remove hair. The hair on the upper lip is now darker, thicker, and grows in faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience: I used this product for 5 weeks on the upper lip and chin area. On the chin I used a level 1 but could never do more than three pulses because the pain actually brought me to tears. On the upper lip, I was able to tolerate a 2, but again with tears. Instructions say to use it weekly. (The instructions have since been changed to say use it every other week.) On the fifth week, I got halfway through the upper lip and red burn marks began appearing on the skin. Within about three hours the burns began to blister, finally healing after about 6 days. I returned the device. Even though I purchased with a 90 day money back guarantee, they did not refund the full price. (They refunded $20 less with no explanation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience was so bad that I have filed a complaint with the FDA. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I just bought this last week and although I have tried it out. It seemed to work the way it way it was supposed to with pinprick hot sensations and some redness, but it hasn&#x27;t been long enough for the hair to start shedding. I will be documenting my experience with the TRIA on my blog though... and I will update my rating accordingly.  [...]</li>
            <li> This product is everything that anybody has written.  It does have a small \\&quot;zap\\&quot; area, but it moves along VERY quickly since there is no time needed between each zap.  It is exactly like the treatments in a salon, and is just as effective.  The charges are more than adequate for an entire setting of underarms and pubic region.  Very satisfied since I had no higher expectations.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost 2 years and i can say that IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK AT ALL!!!!My skin is super white and my hair is black so is no excuse at all why it wouldn&#x27;t work.Save your money,none of Tria&#x27;s products are worth it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really happy with my new device.  It is amazing and I really advise all people to have one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this system in Feb 2010 and did not want to write a review until I had thoroughly used it.  The purpose for which I purchased it was to remove hair in the bikini line and underarm area.  I have been faithfully using it every 2 weeks from Feb 2010 until the end of Nov 2010.  The instructions for the machine tell you to use it every 2 weeks for the first 3 months and only once a month afteward up to 8 months for maximum results.  I wanted to be sure that I got the best results so I used it every 2 weeks the whole 9 months.  I have to say that I am impressed with the product overall.  I am a prime candidate for laser hair removal with light skin and dark, course hair.  I still have some very minor fine hair in the bikini area and a little hair in the underarms.  I am still using the product to get rid of these last stubborn areas, but the overall result is very nice and trouble free.  The biggest complaint I have is against the quality of the product.  My first laser I bought had a bad battery.  Tria cheerfully replaced the product in 2 weeks for mail time with free shipping both ways.  I used the second laser for a while then in June 2010, the laser malfunctioned.  Again, Tria cheerfully replaced the product and send me another brand new unit.  So far I haven&#x27;t had anymore problems and the battery on my third unit lasts longer than the other two.  The only other complaint I have about the product is I wish you could use the unit when the cord is plugged in.  It is a pain to only be able to use it for 20 min on full power and have to wait another 3 hours for it to charge.</li>
            <li> I have used this product about 3 times since purchase and am very anxious to&lt;br /&gt;see the results in another month. This product was exactly as I saw on the TV&lt;br /&gt;infomercials. Very simple and easy to use instructions. I think I will be very&lt;br /&gt;happy with it.</li>
            <li> Do not fall for this SCAM. Save your money and go to a professional hair removal specialist, it might be more expensive but at least you will be hair-free. Versus purchasing this product, and not seeing ANY results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I have dark hair and pale skin, so I&#x27;m supposed to be the ideal candidate but it didn&#x27;t work at all, literally did nothing since all my hair grew back.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s also very time consuming because the laser needs to be recharged often and allowed multiple breaks to cool down (it&#x27;s not at all like in a clinic where they zap your entire area non-stop until it&#x27;s all been covered). So prepare to spend a lot more time with this pre-historic little Tria gun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. If you notice it doesn&#x27;t work for you, return it ASAP. Because when I called to return it, they told me to \\&quot;give it more time\\&quot; so I did. Well, by giving it more time, I also lost the opportunity to return it because it went over the days for their return policy! So now I can&#x27;t even return it. That&#x27;s a double scam. They&#x27;re probably not selling many any more due to bad reviews and cheaper alternatives, and trying to milk whoever else tries out their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So moral of the story, it doesn&#x27;t work, but if you still feel the need to try it, and you realize that you don&#x27;t like it, return it asap! Don&#x27;t wait or you will lose your refund.</li>
            <li> First off, the system works...somewhat.  It takes a significant amount of repetition; it&#x27;s far from completely effective, and I have been using it on very dark hair with very pale skin which is the ideal condition.  I do, however, have less hair on my bikini line than I did when I started.  That&#x27;s helpful; it cuts down on razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that blew my mind is that the battery gave out (won&#x27;t do more than 3-4 pulses) after slightly over a year so it was out of warranty.  When I called to ask for a solution to this very common problem, they make NO provision for any kind of repair.  Their only suggestion is that I should buy another $400 device.  Are you freaking kidding me??</li>
            <li> A product that costs this much money should have WAY better reviews. I saw this product in a Cosmo magazine &amp; was considering it but I decided not to buy since it&#x27;s too iffy. I wouldn&#x27;t spend that much money on something if it might  not work.</li>
            <li> Why are people complaining about the lack of following through on the guarantee and the warranty? Apparently some of you don&#x27;t realize that they put limits (30 days) on the guarantee. Don&#x27;t complain if after 6 months you decide you want to return it and they won&#x27;t give you your money back. You missed the deadline!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if it breaks after a year don&#x27;t expect a free replacement because that&#x27;s their warranty period. I don&#x27;t know how but companies can define their warranty periods to be almost exactly the actual life of the product. I guess quality assurance testing pays off. So if they give you a year then fully expect that it *could* stop working anytime after that and you won&#x27;t get a replacement.  Should they extend the 30 day guarantee and warranty? Probably, since it takes more than 30 days to see results but most electronics only have 1 year warranties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this 3 stars only because I have not purchased this but was forced to give a rating in order to comment. I wanted to comment to complain about the people complaining about the company not following through on their guarantee and warranty *after* they have expired. Some of you obviously don&#x27;t understand how those things work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like the person who gave a bad review after finding out this isn&#x27;t intended for the face ( even though some people tried it anyway with good results) and they say it&#x27;s not for the face but the person bought it anyway. It&#x27;s your own fault if you don&#x27;t research the product. Granted, they will give you best case scenarios for things like battery life but if they say don&#x27;t use it on the face then you shouldn&#x27;t buy it if you need something for your face. If you buy anyway and then read what&#x27;s its intended uses are don&#x27;t complain when you see it&#x27;s not for the face. Besides, people used it on their face anyway, as I mentioned before, and didn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> I purchased as a gift FOR MYSELF! I and absolutely swear by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read lots of reviews online  before purchasing, and called into the Tria Customer Service Department&lt;br /&gt;prior to purchasing to ask them questions about using it, based on some of the reviews...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service was great, they were very knowledgeable, and patiently answered each question.&lt;br /&gt;I have called a couple times just to ask questions, and they are always really helpful and pleasant, which i appreciate, as the&lt;br /&gt;product is not cheap.&lt;br /&gt;I have been very successful, I see great reduction in hair growth on my legs and underarms...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to use this consistenly, every other week, and follow their instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched laser treatments alot, so my expectation was that it was going to take some time before&lt;br /&gt;I could notice the results, now it is really paying off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve see a few reviews about issues after the warranty expires, but if you do the math, and you start using it right away,&lt;br /&gt;you should be pretty much done by then anyway, they give you a free one year warranty, which is standard.&lt;br /&gt;My cellphone broke and I was out of luck, so I dont know what people are worked up about when it comes to the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your homework and if you can commit to the usage time, you will love it!&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for great service and great results!  MOney Well Spent, easily saved me over $2k</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter on her birthday and she love it so much ,and it is easy to use</li>
            <li> OK, just received my Tria laser.  I found something VERY interesting.  The internal laser has a pulse count max, something like 3 million or some obsurd number, they say its enough to remove arm, leg, back, stomach, bikini, and arm pit hair of one average adult.  They don&#x27;t want you &#x27;sharing&#x27; and not spending the money to buy your own... just a caution of you buy a &#x27;used&#x27; unit.  I guess that is why after a while, the unit just stops working.      Used for the first time, pits and legs just for fun.  I could not even feel level 1 or 2, so I jumped to level 3, and I still couldn&#x27;t feel most of it.  The occasional snap of pain more startled me than anything.  It does feel like you&#x27;ve been lightly snapped with a rubber band.  But considering I didn&#x27;t feel every pulse, I didn&#x27;t mind.  I advanced to level 4.. for first day.  Now that definitely every pulse feels like a small snap.  But less pain than tweezing one eyebrow.  I have fair skin and light brown arm pit hair and bikini hair.  My leg and arm hair is lighter, the web site still says it will reduce but they admit is is less effective to blond hairs.  We&#x27;ll see what happens.</li>
            <li> I am a perfect candidate for this product.  I have fair skin and black hair.  I am using it as the instructions advise and have not seen any change at all.  I expected to see SOMEthing different.  I plan to give it another month.  Then I will declare myself just another fool that fell for yet another beauty gimmick.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know it&#x27;s long term capabilities.  I have used it several times on the highest setting and it is bearable.  I have great hopes for it though.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying this joke in January/2011. I have no words to describe how much I feel scammed by this company. I have no idea what degree of improvement those people with the positive reviews had. I would give MINUS 5 stars to it if I could. I spent a lot of money on this (I bough it while I was overseas and had to pay a ton of taxes); I was thinking it would work because I was misled by these reviews. This thing DOES NOT WORK. I used it every month on my toes and I saw absolutely no improvement. The hairs do fall out but in a muuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuch lower rate than they do if you do salon laser hair removal. It&#x27;s depressing how much time you have to put into it to see no results. Yes my hair is thick and dark, and my skin is white (ivory or lighter). I tried to use it on my bikini area but it was just impossible because of the unbearable pain (in all intensity settings). The highest setting has a very long pulse duration and it really hurts on thick hair, specially on the bikini area. I lost a lot of money and time with this. I&#x27;ll stick to salon hair removal and epilators from now on - 185 dollars a session on the bikini area and it does get rid of your hair. One more thing: it is impossible to keep track of the areas you are treating with it. I had to draw vertical lines on my lower legs to treat them. Totally discouraging and time consuming. Plus I had the lines there but the battery wasn&#x27;t enough to do the leg (4 charges for each leg). So I had to wear pants so people wouldn&#x27;t see my new cool \\&quot;tattoo\\&quot; between charges.    Observation: I just came back here to read my review because it just went live. I started reading some of the higher 4 stars reviews and most of them say \\&quot;I&#x27;ve just started using it...\\&quot; one of them says they only used it once. Do not buy this. Seriously.</li>
            <li> The crack of her ass has been as smooth as glass since she started using this--no more crack hairs to worry about.</li>
            <li> I own and used this product for a strict 5 months. I have pale skin and dark hairs. It did not work at ALL and I confidently say that because I was really let down. If anyone wants the hair gone and on a budget, then  your better off going to groupon or livingsocial and getting a deal on a package. It works at the salons faster, better, and longer. Dont waste your hard earned money.</li>
            <li> Battery does not hold charge longer than 15 minutes, so you have to use it in stages over days, big impediment, IMHO.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product eight weeks ago and have followed the instructions religiously.  Although pretty painful on the highest setting, I am seeing excellent results and am already about 90% hair free in the areas which I have treated.  I am a good candidate for using this type of hair removal, as I have fair skin and dark hair.  I am more than pleased with this product and highly recommend it to anyone with skin/hair type like mine, who wants to get rid of any unwanted hair!</li>
            <li> Purchased my TRIA in August 2011. Since 2003 I have been going to laser hair removal locations in two different states. I&#x27;ve had them use all kinds of lasers and numbing - or not - methods.  In all that time I probably spent a total of $2250 for about 10-11 hair removal sessions on each of the following areas: bikini, underarms, full legs, plus a few sessions on the back of my neck to smooth out my hairline. I also tried 3 sessions of electrolysis on these areas to remove the lighter hair that LHR doesn&#x27;t get: bikini, underarm, and eyebrows.  So my hair is mostly gone, but I had a few random hairs here and there. I have dark brown hair and used to have to shave every day, but by 2009, I never shaved anymore. Every once in a while I would shave to get the light whispy blond hairs that you don&#x27;t really notice grow until you get rid of all your dark ones :D  After my pregnancy last year, a little of my hair grew back.  Did my research on the TRIA and decided to try it rather than purchase the expensive full LHR treatments when I just needed a few hairs really.  For what I need, it works great.  I can get all the unwanted hairs left on my body in one 15 minute session whenever I have time.  I&#x27;ve used it once or twice a month since September 2011.  The hair is gone for that cycle until the next cycle comes in, just like they tell you in the LHR salons/spas. I only use the machine on level 5 - why bother otherwise.  When I hit a hair, it hurts just like in the LHR salons/spas.  When I use it on an area without hair, I don&#x27;t feel a thing.  LHR takes time and effort. You aren&#x27;t going to see perfect results after a year of use, but if you&#x27;re consistent over a few years, you&#x27;ll begin to take for granted the fact that you are so maintenence free.  I never think twice about my bikini line if I put on a swimsuit or about my underarms in a tank top. Another plus - get rid of all your underarm hair, and you don&#x27;t sweat as much there.  TRIA is worth it if you&#x27;re willing to put in the time and effort required. You&#x27;ll save a ton of money. If it&#x27;s not about the money for you, just buy your treatments from a LHR salon/spa.</li>
            <li> I would give it -4 if possible!!!! Peice of junk. Expensive &amp; did not work at all. I tried to return it &amp; they would not give me authorization for return. Sent it to the company &amp; was returned with address unknown! Do not wast your $ on this defective product  with a company who does not stand by their product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product of the early &#x27;90s, 5&#x27;2\\&quot; (158 cm), size 2, pale skin w/pink undertones, dark brown (\\&quot;black\\&quot;) hair&lt;br /&gt;LHR in a med spa gave me ~50-70% reduction on my upper lip, neck (hairline), underarms, &amp; legs. The technicians weren&#x27;t thorough &amp; they burned me. I didn&#x27;t have the time/money for more LHR in a different med spa - hence, the TRIA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s embarrassing how much time I&#x27;ve wasted, but I make no exaggerations.&lt;br /&gt;I did 6 rounds of treatments spaced ~2 weeks apart, but ultimately returned the TRIA. (side note: I also used an older version of the Tria as well 2 or 3 times a long time ago too before returning it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time consumption:&lt;br /&gt;treated almost everything - face &amp; body&lt;br /&gt;1 round of treatments took ~5 hours of TREATMENT TIME (actual time spent zapping hairs). Each charge lasted ~20 minutes on the highest setting (5); then the TRIA had to be charged ~2 hours; therefore, it took ~3-4 days of treatments for 1 round.&lt;br /&gt;VERY time-consuming b/c the laser tip is tiny and I overlapped.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I totally cheated; if I were as good about the overlapping as the directions recommend I estimate 1 round would&#x27;ve taken at least 10 hours of treatment time (more than one week of treatments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While using the TRIA (same as w/med spa LHR) you must shave &amp; must not remove hair by the root. Until you&#x27;re completely done with treatments, you spend time shaving plus time using the TRIA &amp; you can&#x27;t save yourself time by using more long-lasting hair removal methods (i.e. waxing, plucking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s inconvenient compared to med spa LHR&lt;br /&gt;1 round of treatments:&lt;br /&gt;med spa: go in once or twice to treat everywhere&lt;br /&gt;TRIA: 12+ ~20 min sessions w/~2 hours of charging in between (3+ days spent; the time waste sucks but the timing does too; using it every 2 hours meant whatever else I was doing got interrupted &amp; I mostly stayed in the house for 3-4 straight days)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boredom:&lt;br /&gt;little to do while using it - they suggestwatching TV but it was hard enough to keep track of where I zapped w/o any distractions. Plus, it&#x27;s very noisy. I listened to music but the TRIA&#x27;s noisiness was irritating. It sucks just remembering spending 4-5 hours over the course of a few days zapping away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain factor (on 5):&lt;br /&gt;painless except for upper lip, underarms, lower abdomen, genitals (OW! details in side note on pubic hair) &amp; randomly some spots&lt;br /&gt;Stubble seems to make treatments painful; I shaved before treatments but I can&#x27;t always get a smooth stubble-free shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness:&lt;br /&gt;slight reduction in quantity and coarseness of hair... I&#x27;m not too critical about the minimal results b/c I didn&#x27;t use it for the suggested 6 months. However, I was hoping for near hairlessness of areas for which I had already had LHR. I was sorely disappointed (ex. 5-6 LHR treatments for underarms in the med spa + 6xs w/TRIA &#x3D; I continue epilating)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;time-consuming, unfun &amp; painful&lt;br /&gt;It might kill hair but the real deal-breaker was the major time suck (&amp; not whenever convenient, but in regular intervals). If I could devote several days each month for 6-8 months to using TRIA I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s ok, but in real life I&#x27;m a full-time student &amp; work part-time. For now, I shave, trim ([[ASIN:B00141DEAC Cleancut PS335 T-Shape Personal Shaver]]), epilate ([[ASIN:B001EWFBLQ Braun 5180 Silk-Epil X&#x27;elle Easy Start Epilator]]) &amp; tweeze ([[ASIN:B000EMWFBQ Tweezerman  Stainless Steel Slant Tweezer]]).&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t given up; next stop: electrolysis! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;side note on pubic hair:&lt;br /&gt;The directions warn not to go further than the bikini line, but the technology should be safe for a full Brazilian. My skin was w/in the safe range of tones so I zapped away. Even though I used setting 5 elsewhere I used 1 here. It still hurt; listening to loud music helped a little. It hurt the most on the mons pubis (I think stubble &#x3D; intense pain) rather than hurting more the further in yougo. I did a session on 5 &amp; it was EXTREMELY painful; I couldn&#x27;t quit cursing (helps w/the pain). The area was red for a few days. The next time I used it on 1 &amp; it was significantly less painful but still very painful. I think I have a high pain tolerance but it hurt a lot.</li>
            <li> I bought this product direct from the company, not Amazon.  Like others, I found it to be moderately effective.  Long before I&#x27;d expect a $400 product to be end of life, it stopped charging. I reported to Tria that the product didn&#x27;t work as advertised.  Tria customer service was more than not helpful ... they were disdainful.  They quite willingly agreed that they were not the least bit concerned if I was unhappy.  They offered me no consideration, suggesting that I should just buy their product again.  Then I discovered that there are similar products, for equal or lower prices, that offer replaceable \\&quot;pulse\\&quot; modules and, based on reviews, identical to superior performance.  Tria could have easily designed this into their product, eliminating many of the negative reviews and transforming my opinion of them. I&#x27;ve bought the Silk&#x27;n Bellalite product and will proceed with that - with the confidence that I can replace the pulse module if needed again and not throw away another $400 nor have an electronic product that is going to end up in a landfill (I&#x27;m searching for recycling) after a very short useful life.  Tria&#x27;s product is, at best, on par with other companies&#x27; product that demonstrate much greater concern for their customers, their reputation, and the environment.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Tria in December 2010. I had only used it a few times when my husband gave me laser hair removal sessions for Christmas. I decided to keep the Tria around for touch-ups in the future. Well, when I tried to use it last week I would only get about five or so pulses before it would shut down. I spoke to a rep and they gave me some hocus pocus about the battery needing to be reset by plugging it in and out about five times. Needles to say that did not work. I just spoke to another rep and basically the unit can be trashed now. There is nothing they can do. No offer to repair or replace, nothing. If you need your hair removed just go to Groupon or Couptessa and wait for a laser hair removal deal to come up ( you won&#x27;t have to wait long). It&#x27;ll be cheaper than a Tria and a lot less hassle.</li>
            <li> The TRIA laser was a huge disappointment!  As many other reviewers have noted, the device fails to function at all after a short time. The laser I purchased will no longer hold a charge and will not work at all.  Both devices have serious flaws and do not function properly.  Tria was not effective either and was the biggest waste of money.  This company should not be allowed to sell such a defective product, I am ashamed that I fell for their gimmick.  Do not waste your time and money on Tria!</li>
            <li> The biggest issue I have is the size of the laser. It is tiny!! I bought this to do on my legs and soon realized that was completely unreasonable. It takes hours because you have to recharge it and with the area so small it&#x27;s impossible to keep track of the areas you&#x27;ve done so you end up missing a lot. I didn&#x27;t think the legs hurt at all though which is a small plus. I then decided I would just do my bikini area since it&#x27;s smaller and more reasonable and I&#x27;ve done probably 4 treatments. The hair has thinned. But it is SO painful in this area. I also found armpits very painful. I would recommend getting laser done professionally.</li>
            <li> I thought the product worked well, however, I am just touching up a professional laser job on bikini and underarms. I used the laser 3 times on all spots including legs, and each time I used it, the battery lasted less time. Although, I did see patches of bald spots on my legs a few weeks after I lasered them the three times I could. The last time I used it, I got about 7 pulses on high power, before the battery died. The first time the battery charge diminished, I called customer service and they told me to charge the laser overnight. So I did. The battery charge still diminished during subsequent uses. I had my boyfriend call, as he bought it for me a a gift, and they said they would assess it and let me know what happened. They sent a pre-paid fed ex label to return it. So I sent it back a few weeks ago and have not heard as of today. Wish me luck.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, Tria would not publish this review ontheir web site for some inexplicable reason.</li>
            <li> I love it :) it is exactly like those in the profisonal salon excet its small and easy to carry with the same effects.</li>
            <li> If you are going to purchase this item, make sure you guys understand that there are people who are paid to write great reviews on products that do NOT work. This product is one of them. I used it for more than 6 months for the set amount of times I was supposed to use it per month. None of the hair on my body (arms and legs) have been reduced to minimal amount. If anything, my hair grew like I never bought the Tria Laser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is so well advertised that is extremely believable, but in actuality, it does not work t all. Seek professional unbiased advice, and make sure you research those who post good consumer reviews about products so you do not have to waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> I gave TRIA six months, as I did not want to be too hasty in writing my review. I am a male. I saw the item on an infomercial.  (BTW I no longer see the infomercials, is it because the product is an absolute failure?) I have had professional laser hair removal from a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office and it does work on my body. The instruction for the TRIA on the other hand are a little different. First the TRIA mentions nothing about shaving the area beforehand. As I was not pleased with the results, I tired shaving an not shaving before the 2 weeks per area recommended use. The results were consistent in that there were NO results. The second thing I found odd, was that before you can even use the TRIA you have a complete an online survery. They don&#x27;t have to do this before you can buy the product, they have you do this after you buy the product, but before you can use it. I suppose most of the questions made sense, they want to know your skin tone, the areas you are going to laser, the color of your hair. My hair is dark brown, by the way, and I have pale skin, so unless if I had black hair, I should be the perfect canidate. I am basing this off of comments from the plastic surgeon&#x27;s office. If I had blonde hair, the laser hair removal would not work. If I had dark skin, the laser hair removal would not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Areas I lasered with zero results: shoulders, upper back, lower back, collarbone, lower abdomen, neck (very painful-but I hate irritating the area with an electric razor, but I must continue to do so as this was pain for nothing), area just outside inner armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Areas lasered with results: none :-(</li>
            <li> I see this has been discontinued. Just in case only the older version was discontinued, I&#x27;m posting to warn everyone off.&lt;br /&gt;In fairness, it does what it says.....after repeated use (like eight times) over about nine months. That sounds tolerable except that it both hurts more than going to a salon for a laser hair removal treatment AND the head is basically the size of your thumb which means it will take you forever to complete what ever area you want to remove hair from.&lt;br /&gt;For general info, I&#x27;ve had laser hair removal several times and it works great with my skin/hair color (medium/olive tone and brown hair). I just want with this trying to save some money for other areas not already done.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line-I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this.</li>
            <li> I have been using my Tria for about 4 months now and have had great results. It&#x27;s really too small to do your legs but I got mine for my underarms and bikini area and it&#x27;s not too time consuming for those areas.  I DON&#x27;T recommend NOT following the instructions but I must say that I used it more often and more aggressively than the instructions say to use it.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had a bigger pulse area. I am extremely happy with my results. My under arms are almost completely hair free. I&#x27;m still working on my bikini area but I would say there is at least a 70% reduction there too.  I have also used it on my upper lip a few times and it looks better too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old and I have facial hair but I did not want to shave or uses wax&#x27;s or tweezer&#x27;s on my face because they made my face break out. It was a lot of money to spend but I am so glad I did each time the hair comes in it is finner and there is less coming in so the hair on my face is less noticabable. I still have to shave but thats ok because after I shave I use the lazer treatement it is quick and painless. I would recomend it to woman that has faicial hair. This winter I am going to use it on my under arms and legs. I&#x27;m a hairy beast and it is so nice to know I have a way to get rid of it,</li>
            <li> So I bought this and hoped with all my heart it would work, I followed the directions religiously with slight discomfort stings a little more than a tattoo,  but Isaw little results maybe an extra day or so before shaving.  But after a wile my skin adjusted and I was back to the same growth, I tried returning it to the company the convinced me to try it longer so I did and kept it out of the return window but got no real results, ended up selling it.  After a time the only thing it left me with is permanent dryer skin, a few spots formed after I stopped use, skin is a little more fragile, and I get hair growing odd in those areas now that can build up collagen.  Also areas that had no hair in the first place now grow hair.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed. This is a lot of money to spend on something that don&#x27;t work. Maybe my hair is lighter than it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas as of 4-5-14 we have sent it back twice for repairs. JUNK!</li>
            <li> I just received the Tria  Laser hair removal system for my wife and after she read the instructions on the package it plainly states that DO NOT Use on the FACE HEAD or NECK  Maybe it should state on the product description so i would not have to return it. thank you</li>
            <li> I have used the Tria 3 times so far &amp; I still am not seeing the results I had expected. I have had laser treatments done by a doctor on the bikini area &amp; was able to withstand high levels but with the Tria I can&#x27;t seem to get above level 3 &amp; around the ankles &amp; underarms only level 2. It seems that the laser head gets very hot to the touch &amp; might be burning more than the actual laser; I have even tried letting it cool down for awhile before continuing. Also the longer I use it the slower it becomes between pulses - which ends up taking longer than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry - not impressed so far!</li>
            <li> I own this unit. I don&#x27;t enjoy wasting money but this was a waste of money. While the most popular review by \\&quot;work of life\\&quot; was fairly accurate, she left out the ENORMOUS FAULTS of this device. First off, it hurts like hell. I am a full grown man and have had back problems so I know a little about pain. This thing is not worth $50 much less $400!!! Here is the REAL problem...it has a battery life of about 20 minutes (which considering how painful it is, is probably a good thing) and its impossible to get the results you want unless you do the area probably 10-20 times. I&#x27;ve read the instructions and personally I have a great attention to detail, borderline OCD, and I don&#x27;t have the patience to do every single square millimeter of skin as this thing requires, not once but three times over a matter of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, that unit has a money back guarantee but that is WAY before it promises you may see the results. So you have 30 days or something like that to return it but the instructions say you won&#x27;t actually SEE results until at least 30 days so its a scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line-the laser area is so small you can&#x27;t get every inch of skin needed for the treatments to work. I do have a somewhat less hairy chest now so that hairs I zapper (at the highest level) actually do grow much less fast....but unless you have a TINY area (and they dont recommend you use it on your face) its pretty much useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a ripoff kids. If it wasnt so painful...or the laser area was bigger AND the battery was much better it would maybe be worth the money. But as it is, no way.</li>
            <li> Yet too soon to tell.  I am a light skinned white dude (not glow in the dark white), with brown hair.  I got it to zap off my chest, belly, and under the jaw neck whiskers (even though it says not to in the package insert).  I have used it twice (every two weeks like it says) and I believe that I see a significant reduction in hair numbers.  Not sure if the laser stunted their growth or if it truely killed the hair like it says it does.  How about pain you might be asking?  Well let me tell you; on the chest, arms, and upper belly, its not that bad.  Like others have reported, feels like a hot rubber band popping your skin.  Under the neck, lower belly, and the back of the neck (hair line wolf fangs) WOW!!!!!!  That will wake ya in the mornin&#x27;!!!!!  Of course this is all on level 5, because it is my belief that when you go to war, you better go in with the guns blazin&#x27;.  The pain seems to be worse when there are more hairs per area, the darker the hair, and the thicker the hair.  I am definitely going to keep this review updated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 10 Jan 2013:  I have used the product on all areas twice.  Again, I believe that the areas that were treated have less amount of hair.  I can report that the hair does grow at a significantly lower rate, and I notice that I have bald missing hair patches on the neck, and the belly area seems to have about 25% hair left.  Keep checking for more updates to this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update November 2013:  I have had to return my first unit, the circuitry failed.  Tria, replaced it without issues, however, the shipping could have been a little quicker.  The second unit is starting to act up.  It will begin to laser, but then after about 5-7 zaps, it will freeze and show \\&quot;ERROR\\&quot; on the screen.  I simply turn it off and then restart the unit.  I will more than likely return the unit for another replacement; hopefully, it will be quicker shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit does kill hair follicles over time, but don&#x27;t get this thing thinking it to be a one time use device.</li>
            <li> It is the best investment I ever made.  I have caramel skin with black, course, curly hair.  I used the tria relgiously for the first 6 months - as instructed every TW0 weeks.  And I will admit it is time consuming, and the charge only lasts about 30 minutes, which was annoying since it takes so long to charge.  But it was well worth the time commitment.  I saw significant results after the first three months.  After 8 months of consistent use I have absolutely no hair on my legs!  As mentioned I used to have very dark, noticeable hair so this seems like a miracle.  Although I was not as consistent, I have also used on my arms, bikini area, stomach, arms and toes and have also seen results there.  It takes time but it is worth it.  I highly recommend it.  Note: get on their mailing list so that you know when it is on sale.  I got $100 off around christmas in 2011.</li>
            <li> Terrible Product &amp; a Hassle to get your money back. It dies NOT work &amp; it&#x27;s a waist of money.</li>
            <li> Started out on my armpits since the hair was the thickest and grew back the fastest. So tired of the razor burn everyday. Have used this product for almost 18 months now and I shave maybe once a week. I think I have about 10 total hairs left on my armpits and finally after 30 years, stopped getting nicks on my ankles and knees. Love it, totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the TRIA laser for one month now and so far I&#x27;m happy with the results.  I look forward to a year from now when hopefully I&#x27;ll no longer have to shave.</li>
            <li> The laser DOES work....But it is a lot of work and dedication ! I really hoped to do the legs, but I only have time for underarms, because I have a 1 year  old who keeps me so busy I hardly ever have time for myself. So...this laser is really only for people who have all the time in the world and here is why : The laser window is sooo small that it takes a really long time to properly cover the area you want to treat. You can&#x27;t just randomly zap yourself.And by the way you cant just relax and watch tv while doing it - you have to pay attention to the process. I&#x27;ve been using this laser on my underarms for about 8 months now,and it worked, the hair slowly disappearing and whichever ones that grow are very very thin and light ( I am a dark brunette ),and the skin is smooth and light , so for me it worked.I am extremely happy about it, although must say I can&#x27;t even imaging starting treatments on my legs since it takes forever to treat both underarms,and btw,the battery lasts for underarms treatment only, so if you are doing a larger area, be prepared to recharge (takes about 3 hrs) and remember where you stopped. I am still planning to do my legs since I know this laser actually works, but i will have to wait,maybe when my baby goes to day care I&#x27;ll have more time.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this laser is very heavy, which can tell you that it&#x27;s not a flimsy product. But when you are doing your underarms you will need a break and some rest for your hands!&lt;br /&gt;I would give this laser 5 stars since it worked on me, but I wish the laser window was much bigger,so that way you can treat larger area, but for now it&#x27;s just takes forever and gets annoying after a while.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it hurts...yes, it does. It only doesnt hurt when on level 1, but when on level 2 and especially 3 it zaps you. Mostly on sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought the TRIA. My doubts were completely squished after using if for two months. I am Italian. My skin is just about as pale as you can get and my hair is DARK and thick. I have been embarrassed by it since I was in elementary school. I started getting laser hair removal at my dermatologist. I couldn&#x27;t afford having it done on my legs, so I had it done on my face (I know you can&#x27;t use the TRIA on your face but this is still relevant). One laser treatment (on a tiny area like my face) was 150 dollars! I got it done three times hoping to see some results. Needless to say, the results were sub par at best. I bought the TRIA on QVC just to give it a try. The results are AMAZING. It&#x27;s been two months and the hair on my legs has thinned out to about half the amount of what it is. I used to have to shave about once every other day, and it would still look miserable thanks to razer burn and ingrown hairs. I can go quite a while without having to shave now. I also decided to laser the hair on my feet. I didn&#x27;t have much there but I thought I&#x27;d do it anyways. Why not, right? It&#x27;s been two months and the hair on my feet is g-o-n-e. Okay. The TRIA might take a while to work fully, but honestly I&#x27;d buy it at full price for the results I see now. It stings a little when you use it. I keep it on a medium power level. Just take some ibuprofen before before you give it a go; it helps a lot. If you can wax, you can use the TRIA. Listen, this is my wonderful and coveted day off and I&#x27;m reviewing a product on amazon. Why on earth, right? I&#x27;ve been meaning to review this product for a while because it&#x27;s helped me so much. I know there are a ton of women with the same \\&quot;hair issues\\&quot; as me. I know it&#x27;s hard to part with almost $500 without hearing about some good results first, so here they are. If you sound like me, buy this thing. It&#x27;s 100% worth it.</li>
            <li> Appears to be a great product based on reviews. But I tried to contact their &amp;#34;customer care&amp;#34; line to inquire about the warranty terms and received ZERO response. I sent a message through their contact form directly on the website, and sent an email as well. I just wanted to know if I could return the Tria 4x in the case that my skintone is too dark (e.g. the device doesn&#x27;t turn on as a result). Anyways this worries me a bit as it is a $550 purchase and makes me question the warranty/returns. Hopefully other customers have had better experiences.</li>
            <li> I used Tria for 3 months, diligently. I did not notice any reduction hair in any areas! I had used it dozens of times on legs, arms, bikini line, and arm pits. Again, I did not notice ANY reduction in hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn´t do what it promisse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt cheated, because i had belive it would work as good as they annouced.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to buy a laser hair removal system but was waiting for a system that I thought would REALLY work.  Well, all the reviews about this product coninced me to try it and I am so glad I did!  After the first time using it, I noticed that the hair wasn&#x27;t growing back.  I didn&#x27;t buy the new model, I opted for the Gen 3 because it didn&#x27;t sound like there was much difference in the models.  This hair removal systems works great!</li>
            <li> I am asian and have really pale white skin with black hair.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, in fact, I was blessed with very little hair under my arms and I hardly have any hair on my legs.  But nevertheless, I still hated tweezing my underarms and trimming my bikini area.  So my results may be seen more quickly than if you have a ton of hair or a different skin type.  Tria is perfect for my skin type and hair color.  I started using Tria 2 months ago.  After activating the Tria (you have to take an online survey to insure safety) and testing your skin color using the skin test device and waving it in front of the laser, it activates the device, I started my treatment for my underarms and bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For underarms:&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you shave as CLOSE as possible, any extra hair makes it more painful.  I also developed the technique of holding one ice pack underneath my airpit (to numb it) while lasering the other airpit.  I switch back and forth every 40 seconds between the arms so I can use the highest setting.  After the first treatment, the hair started growing back after 3 days.  I shaved again after 1 week (even though you&#x27;re suppose to wait 2 weeks) and did my second treatment.  After my second treatment, the hair did not grow back as fast and after 1 months (maybe 4 treatments on highest settings, I kept treating every week even though the last 2 treatments there was not much hair to be shaved) I am hair free.  I have not seen any sign of hair growth for 3 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my bikini area, it was much more painful, so I had to use the same ice technique, but could only use setting 4 or sometimes only setting 2.  I purposely segregated my bikini area into 2 zones, so I could test how effective the laser was.  I started only the top part of binki the same time I started my underamrs and my bikini area has 90% less hair now (after 4 treatments).  I also find that it is  harder to get a close shave, so I ended up tweezing the hairs out (it says not to do it, and if you have yourself waxed you should wait 6 weeks to shave and laser, but I found it simply too painful to laser after shaving because shaving left course stubbles and that&#x27;s what makes it really painful to laser.)  So I tweezed a section of the hair out, waited for about 4 days (that&#x27;s how long the hair starts to regenerate under the skin) and lasered myself (WAY LESS PAINFUL) and noticed a dramatic decrease in hair growth.  I&#x27;m going to do that for the rest of my binki area (It is just way too painful if I shave and laser because of the stubble (or maybe I just need to buy a better razor?).  I find the tweezing and waiting 3-4 days and lasering technique worked for me.  I also know that the reduced hair growth is not due to the tweezing, because there were some hair that grew out after 2 weeks while the majority did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product.  A bit pricy and the head is quite small and each session only lasts 20 mintues (but you get bored from doing it any longer).  So I wish there was some numbing cream I could use, it is painful.  Its like getting tazered or burned everytime.  And it HURTS everytime you zap yourself.  But never having to tweeze or trim again will be worth it.  I am already excited about my hairless underarms! (hopefully for life!)f you have yourself waxed you should wait 6 weeks to shave and laser, but I found it simply too painful to laser after shaving because shaving left course stubbles and that&#x27;s what makes it really painful to laser.)

            <li> I have black hair and pale skin so I find it is working for me. I use Tria on 5 power (highest) and find I have to do many treatments to get rid of most of the hair. On sensitive areas I use an ice pack before treatment to numb the skin. This is consistant with what I found at the spa- you have to go back three times there and some hair grows back no matter what.  I like Tria because it is much cheaper than the spa and even if the hair grows back eventually (although some is gone permanently) you have no hair for a long period of time (better than shaving). Yes the head is quite small so treatment takes a long time but I have been focusing on only one leg over the winter months and will switch to the other one soon. It will be done by the time shorts season is here.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review for those who are needing a unbiased opinion from someone who has no affiliation with Tria or any other hair removal device. I know I really appreciated reviews from real people about their experience with Tria. For many months I pondered whether to take a chance on this product because it seemed too good to be true. I could not afford $10,000 for laser treatments, but really wanted them. Then I worried if the good reviews were paid for and the bad reviews were big warning signs to stay away. Well, after realizing that the FDA would not approve a device if it didn&#x27;t work at some level, I took the chance and ordered it at Christmas time. I am a medium skin tone woman with dark hairs and medium dark hairs and have used this since dec. 27. I already have seen a difference, even though they claim not to expect results for months. Yes, it takes a long time for the legs.... But isn&#x27;t it worth it when you think of the chance of permanent hair removal???? Also, the charge doesn&#x27;t last long on the higher settings, but I found that I am ready to stop by the time it quits as it is quite tedious and there is some pain (though not intolerable). I mark my leg where it quits with an ink pen, put it on quick charge and finish later. I can do it while watching tv at night. I use a white chalk sewing pencil to grid the legs and arms to keep me on track. I start out with my right lower leg, then thigh, arm, then under arm. Then I do the same starting from the left lower leg working up again. Then I finish with the \\&quot;middle parts\\&quot; (bikini and upper lip). This takes me about 2 weeks to complete, then I get a week off. I have to say that the most painful for me has been my legs. I am not sure why. My first session I could only do level 3, but the second one I tolerated level 4. I was so worried that I woul have some kind of bumps from this as I always get those razor and plucking bumps that are aweful. I have sensitive skin for sure so I knew I would have an issue. I promise you all- other than slight redness for maybe a few minutes to a half hour- no bumps no rash no residual pain. The only issue I have is my moles. I have a few that are dark and accidentally lasered them and they did scab. It just hurt a little when it happened and after a day or two the scab fell off. I will be more careful. My freckles were fine and did not burn at all. Although they say not to use on face, I was very careful on the upper lip area and chin and it was fine- no redness or bumps. Yea!!!!   My results so far are as follows: 2 treatments from dec 27-jan 21  legs: I can see some tiny bald spots where hair is gone. I let the hairs grow a few days so i can see my progress. When i shave my legs now- skin is smoother longer  arms:the hair was finer to start with so it is hard for me to tell.  underarms: few visible blank spots where you can tell hair is gone for good  Upperlip/chin: Not much yet exept less of that black shadow.That is good.  Bikini: Wow! Already the biggest winner here. After years of those aweful red bumps after only 2 treatments I can see lots of bald spots and alot less bumps when I shave. THe skin seems alot softer there, almost like baby skin. I have used it on level 4 and 5. Yes it does hurt, but not intolerable and when you see such fast results, it is quite motivating.  If you are contemplating buying it, I would give it a chance. I chose to do it now because it is winter and my skin won&#x27;t be exposed to the sun. I was tired of concealing facial hair and dealing with razor bumps on the bikini area and under arms.    I will review again after treatment 4.</li>
            <li> I used to shave my hands everyday but when I start to use TRIA I shave my hands evrey few months and the hair get thinr , I used Tria on my face few time as well and the hair STOP GROWING WOW, But unfortuntley the I machine stop working and i called the costumer care they told me they will replace it by new one and I Will wait for new one ,,,, ill write back,, good luck for all with amazing technology</li>
            <li> According to the box/instructions Im the \\&quot;ideal\\&quot; skin tone with dark hair. I used the Tria as recommended for just over 2 months and is left scars on my legs and stomach. They look like tiny white pin prick sized spots. Each follicle was fried to the point of leaving a scar and I only used level 2-3. Now I look like I have some skin disease. And it didn&#x27;t even stop the hair growth! This thing is JUNK and a total rip off. If you want to waste money and possibly damage your skin for life give it a shot. Other wise save up and go to a professional hair removal treatment center!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have the kind of hair recommended to be used in this device. I&#x27;ve used it as directed, but I still have hair. It is lighter, but not gone. I would not recommend it. I would not have had any problems with it if the makers said it makes hair thinner rather than gone! which is not true. Too much money for not getting good results.</li>
            <li> Three months in to my test, I definitely think this is working! Excited to see more results as I continue to use the TRIA Laser Hair Removal 4X&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a peek at my full review here:  [...]</li>
            <li> I received the product today and was anxious to try it out.  Unfortunately, it requires \\&quot;activation\\&quot; in order to use it.  Their website will not accept the serial number and says I have to call their customer service.  Their customer service is not available during hours when I have easy access to wait on hold for an extended period of time.  So far it feels like I&#x27;ve just been ripped off.</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying that I have been treated with laser treatmens for very long time I think its been at least 45 in my neck my chest my chin and upper lip so I pretty much know the pain and how it works &#x3D;) please read reviews as I doit for almost evry thing I buy. I have been an Amazon buyer for atleast 4 to 5 years and had never write a review but this laser work on the correct skin tipe, in only 3 treatments even the first one I saw good reluts that I saw at a Laser Hair Removal Clinic Im so glad that I got it. I didint got it before because I is expensive for me I had to save but ok. Please note that you have to have a light skin pigment with black body hair color to work. It does NOT work on red, blonde and specially white body hair, so this is my own and personal experience review on Tria Laser Hair Removal &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1 year of Tria Laser Hair Removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so january 23, 2014 its one years since I got my Tria L.H.R and its been quite a journey let me extplain some of pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: 1. It did work, my black hair on the areas I wanted to remove are way way thinner and very very soft to shave, in the past when I shaved sometimes I had little red bumps and it hurt not any more I can see spots where hair dosent appear any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Now its much easier to use, Im not so scared to do it my self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The money save from profesional salons who do laser like $ 300.00 to $ 500.00 dls in one year. Good Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I only do it when I feel I need it because the hair is much thiner and soft like I said that I only shave in the past 3 months I didint do laser only shave and the hair didint come back like in a week but much more easier to shave much much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons of Tria L.H.R.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It still hurts but the pain is much easier to manage. I mean if I had so many laser hair removal in the past in salons compare the pain is the same no diference. The only thingis that with Tria you can adjust the level you want it so it doesent have to hurt as much but if you really whant the hair to be gone its better to doit on. the highest level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It still dosent take the hair permanently I still have to use it but this is just my opinion I had so many freaking laser hair removal diferent kinds colors names and it didint remove permantly my hair in the past in salons I dont expect a miracle so Im use to it really but this is much more conviniant I do it when I whant and it really does the same job as salon lasers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Some of my friends with like 3 laser hair removals had permanent hair removal results but me I dont know why but it still dosent go away the only whay to tell as that you tryit yourself but give it time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all it does work for me really happy with the money time and effort that the Tria L.H.R gives me, one thing is that you have to have really dark hair for it to work and medium to light skin tone if not the system has a lock that if you dont have the right skin tone it wont unlock that means that you would not be able to use it, its not recomended that you do if it dosent unlock.</li>
            <li> I got this product for Christmas of 2011and started using it a little by little, mostly on my arms because I am half italian and I have been shaving my arms since high school. When I finally got my routine down it was sept 2012 I started noticing less hair and also a lot finer. Unfortunately my tria stopped charging properly. I called tria in December 2012 (over a year since purchased) and told them it wasn&#x27;t charging, they gave me instructions to recharge the battery, it didn&#x27;t work. I wasn&#x27;t able to call them back until just recently, feb 2013 and they sent me a brand new Tria. This was past my warranty and they did not have to do it, but they must value their costumers, so I value them, which is why I took the time to write this review. I believe in this product, it works for me and my skin type and my schedule. Thank you Tria! forever a costumer ( my skin type is olive skin with dark hair)</li>
            <li> Not worth the money :-( The laser is so small that to do one leg may take an hour and you still require shaving. Unless you have 2 hours every three days to zap your body, then don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> After a year of use every 2 weeks, I hardly have any hair left on the places I&#x27;ve used it.  I was disappointed to find out after I got it that it was not for use on the neck or face or that it would not work on light or gray hair.  These points were not listed on information available when you place your order.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the TRIA laser for 995.00, being a weary bodybuilder tired of shaving I thought I would give it a try, I have black body hair which has never been waxed, pretty coarse, and pale skin, you CANNOT tan!! I was the ideal candidate. When I started I was surprised how effortless and quick the results came, the pain was pretty mild, moderate along the bikini line, it got much better after the third session, you have to be patient!! and keep treatments on schedule, the hair will re grow a few times,  after the tenth session I was about 95% hair free, the hair left is pretty fine, not really visible, a year layer, I haven&#x27;t done a touch up, even at the old price, it was the best investment of 2009.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Tria for almost a year now, and it&#x27;s exceeded my expectations.  I have polycystic ovaries, and, therefore, dark hair where girls aren&#x27;t &#x27;supposed to.&#x27; I shave my face, chest and arms every day. This used to be completely traumatic- painful and time-consuming. I still shave after a year of use, but the hair is so greatly reduced that it&#x27;s no longer a huge deal.    So am I lasering the same hairs, or new hairs- is the Tria killing hairs or just weakening them? I don&#x27;t know, and frankly, I don&#x27;t really care. I used the laser a few times per week for the first 3 or 4 months- I have so many areas to manage, I would just use it as I watched TV. I have used it on my face once per week for 11 months. My use on the rest of my body got more infrequent as time went on, but there&#x27;s a huge reduction in hair on all areas mentioned- 80-90%, I would say.    If you don&#x27;t have &#x27;problem hair&#x27;- you just don&#x27;t ever feel like shaving your legs again- and you&#x27;re complaining this isn&#x27;t working after a month or two, I have very little sympathy for you. Yes, the laser head is small, and the charge only lasts 30 minutes- for $500, that&#x27;s the technology you get. (I haven&#x27;t had to replace any parts at this point). Use the laser as recommended, and keep doing it, and eventually you will have very little hair.    I have had to &#x27;manage&#x27; embarassing hair since I was 15, and I assume I&#x27;ll have to do so for the rest of my life. I&#x27;ve done YEARS of electrolysis, years of professional laser hair removal(SO expensive), plucking, shaving- it never ends. If you&#x27;re a girl like me who is a little too hairy for society&#x27;s liking, this is a fabulous investment. So what if you have to laser yourself again every 6 months? WORTH it! Buy with confidence, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Tria is selling the older 3 setting model here which is notorious for burning skin and produces hardly any difference Avoid !</li>
            <li> I began using the Tria in March of 2010. I have seen good results, and was recommending it to my friends....until 3 weeks ago when it stopped charging.  It will charge for 10 seconds and give me the all charged signal. It now only works for 3 pulses, then dies. I spoke with a customer rep last Mon. and was told it sounded like a manufacturer defect.  She said she would call me back...she did not. I called back on Wed. and left a message, as no one answered...no call back.  I called again the next Mon. and was told that since it is past the one year warranty...no offer of repair or even a discount towards a new one.  Tria&#x27;s product would be great if the warranty was longer than 1 year (especially since I paid the $700 retail price in 2010), and they actually had helpful customer service. I am retracting my recommendation to my friends...this will cost Tria more than it would to repair my device or at least offer me a discount towards a new one.    Regretting My Purchase,  Scott</li>
            <li> I bought one of the very first TRIAs on the market directly from TRIA Beauty.  I paid $1,000 for mine!  I can&#x27;t believe how much it has come down in price.  My first unit died within the first couple months, but the company replaced it immediately and the replacement unit has been working great and I have had it around four years now.  I am not hair free, but since the hair reduction is so significant I just have to highly recommend it.  The spa treatments are so expensive and you only get the areas you pay for whereas the TRIA is yours so you can laser anyplace you want.  Since the laser head is so small it is tedious and time consuming and some places are hard to reach by yourself.  I used to never ever wear skirts or dresses because my thighs would rub together and the stubble scratching was completely painful.  Now I have been wearing skirts and dresses comfortably since the hair grows in so much finer and so much more slowly.  So if anybody has doubts that this machine actually works, I can vouch that it absolutely does.  If I am happy with my machine for the whopping original price of $1,000 the price they are selling it for now is absolutely worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love Tria!  I&#x27;ve paid for professional hair removal (LFR) and if you can afford it, it is more powerful.  But to me $500 (now less than $400) is worth it since professional LHR costs much more and requires appointments. And, professional LHR will charge you for each area - lower legs, upper legs, bikini, etc. and won&#x27;t sneak in the stray hairs on toes, breasts, etc.  With Tria, I can do all of me for the same cost.  I even used it to finish what 9 treatments of professional LHR ($1000) didn&#x27;t accomplish on my underarms and it&#x27;s done a great job. I&#x27;ve used Tria for 2 months now on the coarse, dark hairs on my legs and knees and the hairs in these areas are coming in less, or finer, or not at all and I&#x27;m waiting 3 weeks between treatments. The sensitive areas like toes, fingers, breasts, and belly are already without hair!  Just be careful to shave first and go gently over scars because the laser is attracted to dark pigment and will hurt more.  I shaved a small area and treated it, then shaved some more and went about it like that (no markers necessary).  I always used the highest setting which is 3 on my older version.  I would recommend Tria and don&#x27;t understand why someone would send it back and go back to professional LHR.  I&#x27;ve done both and would recommend this since you&#x27;re able to direct it to all the areas you need LHR, use it as you need it, and it&#x27;s one cost for a year or more of treatment.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s comments on this product are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;I researched this item a lot before i bought and somehow i missed the part about having to shave the hair first. I was clearly disappointed. I&#x27;ve tried to use this product at least three times and i would say that results are poor. I am brown skinned with dark black hair and do professional laser treatments.The latter is not painful however removing every hair with this product  feels like electrolysis which is burning off each hair one by one. So basically my item sits there more or less brand new having wasted 2,500 of my currency (TT Dollars) and still paying for laser treatments. The nozzle is way to small and i don&#x27;t like the shaving that&#x27;s why for all my life i have waxed, shaving just brings back the hair faster and coarser, so imagine if i forget to do treatments and this product does not perform as expected. Not sure if the new one is any better but i would say stick with the real thing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;Been using this product for 7 months on the highest level, no reduction in hair growth. I would not recommend this product, just pay the money and go to a professional. What a waste!</li>
            <li> During the first session, it quit and had a \\&quot;error\\&quot; message.  I called the company, and they said it was defective and to send it back.  I did get my money refunded promptly.</li>
            <li> According to description \\&quot;there will be changes in three months\\&quot; and I waited for more than 3 months with regular treatment of every 2week but there is not(little) changes at all. I think it&#x27;s not useful at all. It&#x27;s just waste of time and money. So, Guys be careful before you purchase this item because it not $3-4 item, you are spending around $400. Shouldn&#x27;t now waste money like that. They never return this item. There is lots of hassle when you call to customer service, just they don&#x27;t want to give refund. Making fool to customers. [[ASIN:B0029OSN4U TRIA Hair Removal Laser]]</li>
            <li> This is not worth buying AT ALL!  I used it as directed and never noticed a change in the hair.  My hair is dark and my skin is light in the area being treated...This is supposed to be ideal for this kind of thing.  When it finally dawned on me that it wasn&#x27;t going to work for me I was outside of the return window.  Do Not Waste Your money.  Get a good razor until the technology can really be counted on.  It is just too expensive if you consider that there is a very large population of women it will never work on.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my fiance, per request, im not that bad of a person. she wanted it for her birthday, and so far she loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman with medium brown skin and I have yet to find an at home laser treatment that works on darker skintones.  It would be great if the TRIA company could come up with a product women of all colors could use!   so annoying!</li>
            <li> I was scammed by Tria laser company. The device is a joke. It doesn&#x27;t do anything. The company promises a money back guarantee as well as it guarantees the permanent results. There is no money back and no results. I used the laser according to the instruction using setting 4. Now five and a half months later my hair is as think as it was before and grows as fast as before. I am Caucasian with a very fair complexion - perfect candidate according to the instruction.   After calling the company three times I was told that they couldn&#x27;t authorize a return but could replace my laser. I asked to speak to a supervisor who suggested I might need more treatments. No money back.   Don&#x27;t fall for this. It is just another worthless device.</li>
            <li> I bought the Tria about 2 months ago, which is probably too soon to write a review, but I wanted to share! I have light olive skin and dark hair. $400 is nothing to sneeze at, but after a few months of thinking about it, I bought it as a treat for myself after I got a bonus at work.   I&#x27;ve had professional laser hair removal before and before that I tried electrolysis. See, I&#x27;ve always had hair on chin and even some sideburns and it was mortifying. After awhile the hair always grew back. I was shaving every day and even then somedays the hair would be visible by the end of the day. Makeup didn&#x27;t cover it completely and I couldn&#x27;t afford constant treatment. I had resigned myself to the fact that I would just be hairy.   After the second session with the Tria, I noticed that the hair in the area was finer. And even when I waited another few weeks to do a third treatment, the hair still didn&#x27;t grow back in the capacity that it had before. Sure, I still have dark, coarse hair that needs treatment, but just the fact that I don&#x27;t have to shave every day is fantastic. The fact that I can touch my face and it feels smooth is the greatest thing ever.   I don&#x27;t doubt it will take awhile before the hair is gone. But after 4 treatments, the Tria has paid for itself. I can say that if I had to buy one every year for the rest of my life, I would. Because even if it never rids the hair completely, at the very least, I know I look good when I use it.   So why 4 stars, instead of 5? The treatment area is pretty small. It&#x27;s difficult to figure out exactly where you&#x27;ve been and where you need to go next without zapping the same area 3 times. That&#x27;s truthfully, my only complaint. I have a pretty high tolerance for pain and even in the areas that are particularly sensitive and somewhat painful, it&#x27;s manageable. I just remind myself that it&#x27;s working. It&#x27;s like getting flinched with a rubber band. The pain is temporary and I find that the redness doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> This thing is a toy. It doesn&#x27;t compare to their Lightsheer. The most you can get out of the machine is 22j and its fixed at 1cm. Anything less then 30j you are not really gonna get good results, much less any permanant hair removal.  If you have had professional laser, then you know a shot feels like a big rubber band snapped on your skin, and it leaves a burning sensation, often burnt hair, and hairs with follicles and all that jumped out of the skin. The Tria feels like a skin prick, and thats at its maximum setting #5. Tria also likes you to activate the laser online or by phone. Basically hold the power button for 6seconds. They just want your serial number and information!!!  Another issue is the battery, you can only zap about 1 sq/ft at the most, at its maximum power level before the laser shuts off and you have to recharge. Once the batteries don&#x27;t hold their charge, then you are s.o.l. tria will not replace them for you. they said you have to buy a new unit! When you start zapping you can move reasonably quickly, but after about your 10th zap, the laser starts to slow down to a super, molasses crawl. I think it has a capacitor inside, and depending how much power the batteries have, it has to charge it, so large area are annoyingly slow!!! One zap every 5-10 seconds. Also this laser is made in China, and it shows, most parts creaks, the metal grills don&#x27;t fit very well, poor design and workmanship for a $400 product.</li>
            <li> Never have I spent so much money on a product and been so thoroughly and utterly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, a little background information:  before even considering laser hair removal I went to see an endocrinologist to determine the underlying cause of my hair growth.  I&#x27;m 27 and have been dealing with unwanted hair on my face and chest since I was 17.  As a female, it&#x27;s hard to describe exactly how psychologically damaging this has been.  It lowers your self-esteem and causes a great deal of anxiety.  It&#x27;s also a time consuming hassle- having to shave every single day, covering it up with makeup, worried your date or boyfriend will notice it- fearing that first kiss instead of looking forward to it... the list goes on.  All this to say...I was very, very motivated.  SO, my endocrinologist ran tests on my hormone levels and couldn&#x27;t find anything conclusive.  I had slightly elevated testosterone, but nothing even close to abnormal.  Just bad genes, lucky me.  But I began taking pills to even out my hormones and prevent any new hair growth.  My doctor then gave me the go-ahead for hair removal and said it should work just fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was unable to afford expensive laser hair removal treatments.  After doing some research I discovered Tria.  I was so excited to read all the positive reviews and even more excited that I was an ideal hair removal candidate-  very light, pale skin and coarse, black hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions religiously, even graphed out the treatment area with a red marker so as to not miss a spot, and zapped my face repeatedly on level 5 every other week for 3 months, all the while taking my hormone suppressant meds.  I was concerned after passing the guarantee date with no noticeable results, but decided to keep on going.  And I kept on going....and going....and nothing changed in the least.  I pretty much surrendered after keeping up the regime for 8 months with absolutely no results.  I desperately continued off and on with it for about 2 years, giving it another go for a few weeks at a time and then giving up again and losing hope, still with no change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s not defective as it sure does hurt like hell, and it SURE did work when I accidentally zapped a tattoo on my wrist...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Which BY THE WAY, Tria, you might want to include a warning to keep the laser head WELL away from any tattoos...it nicked the corner of the design and it felt like my skin exploded, like an instant 2nd degree burn.  I was in tears.  The next day, the skin blistered up, then popped and when it scabbed over, the ink literally FELL OFF.  I had to wait for the area to completely heal then go to a tattoo shop and pay $50 to have it touched up.  It now looks awkward and crooked and I have a permanent raised scar from where the laser zapped the design.  So...THANKS FOR THAT.  It&#x27;s actually the only reason I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars, as it DID work on my tattoo.</li>
            <li> I got this system from QVC for three payments to complete full purchase price.  I am light skin (African amer/Cuban) with dark hair about 135pounds at height 5&#x27;2 (to give an idea of amount of laser treatment)  So far I have been able to do complete full legs, underarms, bikini area (full), stomach, toes, fingers and lower arms on  full BATTERY. my LEVELS VARY BETWEEN 3 AND 4 DEPENDING on pain. The newest tria is better because you can hold it against your skin and continue along skin, so you don&#x27;t forget which areas you have already treated. Also if you decide to take a break in between body parts, the system charges rather quickly.  I just completed my second session two days ago, and am following the recommended schedule of every other week as advised by TRIA.  On my legs, arms, and stomach I am able to to treat areas at a level 4. I&#x27;ve noticed the hair to grow back slower, as I am a very hairy person, in fact some areas done on my stomach are completely hairless thus far. Since I am light skin, I have to look closely for bald hair areas.  My underarms and bikini I do level 3, as that level burns more on these areas (even on level 3). Perhaps because the skin is more sensitive, or that these areas are darker. i dunno.  On my last treatment (second treatment) I used a burn spray and took a Tylenol 500mg, to help with the pain. Im not sure if it helped on legs, but again underarms and bikini area really hurt on level 3 (and I can tolerate pain very well).  It seems the legs, arms, fingers, and some parts of bikini line hair is growing back slower, but under my arms and other bikini area hair growth is normal (darker areas).  ANYWAY I will continue to update. Hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> Despite Tria&#x27;s money back guarantee, they denied my refund when I attempted to return it because the product did not work.</li>
            <li> HAVE NOT TRIED IT YET. DO NOT KNOW IF I CAN USE IT ON CERTAIN PARTS OF MY BODY OR NOT.  I WAS SILLY TO BUY SOMETHING  SO COSTLY AND THEN NOT TRY IT!!!</li>
            <li> First off I don&#x27;t understand how people say this doesn&#x27;t work for them after a few sessions. It takes a few months to see gradual improvement at a high setting, minimal spacing, and an extreme amount of patience. I&#x27;m East Asian with thick black hair and fair skin, which is great for the top of my head but not so much on the rest of my body. I have been using the Tria every 2 weeks since August 2011. I set up a nice calendar reminder of dread on my phone to stay on track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially started out using level 3, lasering my lower left leg (knee cap and below). In my own experience if you&#x27;re overlapping correctly it takes one complete charge to do each lower leg. I chose to do both lower legs, bikini area, and underarms. It also hurts like hell especially near the bony areas. I can&#x27;t stress enough that it&#x27;s best to use a sharp razor and to shave right before using it. During the first session, you get all excited about using it and find out a couple weeks later that your hair growth hasn&#x27;t changed. This happened for each area of the body I initially started on. The hardest session is the second one because it still hurts like hell and it doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept at it for a few months, still at level 3, every 2 weeks. By that time I could see very sparse, coin size patches of hair that weren&#x27;t growing back as fast or at all. I was happy to see results but it wasn&#x27;t fast enough for me. If I was going to be hairless by next summer I needed to bump up the level to 5. I couldn&#x27;t stand the pain so I started to research some numbing creams. In conjunction with ice packs (the ones you pack in your child&#x27;s lunch boxes), I was able to tolerate the pain. The pain level felt like the level 3 setting again. Also at level 5 the charge doesn&#x27;t last the whole lower leg, more like 75%. I like to charge the laser while I&#x27;m waiting for the numbness to kick in since the ice packs can only numb a section at a time. Besides the prep of shaving with shaving cream and exfoliating, I also needed to wait a hour for the numbing cream to start working. Yes, it&#x27;s a lot work, hence the dread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward several months to present time, I now can laser my lower legs and underarms without numbing cream. The stuff starts getting expensive so I just use the ice packs now. The pain is much more bearable, much less than when I initially started using the Tria. I can now go 2 weeks without shaving my lower legs which is huge for me. Before the Tria I would shave in the morning and have a sand paper stubble by the afternoon. Now after 2 weeks I only have a slight stubble in a few areas with several random hairs here and there. The remaining hairs are extremely soft and light so I&#x27;m thinking of moving on to my upper legs next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I gave this 4 stars:&lt;br /&gt;This is my 3rd Tria unit. My first one after 5 months stopped holding a charge. Customer service is great by the way. I just packed it up, shipping is pre-paid. I think the whole process took a week and half to complete. You have to wait a couple of days for the shipping label to arrive by email then for it to arrive in Fremont, CA and then back to you. The second unit had a strange almost water/oil mark on the treatment window. I had that returned and got my 3rd unit. I feel like my unit now doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as well as my first or second unit so I&#x27;m on the fence about exchanging it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish you could plug it in and use it. I hate waiting for it to charge because it means I have to schedule different parts of body on different days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;It works, it really does. I&#x27;m not paid by Tria, this is just my experience so far. I am pleased with the results but it took a lot prep work and conscientious effort to arrive at this conclusion. If you can&#x27;t put in the time this is not the treatment for you. It is better to pay for a reputable, great yelp rated office because I figure with all the time and money spent it probablyis the same amount of money (depending on how many body sections you want lasered).</li>
            <li> 8 Months have gone by with little result I have been using this on only my upper lip (I wanted to see some results before I spent the time on my legs)  but I have see little result. The hair is a bit thinner and lighter, but its still all there there hasn&#x27;t been any decrease in the amount that still grows on my upper lip and I&#x27;m a prime candidate with pale skin and dark hair. My friend paid twice the amount for a spa treatment and she started a few months before I did and she had great results.... I should have just paid for the spa treatments.</li>
            <li> Does not work well.  Would take years to remove hair permanently</li>
            <li> After i finished one year of dedication on treating my excessive hair, i was pleasure for the results i have got, but after 6 months of stopping using tria, all my hair grew back again, as i had waste one year with out any results.</li>
            <li> goodbye knuckle and toe hairs..so far, ive been treating small areas only with this laser but will move on to larger ones when i have more time.  i&#x27;ve had professional laser treatments done and this one hurts just as much and im getting the same results.  i have used it on my upper lip and chin hairs. i notice when i pull my skin tight, it doesn&#x27;t find the hair as easily as when i let the nozzle sink into my skin.  at the salon its the other way around, they want my skin pulled tight...so go figure...but whatever works.  the only reason for subtracting a star is because of how small the head is.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I purchased it from tria, with their 4 month money back guarantee.  Kept it!  Not only does it remove hair, I have also been able to laser off some dark freckles.  It hurts when it works.  It has to hurt a bit, so accept that! Just ice the area before you zap it, or pull the skin away from the muscles in the lean areas of your body like the armpits or hip flexors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up only the dark hair follicles or very dark freckles on your skin.  I have very light skin, dark hair, and the occasional dark freckle.  It will \\&quot;burn\\&quot; the follicle or freckle.  If you burn a freckle, it will get dark and bumpy or even form a scab.  The scab falls off in about a week, leaving less of a freckle.  You can do it again until your freckle disappears or just doesn&#x27;t respond to the laser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your light skin will not heat up at all, just the dark hair or dark freckles. It is completely painless on light skin. I start at 2 setting, then work my way up to setting 5, the highest when I&#x27;m zapping the hairy areas.  It is easy to use and cheaper than the multiple and not at all discrete spa vists.  At $400, I think it is a great investment and have used it successfully for about 7 months now.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of comments before I bought Tria. Based on them I decided to take a chance and I am glad I did! I just started, used it only two times and it WORKS! Also, very easy to use!</li>
            <li> I purchased this device after hearing recommendations from my sisters, but I was a little disappointed in the efficacy of the machine.  To shed some light on whether or not you should try it, here&#x27;s an explanation as to how these devices work and whether or not it will work for you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To preface, I have had about 12 sessions of professional laser hair removal on several parts of my body over the last 6 years (5 sessions every 6 weeks followed by touch ups - no hormone problems, I just have more hair than most women). Understand how the laser works, and you will know if it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A laser hair removal device, whether the Tria or a giant machine used in clinics, finds pigment (color) and passes energy all the way through the pigment to the root of the hair. It then kills the root, thereby disabling that hair forever.  Unfortunately, we have several hairs that pass through the same follicle, so that&#x27;s why you often need to have several treatments, because you cannot kill the entire hair follicle with just one session.  Hair doesn&#x27;t all grow at once, either, which is why you have to space out treatments (the laser cannot kill hair that hasn&#x27;t grown yet). As long as that hair follicle is still in tact, hair will continue to grow from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have light skin and dark hair, the machine can \\&quot;find\\&quot; the pigment more easily and send energy all the way to the root.  If you have light hair (or light roots), then the laser will not send enough energy through the hair to kill it at the root, and hence it will not work.  If you have too dark of skin, the laser will not be able to differentiate hair from skin, and will not work.  If you have freckles and moles, you may notice the laser \\&quot;stings\\&quot; over those area as it is sending energy into a non-hair area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The laser only works in one way: either it kills the hair at the root or it doesn&#x27;t.  There is no middle ground.  How do you know if the laser killed the hair at the root?  Afteryou treat it with the laser, you will be able to pull the hair out of your skin with a tweezer (or even your fingers) and it will easily slip out of the skin as it will no longer be attached at the root.  If you go to pull it out and it&#x27;s still attached at the root (you may even see the root when you pull it out - or it will be resistant to pulling and hurt on its way out), then the laser did not kill that root and hair will continue to grow from that follicle.  The laser either kills the hair at the root or it doesn&#x27;t.  It is just that simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how do you know if this device works?  Well, doing several passes on my underarms, going over the same spot twice each time, I&#x27;d say about 30% of the hair each session gets killed at the root.  The rest of the hair the laser either misses, doesn&#x27;t pass enough energy through, or the hair is too light.  The reality is this is a tiny, battery powered device.  The machines used by professionals are massive and can heat up a room 20 degrees F.  This device is nowhere&#x27;s near powerful enough to get the job done without multiple sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When people complain that they use this over and over again and they don&#x27;t see any results, what they really need to be asking is \\&quot;did this kill the root of the hair?\\&quot; It&#x27;s possible the laser IS working, slowly but surely, but you just have so much hair that it requires several treatment sessions.  This device will not kill the root of the hair like professional machines will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would not recommend this product to people who have never had laser professionally.  It is OK for those who have done several laser treatments with a professional and are looking for a \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; device.  But I think this would only work on light skin and dark hair, as the laser on the highest setting (5) kills only about 30% of my hair when following the directions perfectly. If you&#x27;re looking to do large areas like your legs, save your money and find a Groupon or Living Social deal for a local laser hair removal place.  I will say that the device isn&#x27;t painful.  I was able to do 4 on my bikini and 5 on my underarms without more than a slight discomfort.</li>
            <li> We just received the  unit from Tria and while removing the plastic cover noticed the following warnings  which I cannot find on Tria web site so think they are very disingenuous.  So in case you had planned to use it in these locations beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It notes:&lt;br /&gt;For use on:  LEGS BIKINI LINE UNDERARMS FEET ARMS HANDS CHEST BACK STOMACH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE  the TRIA Laser on or around the eyes eyebrows, or eyelashes. Doing so can cause permanent eye injury.  - (OK I get this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE the TRIA Laser anywhere on the face, head, ears, neck, nipples, or genitals or around the anus.  These areas may have more sensitive skin, a darker tone and/or a greater hair density and using the TRIA there may cause serious skin injury.  - (This one I do not fully get)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a male I wanted to use it on the wild ear hairs.  My wife planned to use it for some hair on her chin and a  few wild hairs close to nipples.  I can see that nipples or genitals would be more sensitive skin but would not think the outer ear or chin would be more &#x60;sensitive\\&quot; than an underarm. And how could your head be sensitive skin.  Finally \\&quot;greater hair density\\&quot; hu?  If I had unwanted hair somewhere AND it had a greater density than hair I wanted to keep, I would think this would be exactly a good place to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have other plans  be aware of this.  We are going to return it and instead consider  NoNo but will do much more research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 9/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NoNo does not look so good as far as reviews so we will just stay a hairy family ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called TRIA per their comments to this post and they confirmed it can not be used in the areas noted above. They said they are seeking approval and may have it soon and to keep watching their site.  I still say they should note the above warning conspicuously on web site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked about why folks say it only lasts a year and then dies and was told \\&quot;people put it up and don&#x27;t maintainthe battery\\&quot;. And then a year later try to use it and it will not charge.  Seems a little lame and if that&#x27;s the case, they should have consumer replaceable batteries or allow use via direct AC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also asked what happens if it dies can they repair it. Was told it has a one year warranty. Asked what happens if it fails after a year and was told.. Well if used properly you should not need to use it more than a year...  Hummm  So I guess after warranty there is no repair option. And don&#x27;t plan on passing it on to your sister, daughter, cousin  later on as it sounds like the batteries are pretty lame and even if you \\&quot;maintained\\&quot; the number of charge cycles for the battery is low.  Perfect planned obsolescence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said they were very courteous had no issue with a return and so I&#x27;ll see how that goes. Since I did buy it direct from them they are sending me a return label etc.</li>
            <li> i started using this product 4 months ago and I&#x27;m dark haired with a light- medium skin tone. I used it on my legs, bikini, underarm, arms and upper-lip as directed in the manual. It&#x27;s kinda easy to use, safe but it&#x27;s extremely painful. I can not tolerate the level 5 except on my upper-lip coz the hair there is fine, light and not much . The level i can tolerate depends on the area i use it for and how sensitive it is. The problem is if u wanna get results you have to use it on level 5 on all the areas to be treated which is impossible for me. About the results there is a result but not good enough for me. yeah the hair is lighter, finer and grow slower but i still need to shave even on my legs which i use level four and sometimes 5 for it! and the reduction is not more than 30% for the legs and all the 30% in the quality of the hair not the quantity!!! the arms i use level 4 or 5 too the reduction is 10-20% and this percentage goes for all other areas i mentioned in the beginning but i use a lower levels except the upper-lip area the reduction is 50%&lt;br /&gt; There is a tip to reduce the pain shave well the use ice to numb the area you gonna treat then treat it quickly. This will make you tolerate a level up or even tow if you did it in a very cold room.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item over 6 months ago and haven&#x27;t seen any difference in spite of following the usage instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Two months ago increased usuage and strength - still no results.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I waisted my money for zero result...if somone wanna buy it from me for 100$ I&#x27;m ready..also I&#x27;m  thinking to recycle it</li>
            <li> Although I did feel some hairs burn you realize cannot use this on your face after you buy it and it doesn&#x27;t zap very small areas or round areas.  I cannot zap my knees or fingers so it&#x27;s sorta pointless!</li>
            <li> The Tria Age-Defying Laser is DEFECTIVE!!! Unless you are prepared to wait months, to keep getting replacement pieces, and still not have it work or go through the return process and have to wait a month to get your $600 back. Do NOT buy this product. To the thousand&#x27;s of people on the internet that have already bought Tria&#x27;s defective product, the only way you are going to get your money back, in a timely matter, is to dispute it with your credit card company. Tria knows it is defective but does not tell you when you purchase it. Instead of owning up to the issue they are unwilling to do right by their customers. After charging close to $600 for the product they use one of the slowest shipping methods available to process returns and warranties. And after they receive it there is another up to 2 more WEEKS waiting period before they will process your return or get a replacement piece back out. If you google the product you will find infinite reviews, all saying the same thing</li>
            <li> it actually did not work for me, I was pretty disappointed after 7 month usements, no real result. It&#x27;s a waste of money. I have bought Lumea Philips, which really gives me good results, mostly on my face and legs.</li>
            <li> I agree 100% with the person who said this product is intended to only work for one year. Mine is out of warranty and the company will not stand behind the product. Not only do they not inform customers that you MUST use the device every 2 weeks to maintain the battery but do share that you must also use the product at the highest setting.  I asked to speak to a manager because I could not believe that in 2012 this company had such poor customer service. A manager would not talk with me and the representative that I spoke with continued to spout the company line- \\&quot;out of warranty, just doing my job\\&quot; Do not buy this product unless you are willing to throw away $400.</li>
            <li> hi&lt;br /&gt;i m a long time user of tria and am so happy i purchased it ..i ve seen a significant growth reduction where i had thick growth .&lt;br /&gt;i ve stopped doing my sessions justy to make sure if the growth would come bk ..but as promised it really is permanent ..:)</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0029OSN4U Tria® Laser Hair Removal System]] Hello ladies I just want to say that this device is a must have. It could get very expensive to go to a spy all the time to get this done. If you have it at home you can do it yourself. This is a great gift for Black Friday or for Christmas.To yourself or a loved one, please take a look and consider buying. I don&#x27;t have one yet but I will soon. I hear that is spectacular.[...]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use. I have used it for a month now and have noticed my hair is not growing back as thick.</li>
            <li> I have been using the tria now for just under a year, every 2 weeks. I have noticed no changes in the area that I have been treating. I recommend you save your money and have this done professionally.</li>
            <li> I was able to use the product once, and thought although time consuming to use, will be worth it if the product does what is says.  Problem is the next time I went to use it the screen read \\&quot;error\\&quot; and the product won&#x27;t turn on.  Tria felt it was a product malfunction and it needed to be returned for a new product and since I bought it through Amazon there will be no difficulty sending it back. Bit of a hassle to return then reorder the product, but if the product works.... time will tell.</li>
            <li> This really works! But only on dark hair and you have to be consistent with the process. And turn it up to the highest setting you can handle for faster results. I have had professional laser treatments and it does take longer but results are the same. Used on legs, bikini, even underarms. Recommend shaving about a day or two before treatments so the hair is not as long and then it wont hurt as much!</li>
            <li> Have only had a short time and have noticed the hair starting to thin out not completely gone yet, but as a side note it got rid of my tattoo quick fast and in a hurry</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who needs to treat a large area of skin. I would be paying close to $300 a session so it is very cost effective in that sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue i&#x27;ve had to deal with is pain management. it&#x27;s easier to handle in a clinic for some reason. I can&#x27;t get past the 3rd setting on general areas like my thighs, and on sensitive areas the first setting is hard enough. In any case, it differs with people depending on hair type and skin colour. Pain can easily be managed using an ice pack (best choice) or emla cream (not very useful alone). Also, after the first few sessions, the pain subsides significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing i didn&#x27;t like about the Tria laser is how fast the battery runs out. If they had made the device as a plug in, it would have been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I am very happy with it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stupid thing religiously and I see absolutely no change in my hair quantity or thickness. Glad it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I owned this one year.It went dead a year from date of purchase, funny???  I used it religiously. i have porcelain colored skin and black hair, so I fit the required m.o. This did not work at all for me. I called while still under warranty, the pulse was decreasing over time. Customer service was cordial, but, uninterested. Maybe they&#x27;ve heard this too often!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have used this product exactly as suggested by the manufacturer. I have light skin and black hair on my underarms. I used it every 2 weeks like clockwork exactly as instructed on setting 5. I took before and after photos and the hair growth has been reduced only by 10%. Hardly worth the trouble or the time. The company claims it takes 3 months. I did this 16 times over for 8 months. They offer a \\&quot;risk-free\\&quot; 90 money back guarantee yet you must use it far longer than that to even begin see results. Tricky and deceptive marketing. I emailed the company 2 times with my concerns and they failed to respond. A rip off!</li>
            <li> Wish it was stronger, but definitely works. Limited head size makes use somewhat tedious. Repeated use will decrease dark hair growth only, Does not work on red white or blonde hair as with any laser.</li>
            <li> I love it . i use it to my legs and underarm  it&#x27;s awesome result . i well complete to see how the hair grow up and i recommend the girls to buy it.</li>
            <li> I worked really hard to like this product. The over lapping that has to be done to make this work made my arm tired. I struggled to get to spots that my weak arms just didn&#x27;t want to get to.  There is a reason that this item was discontinued.</li>
            <li> I have not completed the recommended use period, but have been using it about every 2 weeks.  One day I managed to get one and a half legs done but the battery died before I finished and I never got around to the other half.  It was an interesting experiment though...the hair on the untreated area grew more/faster than the treated area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is heavy so my wrist/arm sometimes gets tired.  Treatment can be a bit tedious and it can be hard to tell where exactly you&#x27;ve treated and not treated--it&#x27;s not like legs are square and you can go in straight lines the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll post an update once I have treated longer and seen if there really are long-lasting results.</li>
            <li> Bought it new, but wasn&#x27;t totally happy.  Not as easy to use as it says and very high priced.  Although it did remove hair, wasn&#x27;t the best product out there.</li>
            <li> easy purchase thanks for the service, your product works as advertised and looks and works well. I will make future purchase with complete confidence.</li>
            <li> I bought the Tria a year and a half ago- been using it on my upper lip and chin every week since I bought it - i figured it HAD to work after doing so long but zero results ! The laser is so small that I stopped doing my legs because it took way too long -</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product because I have very course dark hair and pale skin which made me the perfect candidate for the Tria. I also get razor burn and skin irritations easily so I was excited for that reason too. I have sensitive skin so using the laser felt like a rubber band snapping against my skin, unless I did it on the mellowest level but then I felt it wouldn&#x27;t work. The laser head is SOOOOOO small that it would take hours upon hours, days upon days to get everywhere I wanted to laser off (which was everywhere on my body).After a few months I stopped because it was so time consuming and I ended up selling it. After about a year I notice a couple tiny bald spots but for the most part I&#x27;m still just as hairy as before.Maybe if I would have kept it up I would have had more success but note to the makers of TRIA, MAKE THE LASER BIGGER!!!! If they make the laser bigger I will purchase the product again but until then I don&#x27;t see how anyone has any success with this.</li>
            <li> I am light complected with dark hair and of French descent (French &#x3D; furry).  Reviews of this product compelled me to purchase it but I was not satisfied.  The unit kept turning off and/or giving me errors even though I had read the directions...because I really wanted it to work.  Well, it didn&#x27;t work properly and didn&#x27;t help remedy my &#x27;fuzzies&#x27; so I returned it.  Purchase the more expensive Silk&#x27;n Sensepil (the pink one)...it is painful but I continue to see the results.</li>
            <li> I LOVE MY TRIA!  THIS PRODUCT IS VERY EASY TO USE AND IT IS PORTABLE SO YOU CAN USE IT ANYWHERE.  AFTER JUST A FEW USES I SAW RESULTS.  I HAVE VERY COARSE BLACK HAIR AND I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING AND THIS HAS BEEN A SAVIOR.  THE MANUFACTURER HAS ADVISED AGAINST FACIAL USE, BUT ARE CURRENTLY SEEKING APPROVAL BY FDA, WITHOUT MAKING ANY CHANGES TO THE PRODUCT.  I HAVE USED IT ON MY FACE AND IT IS COMPLETELY FINE.  THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE AREA FOR ME TO DO IS MY LEGS, I GUESS BECAUSE THE ROOTS ARE DEEPER.  YOU CAN ADJUST THE LEVEL OF INTENSITY WHICH IS ALSO VERY NICE.  I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE I WAS SEEKING PROFESSIONAL LASER HAIR REMOVAL AND IT IS SO EXPENSIVE I THOUGHT WITH JUST A FEW TREATMENTS I CAN BUY THIS AND DO MY WHOLE BODY.  IM SO GLAD I DID.  I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT ALSO MORE OFTEN THAN THE RECCOMENDED EVERY 2 WEEKS AND IT IS ALSO FINE.  I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT USING THE PRODUCT BECAUSE I DIDNT WANT TO BURN MY SKIN OR SCAR MYSELF.  AFTER USING IT, I HAVE NEVER BEEN BURNED OR SCARRED, AND HAVE NO FEAR OF THE PRODUCT AT ALL.  I HAVE ALREADY RECCOMENDED THIS TO FRIENDS AND THEY ARE NOW OWNERS OF THEIR OWN TRIA.</li>
            <li> Was really hopeful this would work as advertised, so I went ahead and bought and used it as instructed.  By the book, on the highest settings, and for over a year.  Actually, well over a year, and it&#x27;s pretty safe to say I wasted that money.  I have the right hair/skin combo for the product (very fair skinned with brown hair) but it made no difference.  I&#x27;d say save your money for the always available groupon for laser done by a professional.  This may be a workable product someday, but it doesn&#x27;t work in the year 2012/2013.</li>
            <li> Bought the Tria machine 9 months ago, LED screen went out, machine was still working.&lt;br /&gt;Waited 80 days, after many calls to company, was told I tried to take apart, which I didn&#x27;t, but they could not repair, but I could repurchase another one for $200. Or, I could buy the upgraded model for $395. Two days prior, I was told by customer service that if unrepairable and determine to have been dropped that it would cost me $118 to replace. Very suspect that they accused me of tampering with it. The other big scheme is to wait an excessive amount of time, and then tell the customer it&#x27;s no long under warranty. They tried that on me also, but when I called foul, the customer service rep said, \\&quot;Oh, yea, I see you purchased it in AUG from QVC\\&quot;, it still had a month+ left on the warranty. Take pictures of your unit. They threaten me with pictures. I told them they could have taken a picture of any unit. That means nothing.  Bad, Bad company. It&#x27;s a shame, too; it work great when it&#x27;s working, but, why have a warranty if you&#x27;re not going to stand behind. Also, why did I have to wait 80 days. They said they were way behind, yea because so many of their products are in need of repair. I would recommend looking elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I would highly encourage other customers to take a few minutes to write up your experience. Only after using the Better Business Bureau, did I see TRIA customer service offer any sort of reasonable solution to my issue above. I fully expected to spend money to replace my unit, but the way the company avoids the customer and bully&#x27;s them into purchasing new units is bad practice. I believe the product does work for a specific hair color or in specific areas of the body. As a consumer, read up to see if your area and color is within the specifications the product claims will positively affect hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;Customers, keep being resilent. We own the market. The company can&#x27;t push us around if we speak with a loud voice about our experience, both good and bad. I use customers&#x27; review the most when making a decision about a purchase online.</li>
            <li> My body hair was too light for this to be effective...not sure if I&#x27;m going to return it or give as a gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had my Tria for 25 days, but I&#x27;m already seeing results. I&#x27;m transgendered, so as you can imagine, I&#x27;ve got hair issues. My hormonal feminizing regimen probably had helped some, but places like my knuckles/hands and my tushy cheeks have shown dramatic improvement. I used the 3 setting the first time, 4 the second time after I tried mixing oral analgesic (20% benzocaine) with collagen gel. I barely even felt it. With my face, much slower going. I know it&#x27;s not approved for face, but I laser it blindfolded with a sleep mask pulled down low. I won&#x27;t take any chances with my eyes. Anyway......YOW!!  It&#x27;s bearable with the benzocaine, but I&#x27;m still on 1 setting. It&#x27;s unbearable on 1  without numbing. I should mention I&#x27;m rocking a serious Homer Simpson  shadow. I suspect the thick dark hairs just conduct more heat, hence the greater pain. I&#x27;ve been doing my face every week to 10 days because of the low setting. No noticeable results so far after 3 laserings. Nonetheless I&#x27;m pleased with the results on my hands and butt, so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased my Tria in April of 2011.  I was cautiously optimistic -- I have very dark hair and light olive skin, so I seemed to be a good candidate.  As I am a wimp, I also ordered numbing cream (which did not seem to help at all with the pain).  I&#x27;ll admit -- there&#x27;s quite a sting on higher settings.  I&#x27;ve found the best pain relief method is to ice the area right before treatment.  A couple of glasses of wine also help.  Also as others have mentioned, it does take a lot of time with the small treatment head.  You will not see immediate results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, I was almost completely hair-free by swimsuit season, which was my main reason for purchasing the unit.  I noticed last summer that the unit&#x27;s fan had stopped running, which made sessions very slow as it had to cool down between each pulse.  I called Tria, and as it was in warranty, they agreed to send out a return authorization.  They sent out the authorization, FedEx picked it up, and a new unit arrived a couple of weeks later.  Their customer service was wonderful.  I know some have mentioned that the battery life eventually wears out, but in comparison to the cost of professional treatments, I still think the Tria is a good value.</li>
            <li> After reading numerous reviews and blogs I take the chance and invest in it...now I&#x27;m in the process of returning it.  I followed the directions to the letter, and after 3 months at twice a month (every other week) NO RESULTS! I&#x27;ve been using it on setting 2, anything more than that stings quite a bit, and there is no hair reduction that I can tell. Not even growing in lighter or thinner like some reviewers notice...NOTHING! So, I won&#x27;t tell you not to try it but I will say that IT DID NOT WORK FOR ME! :(</li>
            <li> I was sooo excited to receive this. I have very dark, thick, coarse hair and fair skin, which makes me an excellent candidate for laser hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;The hair on my legs is dark enough to be visible through the skin immediately after I shave. I have had the Tria since October 2011 and have been using it diligently on my underarms and my chin. I have had professional lasering on my stomach and face and even after two treatments of that, my hair was over 50% gone and the hair that continued to come in was much, much finer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: .... Nothing comes to mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1.) The head of this laser is absolutely TINY.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the only reason I have been diligent about doing my underarms- because it only takes about 10-15 minutes on Level 3. I&#x27;m a patient person, but the head of this laser makes it nearly impossible to do larger areas such as your legs, which is what I hoped to use this for. It would take me an entire day to finish my legs. Sure, I could set aside the time, but the problem is, that on Level 5, it dies within 15-20 minutes and you have to charge it for 2 hours at least. Within this time, I am able to get about half of one ankle done (I&#x27;m small too). According to the directions- you take the laser head, apply it to you skin and wait for it to pulse. Each pulse takes about 5 seconds to fire (doesn&#x27;t sound like a big deal, but those 5 seconds add up). The you move the treatment head to the next spot, about 3 cm to make the next pulse and so on. You have to overlap the pulses (the directions show you a &#x27;map&#x27; for your pulses, which is circles representing the treatment head, overlapping half way on top of each other (just like a Venn Diagram). if you could hold the laser in your hand and see how small the treatment head is, you&#x27;d understand how long the correct process takes.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just not efficient for large areas. If this were to plug into the wall and not take 5 seconds in between each pulse, it might be possible for an extremely patient person. A much larger treatment head would be helpful too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) This thing HURTS if you plan to use Level 5.&lt;br /&gt;You know that feeling when you accidentally touch a scolding hot pot on the stove? That&#x27;s what it feels like. A very intense heat that makes you automatically yank away. It&#x27;s quick, but intense. Like I said, I have dark, thick hair and light skin so it might not hurt as much if you have lighter, finer hair.&lt;br /&gt;I also, have a fairly high pain tolerance. Professional lasering, which is pretty painful, was cake compared to this.&lt;br /&gt;Laser hair removal is generally said to feel like a rubber band snapping on your skin and professional lasering really does feel like that. The Tria on the other hand gives a very uncomfortable burning sensation. And I would find myself cringing, waiting for the next pulse.&lt;br /&gt;Level 1 feels like nothing, but if I&#x27;m not seeing results with Level 5, I imagine Level 1 is simply useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) It simply does not work.&lt;br /&gt;I used this for 12 sessions, every two weeks on Level 3 (which was all I could tolerate) on my underarms. No change in hair growth or thickness. It&#x27;s exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on my chin on Level 5 (the hair is thin there now, so Level 5 is tolerable) for about 10 sessions, every two weeks to the leftover hairs that I had after the professional lasering. No change, whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very optimistic about this product, and was absolutely desperate to at the very least REDUCE my body hair. I told my Mom, who thought this was a ridiculous purchase that it would be worth it for me if my body hair was reduced by 10% because I was so tired of plucking and shaving every day (especially my legs, which I shave daily). It didn&#x27;t reduce my hair by 1%. It did nothing. I WISH I had just saved my $450 and got a single treatment of professional lasering on my legs. One session of that and I would have seen 5 times the results I saw from the Tria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money. The Tria just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I bought the Tria in 2011 ( about a year ago) and have used it primarily on my face( I know it&#x27;s risky) and lower legs. The result is less or finer hair, but it takes a LOT of patience. You can only use it for about 30 min before it goes off and needs to be recharged for about 2 hours. In my experience it&#x27;s OK to use the Tria laser on your chin but never get close to your eyes. It worked on very dark hair but it didn&#x27;t on medium brown roots- some hairs appear dark, but the roots may be too light for laser. Use with caution, be patient and have realistic expectations: to remove 1 hair for good I needed at least 3-5 consecutive beeps in the same spot. Once I hear about 3-5 beeps, I tweeze off that hair as it falls off naturally and that hair doesn&#x27;t reappear from what I&#x27;ve seen. Don&#x27;t have time to do treatments every 2 weeks, just want the hair gone asap, so I take one hair off at a time. The results are ASTOUNDING: my lower legs are 90% hair free!!! I never thought I would say that. It is unbelievable! I&#x27;ve always had a big problem with my legs and couldn&#x27;t wear skirts, shorts and dresses on a daily basis, as shaving, tweezing, plucking always left unsightly red spots and embarassing rashes. Going to the beach was a challenge, but not anymore! Now my legs are smooth and the skin quality is amazing, as if hair never was there. I don&#x27;t care about the pain as long as it works. If you can&#x27;t tolerate pain, you may have to stick to shaving. I hope Tria comes up with a bigger treatment head and more power for the next product.Still need to do my underarms and upper legs, but I know I&#x27;m getting there at least. All in all , a great product. I DO recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Update 2014: So it&#x27;s been 3 years not that I started using Tria on and off. I also tried professional laser treatments( really disappointed with the high cost-over $1500 and virtually NO effect, everything grew back the way it was on my underarms, OK, maybe 10% reduction, kinda hard to tell). Only my lower legs, which I treated myself with Tria are virtually HAIR-FREE. The skin is silky smooth and healthy looking. I do hope they come up with a bigger treatment head and it starts working on finer hairs as my face has had many of those. Be careful not to drop the Tria ( always keep on floor) as the small screen or the side panel will break...Good luck, everyone!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. It&#x27;s a high quality product, easy to use. The packaging is well thought for when you want to put it away.</li>
            <li> I really want this to work.  I use it faithfully twice a week on medium-dark brown hair and I have light skin.  Setting it up was weird.  Who&#x27;d have thought you would have to program it?  It BURNS in tender areas but only a sensation of burning, no actual burns.  I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months and so far can&#x27;t tell much difference.  I REALLY hope this works!</li>
            <li> I have had my Tria foe 2 years now.  I used it off and on for a few months and then didn&#x27;t need to use it for a while.  I put it away and recently pulled it back out to use again.  The device is dead no matter how long I try to charge it.  And, surprise!  There is no repair service offered by Tria yet.  So, it&#x27;s worthless to me now!!!  You get a 1 year warranty and all they do then is exchange the device.  If it&#x27;s outside the 1 year warranty, you get nothing.  No help, no repairs, nothing!!!  Supposedly they will have a repair service in a few months, but the CS Rep couldn&#x27;t tell me when that is.  How sad that Tria can&#x27;t even repair its own product!!!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am not new to laser hair removal..I have been to med spas and spent a lot of money on Brazilian and full leg hair removal-successfully.  I have the perfect skin tone and hair type (light/olive skin and dark course hair) so I figured for the price I could finish my underarms myself and have for touch ups as necessary.  I wish I could give it zero stars. It did not remove a SINGLE hair follicle. Do not waste your money. Med spas are actually much more affordable now so don&#x27;t bother with this piece of crap!</li>
            <li> Six years ago, I had three sessions of laser hair removal on my underarms at a medical salon for the price of $150 per session. I was unhappy with the results and the level of discomfort. As the years have gone by and the inconvenience of shaving persisted, I thought I&#x27;d revisit the idea. Not wanting to repeat the salon experience I started to research at home laser hair removal systems. After much research, I purchased the Tria Laser Hair Removal system in August 2012. After two months of use, a total of five sessions, here is my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Areas Treated: Legs from knees to ankles, underarms, and bikini line&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Claims: 5 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;Initially I was hesitant about this product because of some of the negative reviews. However, for the attentive, well informed buyer, this can be a very effective product. The important points to remember is that you must fall within the hair color and skin pigment scale that this laser will be effective for. And, secondly, much like medical salon laser treatments, this is not an overnight fix and it will take several sessions before you see results. I have naturally dark brown hair and skin that is medium in tone. My skin tans easily and my hair sun bleaches to a light honey brown in the summer. I have been very pleased with the results after 5 treatments. About 70% of the hair on my legs is gone. The hair that still remains on my legs is growing back more slowly and the hair itself is whispy and softer. For areas like my thighs, which have very light, soft blond hair, this product doesn&#x27;t work nor did I expect it to. The product is true to its advertising and claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain/Discomfort Rating: 4 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;At its worst, the pain felt like snapping a rubber band against my skin. The ease of adjusting the power is very easy, making pain and discomfort unnecessary.With the adjustable power settings, in more sensitive areas I dropped down one power level and felt no pain or discomfort. The power settings start at 1 for the lowest and 5 at the highest. For my legs, I was able to comfortably use the level 4 power setting and around the bikini area a level 3 without discomfort. I believe that it is important for users to know that the higher power settings will bring about faster results. So, you have to balance pain with the time investment you are willing to make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operation: 5 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;The controls are very easy and straightforward. After just a five minute tutorial, you can start using this product immediately without complication or confusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Design: 3 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;The laser head is small and it would be nicer if it was about twice the size. At times, the shape can be difficult to get into hard to reach or more curved areas like under arms. The laser head can only operate on a mostly flat surface. So, underarms, shin bones, and knees can take some negotiation to get a flat enough surface for the laser to fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weight: 3 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;The weight isn&#x27;t bad and seems to weigh the same as a full sized hand held hair dryer, but the weight is packed into the size of a travel hair dryer. It is a bit top heavy and the handle is comfortable, but long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life: 3 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;The approximate battery life is around 45 minutes. When I first started, I could get both legs done before the battery would need to be recharged. Once recharged, I could then finish up my bikini line and under arms. Now that I have so much less area to treat, I can spot treat as needed on a single battery charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery Recharge Time: 3 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;Depending on which setting you select for the charging session, it can take anywhere from two hours or up to six hours to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise Level: 3 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;As the laser fires, the audible beep is not bothersome at all. However, when the fan turns on, it is about the same level of noise as a hair dryer on the low setting. I originally thought I&#x27;d do my treatments while watching a movie, but when the fan turns on, I have to turn up the sound on the t.v. which can be distracting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Instruction and Construction Quality: 5 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;Tria has very good instructional videos and manuals with the product. The product itself seems well constructed and durable. The product packaging is nicely designed and visually attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convenience: 5 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;You just can&#x27;t beat being able to do your own laser hair treatment in the privacy of your own home at your own convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value: 5 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;Though it seems a little pricey at time of purchase, when I compare the $450 I wasted at a medical salon, the Tria is an excellent investment. I&#x27;m guessing that I will be hair free after three more treatments. That means that I was able to do my legs from the knees down, bikini line, and underarms all for under $400. I can do touch ups at no additional cost. I never have to make appointments and I can do this in the comfort of my own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Rating: 4 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;Though there are some minor improvements that could be made, the results are very pleasing. It is important for potential buyers to be honest with themselves about their hair and skin coloring. And, it is equally important to be realistic about the time frame for realizing the true results of the product. I believe for buyers who abide by the previous two suggestions, you will be very satisfied with this product just like I have been.</li>
            <li> It helps... I&#x27;ve used it for a couple months now...not religiously, but my hair falls out. I can absolutely see a difference. It does feel like rubber bands are snapping at it, some spots are more sensitive than others, but I love this thing!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Tria in March 2011. Within four months the unit died. Tria did replace it for no charge, but the new unit didn&#x27;t work any better than the old one. I&#x27;ve been using the product for over a year, but I can really only report a slight reduction in hair. If you want to pay $400 for a hair reducer system, this is the product. But it does not permanently remove hair. I am the right demographic for the system (light skin, darker hair), so I can&#x27;t say it didn&#x27;t work because of that.&lt;br /&gt;I keep using it every few weeks, hoping it will suddenly start working, but I think I need accept that I wasted my money. I hope you don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this product.</li>
            <li> I think I am impatient  After four weeks I can see some improvement, but not as much as I would like. I have been using it on my face even though you are not supposed to.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than waxing and it is slowly working, just not as fast as some other reviews had led me to believe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this for almost 90 days and seen almost no change while using it every 2 weeks according to directions. I won&#x27;t say no change because perhaps there&#x27;s an infinitesimal one, but certainly no change that I can notice easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does hurt, though--not on the legs, but on the more sensitive areas like the bikini area and underarms. I gave birth to two children without an epidural, so I&#x27;m no wimp, but I had to force myself to proceed in these areas while cringing. If it worked it would be worth the pain, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be returning for a refund...too bad, as I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> Best price on the net the item work very well . My wife recommends it get it now before they run out!</li>
            <li> I am a 25 year old female with dark course hair &amp; ivory/beige (according to Tria) skin. I suffer from severe facial hirutism &amp; have done laser hair removal at a dermatologist in the past. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, the hair has come back (LHR works but it requires routine upkeep) &amp; in some places its even worse! LHR is quite pricey &amp; I don&#x27;t have the time or money for the upkeep it requires when going to a clinic. The hair on my chin/neck &amp; side burn area has recently gotten a lot thicker &amp; unavoidably noticable. I have to shave EVERY DAY &amp; it even leaves a shadow right after (eeewww). This is not attractive AT ALL!&lt;br /&gt; So I have had my eye on the Tria &amp; finally decided to give it a go.  The very next day after its arrival, I got to zapping! I was scared &amp; it hurt like a mother but I grit my teeth and just got through it because I knew it would just take longer to see a result if I didn&#x27;t give it my all. I could only grit through a lvl 4. I have some pigment in my skin &amp; couldn&#x27;t get a super close shave for some reason so I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s why it stung so badly. I had some soreness &amp; redness around my jaw line &amp; neck for about 3 days after the treatment. This was typical when I would go to the clinic as well, so I figured I did something right. *yes I know the Tria doesn&#x27;t reccommend that you use it on the face. I&#x27;m a desperate female. I figure the benifits outway the risk.*&lt;br /&gt;It has been exactly 2 weeks since my 1st treatment. Yesterday I noticed little hairs on my wash cloth as I was washing my face, so with great excitement I spent a good 5 mins pulling little hairs out of my neck! I noticed that I now have some smooth &amp; hairy patches on my neck. I shaved the rest of the hairs that weren&#x27;t shedding &amp; knew it was time for another treatment. I put on make up as usual &amp; there was no shadow which was nice for a change. Planned on shaving &amp; treating this morning but when I got up to wash my face I noticed something that I hadn&#x27;t in a very long time... NO NEED TO SHAVE! This is going to be a huge confidence booster &amp; already worth every dolloar in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I have high hopes for this machine &amp; can&#x27;t wait to see what the progress will be in 6 months!This is going to be a huge confidence booster &amp; already worth every dolloar in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I have high hopes for this machine &amp; can&#x27;t wait to see what the progress will be in 6 months!</li>
            <li> I have had professional laser hair removal that actually worked very well on me.  I have black hair and very light - almost Snow White, fair skin.  The Tria didn&#x27;t work at all.  I would never recommend it and wish I had never purchased it.  Had I not followed directions and taken so long to try to get good results, I would have returned it long ago.  I would love to return the item and  have my money refunded.  The Doctors show is where I saw it recommended so thought they would know what they were doing.  Apparently not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I have any hope for a refund or an exchange for something that does work?</li>
            <li> I used this machine consistently as directed for 4 months and saw no results.&lt;br /&gt;If anything I think it started to stimulate growth in certain parts.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Laser hair removal has become more affordable and you can buy packages on groupon etc for actual laser, which is more effective. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I bought a tria and used it for couple of times and nothing happened. after 6 months I wanted to use it again, BUT it was not even working, I called the customer service and they told me the battery life is gone. and here it was my $800. It did not even worth of s***, they told me I need to trash it and they won&#x27;t do anything about it.</li>
            <li> This is only the second product review I have ever written. I have been trying everything and anything I could for facial hair removal. And I mean I couldnt go a full day without shaving twice. My problem areas are sideburns, chin and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was the prefect candadite for laser hair removal and did 6 professional sessions about 12 years ago. With the cost as it was I couldnt purchase more sessions and the hair, because it wasnt all targeted, came back. So, for the last 12 years I have been shaving and trying various creams. As any girl knows with facial hair, you simply cant let it grow in for waxing and creams. So, I lived with the redness and irritation and razor burn. Ive never been able to wear a baseball hat or a ponytail because the hair would be off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had thought about purchasing this system for a few years but was very skeptical and the cost scared me. But I red years worth of reviews and they were overwhelmingly positive.  Once it came on flex pay on QVC I jumped on it. And thank the laser gods I did. This system is AMAZING. This is a weekly treatment, unlike professional treatments which make you go every 6 weeks because of the hair growth cycles. Well, since the cycle varies treating weekly is absolutely the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have completed 4 treatments, I started on a level 3 and am now at level 5.  I have about 70% of hair that is NOT growing back. I actually went out of the house without shaving and with a baseball hat on because so little is coming back. No irritation anymore because what I am shaving now, compared to before, is such a small amount. I have no dount that I will be hair free in the recommended 3 months of treatment. And you can continue to shave while treating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to treat other areas that really I didnt think of such as my bikini.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, love this product and have already recommended it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are even considering this, you cannot lose! I have never been happier with a hair removal result and I am gaining confidence back which you cannot put a price tag on!</li>
            <li> Ordered this (and returned it) for my mother.  The box and/or packaging clearly states not to use this above the neck.  I am guessing that is just an attempt at some legal protection in case someone hurts themselves, but choosing not to include that same warning here on a $400 item is deceptive.  Safety conscious people are not going to want to use this product on their faces after reading that warning, and I suspect that people with unwanted facial hair are a target market for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced Amazon not fully disclosing relevant details about products several times, and I find it disturbing with such an expensive product.  Please do a better job of making sure your customers are fully informed before they order a product.  I also had to call Amazon twice in order to get a prepaid return label to ship this thing back.</li>
            <li> Not only did this not remove the black hair on my pale ivory skin, but it was very painful.  Save your money.  Oh, and it breaks really easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly to eliminate fuzz on my upper lip. I had hopes of using it in other areas as well. The tria has not only, NOT removed the hair on my upper lip, but it has actually made it darker.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely not recommend spending your money on it</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the good reviews on Amazon. I&#x27;m very light skinned with dark hair. I used this product every three weeks for 9 months and so no change. I don&#x27;t understand where all of these positive reviews come from. This product simply did not work at all for me.</li>
            <li> The device demonstrates moderate efficacy at hair removal for mild cases of excess hair growth.  Product does not last long, and customer support is non existent.</li>
            <li> I am the perfect canidate, light skin, dark hair.  I also have an extremely high pain tolerance.  I can barely handle the level 3 setting and it did nothing.  I followed the directions and after 4 months of use not one hair was removed.  Not to mention the time it takes to charge and only 20 minutes of use just stinks.  Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift from my husband and then got pregnant shortly after so I stopped using it after only 3-4 sessions.  About a year and a half has passed since I put it aside.  I went to use it and the battery will only hold a charge long enough for ONE pulse of the laser.  I called Tria&#x27;s customer service and they said since the warranty was expired there wasn&#x27;t anything they could do.  I spend $600 for a faulty product and bad customer service and didn&#x27;t even get any hair removal results.  What a pathetic excuse for a \\&quot;quality\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> This Hair removal laser is easy to use and provides great results with simple instructions. Hair really stops growing back within the sixth week.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all for me and I have fair skin. Wish there was some way to get my money back.</li>
            <li> F*in hurts! It&#x27;s amazing how we can stand to let someone else do it, but I&#x27;ll never hold this thing to my armpit again.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Tria for about 7 months.  I almost gave up on it working but then decided to get more aggressive with the treatments.  I did the treatments exactly as they said to and the amount of times they said to but was  just not seeing any difference.  So, I started using it twice a week, and upgraded the duration for each time.  They say let it beep only once then move on to next area, but I let it beep 2-3 times and finally I am seeing huge areas where no hair is present and the areas that do have hair, that hair is so sparse it shouldn&#x27;t be much longer before it&#x27;s all gone.  This laser does work, LOTS OF PATIENCE is needed and don&#x27;t be afraid to set it up as high as possible and give it hell!!</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to buy TRIA but I read the reviews first, after that i&#x27;m really suspicious now whether to buy it or not!&lt;br /&gt;I have dark hair and fair skin and I&#x27;m HAIRY :( so I really need something to get rid of this hair:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not TRIA, any other advises?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks:)</li>
            <li> I bought the Tria to do touch-ups of spots that i&#x27;ve had professionally lasered in the past.  Unfortunately, laser is not permanent, so 10 years later I&#x27;m starting to have to shave again.  The hair is much lighter and much less coarse than I originally had, but I&#x27;d still like to be smooth again without spending thousands more on professional laser treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m getting great results with the Tria.  I&#x27;m using it according to the directions, and using it at its highest level (which is recommended).  I&#x27;m definitely seeing a reduction in hair growth.  6 months ago I was having to shave my lower legs once per week to keep smooth, now its every other week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> I HAVE TREATED MY UNDERARMS AND BELOW THE KNEE ON MY LEGS 2 TIMES NOW.  SO FAR I HAVEN&#x27;T NOTICED ANY CHANGES.  I AM ABLE TO TOLERATE LEVEL 5 FOR ALL AREAS BEING TREATED JUST AS YOU ARE INSTRUCTED TO DO.  I AM GOING TO DO ONE MORE TREATMENT AND IF I STILL DO NOT SEE ANY RESULTS, I AM GOING TO RETURN MY TRIA FOR A REFUND.  I WAS HOPING THIS PRODUCT WOULD WORK FOR ME TO BOOST MY SELF CONFIDENCE BUT NOW I THINK IT IS JUST ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE PRODUCTS I WILL ADD TO MY FAILED LIST.</li>
            <li> I have read the customers reviews from various sites to ascertain the validity or worth of this product and in the end I purchasing it despite of both negative &amp; positive viewpoints.  Now this is my finding from this product that NO ONE has imparted: it does work for ME -- after 3 sessions I saw less hair regrowth on the body parts I have used it on (arms &amp; legs); however as \\&quot;hairless\\&quot; I become I did not expect to have my skin NOT feel smooth &amp; silky despite of exfoliating before lasering, and creaming &amp; lotioning after.  I felt little bumps underneath the skin, although not visible but a bit disturbing.  I like the \\&quot;hairless\\&quot; result despite of this downside, hopefully after awhile this too will disappear. I would still recommend this but just beware of this could happen to you too. I contacted the company itself to present my situation and if they could possibly provide a solution or answer -- I received a run-around, and was rejected when I posted my review upon their request. Good luck, I hope this was helpful!</li>
            <li> I bought the Tria in June 2011, so I have owned it for nearly a year and a half. I used it perfectly on schedule and very diligently. I followed the instructions at the highest setting of power. At first I considered electrolysis, because I understand that it&#x27;s the only true hair removal. Tria may not be permanent hair removal, but it HAS made my hair grow back finer, and that makes a HUGE difference. It means I don&#x27;t get stubble on my legs after shaving just earlier in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it take FOREVER to do? Yes. It is a gigantic time suck. Is it cheap? Yes, if you can afford time and have nothing else to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been doing any treatments for the past six months or so. Hair has grown back, but as I say, much much finer than before. Some hairs are stll coarse and dark, but far fewer, maybe just a dozen or so here and there. I have gotten success only for leg hair on lower legs. It does not seem to have made a difference elsewhere. From that experience I guess you need to have the perfect hair and skin match-up for it to be effective. In my case, I have pale legs and very thick and coarse and dark black leg hair. Upper thigh hair is finer so that&#x27;s probably why it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope this can help somebody out there. It&#x27;s a risk to buy because you don&#x27;t know if your hair will be the right fit. It&#x27;s also hugely time consuming. But if you are determined and don&#x27;t mind, it really could be a good decision. I know I am very happy about my purchase even if results aren&#x27;t \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; they are still enough to significantly increase my quality of life.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred NOT to leave any star. ZERO stars actually. I bought this product and used it diligently for over a year. ZERO results. Worse part as soon as the warranty ended, it only stayed on for a beep/laser or two. Then, nothing dead. If you research you will find laser centers that have great specials. At least with professionals, I DO KNOW, you get results the 1st time. The hair becomes finer with a professional, and eventually is gone if you can afford to continue to do several treatments per area.&lt;br /&gt;So, save your money. At least use it for a real pro to remove your hair from unwanted areas. Go to a Spa, a Laser Center or good doctor. The choices are amazing. Newest lasers have a great cooling system for less pain. Take pain reliever and topical ointment then ice if you need after. Worth going to a pro.&lt;br /&gt;I learned the hard way. I don&#x27;t want others to spend hard-earned money on this piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY! I have no idea where any of the positive reviews would ever come from but in reality, this is a scam. A professional you can see. And you can have someone accountable for your treatment.  Good luck!!!!</li>
            <li> I have done at least 8 session on my underarms, bikini line, toes, feet &amp; upper lip (although not approved for this use) and seen little to NO hair loss.  I went and has my underarms done by a spa with a YAG laser and after ONE session, half the hair is gone.  Save your money (wait for a Groupon/Living Social) and go have it professionally done if you&#x27;re serious about results.</li>
            <li> I have had professional laser removal done in the past.  I can attesst that the Tria has worked very well for me to use for touch ups.  Even though it is not approved to be used on the face, I use it on my chin and neck and it has worked great!  I am so glad I took the risk to order this as it saves me having to drive an hour to a laser hari removal spa.  I have used this three times every two weeks and have noticed much less facial hair regrowth.  So happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I am unsure about this product so far I haven&#x27;t used it yet. there were some warnings in the manual when I opened it that were not on the website or advertised and the lady at customer service that I called before ordering this product knowingly lied to me about.  That is if she knew what was in the manual.  I&#x27;m trying to decide the next two days whether or not i want to try this out or just send it back.</li>
            <li> The product advertisements do not highlight the fact that the laser remover can be used only after shaving by a razor and will not work with waxed skin. Also generates too much of heat to make it bearable on the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought Tria from the website but it was really painful than doing it in the clinic.&lt;br /&gt;When I decide to return it they said RETURN IS NOT FREE !! I am really disappointed about that. So I just want to tell you this point because they don&#x27;t mention it in the website return policy.</li>
            <li> I am happy with it so far.  I like the fact that it is cordless.  I was concerned that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to cover enough area before having to charge it but that hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  I have not had it long enough to see how it does at removing the hair.</li>
            <li> I had about 4 sessions of professional laser hair removal for my underarms and bikini about 4 years ago.  It did work but I still had to shave a little bit.  I bought Tria to finish those areas and treat my legs.  To make sure it worked I only started with one leg.  After about 4 treatments I noticed a definite difference in the growth of hair on my legs.  My husband could even feel the difference.  It should be noted that I did use it on level 5 for each treatment.</li>
            <li> I received the product today, but I did not know how it works: (&lt;br /&gt;I want you to write the operating steps,</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year now, as directed. I did notice a small decrease in the amount of hair in each area, but by no means am I hair free. I would say the hair has decreased by maybe 25%, so I am left with 75% of the original hair in place. For $500 (the price I paid when I purchased) I would not at all say that is worth it. I should have saved up and went with professional laser treatment, which is what I will likely still end up doing.</li>
            <li> I bought one, used it for a year on myself and a friend, and ...it doesn&#x27;t work.  If the lasers that are in doctor&#x27;s offices aren&#x27;t permanent then why would this one be?  Electrolysis is the only form off permanent hair removal that I have found to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;no no\\&quot; just tweezed the hair out &amp; you end up with courser hair and more hair than you started with.  None of these products are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ella</li>
            <li> PURCHASED AS A GIFT. RECIPIENT DIDN&#x27;T LIKE IT AS WELL AS NO NO! I SEE IT&#x27;S BEEN DISCONTINUED MAYBE THAT&#x27;S WHY!</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife and she used it consistently at the highest setting she could tolerate (which was only 2 or 3) and it never made any noticeable reduction.</li>
            <li> Works great, takes several times.  The hardest thing for me is not plucking or waxing. I highly recommend this. I have pcos, and this lazer has been a life saver.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin and light to medium brown hair. The lazer did absolutely nothing to remove the hair. I used it exactly as directed, and cranked that sucker as high as it would go (I am good with pain). Nothing. Save your money and go to a pro.</li>
            <li> Tria hair removal laser does not work at all. I didnt buy my laser from amazon but i am posting this review because tria website didn&#x27;t allow me to post my review. I posted my review on tria website stating that this product does not work. I am really upset that they didn&#x27;t approve my review. In their review guidelines it says that you cannot promote any other product but I didn&#x27;t do so. I just said it didn&#x27;t work for me and that you should try other options. I tried this laser for about 5 months and it did not reduce the amount of hair growth. I used it on my underarms. Save your money.</li>
            <li> The Tria Laser Hair Removal product did not work for me.  I just couldn&#x27;t get the hang of doing it properly on those hard to reach areas.  I sent it back in it&#x27;s original packaging in pristine condition following all of their \\&quot;rules\\&quot; for returns.  They received my return on November 13, 2012 and as of today Jan 4, 2013 I still have not received my refund.  I have been told to allow up to 60 days for a refund, but their website says to allow 10-14 days for a refund.  This is the worst company I have ever dealt with for a return.  Just BEWARE if you think you may have to return it.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to work like they say it will.  I use it but I still do not see any results so I just end up shaving with the razor.</li>
            <li> I actually had salon laser hair removal on my underarms and bikini area, and saw about 70% hair reduction.  I decided to try this product to finish the treatment and banish the remaining 30%, since just one follow up visit after the initial block of visits was going to cost over half of what the Tria costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Tria as directed for both frequency and duration.  I have fair skin and medium brown hair.  I used it on the highest setting most of the time, knowing that even though it hurt more, this was supposed to be more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this hurt pretty much the same as the salon treatments - repeated sharp snapping sensations, like a rubber band snapping against the skin.  The only difference was I had to administer the pain myself, as opposed to bracing myself while someone else administered it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The usual charge lasted through the underarm area or the bikini area, but never both together.  The device became hot as I used it, almost uncomfortably so.  I find it odd that this was not designed to function while plugged in.  Cordless is nice, but a long cord would allow convenient use with better, longer lasting power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After six months of use, I had no visible results.  This was extremely disappointing!  I had read the good reviews, followed the directions, I felt the pain as if it had been working, yet nothing changed.  Wasted time, pain  and money!  Perhaps the Tria  has worked for some, but it did not for me.</li>
            <li> Device does not work&lt;br /&gt;Corrupted&lt;br /&gt;I want to recover my money&lt;br /&gt;Or the oldest complaint to the concerned authorities&lt;br /&gt;You buy 2 one device does not work</li>
            <li> It does not work if you&#x27;re not Caucasian. Buyer beware. If your skin is darker than WHITE, it will NOT work for you.</li>
            <li> Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;And very comfortable Works&lt;br /&gt; on more than one grade&lt;br /&gt; Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;And saves a lot of money</li>
            <li> The advertisement on the TV is deceptive and misleaing. The ad shows blonde women in it and one woman says it can be used anywhere on the body and then when you get the product is clearly states on the box that it only works on dark hair and also lists all the areas that it can&#x27;t be used on. If I had the funds to spend I would seek legal advise on the issues of this deceptive advertisement.  Amazon however did everything right and am very pleased by your quick response and refund.</li>
            <li> There is no doubt in my mind that the Tria works - and works really, really well! I have fair skin and dark hair, so I fit the profile of people for whom it should work. You have to be patient. Give it time, keep using it, and you will see the results. 100% worth it.</li>
            <li> Tria does work.  You just have to be consistant &amp; patient.  It won&#x27;t make you hair free in 6 months as they claim, but it does work.  I use it every other week and have seen a huge reduction in hair.  In some smaller areas, the hair pretty is much gone.  The battery lasts about 40 minutes which is just about the time you get tired of using it for that day.  My advice is to focus more on where you want the hair gone most and then use the rest of the battery to do other areas.  It doesn&#x27;t work for all skin types and hair colors so check out their website and follow the guide to see if it will work for you.  This was worth the money saving me thousands from having it done professionally - not to mention much more private which is what I like!  Highly Recommended!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of their claim to be hair-free in 6 months.</li>
            <li> The battery time seems to go quite fast.  I just started to get &amp;#34;used &amp;#34; to the jolt and the Tria would be in the fan mode  and the battery would need charging.</li>
            <li> After spending weeks reading reviews and researching several different options for hair removal I broke down and bought the Tria.  I have only had it for a month and can already see a difference with my armpit hair.  I also use on the bikini area and found that you really need to read the directions before using and shave as close a possible before use.  It really does make  difference when it comes to the pain factor.  The closer the shave the less pain.  I also purchase the Lido Cream Topical Anesthetic Cream but have found I don&#x27;t need it for the armpit area.  But the bikini line is another story.</li>
            <li> i got this for the wife, she said she likes it ,that it works , she has noticed a improvement.</li>
            <li> Ok so I have read ALL of the reviews on this product. The first thing I want to point out is that a lot of people who said the Tria did not work also said that they had \\&quot;brownish\\&quot; hairs or \\&quot;fine\\&quot; hairs. This product is ment for people with very light skin and very dark (like black) coarse hairs. if you have all of those things this WILL work it just takes time! This is not for those of you that want that little bit of golden peach fuzz gone, it is for those of us that has a serious hair growth problem that we either inherited or got from a hormone imbalance. It works!! and it works beautifully!!</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time, was packaged well, and works just like the advertising said it would.  I especially like the adjustable comfort level settings. I have used it twice now and already the regrowth is finer and shorter than before. I plan to continue the six month treatment. I also like the email tips for using the Trial that are sent. I have found them helpful as I was getting used to using this product.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my daughter as a gift, she said so far it is working, after four treatments, she is noticing less regrowth, but true enough you need to be patient since it is a lot of work and dedication for her to achieve her goal.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife a little over a year ago, instead of going to a salon. It is a great idea with safety features built in. My wife and I were traveling and she wanted to tan so we packaged the TRIA up, back in the box for safety and put it away. 3 months later, pulled it back out, charged it and it worked fine. We went to charge it again, but alas, it would not. We call customer service, they tell us it is out of warranty by less than a week. So we got 6 uses out of this system then were told we could buy a new one. Wish I had put the money towards a salon in the first place.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my friend and she absolutely loves it. She said to be patient and give it some time. You will see positive results. The darker your hair the better.</li>
            <li> Hello, When I boot up this machine, it ask to press the power button till count to 6, I follow the step of guide, but the machine shows error, and I reboot many time they alway shows error, what can I do? can this product refound? thank you&lt;br /&gt;please contact me at period945@gmail.com, thanks</li>
            <li> I called Tria&#x27;s customer service and they told me that there is a new upcoming model on January fifth.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m going to wait for it... Although I need it right now but I think its worth waiting because it will be improved!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far. Recommended use is every 2 weeks. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed less hair because it&#x27;s still too early to tell. I ordered it because of the good ratings and the salons really add up quickly for laser hair removal. This would be more affordable. I&#x27;m working on bikini area and underarms and upper lip... even though it is not recommended for that area. No problems have developed from using it on my upper lip. If it works I will then start using it on my legs.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product for a really great price, including shipping!  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a deal!</li>
            <li> Not working well at all</li>
            <li> I have PCOS, which causes abnormal hair growth on my face and chest. As a woman it is very embarrassing, I used to wax, shave you name it. Because of my condition there is really never a complete solution unless I can afford a VERY EXPENSIVE laser treatment. Tria has done a great job at eliminating most of my unwanted hair. You have to use it a LOT for it to work, it is time consuming and it does hurt even at the lowest setting, you do get used to it after a while. I have used it on my chin, neck and chest, as I mentioned before it hurts, it feels like a rubber band hits you every time. After using it for about a month I have seen big improvements, in some areas I do not have any hair in others I still do but it is much less, I have not used it on other areas yet. The only drawback is that the unit get hot after a bit and the battery only last for about 1-2 so if you have to work on big areas you might have to do one and then recharge it for the next one.</li>
            <li> This works SO well!! I am very pleased with it. I tried a few sessions at the dermatologists office (at $200 per session), and needed many more sessions to see a difference. With this at home device, I can use it as many times as I need, and it WORKS!! It feels the same way it did in the doctors office, so I know it is the real deal. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but definitely worth it, compared to what you would be paying someone to do it for you.</li>
            <li> im still using it to see result. im still waiting for result, i am being using it for only 4 time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I have been using the tria laser for 7 months. I used it on my legs and bikini area. I have fair skin and dark hair. I used it every two weeks like instructed but after 5 months with no results I started using it every time I shaved, now I am trying every other day. Guess what still very little to no result. The pain is terrible I have to use it on 2 sometimes I try 3 but I can&#x27;t stand it. Let me put it this way... my whole back is tattooed, my wrist and my ankles and feet, I have sat 4 straight hours with a tattoo needle pounding at my flesh that I could stand this laser I can&#x27;t. My husband asked \\&quot;How bad can it be?\\&quot; so I  zapped him on his arm with it one day on high and it left a circle burn on him ( he didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t shave first ) I really thought the safety feature wouldn&#x27;t let zap him, but it did and he got burned. I am now trying it with a skin numbing spray I used to use when I waxed, it still hurts. I would put the money your going to spend on this as a down payment on professional electrolysis.</li>
            <li> Sent back because in instructions said that it doesn&#x27;t work on light hair and nowhere in prior reading before ordering was that mentioned.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this laser on sale (not from Amazon, a different retailer). For the first eight weeks it really worked well, I was pleased and thought I was seeing results on level 3. However tonight I had the same experience countless others have had: it stopped working. All of a sudden I couldn&#x27;t feel the tel-tale pin prick sensation, and when I removed the laser it continued to run but it wasn&#x27;t actjally firing. And now it won&#x27;t turn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just thankful I&#x27;m within the 90 day return period offered. I already printed the return label. Although it seems to have some effect I won&#x27;t be purchasing another. The company knows their product is defective yet continues to sell it and hope maybe people won&#x27;t bother to return them?</li>
            <li> As the saying goes, \\&quot;If it sounds too good to be true, it is.\\&quot; I bought one of these about 9 months ago, used it exactly as directed from the first day I got it until just before the trial period ended. I have black hair and beige skin, so it&#x27;s pretty close to ideal. Because I was suspicious, I decided to use it on one single foot, using the other foot as a \\&quot;control\\&quot;. After 2.5 months, I stopped and let everything grow back in. At the three month mark, having seen no reduction at that point, and having a bit of a sunburn-like rash on the test foot, I returned it. That actually took two phone calls - the first time, they promised to e-mail the info and then did not do so. The second time, they said there must have been a computer error and they&#x27;d resend it - I insisted on staying on the line until I got the e-mail. After that, I got the RMA info, sent it back, and got my refund with no problems, but it&#x27;s suspicious I had to call twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s where it is after just shy of three months&#x27; use, and about six months&#x27; leaving it to sit: I have exactly the same amount of hair on both feet. There&#x27;s one discoloured spot on the test foot that wasn&#x27;t there last year. But at least I have my money back in my pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t have their \\&quot;money back guarantee\\&quot; listed anymore. If it really worked, wouldn&#x27;t that still be up?</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would really work on my dark thick hair, it made a difference for about the first 2 months,then after the 3RD AND 4TH month, my hair is just the same as it was before I started using the product.  $400. WASTED&lt;br /&gt; &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first since there were other options that were more complicated and expensive to choose from. I thought the more expensive the better it would be. I have only used it 1 month and the results are already showing - it&#x27;s really good and I am very happy and satisfied. Also very easy to use - I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very painful to use, but that is true with with any laser treatment, I guess. We have only used it, twice. It&#x27;s just not comfortable, and of course, by only using it twice, there were no effects on hair.&lt;br /&gt;Quality is very good; heavy product. It def feels like the real deal. Only buy it if you can stay dedicated to using it, long term.</li>
            <li> greatly disappointed with this product.  It arrived broken and after reading the enclosed article on how to use this item.....it proved that it was not as easy to use at it states in its advertisements.</li>
            <li> works great use once a week hair is getting less and less shipped fast will be hair free in no time</li>
            <li> As one who, over the last 20+ years, has purchased EVERY hair removal product ever invented (including laser hair removal at a Plastic Surgeon&#x27;s office which did NOT work), I have to say FINALLY A PRODUCT that WORKS!  After my first use on my underarms, I had virtually no regrowth.  I treated 2 more times and the hair is gone (4 months now with no shaving.)  I treated my bikini line and after the 4th time, I now see a marked decrease in hair growth.  I think a couple more zaps and shaving is done!  I had my bikini line treated professionally (at great expense) and I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference and was NOT happy.  I conducted my own experiment on my legs due to the time involved to do them.  I shaved both legs with a new razor, then used the Tria on one and not the other.  After 2 time consuming treatments, it is clear that I need to do the other leg because it is working.  Another plus for those ladies with dry skin, the laser also exfoliates and my skin appears smoother without gallons of lotion.  The only negative is that the laser head is small and it does take time but I am willing to put in the time because Tria works.  The reduction in shaving time and hassle has already made up for the time it takes to laser (which you can do while watching TV).  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this thing for a gift and the person is really satisfied with the product. seems that it works</li>
            <li> Tria really works,but only minus is,you have to spend all day to do it,because of the battery,which You have to recharge every 20 min</li>
            <li> I purchased a used Tria 3.0 for $200...It did not work when I received it.  I got my money back immediately.  The problem is this:  The only one who can use 1 year warranty is original owner...who has to call or enter serial # when they purchase the unit.  If you have problems after a year or give the unit to someone else all bets are off.  No place to have it repaired or no service after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, $550 unit is only good as long as the limited life batteries work and only for the original purchaser.  Same price as a washer or dryer.  So, I am purchasing a Remington unit (do not know if it is good either).  This unit has additional purchases of the head of the unit or something.  That way the manufacturer keeps you on the line for additional purchases....but, you are not completely out of luck.  Hope this gives something to think about.  Manufacturer built in lifespan and controls over usage and ownership.  Do not like that at all.  No class.</li>
            <li> I did have some problems in the beginning but the company handled it well.  I am now using my Tria and we will see how well it works over time.</li>
            <li> *** The next generation for this product is already available. I would get that instead. ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in 2011.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had heard about laser hair removal and it sounded painless and seemed an exciting possibility.&lt;br /&gt;However to go to a lab and do the procedure had always seemed a bit expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product and I was like - here it goes, affordable, I can repeat procedure as often as I like - Good Buy - I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it. I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;Pain was fine, highest setting was pinching quite a bit but hey less than plucking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions, but I did not really see a difference so I just put it back in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last fall I decided to really work on my legs w/ this machine.&lt;br /&gt;I think I repeated like 20x on my lower half of the legs until again I gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This winter, clearly I did not shave my legs.&lt;br /&gt;Now spring came and I&#x27;m like - ok, I have to shave my legs again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it was now that I noticed, my lower half of the legs is covered w/ about 20% hairs than what I normally have.&lt;br /&gt;Upper legs covered as usual. By comparison there was clear difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took me 2 years to be able to pronounce myself YES / NO on this product.&lt;br /&gt;BUT the VERDITCT is IT WORKS - BUY, BUY, BUY LADIES! (What iPhone?!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be persistent and it shall pay off! &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> Came on time, didnt use the device yet. Easy to use. All accessories available. hope the results are as promessed.</li>
