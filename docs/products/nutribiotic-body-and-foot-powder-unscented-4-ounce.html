            <li>I have been using \\&quot;Tushy Derm Baby Powder\\&quot; for over a year now...  LOVE it!!  </li>
            <li>also acts like a good deordorant in a pinch.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if silica is good for your body.  </li>
            <li>Have loved this stuff for years.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find it on Amazon &amp; it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Particularly good for travel, as it works for the body as well as the feet.</li>
            <li>but over all it is a good powder</li>
            <li>Grapefruit seed extract is supposed to be good for fungal infections although tea tree oil seems to be the champ.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable and our soldiers can use this type of product, and the way Amazon shipped it to me was perfect all I had to do was put it in the package.</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>This powser is non-toxic, non-irritating, and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Nicely scented and helps soothe and protect irritated skin.</li>
            <li>Nice for those of us looking for body/foot powder without any talc or added chemicals.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect for your skin,  very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>This is a good powder but is very light and fine ground.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>--I always get the most compliments on my hair with this in it.</li>
            <li>The texture feels nice and light.  </li>
            <li>It is way better than baby powder and has no scent.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to see it on here and will keep ordering it.</li>
            <li>Been using this powder for years and absolutely loved it; keeps my feet feeling and smelling fresh without incredients I can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li>My feet and body love it.</li>
            <li>Short of that, this powder and rotating your shoes is your best bet.</li>
            <li>tell me again, which is more affordable?</li>
            <li>I love putting this on my legs after I shave.</li>
            <li>well i needed something to help my feet and it seems to do ok...</li>
            <li>This is a great all purpose powder, and is safe for my sensitive skin, and my husband&#x27;s tender skin.</li>
            <li>This powder is working GREAT on my 11 year old son&#x27;s foot odor.  </li>
            <li>This is a great light and all natural powder.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li>Feels light and clean , is fragrance free, and to have the GSE and Tea Tree oil in it are a bonus for healthy skin.</li>
            <li>I got huge blisters on the bottom of my feet.</li>
            <li>It clears up a  rash from sweating is toxin free</li>
            <li>This is a great in scented body and foot powder especially if allergic to fragrances and even if you are not.  </li>
            <li>I use it primarily as a foot powder and it does the job.  </li>
            <li>It dispenses easily and cleanly, and does not have any over-powering scents to it.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find NutriBiotic powder at Amazon, because it saves me a trip to the city to Whole Foods and searching for it on the bottom shelf in the personal beauty products.</li>
            <li>i went back to thai crystal powder which is very effective.  </li>
            <li>His is great for me to follow up after putting on an all natural mild deodorant like toms keeps moisture down no scent great product</li>
            <li>Originally I had a four star review.</li>
            <li>however the combination of this fine powder and table salt twist type top puts way too much powder in at one time.</li>
            <li>It is very nice, silky smooth and keeps feet dry.</li>
            <li>Nothing special</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s not a bunch of chemicals on his feet, as feet are very absorbent.</li>
            <li>It is a good product, but it is only for my wife now because I was told by my dermatologist that my skin issues could be caused from Tea Tree oil.</li>
            <li>Not necessarily a bad thing, but just a heads up.  </li>
            <li>I do this with other powders and it works great</li>
            <li>I am going to a compounding pharmacy and have them make me a nice fragrance free silky powder, they charge in the same price range as some of these on line products.</li>
            <li>This is more the problem of the way I&#x27;m using it than the actual powder, a nicer container or top</li>
            <li>If you have issues with fungal infections (such as athletes foot, jock itch) or otherwise want to keep yourself dry when you exercise, this is a great product!</li>
            <li>Smooth as silk and cures every itchy spot very absorbent.</li>
            <li>it flies all over and still be kind of gritty.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure this would help or that my sensitive skin would tolerate it.  </li>
            <li>This smells nice but it a bit gritty.</li>
            <li>The skin irritation cleared right up.</li>
            <li>She is right on target.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for chafing and especially in the summer when sensitive skin gets really irritated from sweat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real itch buster!</li>
            <li>This took the athletes foot right away fast.</li>
            <li>Gentle but strong enough to keep moisture in control.  </li>
            <li>It does not have much of a smell at all.  </li>
            <li>I went to \\&quot;whole foods\\&quot; and this \\&quot;body &amp; foot powder\\&quot; was all they had...  </li>
            <li>Very absorbent.</li>
            <li>So much healthier than talc.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>It is a very fine milled powder, so it &amp;#34;floats&amp;#34; a little, but I like the lightness.</li>
            <li>While a little on the pricey side, this body powder is really a wonderful alternative to a lot of the talc based powders that have other potentially toxic additives in them (looking at you, Gold Bond).</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t totally ok--but I am super sensitive and this one better than any other I have found.</li>
            <li>I compared this to a more expensive brand, and to a popular Australian brand of powder specifically for smelly shoes.</li>
            <li>After years of fighting fungal infections, I have found that a combination of &#x27;Defense&#x27; brand tea-tree oil soap and their wet wipes (for between showers) along with this powder do the trick better than commercial sprays such as Lamasil (although Lamasil is good for getting the infection under control, but long-term it can be hard on your liver).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always kept me fresh and dry.</li>
            <li>A little bit to fine and whisphy for me.</li>
            <li>it is completely ineffective for odor control.  </li>
            <li>I sprinkle directly onto my hair and rub in with my fingers.  </li>
            <li>this has tea tree oil and grapefruit seed extract natural anti fungal&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
            <li>I send care packages to our troops overseas and so far they keep asking for it</li>
            <li>(That&#x27;s is why I got it) and all this other BS, but that&#x27;s worth ZERO when the product has adverse effects and</li>
            <li>It is scent free (far as i can tell) and so unlike the common talcum powders you find at the store (Gold Bond, etc.)</li>
            <li>Closer to a 2-1/2, hard to figure how it can be so fine</li>
            <li>It really stops odor cold and keeps me nice and dry.</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with an antifungal soap, as well white iodine every third day or so on the nail, and this protocol seems to have completely cleared up the problem.</li>
            <li>I think that this particular item is helpful in preventing the spread and reoccurance of the fungus; I am not certain that it would solve the problem by itself.</li>
            <li>It heals and soothes irritated skin, heals and prevents athletes foot, and keeps skin dry and soft.</li>
            <li>I also really like to sprinkle some in my hair to give it a little extra volume!</li>

            <li> I also really like to sprinkle some in my hair to give it a little extra volume!</li>
            <li> I purchased it here because it is becoming harder and harder to find as two of my usual spots</li>
            <li> Not sure about that review saying it was gritty, the powder is extremely fine to the point where I find it messy to just pre-fill my socks with them.</li>
            <li> It does not last as long as Dr. Scholl&#x27;s, but I am not complaining!</li>
            <li> I later bought Tea Tree Thursday Plantation - Tea Tree Foot Powder and use it all over my body, feet and as a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other actual hair powders, but none even come close to working as well as this one.</li>
            <li> The first time a natural product has steered me wrong.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch of it; according to other reviews it is light &amp; gentle.</li>
            <li> Patting it onto my skin actually hurt, as though it were sharp.</li>
            <li> The powder is a little grittier, than say, major brand baby powders.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it keeps your feet dry</li>
            <li> I have been using this as a foot powder to help control a minor toenail fungus infection I picked up from a hospital a few years back.</li>
            <li> Even though my feet perspire, there is absolutely no odor.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work just as well as other powders though.</li>
            <li> This one performed as well as the other two, and is about half the price of the others.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and you want it to change, nothing does the trick like eating a bland diet for two weeks and eliminating sugar in all forms.</li>
            <li> After it was on a little while, no problems.</li>
            <li> It is corn starch, not talcum powder, so it is a little grainy.  </li>
            <li> I sprinkle a little in my shoes as well.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I used plain cornstarch, and I like the added benefit of GSE in this product.</li>
            <li> not a fit for me.</li>

            <li> They play hard get sweaty and started having trouble with athletes foot.</li>
            <li> Four weeks later, i&#x27;m out of the product, and all my shoes smell worse!</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s bum needed powder (I never liked using creams - too icky/messy).  </li>
            <li> It also helps to use oder-eliminating insoles, and common sense (no boots in the summer).</li>
            <li> /&gt;talc is not good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s irritating when it&#x27;s grainy.</li>

            <li> I was desperate!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So disappointed.</li>
            <li> But this product is just so awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smooth as silk and cures every itchy spot very absorbent. Great for athletes foot a must have for babies and adults</li>
            <li> I do not tolerate the fragrances in other powders--to say the least, so I get this one for my mother. It isn&#x27;t totally ok--but I am super sensitive and this one better than any other I have found.</li>
            <li> The powder itself is great, but the container doesn&#x27;t close well and will leak powder everywhere if you travel with it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this powder; it&#x27;s the only one she uses.  It heals and soothes irritated skin, heals and prevents athletes foot, and keeps skin dry and soft.</li>
            <li> It does not have much of a smell at all.  It does not last as long as Dr. Scholl&#x27;s, but I am not complaining!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for chafing and especially in the summer when sensitive skin gets really irritated from sweat. A friend at the gym recommended it and I tried it and I love it!</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. Love it. also acts like a good deordorant in a pinch.</li>
            <li> The silica in the powder gives the powder a sandy gritty feeling.  I don&#x27;t know if silica is good for your body.  I did&#x27;t notice any tea tree oil smell in the powder either.  I later bought Tea Tree Thursday Plantation - Tea Tree Foot Powder and use it all over my body, feet and as a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> i bought this as a replacement for the thai crystal powder product i am used to. i use it for odor control.  it is completely ineffective for odor control.  i went back to thai crystal powder which is very effective.  i also did not like the feel of this powder. not a fit for me.</li>
            <li> It is very nice, silky smooth and keeps feet dry.</li>
            <li> It would be perfect if it wasn&#x27;t grainy. There is no getting around it. It&#x27;s irritating when it&#x27;s grainy. I am going to a compounding pharmacy and have them make me a nice fragrance free silky powder, they charge in the same price range as some of these on line products.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go in a care package for a soldier in Afganistan. The price is very reasonable and our soldiers can use this type of product, and the way Amazon shipped it to me was perfect all I had to do was put it in the package.</li>
            <li> THis is a great product.  Great odor control</li>
            <li> Have loved this stuff for years. It really stops odor cold and keeps me nice and dry. I was delighted to find it on Amazon &amp; it&#x27;s delivery was perfect. I like the scented one also.</li>
            <li> We use this for our baby&#x27;s diaper rather than talcum baby powders. Very handy and lavender helps keep fungal and yeast infections at bay!</li>
            <li> Works great on my kids. I sprinkle it in their shoes. They play hard get sweaty and started having trouble with athletes foot. This took the athletes foot right away fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this as a hair powder for years and it works well to extend the time between washes. I sprinkle directly onto my hair and rub in with my fingers.  Absorbs oil and gives great body--I always get the most compliments on my hair with this in it. I&#x27;ve tried several other actual hair powders, but none even come close to working as well as this one. And it&#x27;s so inexpensive!</li>
            <li> I have been using \\&quot;Tushy Derm Baby Powder\\&quot; for over a year now...  LOVE it!!  But the red from the cranberry would make my son&#x27;s bottom look like he had been smacked around!  It always made me feel self-conscious!  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I went to \\&quot;whole foods\\&quot; and this \\&quot;body &amp; foot powder\\&quot; was all they had...  I was desperate!  My son&#x27;s bum needed powder (I never liked using creams - too icky/messy).  So I bought it...  Perfect!  The texture feels nice and light.  It absorbs well with no irritation.  Redness on his bum disappears.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will try it on my husband&#x27;s sweaty/smelly feet now!!...&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  Just as it states, body and foot.  It is way better than baby powder and has no scent.  I use it after showering and in shoes that do not wear socks and sandals.  I even have put it on my dog who has skin issues. I purchased it here because it is becoming harder and harder to find as two of my usual spots stopped carrying it and I did not want to drive or call around looking for it.  I was glad to see it on here and will keep ordering it.</li>
            <li> It clears up a  rash from sweating is toxin free I use in summer to keep from getting a rash.</li>
            <li> Been using this powder for years and absolutely loved it; keeps my feet feeling and smelling fresh without incredients I can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li> this has tea tree oil and grapefruit seed extract natural anti fungal&lt;br /&gt;use this instead of regular baby powder&lt;br /&gt;talc is not good</li>
            <li> Very absorbent. My feet and body love it.</li>
            <li> I compared this to a more expensive brand, and to a popular Australian brand of powder specifically for smelly shoes. This one performed as well as the other two, and is about half the price of the others.&lt;br /&gt;I will say this, if you have smelly feet and you want it to change, nothing does the trick like eating a bland diet for two weeks and eliminating sugar in all forms. Short of that, this powder and rotating your shoes is your best bet. It also helps to use oder-eliminating insoles, and common sense (no boots in the summer).</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch of it; according to other reviews it is light &amp; gentle. Patting it onto my skin actually hurt, as though it were sharp. It felt like I was putting sand on my skin. After it was on a little while, no problems.</li>
            <li> So much healthier than talc. The skin irritation cleared right up.</li>
            <li> Closer to a 2-1/2, hard to figure how it can be so fine it flies all over and still be kind of gritty.</li>
            <li> This powder is working GREAT on my 11 year old son&#x27;s foot odor.  Now he can take off his shoes and not stink up the room.  I also love that it&#x27;s not a bunch of chemicals on his feet, as feet are very absorbent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of sweat and odor.  Who is?  I wasn&#x27;t sure this would help or that my sensitive skin would tolerate it.  But it works great.  I can use it anywhere on my body and have never had a reaction to it.  It seems to control odor well.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to use instead of aluminum-based antiperspirant, especially at night.  This powser is non-toxic, non-irritating, and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a body powder to use in the summer but wanted one without talc.  This smells nice but it a bit gritty.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine.  It is corn starch, not talcum powder, so it is a little grainy.  But I haven&#x27;t had any discomfort.  I added some Polo powder for scent.  Makes my Polo powder go further.</li>
            <li> This is a great all purpose powder, and is safe for my sensitive skin, and my husband&#x27;s tender skin. Particularly good for travel, as it works for the body as well as the feet. It is a very fine milled powder, so it &amp;#34;floats&amp;#34; a little, but I like the lightness.</li>
            <li> His is great for me to follow up after putting on an all natural mild deodorant like toms keeps moisture down no scent great product</li>
            <li> Originally I had a four star review. But this product is just so awful. Took me some weeks to realize it wasnt working. Four weeks later, i&#x27;m out of the product, and all my shoes smell worse! That weird Talc smell+plastic+foul foot odor.  It&#x27;s like a spices smell. AGGH!!! It literally penetrated my shoes, through my socks and made the stink permanent. This is only obvious when you stop using the product. Maybe it keeps your feet dry (That&#x27;s is why I got it) and all this other BS, but that&#x27;s worth ZERO when the product has adverse effects and SMELLS!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed. The first time a natural product has steered me wrong. Ruined my Jordans. Oh joy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your self a favor and visit a dermatologist or podiatrist and find a proffesional opinion. I can hear you now, \\&quot;YeAH BUT THAT&#x27;S EXPENSIVE.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now replacing 5+ pairs of Jordans @100+$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So tell me again, which is more affordable?</li>
            <li> Not sure about that review saying it was gritty, the powder is extremely fine to the point where I find it messy to just pre-fill my socks with them. I do this with other powders and it works great however the combination of this fine powder and table salt twist type top puts way too much powder in at one time. This is more the problem of the way I&#x27;m using it than the actual powder, a nicer container or top and it would have 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love putting this on my legs after I shave.Stops nits and cuts after shave.Can also apply into shoes and feet anywhere onto body</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  Gentle but strong enough to keep moisture in control.  Will definitely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Great powder. This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve bought it.</li>
            <li> Best body powder i&#x27;ve ever used. Feels light and clean , is fragrance free, and to have the GSE and Tea Tree oil in it are a bonus for healthy skin. Great buy!</li>
            <li> This is a great in scented body and foot powder especially if allergic to fragrances and even if you are not.  I use it primarily as a foot powder and it does the job.  Even though my feet perspire, there is absolutely no odor.  The best way to use it I have found is to rub some on my feet and in between my toes.  I sprinkle a little in my shoes as well.  This stuff really works.  I&#x27;ve ordered it a number of times and have used it for years.  I definately recommend this product and this seller.  Excellent turn times</li>
            <li> Recommended by the nurse practitioner in my gynecologist&#x27;s office. She is right on target. Nicely scented and helps soothe and protect irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Works well for me and sometimes I put it on my dog. Fleas don&#x27;t like Tea Tree Powder.</li>
            <li> This is a great light and all natural powder. it&#x27;s perfect for your skin,  very soft and silky. I also really like to sprinkle some in my hair to give it a little extra volume!</li>
            <li> I use it as foot powder.  Nothing special but I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> i thought i&#x27;d try it but I guess I&#x27;m allergic. I got huge blisters on the bottom of my feet. Threw it away. ehh...you just never know.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as a foot powder to help control a minor toenail fungus infection I picked up from a hospital a few years back. I use this in conjunction with an antifungal soap, as well white iodine every third day or so on the nail, and this protocol seems to have completely cleared up the problem. I like that this has simple ingredients. Previously, I used plain cornstarch, and I like the added benefit of GSE in this product. It dispenses easily and cleanly, and does not have any over-powering scents to it. I use it anytime I am wearing close-toed shoes. I think that this particular item is helpful in preventing the spread and reoccurance of the fungus; I am not certain that it would solve the problem by itself.</li>
            <li> The powder is a little grittier, than say, major brand baby powders.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but just a heads up.  Seems to work just as well as other powders though.</li>
            <li> While a little on the pricey side, this body powder is really a wonderful alternative to a lot of the talc based powders that have other potentially toxic additives in them (looking at you, Gold Bond). I&#x27;m a big fan of tea tree oil and the grape seed extract seems to be beneficial as well. This powder definitely has prevented any rash or jock itch that can happen during the summer months. It&#x27;s always kept me fresh and dry.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, but it is only for my wife now because I was told by my dermatologist that my skin issues could be caused from Tea Tree oil. I am not convinced, but will take the advise of my doctor.</li>
            <li> This a great all around product. Use it on my scalp and the dogs too. It&#x27;s a real itch buster!</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find NutriBiotic powder at Amazon, because it saves me a trip to the city to Whole Foods and searching for it on the bottom shelf in the personal beauty products.</li>
            <li> Nice for those of us looking for body/foot powder without any talc or added chemicals.</li>
            <li> I send care packages to our troops overseas and so far they keep asking for it so I am assuming it works well.</li>
            <li> This is a good powder but is very light and fine ground. A little bit to fine and whisphy for me. That is the reason for the 3 stars</li>
            <li> well i needed something to help my feet and it seems to do ok... it is not like the regular powder feel to it. but over all it is a good powder</li>
            <li> If you have issues with fungal infections (such as athletes foot, jock itch) or otherwise want to keep yourself dry when you exercise, this is a great product! It is scent free (far as i can tell) and so unlike the common talcum powders you find at the store (Gold Bond, etc.) it won&#x27;t scream out &#x27;I&#x27;m wearing baby powder!&#x27;.  Grapefruit seed extract is supposed to be good for fungal infections although tea tree oil seems to be the champ. After years of fighting fungal infections, I have found that a combination of &#x27;Defense&#x27; brand tea-tree oil soap and their wet wipes (for between showers) along with this powder do the trick better than commercial sprays such as Lamasil (although Lamasil is good for getting the infection under control, but long-term it can be hard on your liver).</li>
