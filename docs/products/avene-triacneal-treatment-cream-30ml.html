            <li>, it&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best, as it contains both Retinol and Glycolic acid.  </li>
            <li>Perfect time to put this to use.</li>
            <li>God i was referred to a great dermatologist who has had me</li>
            <li>This product is great for breakouts, it vanishes pimples rapidly.</li>
            <li>When I found this on Amazon I was thrilled, because it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than it is at my doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried Ziana gel, Differin cream and of course oral antibiotics for acne, but this has helped the most as well as calms my skin.</li>
            <li>Amazon.com being a reputable merchant refunded my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I try several prescription creams, and now i use Bionect-which is an awesome prescription Hyaluronic Acid gel..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way better than any over-the-counter product-</li>
            <li>if it can help me with my skin &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34;, i think it can help anyone!! :)</li>
            <li>I have been using Diacneal lotion for about 6 months and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>What can I say I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many products, including prescriptions.  </li>
            <li>ask your doc/derm for it-the moisture in it is so wonderful, and in combo with this cream, it has changed my skin for the better, which means less reparative work needed for me :)</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>More unfortunately, more bumps developed and after many days of use, I was sure this was not purging but irritation.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and fine lines seem to be disappearing.  </li>
            <li>(Lucky me!).</li>
            <li>I enjoy also the tube container instead of a jar with lid.</li>
            <li>This works amazingly well and fast.</li>
            <li>I have fair, oily, sensitive, acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I have decided to give this lotion a try after reading many positive reviews on it.  </li>
            <li>So I reordered it through Amazon because the price is much more reasonable.</li>
            <li>This cream is gentle and fantastic!</li>
            <li>This cream dries what used to be some stubborn pimples very fast!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine a time I won&#x27;t own a tube of Avene&#x27;s TriAcneal (formerly DiAcneal).  </li>
            <li>I was first guided to purchase this by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the cream!</li>
            <li>Had little time to try out, bought for the first time particular cream, but this brand been using over decade, so hope the cream so far doing great, needed only very small amount at night, not greasy, pleasant.</li>
            <li>This also seemed to lessen the red bruising I originally saw under my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t/hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li>This product is one of the few that I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>I am very upset that Diacneal has apparently been replaced by Triacneal.</li>
            <li>It passed first impressions big time.</li>
            <li>the plastic surgeon who did it was WAY too agressive and went WAY too deep for certain areas:</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and usually products that work this quickly</li>
            <li>This stuff truly helps clear it up and doesn&#x27;t dry me out.</li>

            <li> It flat out does nothing.</li>
            <li> I have had iffy skin for a long time.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way mixed in with my regular moisturizer.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it 2 stars because it really didn&#x27;t do anything for me; however, it didn&#x27;t make my face any worse.</li>
            <li> This cream was recommended by my doctor, and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I found it worked extremely well in controlling my acne and as an exfoliant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it along with Avene Cleanance K (which I use every other night).</li>
            <li> By the afternoon, the pimple went down, almost flat, with no more pain.</li>
            <li> I guess this is a product that either you love or you hate.</li>
            <li> I work in Dermatology, but generally don&#x27;t require heavy retinals to get rid of acne without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> just a little info there..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after using it for 2 days, I developed skin colord bumps all over my face.  </li>
            <li> Cream works well and was a little pricey; but these types of products usually are.  </li>
            <li> but Ive been struggling still with a few small hormonal outbreaks.</li>
            <li> It just sucks that it&#x27;s not easily available in the USA.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m going to use.</li>
            <li> are very harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> so I have to fight hard against hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> I placed a thin layer all over my face after washing with gly/Sal 5-2.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone that is sick of having bad skin!!</li>
            <li> I happen to awaken to a painful pimple.</li>

            <li> I work in Dermatology, but generally don&#x27;t require heavy retinals to get rid of acne without irritating my skin. I love this product. I have tried Ziana gel, Differin cream and of course oral antibiotics for acne, but this has helped the most as well as calms my skin. A little goes a long way mixed in with my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have decided to give this lotion a try after reading many positive reviews on it.  I suffer from occasional acne and I thought this lotion will eliminate that.  Unfortunately, after using it for 2 days, I developed skin colord bumps all over my face.  I thought this is a sign of purging so I continue to use this lotion.  More unfortunately, more bumps developed and after many days of use, I was sure this was not purging but irritation.  Amazon.com being a reputable merchant refunded my purchase.  I guess this is a product that either you love or you hate.</li>
            <li> I had C02 laser resurfacing on my face in June 2013, and now almost 6 months later, i still have red and tan colored marks &amp; my skin has a bumpy texture in places..the plastic surgeon who did it was WAY too agressive and went WAY too deep for certain areas: my temples and the upper sides of my forehead. And so in a month or two, i am going to have reparative work done.&lt;br /&gt;BUT this treatment cream has been a God-send, in about 3 weeks, it has lightened up the redness about 50% and smoothed out my skin too! So if you have a skin issue with acne, marks or texture issues, then if this helped me, i KNOW it will help you!&lt;br /&gt;And it didn&#x27;t/hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin!! Which is nothing short of a miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank God i was referred to a great dermatologist who has had me I try several prescription creams, and now i use Bionect-which is an awesome prescription Hyaluronic Acid gel..it&#x27;s way better than any over-the-counter product-just a little info there..ask your doc/derm for it-the moisture in it is so wonderful, and in combo with this cream, it has changed my skin for the better, which means less reparative work needed for me :)&lt;br /&gt;Try this product!! if it can help me with my skin &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34;, i think it can help anyone!! :)</li>
            <li> I have been using Diacneal lotion for about 6 months and love it.  I am 39 and my skin has a history of issues.  Breakouts, oily, dry, etc.  I have been using this product at the recommendation of an esthetician.  I use it morning and night following a wash w/ Pernox scrub.  It has eliminated bumps on my forehead that have been there since my 20s.  My skin is smoother and fine lines seem to be disappearing.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have had iffy skin for a long time. This stuff truly helps clear it up and doesn&#x27;t dry me out. I highly recommend it to anyone that is sick of having bad skin!!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me about the facewash (which is terrific) but Ive been struggling still with a few small hormonal outbreaks. This cream dries what used to be some stubborn pimples very fast! I highly recommend the cream! Paired with the Diacneal face wash its a combo that cant lose!</li>
            <li> I was first guided to purchase this by my dermatologist. I found it worked extremely well in controlling my acne and as an exfoliant. So I reordered it through Amazon because the price is much more reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 4 months. I have fair, oily, sensitive, acne prone skin (Lucky me!). I use this only when I have a breakout. It&#x27;s been working for me. I&#x27;ve been using it along with Avene Cleanance K (which I use every other night). Since using both products, I haven&#x27;t had a breakout. It does contain glycolic acid, so when you use it on a breakout, it burns. This never bothers me (I must be a glutton for punishment). :o)&lt;br /&gt;I did get mine a lot... a LOT cheaper online. About $19. The Amazon price is outrageous.&lt;br /&gt;But, it&#x27;s an awesome product. I love it.</li>
            <li> Cream works well and was a little pricey; but these types of products usually are.  I will definitely buy again when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine a time I won&#x27;t own a tube of Avene&#x27;s TriAcneal (formerly DiAcneal).  This stuff is the best, as it contains both Retinol and Glycolic acid.  Whether your problem is aging skin or oily, breakout-prone skin, this creme should DEFINITELY be in your arsenal.  It just sucks that it&#x27;s not easily available in the USA.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve just started using the cream my skin feels somewhat smoother. I apply sparingly. Hopefully with the next season I&#x27;ll continue to notice &#x27;silky&#x27; skin. I enjoy also the tube container instead of a jar with lid. It&#x27;s a pleasure doing business with Amazon.</li>
            <li> This works amazingly well and fast. I have sensitive skin and usually products that work this quickly are very harsh on my skin. This cream is gentle and fantastic!</li>
            <li> What can I say I love this product. This product is great for breakouts, it vanishes pimples rapidly. I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This cream was recommended by my doctor, and a little goes a long way so it took a while to run out. When I found this on Amazon I was thrilled, because it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than it is at my doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> This product literally does not work. It flat out does nothing. I used to use Diacneal and it worked well at reducing redness and reducing the lifespan of blemishes. I am very upset that Diacneal has apparently been replaced by Triacneal. You can still find Diacneal on Google Shopping, but the price has skyrocketed to $56 per tube. Now I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m going to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly in a battle with my complexion. I&#x27;ve tried many many products, including prescriptions.  This product is one of the few that I absolutely love.</li>
            <li> I am a 30-year-old female with acne &amp; rosacea. I&#x27;ve tried numerous OTC and prescription medications but nothing seemed to work. I decided to give this a try. I&#x27;m only giving it 2 stars because it really didn&#x27;t do anything for me; however, it didn&#x27;t make my face any worse. I used this in combination with the Diacneal cleanser. It didn&#x27;t stain my sheets but it is rather stinky. I am going to keep with the Avene products and hope that one of these combinations does the trick!</li>
            <li> Had little time to try out, bought for the first time particular cream, but this brand been using over decade, so hope the cream so far doing great, needed only very small amount at night, not greasy, pleasant.</li>
            <li> I am using this product for almost a year.  It was recommended by my dermatologist to help me with some aging lines.&lt;br /&gt;Do not expect miracles, but it has improved the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I just recieved this on the morning I happen to awaken to a painful pimple. Perfect time to put this to use. I placed a thin layer all over my face after washing with gly/Sal 5-2. Followed by Cetaphil lotion. By the afternoon, the pimple went down, almost flat, with no more pain. It passed first impressions big time. This was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I&#x27;m also AA so I have to fight hard against hyperpigmentation. This also seemed to lessen the red bruising I originally saw under my skin. Double plus!</li>
