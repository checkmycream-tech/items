            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Kenra product before and really liked it.</li>
            <li>I was also very happy that they arrived really fast</li>
            <li>Shampoo is great but conditioner not so much!!!</li>
            <li>The shampoo is good and gets my hair clean, and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I knew the price was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 5 years and will use it for more.</li>
            <li>Love the conditioner, too.</li>
            <li>I was looking for more products and accidentally found these.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist tells me my hair is so healthy for bleached hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is more hydrating than any I have tried before.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of both of them.  </li>
            <li>I love Kenra products and so does my daughter -</li>
            <li>Of course I already knew I love these products</li>
            <li>I have used the Kenra color maintenance  for many years</li>
            <li>and i use to be able to find it at the Smartstyle  store in Walmart, but not any longer..</li>
            <li>Three stars because it is ok...</li>
            <li>but isn&#x27;t any better than Pantene.  </li>
            <li>I bought this from a reputable salon.  </li>
            <li>I do love their hairspray and their heat protecting products though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with Suave.</li>
            <li>My hair always looks healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I would recommend you read all of the reviews for this product/seller before buying if you are looking for an authentic Kenra product.</li>
            <li>work well with my hair type (dry, permed and color treated) and both products smell wonderful.  </li>
            <li>So if you buy this, use it up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Love Kenra specially there shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>Not the most exciting shampoo in the world.</li>
            <li>Smells great, works great with the blow dry spray, good price, have to use extra conditioner because I have long full hair but worth it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cause I only use good products not store bought.  </li>
            <li>The Kenra Color Maintenance duo is not a bad product.</li>
            <li>but i find it worth it to lengthening the life of my color.</li>
            <li>right on time and just what my hair needed.</li>
            <li>This combo is better than most and it is easy to rinse out of thick hair.  </li>
            <li>The smell is also a little off -- most notably in the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I think it could probably work better for people with a different hair type or length, but I went back to Kenra&#x27;s volumizing formula, which I love.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these are worth the high price.  </li>
            <li>I noticed you still don&#x27;t have to use much.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo was not packaged well and leaked all over, resulting in about 3/4 a bote instead of a whole bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very drying and lacks luster.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Kenra products in the past and have always been pleased!</li>
            <li>I have volume and the color is vibrant.</li>
            <li>Made my hair feel dryer than normal.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product my hair is bleached and it massages it so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Keeps ends feeling soft so they don&#x27;t get too dry too quickly.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous &amp;#34;color safe&amp;#34; products but find this one really works.</li>
            <li>held my RED color much longer...</li>
            <li>Completely destroyed my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have attempted other brands and never found any other better..</li>
            <li>I have long hair and wash every other day at most( dry hair)...</li>
            <li>I can totally tell because after I used it, I had the most gnarly snarls in my hair and could barely comb thru my wet hair with a wide tooth comb, as I typically can with the REAL Kenra products.  </li>
            <li>For instance, if my hair is very tangly and or wet going into the shower, it&#x27;s a problem.</li>

            <li> For instance, if my hair is very tangly and or wet going into the shower, it&#x27;s a problem.</li>
            <li> Only complaint was was bottles weren&#x27;t closed well so lost much of the product and ended up on all my purchases</li>
            <li> These are not real Kenra products.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected from Kenra.</li>
            <li> Works well with other styling products like AG and Alcove.</li>
            <li> Apparently it works as it is described, because she hasn&#x27;t complained to me about it.</li>
            <li> However, the conditioner is such a thin, watery formula that it takes a lot to coat my long hair, and it&#x27;s just not a very rich feeling product.</li>
            <li> After a year, however, the texture of both turn sour smelling amd watery and do nothing to your hair.  </li>
            <li> Almost felt like it was watered down (which it may have been).</li>
            <li> But I keep buying it because I&#x27;m afraid if I try something else it will strip the pretty red/purple highlights out of my brunette hair.</li>
            <li> I was unfortunate enough to use this product while visiting a beach, so every day I would go to shower with my tangly salty hair, and I had to use ridiculous amounts of conditioner just to get the shower comb through my hair.</li>
            <li> could hardly tell it was time for me to see my hair dresser at 4 wks...</li>
            <li> No more fading between colorings!</li>
            <li> The bottles are a little awkward</li>
            <li> However, this product fails to deliver.  </li>
            <li> horrible product!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 5 years and will use it for more. A recommendable combo for everyone.</li>
            <li> Nice products....work well with my hair type (dry, permed and color treated) and both products smell wonderful.  Would definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed, the shampoo is better than the conditioner.  Still had to put my stuff on my hair to get a comb through it.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Helps maintain hair color of all types. Keeps ends feeling soft so they don&#x27;t get too dry too quickly. Works well with other styling products like AG and Alcove. These are all my favorites.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that a shampoo for colored hair would make any difference, but my color really does stay looking fresh longer with this.  Love the conditioner, too.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is good but skip the conditioner. No problems with the seller. Both products arrived on time.</li>
            <li> No complaints from She Who Must Be Obeyed.  Apparently it works as it is described, because she hasn&#x27;t complained to me about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Kenra product before and really liked it. I was looking for more products and accidentally found these. They&#x27;re wonderful!! I&#x27;m ordering more!</li>
            <li> Love Kenra specially there shampoo and conditioner the condioner could be littler thicker.  But it&#x27;s all like that even when I bought it from a salon.  I noticed you still don&#x27;t have to use much.  The smell is great too.  I&#x27;ve been using the one for volume and it smells just like Bananas smells great.  I just got this duo for color treated hair and it smells good too.  I highly recommend this product my hair is bleached and it massages it so soft and silky. My hair stylist tells me my hair is so healthy for bleached hair.  It&#x27;s cause I only use good products not store bought.  You cab tell big difference once you use for a month.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is great but conditioner not so much!!! Not a deranged at all!!!</li>
            <li> Red hair color is notorious for fading between colorings. I have tried numerous &amp;#34;color safe&amp;#34; products but find this one really works. No more fading between colorings!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  It was great price for the amount of shampoo and conditioner you receive.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smell soo good! My hair stylist uses this brand on me!</li>
            <li> great for colored hair</li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy.  I have volume and the color is vibrant.</li>
            <li> The product is good.  Only complaint was was bottles weren&#x27;t closed well so lost much of the product and ended up on all my purchases</li>
            <li> The conditioner is more hydrating than any I have tried before.  I love the smell of both of them.  I will purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> held my RED color much longer... could hardly tell it was time for me to see my hair dresser at 4 wks... I have long hair and wash every other day at most( dry hair)... this stuff is good for my hair</li>
            <li> Had to return - I had a severe break out reaction to the products.</li>
            <li> I love Kenra products and so does my daughter - so this was one of her Christmas presents from me.</li>
            <li> Of course I already knew I love these products but I was very happy with the price and that they came as a set. I was also very happy that they arrived really fast</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo and conditioner, made my hair fee wonderful</li>
            <li> I have used the Kenra color maintenance  for many years and i use to be able to find it at the Smartstyle  store in Walmart, but not any longer..So i was elated to find it here finally. I have attempted other brands and never found any other better..It is pricey but i find it worth it to lengthening the life of my color.</li>
            <li> I would rate this as a zero star if I could.  Can&#x27;t believe I fell for this again!!  I knew the price was too good to be true.  I&#x27;ve always bought Kenra shampoo and conditioner from the salon, but decided to test this Amazon deal.  THIS IS A DIVERTED FRAUD!!  These are not real Kenra products.  I can totally tell because after I used it, I had the most gnarly snarls in my hair and could barely comb thru my wet hair with a wide tooth comb, as I typically can with the REAL Kenra products.  The smell is also a little off -- most notably in the conditioner.  These fraud products also left my hair feeling greasy/coated with something.  This also happened to me when I bought some Tigi Bed Head products from TJ Maxx, and found out they were diverted too.  Completely destroyed my hair.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> Left my hair oily didn&#x27;t work for me so I gave it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works great with the blow dry spray, good price, have to use extra conditioner because I have long full hair but worth it</li>
            <li> The Kenra Color Maintenance duo is not a bad product. The shampoo is good and gets my hair clean, and smells nice. However, the conditioner is such a thin, watery formula that it takes a lot to coat my long hair, and it&#x27;s just not a very rich feeling product. For instance, if my hair is very tangly and or wet going into the shower, it&#x27;s a problem. I was unfortunate enough to use this product while visiting a beach, so every day I would go to shower with my tangly salty hair, and I had to use ridiculous amounts of conditioner just to get the shower comb through my hair. Even then, I had to apply a separate leave-in conditioner just to brush my hair after using this product. I think it could probably work better for people with a different hair type or length, but I went back to Kenra&#x27;s volumizing formula, which I love.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I changed from Aveda and am happy I did.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected from Kenra. Made my hair feel dryer than normal. Almost felt like it was watered down (which it may have been).</li>
            <li> I thought this was a good price for quality shampoo and conditioner. The smell of both is okay and leaves my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li> Great product, on time.</li>
            <li> Not the most exciting shampoo in the world. But I keep buying it because I&#x27;m afraid if I try something else it will strip the pretty red/purple highlights out of my brunette hair.</li>
            <li> This combo is better than most and it is easy to rinse out of thick hair.  It makes it shiny and looks great.</li>
            <li> Three stars because it is ok...but isn&#x27;t any better than Pantene.  I bought this from a reputable salon.  It has a banana smell to it and smells good.  After a year, however, the texture of both turn sour smelling amd watery and do nothing to your hair.  I have never seen a shampoo or conditioner do that. So if you buy this, use it up very quickly.  I don&#x27;t think these are worth the high price.  I do love their hairspray and their heat protecting products though.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was not packaged well and leaked all over, resulting in about 3/4 a bote instead of a whole bottle. Good stuff otherwise.</li>
            <li> horrible product! I&#x27;ve used Kenra products in the past and have always been pleased! However, this product fails to deliver.  It&#x27;s very drying and lacks luster.  And, to throw salt on the wound, there is no fragrance! I&#x27;ve had better luck with Suave.</li>
            <li> right on time and just what my hair needed. The bottles are a little awkward but otherwise this is great</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 10 years. This is the only product myself and my family will use. My hair always looks healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> Good Shampoo it smells good too!</li>
            <li> This product came to me unsealed and leaking. I will not be using it and I&#x27;m sending it back. I would recommend you read all of the reviews for this product/seller before buying if you are looking for an authentic Kenra product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sent several messages trying to get the rest of my product and still haven&#x27;t heard anything. I bought the combo set and only revived part of it..</li>
