            <li>My boyfriend is fair skinned and burns very easily.  </li>
            <li>Vanicream was even better than Neutrogena!</li>
            <li>It kind of worries me</li>
            <li>For those not wanting to use chemicals that are absorbed into the skin this is a great alternative.  </li>

            <li>Love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Having used it for several years, it still is the best sunscreen product that I have found.</li>

            <li>Prefer this to exposure to chemicals found in most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>But apply it 15-20 mins before you go into the sun and it works better.</li>

            <li>You can feel the damage you are doing to your skin when you wipe it on and spread it around because you have to wipe so deliberately and strongly.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of greasy and you have to really rub it in to get the whiteness to go away, but it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has everything with free delivery.</li>
            <li>It costs more, but is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny face.  </li>
            <li>Everything that is available is SPF</li>
            <li>This product is extremely easy to apply and is absorbed very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am SO excited about this one.  </li>
            <li>Originally, this product was introduced to me by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Great price for my favorite sunscreen - the only sunscreen I can use on my highly sensitive Rosacea skin,</li>
            <li>I always try to be gentle when touching my face (scratching my eyes, rubbing my nose or lips or chin, etc.)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really experienced this with other sunscreen products.</li>
            <li>I have had many skin cancers over the last many years.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and many sunscreens cause a rash.  </li>
            <li>but that is purely shallow - but nice too! :)</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It seems more like the old.  </li>
            <li>He was able to enjoy days on the beach, at the pool, a day deep sea fishing and did not burn once.  </li>
            <li>I now buy RosaSkin Total Care Sunblock and love it.  </li>
            <li>Nor does it end up in the creases of your neck if the weather is hot.  </li>
            <li>First thing, this is not SPF 60.</li>
            <li>I knew it only when I called the customer service to find that they don&#x27;t make any more Vanicream Sunscreens with SPF 60.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen stays on very well and doesn&#x27;t burn when you apply it to your face.</li>
            <li>I have been using it on him daily this summer, since he is constantly in the pool or outside at camp and it has worked great.  </li>
            <li>And a whole lot cheaper then the dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I plan to play again tomorrow even though a high of 98F is predicted.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Des not irritate your skin or cause your eyes to burn or water would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>&quot; we have had a lot of success - 7 hours in the pool with only one reapplication and no sunburn.  </li>
            <li>I put this on the top of my hands everyday to fade age spots.  </li>
            <li>We live in Minnesota.  </li>
            <li>Been buying this sunscreen for a year because i have rosacea and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am sensitive to some fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Store it vertically, mouth of the tube down, and keep &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; the tube (squeezing it), and you will still get many days of use...!!&lt;br /&gt;Price-wise, use Amazon, or similar sources to buy it, NOT your dermatologist.</li>
            <li>My son (5yo) has extremely sensitive skin (including eczema, food allergies, environmental allergies, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;EVERY</li>
            <li>This is the cream that has made living in Florida manageable, and leaves skin soft and dewy to boot.</li>
            <li>I Ordered  4 boxes of Vanicream Suncreen Sensitive Skin SPF 60.</li>
            <li>Also, it causes your face to be very shiny at first and the sheen seems to dissipate slightly over time as it dries.  </li>
            <li>however, if you apply this to your skin and don&#x27;t cool off by getting in the water, perspiration tends to cause an odd film on your skin.</li>
            <li>Vanicream not only does not cause a rash but includes a high protection from sun rays.  </li>
            <li>The new vanicreme is not SPF 60 like the old and it is far inferior to the old even when it is falsely advertised with the old photo.</li>

            <li> The sunscreen leaves a white chalky residue on your skin especially when your skin gets wet and the pool or beach.</li>
            <li> The lip protectant is excellent in that it does not taste awful, like some other brands.</li>
            <li> then I double check the active ingredients from both SPF 30 &amp; SPF60 and found out they are different.  </li>
            <li> Rosaskin sunblock has no nano particles, offers both UVA and UVB protection and had green tea in it for inflammation.  </li>
            <li> I applied this product before my round of golf yesterday and together with my wide-brimmed hat felt I was completely protected.  </li>
            <li> You need to reapply after being in the water a long time.</li>
            <li> He has tried it for a few days and so far likes it.</li>
            <li> This is likely due to the &amp;#34;barrier&amp;#34; protection</li>
            <li> One word to the thrifty, don&#x27;t give up on the tube when it appears empty.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It has almost no scent to it and all of the smell washes out of your clothes with one washing (where as other sunscreens won&#x27;t wash out after 10 washes).  </li>
            <li> other sunscreen we have tried makes him break out.  </li>
            <li> Using Vanicream sunscreen protects me extremely well</li>
            <li> Zinc and titanium dioxide are not absorbed into the skin and may therefore be healthier.  </li>
            <li> We have been using this cream previously.</li>
            <li> I used Neutrogena SPF 100 previously.</li>
            <li> Only downside about it is, it&#x27;s very thick, but it works!</li>
            <li> I realize the shiny aspect is a result of how the product works to reflect the UV rays but it seems excessive.  </li>
            <li> The product is thick on application but works like nothing else we have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> for me, I like that it soaks in and doesn&#x27;t look all white and ugly -</li>
            <li> Very thick cream that causes you to stretch your skin while putting it on.  </li>
            <li> It is all mineral, none of the chemicals that I fear are worse for us than overexposure to sun.</li>
            <li> Not at all what was advertised  wrong number</li>
            <li> In returning the four boxes I had to pay the $11.30 postage to return the wrong product they sent me.</li>
            <li> I get contact dermatitis, and ugly blisters when exposed to the sun.  </li>
            <li> Stupid company/decision to discontinue it.</li>
            <li> I hate sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> HATE IT!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Been buying this sunscreen for a year because i have rosacea and very sensitive skin.  I am turned off by the continual price increases.  I now buy RosaSkin Total Care Sunblock and love it.  Rosaskin sunblock has no nano particles, offers both UVA and UVB protection and had green tea in it for inflammation.  Anyway, I am at a loss as to why vanicream keeps raising their prices!!</li>
            <li> I hate sunscreen.  HATE IT!  I don&#x27;t like the smell or how it stains your clothes, but I don&#x27;t have those problems with this sunscreen.  It has almost no scent to it and all of the smell washes out of your clothes with one washing (where as other sunscreens won&#x27;t wash out after 10 washes).  It is kind of greasy and you have to really rub it in to get the whiteness to go away, but it lasts all day.  It also didn&#x27;t make me itchy or make my face break-out.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great for my skin.  With the SPF of 50 I am sure to get sun protection as well as having my skin moisterized.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is very good. We use it for our children when prior to entering the water at the beach. This product is water resistant (external seawater/pool water etc.) however, if you apply this to your skin and don&#x27;t cool off by getting in the water, perspiration tends to cause an odd film on your skin. I haven&#x27;t really experienced this with other sunscreen products. This is likely due to the &amp;#34;barrier&amp;#34; protection this product is designed to provide.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used every sunscreen made, and now am allergic to all of them.  I get contact dermatitis, and ugly blisters when exposed to the sun.  I have used this product every day for 2 years, with no tanning, no burning and no skin reaction.  It is worth the price.  The lip protectant is excellent in that it does not taste awful, like some other brands.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the Mayo Clinic pharmacy in Arizona knowing I would need a top notch barrier to the desert sun.  I was not disappointed.  Use both the 30 and 60 on a daily basis.  The lip sunscreen is also great protection.  I am uber fair-skinned and keep these products with me at all times!  Have purchased for friends and family who concur with my assessment.</li>
            <li> We have been using this cream previously. We bought it from WalMart but they will not keep it on there retail shelves and you have to purchase it in the pharmacy. The pharmacy closes for lunch whenever I am there to buy the Vanicream SPF 60. When it does open up after their lunch period, sometimes they have it and sometimes not. Amazon has everything with free delivery.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.  My son, who has tons of allergies and skin issues, has never had a problem using this.</li>
            <li> Not at all what was advertised  wrong number</li>
            <li> 7.5% each titanium dioxide and zinc oxide offer maximum protection against cancer&lt;br /&gt;7.5% each titanium dioxide and zinc oxide offer maximum protection against cancer</li>
            <li> This sunscreen stays on very well and doesn&#x27;t burn when you apply it to your face. I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin. Only downside about it is, it&#x27;s very thick, but it works!</li>
            <li> My son (5yo) has extremely sensitive skin (including eczema, food allergies, environmental allergies, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;EVERY other sunscreen we have tried makes him break out.  I am SO excited about this one.  It costs more, but is well worth it.  I have been using it on him daily this summer, since he is constantly in the pool or outside at camp and it has worked great.  I also use it on myself and my daughter (1.5yo) and we have not had breakouts either.  I use the spf 60 on their faces and spf 30 on the rest of their bodies.  ALthough it does not claim to be \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; we have had a lot of success - 7 hours in the pool with only one reapplication and no sunburn.  I am happy!!!&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I like that it soaks in and doesn&#x27;t look all white and ugly - but that is purely shallow - but nice too! :)</li>
            <li> Originally, this product was introduced to me by my dermatologist. Having used it for several years, it still is the best sunscreen product that I have found. Easy to use. One word to the thrifty, don&#x27;t give up on the tube when it appears empty. Store it vertically, mouth of the tube down, and keep &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; the tube (squeezing it), and you will still get many days of use...!!&lt;br /&gt;Price-wise, use Amazon, or similar sources to buy it, NOT your dermatologist.</li>
            <li> If you have sun sensitivies this works great.  And a whole lot cheaper then the dermatologist. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I received a sample Vanicream Sunscreen SPF 30 sample from my dermatologist.  I like it a lot and check it out in Amazon.com.  I thought SPF 60 will give me more power blocking the sun.  I guess it serves the purpose… but the product is SO greasy on the skin.  My skin shines and reflect lots of lights……  then I double check the active ingredients from both SPF 30 &amp; SPF60 and found out they are different.  I guess that explains why.  I go order SPF 30 next time.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product by means of a sample provided in the waiting room in my dermatologist&#x27;s office.  It is one of the best sunscreens I have ever used.  I have had one basal cell carcinoma and two squamous cell carcinomas removed from my forehead and both ears and cannot take a chance with sun exposure.  This product is extremely easy to apply and is absorbed very quickly.  It is not greasy.  I applied this product before my round of golf yesterday and together with my wide-brimmed hat felt I was completely protected.  I plan to play again tomorrow even though a high of 98F is predicted.  I would recommend this product to all sun-sensitive people without hesitation.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause an unattractive allergic reaction.  It is all mineral, none of the chemicals that I fear are worse for us than overexposure to sun. This is the cream that has made living in Florida manageable, and leaves skin soft and dewy to boot. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> For those not wanting to use chemicals that are absorbed into the skin this is a great alternative.  Zinc and titanium dioxide are not absorbed into the skin and may therefore be healthier.  Provides a protective barrier from sun rays. Needs to be rubbed in to get rid of white color. Dust with a mineral power if you wish. Prefer this to exposure to chemicals found in most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Vanicream was even better than Neutrogena! It moisturized my children&#x27;s skin while staying on through beach trips and the pool.  You need to reapply after being in the water a long time. But it&#x27;s quite easy!!  We never got a sunburn - so that is a true testament that iit works!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was recommended by a friend who has skin cancer, so I ordered it for my close friend.  It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny face.  Nor does it end up in the creases of your neck if the weather is hot.  He has tried it for a few days and so far likes it.</li>
            <li> I Ordered  4 boxes of Vanicream Suncreen Sensitive Skin SPF 60. They sent me SPF 50+. The 50+ has ingredients that cause skin rash. The SPF 60 doesn&#x27;t have those harmful ingredients. In returning the four boxes I had to pay the $11.30 postage to return the wrong product they sent me.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and many sunscreens cause a rash.  Vanicream not only does not cause a rash but includes a high protection from sun rays.  I have had many skin cancers over the last many years.</li>
            <li> First thing, this is not SPF 60. It is only 50 Plus though the picture says it is SPF 60. I knew it only when I called the customer service to find that they don&#x27;t make any more Vanicream Sunscreens with SPF 60. Everything that is available is SPF 50 plus.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, It doesn&#x27;t do any magics if you are expecting one like I did. I had severe itching in sun and was advised to use this by a dermatologist. I used Neutrogena SPF 100 previously. It worked the same. So, next time I would prefer buying that which is lesser in price compared to this and works the same. I purchased this after lot of research and reading all the reviews. But apply it 15-20 mins before you go into the sun and it works better.</li>
            <li> The new vanicreme is not SPF 60 like the old and it is far inferior to the old even when it is falsely advertised with the old photo. Try solbar. It seems more like the old.  Stupid company/decision to discontinue it. Oh well...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use regular sunscreens as I often breakout. I have had no problems with Vanicream and have used it for over three years. It spreads easily and does not feel greasy. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have an autoimmune disease which requires that I avoid all UV rays from the sun. Using Vanicream sunscreen protects me extremely well and I have had no problems since I began applying it.</li>
            <li> I put this on the top of my hands everyday to fade age spots.  It does keep them at bay!</li>
            <li> The sunscreen leaves a white chalky residue on your skin especially when your skin gets wet and the pool or beach.</li>
            <li> Very thick cream that causes you to stretch your skin while putting it on.  I always try to be gentle when touching my face (scratching my eyes, rubbing my nose or lips or chin, etc.) because stretching your skin causes it to eventually sag.  I think the cream should be thinner so it will go on easier.  You can feel the damage you are doing to your skin when you wipe it on and spread it around because you have to wipe so deliberately and strongly.  Also, it causes your face to be very shiny at first and the sheen seems to dissipate slightly over time as it dries.  I realize the shiny aspect is a result of how the product works to reflect the UV rays but it seems excessive.  Then, when you wash it off and wash your hair, it takes a couple or three washes to get it all off of your skin and out of your hair (even though I DID NOT get it in my hair when I put it on).  It kind of worries me so I have been reluctant to use it.  This was recommended by a dermatologist who said it was a good product but it was pre-printed on the back of the prescription he gave me for another product.  Maybe he was being paid to promote it???</li>
            <li> Great price for my favorite sunscreen - the only sunscreen I can use on my highly sensitive Rosacea skin,</li>
            <li> I am truly happy with this product.  I have very sensitive skin and am sensitive to some fragrances.  This does not affect any of my sensitivities.  Thanks Vanicream for a great product.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. Des not irritate your skin or cause your eyes to burn or water would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for a trip to Mexico in February of 2013.  We live in Minnesota.  My boyfriend is fair skinned and burns very easily.  We used this and not once did he burn.  He was able to enjoy days on the beach, at the pool, a day deep sea fishing and did not burn once.  He was so relived to be able to enjoy all these activities without worry that he was going to be sun burned for days and in pain.  He did get tan but did not burn.  The product is thick on application but works like nothing else we have ever tried.  I will be buying lots more of this for our family.  This product would be great for kids and anyone who is concerned about sun burn.</li>
