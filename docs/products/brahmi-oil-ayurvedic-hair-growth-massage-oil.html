            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>really enjoying that!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell nothing over the top.  </li>
            <li>Really amazing.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>The product does have an &amp;#34;herby&amp;#34; scent, like a nice tea.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I also use a bonnet dryer to keep it warm on my hair for about 1/2 an hour or so.  </li>
            <li>I need to use it more to make a fair rating.</li>
            <li>I guess you need to warm it up.</li>
            <li>my wife used this product so i have no idea if she liked it or not.  </li>
            <li>but if i have to guess, i would say that she liked it.  </li>
            <li>One thing I liked about this product was the ingredients did not appear to be harmful in any way.</li>
            <li>While some people are bothered by the smell I actually kind of like it.  </li>
            <li>It does turn to liquid if its warm.</li>
            <li>If you can handle the scent of this oil which is not bad once it settles, it is great to massage the scalp with.</li>
            <li>, that is a good sign to me, because of my hair type, my hair breaks very quickly .  </li>
            <li>This a good light hair oil and conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li>It also works wonderful on my two year old daughters hair growth as well.</li>
            <li>So far so good!!!</li>
            <li>The hair on the hairline was very fine</li>
            <li>Great hair massaging oil when it is hot.</li>
            <li>it truly works for me I will buy more.</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>I love the smell, but I guess I have to wait another two weeks to see if it has made my hair thicker and longer.</li>
            <li>My hair shed more than before.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>I am planning to order one more jar and see if i will notice any difference.</li>
            <li>i would say mostly like herbs).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying this product.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair itch and fall more.</li>
            <li>but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I HAD A BALD SPOT IN THE TOP OF MY HEAD AND HAIR THINNING.</li>
            <li>I feel the longer it stays in your hair the better</li>
            <li>I will update after a couple more times.</li>
            <li>, we have been using it since July and her scalp is getting really healthy.</li>
            <li>My cat fur hair looks better in two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Leave it on overnight for the oil to work its magic.</li>
            <li>I will purchase another of the Brahmi Hair Oil as it seemed to be a better conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the herbal smell.  </li>
            <li>will purchase more soon.</li>
            <li>If you like to see your hair growth 1 inch in one month use this product and you will love it trust me.</li>
            <li>My scalp was awakening :).</li>
            <li>, I really love the performance of this product.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t let this run out before I order more.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>my hair is shiny  and looks healthy</li>
            <li>i will keep using because my scalp feels healthy after leaving on overnight</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s how I am able to determine the growth.</li>
            <li>It has an herbal scent like most ayurvedic products.  </li>
            <li>It stays moisturized for days and the hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like with a lot of creamy type products that can become overwhelming at a times.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I was confident that I was safe after reviewing the ingredients in this product, until I used it.</li>
            <li>It smoothes out my curly roots wonderfully and it has changed the texture of my hair so it is almost like White hair.</li>
            <li>Noooo does not work at all.waste of money, my hair kept falling more than before, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li>OK BYE</li>
            <li>My remaining hair feels silky and healthy -</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I put it on top of the oil.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year and love it.</li>
            <li>more then 10 minutes fades your color.</li>
            <li>Very exciting!  </li>
            <li>But so far, so good!</li>
            <li>She doesnt scratch her scalp and we keep her hair/scalp VERY clean.  </li>
            <li>Thank goodness coconut oil is good for dogs and there seemed to be no ill effects of this.</li>
            <li>I uses whith others ayurvedic oils mahabhringaraj and bhrami powder and my hair is growing strong ,healthy and declined to almost nothing what I get.</li>
            <li>Because the weather is changing and becoming cooler, my hair seems to be shedding alot.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important as well to make sure you follow the directions and MASSAGE the oil into your scalp, don&#x27;t just rub it on.  </li>
            <li>After three weeks of using this product my bald spot in the top of my head filled in.</li>
            <li>but it washes of easily and leaves the hair supple and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Nothwithstanding, it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Strong [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The scent is a strong herbal scent, reminds me a mixture of indian sage and tyme.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most certainly buy more if I think I still need it.  :)</li>
            <li>Strong super herbs :).</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and color treated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many hair oils and most of them have mineral oil as the first ingredient.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about a month and see fine hairs coming in along my hairline.  </li>
            <li>My hair does seem to have grown more quickly ..</li>
            <li>But, since there isn&#x27;t any warning on the product label or on the seller&#x27;s page about pregnant women using this oil, I thought I had better share my findings.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This oil is mild and works great on sensitive scalp too.</li>
            <li>I am trying another brand that has mostly oils (dr organics) and seems to be a nice scalp treatment, but it does not leave my hair as soft and manageable as the Brahmi hair oil.  </li>
            <li>so it hasn&#x27;t been a huge issue.  </li>
            <li>This product is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Another important note:  this product leaves my hair with some body....</li>
            <li>10,000mcg, Maximum Strength, 100 Tablets]] for hair growth and this sulfate free shampoo</li>
            <li>I am seeing baby hairs growing in areas that have been smooth for years.  </li>
            <li>There is genuine shine and plenty of body.</li>
            <li>I love that it seems to calm my itchy scalp and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  </li>
            <li>The two spots thinning in the front of my head are almost completely filled in.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and really powerful, more product details see on http://hvast.com.ua/brahmi-volshebnoe-maslo-dlya-rosta-volos/</li>
            <li>If you want to grow your hair longer this really works...a bit sticky and not the greatest smelling, but noticed a definite increase in hair growth.</li>
            <li>And it feels good on skin, I will definitely get another jar when will run out :))</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny, full, bouncy, strong, and voluminous.</li>
            <li>This really works!!!</li>
            <li>Yes, it has a unique smell.</li>
            <li>That way I can more accurately measure out how much I plan to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works best when applied to each individual section of hair, particularly at the ends and roots, right before blowdrying the section.</li>
            <li>I experienced some shedding from this oil which was not normal for me.</li>
            <li>When tthis jar is empty I will happily purchase another one</li>
            <li>This oil smells like sweet herbs.</li>
            <li>It feels really cool and moist on the scalp.</li>
            <li>This make my hair nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair was soft and it had a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li>I cannot give a full review on this product as of yet.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>My hair is really getting better with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this oil for hair growth for six months and it increased my hair growth tremendously.</li>
            <li>The fact that it seems to sell out so quickly should tell you something.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am literally in a logic battle with myself even now, because as a science and math teacher, I can&#x27;t make sense of that quick growth, but it&#x27;s there.  </li>
            <li>The Red and White Label products are WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li>I found out that Gotu Kola can cause miscarriages in pregnant women, and it is advised that it is not used by pregnant women at any stage of their pregnancy, neither ingested, nor applied in any form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it 2x a week at most, but normally don&#x27;t use it for 3 weeks after coloring since leaving it on for</li>
            <li>Its not unpleasant</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be looking to see if I can get more than the 1/2 inch of new hair growth each month.  </li>
            <li>but nothing yet..it keeps my scalp from being dry and feels good when I massage it in..</li>
            <li>I know that everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but if this worked for me, I am pretty sure it will work for many others.</li>
            <li>I put it in the fridge overnight to get solid making it easier to apply Enjoy!!</li>
            <li>Before I started using this product, I could easily see the entire top of my scalp when I looked in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Being three months pregnant myself, I read that and washed the oil out of my hair and off my skin right away.</li>
            <li>So far i LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>To be honest you can do that with any product and get the same results.</li>
            <li>I would love to be PC and call out a texture number like my natural contemporaries but that would not make sense to the lay person.</li>
            <li>It liquifies quickly so something to be aware of.  </li>
            <li>Love yourself, love your hair, and give thanks that your hair is long and growing.  </li>
            <li>it melts right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with Brahmi products for hair health and new hair growth when they are massaged into the scalp and left on for between 45 minutes and several hours.</li>
            <li>I see the beautiful hair of the Middle Eastern women and thought there must be some treatment for such glorious results.</li>
            <li>First of all, only been using it for 2 weeks so jury&#x27;s still out on whether this will effectively boost my hair growth.</li>
            <li>Does have a very strong smell, so be advised to use this at night and follow next day with shampooing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product at the same time as oral supplements for hair re-growth, so I can&#x27;t say much about its effectiveness on its own.  </li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong, but my dry scalp seems to enjoy it from time to time.</li>
            <li>I have a texture again, I might even get bold enough one day and have my natural hair connoisseurs rate it, in the meantime I am able to pull my hair back in a pony tail (well nice afro puff) without a struggle.</li>
            <li>I give it a rating of 3 at first because of the smell and feel.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve started warming this oil with some avocado oil and using it as a hot oil treatment before cowashing my hair.</li>
            <li>The first time i oiled my scalp with it, placed a plastice bag over my head and watch an HBO movie for and hour 45 minutes then washed it out.</li>
            <li>I spray my hair with water first, then I apply this oil.</li>
            <li>It arrived in more of a solid.</li>
            <li>The Brahmi oil smells kinda funny but not a problem.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Be aware it smells like henna (to me, anyway), but I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li>After using this regularly for over a month, my hair looks and feels healthy.</li>
            <li>At first I could not tell if was doing anything.</li>
            <li>This herb will make your hair grow so fast!</li>
            <li>I am interested in seeing what happens in 90 degree weather when the humidity is 100 percent.  </li>
            <li>The first ingredient in this one is Coconut oil.</li>
            <li>The first day I used I did not see any diference</li>
            <li>Today is my first time trying so</li>
            <li>This oil reminds me of coconut oil in that it is a solid at room temperature and must be warmed to become more of a liquid.  </li>
            <li>, I warmed it and used as hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>It will permanently stain clothing, as i found out the first use when i used way too much!</li>
            <li>Instead, imagine if you would, a beautiful afro that is soft and blowing in the wind, when suddenly an electrical jolt occurs and it retreats within inches of the scalp with an inability to untangle and be pull back straight.</li>
            <li>Be advised that the smell is strong - very sweet and heavy.</li>
            <li>Because the texture is so light i have to put it in a cool dry place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing this made a difference in the way my long hair felt and looked so much more conditioned.</li>
            <li>most everything I have read list several main causes:  Genetics, Diet and Stress.  </li>
            <li>Im very please with the positive results.</li>
            <li>and it has been very helpful in addressing certain issues.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For those on a budget, I recommend buying Brahmi powder, mixing it with the conditioner of your choice, covering with a wet turban, leaving on for an hour or more and washing your hair out in a stainless steel sink or shower stall with tiles.</li>
            <li>I have been using this amazing product for few weeks now and my hair is definatley growing again</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been a month now of me using this; it didnt do much.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;ve realized it&#x27;s much easier to use when it is melted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I wash it out, my hair is very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it made her hair grow</li>
            <li>It stops the itching and hair breakage real well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I wore wigs for decades, and I neglected my real hair, but decided to start babying it and growing it out about a year ago.  </li>
            <li>I really can not tell if this oil has helped or not.</li>
            <li>I could so much was falling out.  </li>
            <li>May be it really helped to me.</li>
            <li>This oil really loosens up your scalp and helps with stress.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Give it some time and it will really make your hair healthier.</li>
            <li>This product has really thickened my hair and helped it to grow.</li>
            <li>primrose oil 1000mg softgel 3 times a day which is suppose to be very beneficial for thyroid hais loss</li>
            <li>I am beginning to wonder if the Amazon reviews are real</li>
            <li>i am almost finished with the jar,it does moisturize my curly hair really well,i put it on at night and shampoo out</li>
            <li>The first day it arrived in the mail, I rubbed two teaspoons of the oil into my scalp and ends and waited about 20 minutes and then washed and conditioned as normal.  </li>
            <li>head feels very tingly throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>As you&#x27;re massaging this into your scalp, do it carefully with love.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the way it makes my scalp feel</li>
            <li>Using it for two weeks, so unsure about hair growing part for now, but it feels so very soothing on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Brahmi.</li>
            <li>My hair grows in so fast and is much stronger then before.</li>
            <li>This oil is like a solid when you get because it has coconut oil in it and that oil sometimes becomes a solid and when it gets warm in your home the oil becomes a liquid.</li>
            <li>honestly this is the only product that I&#x27;ve used and actually seen results.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this product a try after reading the reviews and WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over a month and have seen significant hair growth...1 inch of healthy thick hair.</li>
            <li>While I was letting the oil sit in my hair, I did some more research on the active ingredient, Gotu Kola.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to grow their hair out and has tried everything.  </li>
            <li>I am natural, but wear my hair in a protective style (box braids), so it&#x27;s easy to apply the oil in solid form throughout my head.</li>
            <li>I have my hair in a protective style now(box braids), but I&#x27;m going to continue to use the oil and see the outcome when I take my braids down and hope for some better results.</li>
            <li>so I am able to wear it down instead of having to braid it...</li>
            <li>This product will not only thicken your hair but it will grow it and grow it quickly.</li>
            <li>so I know how quickly it can melt from a solid state.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased to say I am on my second jar of Brahmi Hair Oil and have managed to actual get my fingers through my hair without being rushed to the emergency room.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this will bring back the fullness to be able to wear my hair back in a bun!!!  </li>
            <li>But if you work in office, where no one comes into your intimate territory and sniffs your ear, then the scent is not such a big concern, as it is not as strong.</li>
            <li>BUT.. It does die down pretty quick if u dont use too much.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4c high porosity hair which tends to dry out easily.  </li>
            <li>I think that the hair was a little better)))</li>
            <li>I am African American with 4b- naturally curly hair :).</li>
            <li>Love this product; I am an African American woman with natural 4a/b hair.</li>
            <li>but a few days after I notice that my haie was better and&lt;</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s exciting is that I did my big chop (cut off all my chemically relaxed hair length) in spite of the fear of showcasing some thinning sections and edges.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to all mothers of african american children who want to grow their hair long and healthy!</li>
            <li>My hair dresser noticed right away that I was using something different.</li>
            <li>this oil made my hair very soft with the first application,then my hair just felt strong, not much shedding or breakage,i ordered a second jar.</li>
            <li>when I say it has made my hair almost like White hair, I mean that it straightens it wonderfully and hair doesn&#x27;t get broken off in my hair ties and the hair is perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li>It is a staple in my new hair journey.  </li>
            <li>has not produced any new hair believe me i look in the mirror every night.</li>
            <li>I wish i could say after 9 months i had some new growth where hair fell out</li>
            <li>Noticed new hair growth on my hairline after 2.5 months of usage.  </li>
            <li>I use a medium amount, mostly on scalp &amp; a little on hair itself then brush through,put in a ponytail or bun &amp; sleep in it then wash and wear!</li>
            <li>first, I was just using Brahmi oil solid and rubbing it on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Now, my hair looks much fuller and scalp is barely visible.  </li>
            <li>The other one came clean.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone looking to grow thick and healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want to walk around in public with my hair smelling like Brahmi oil, but it&#x27;s not bad for a short while at home.</li>
            <li>That is a great visual of the texture of my off black super tough hair.</li>
            <li>Literally because my natural hair color is golden brown and it is very visible against the black color I dye it.  </li>
            <li>I will experiment by adding some essential oils with sweet base, like rose or geranium oil or ylang ylang oil which may be able to cover above and hide that too earthy scent.</li>
            <li>This is all I&#x27;ve been using in these last months, so I know for certain its the Brahmi oil.</li>
            <li>So I just use a clear shower cap and sleep with that over my head at night.</li>
            <li>Being natural, all the extra grease and moisture is really helpful.  </li>
            <li>It does not make my hair soft at all.</li>
            <li>I notieced that my hair was really soft.</li>
            <li>This Oil makes my hair really soft and managable.</li>
            <li>I can feel tingling in my scalp because I have a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>Now my hair feels soft, conditioned and is noticeably thicker.</li>
            <li>And you might want to use an old pillowcase, too.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4c type hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-make hair soft</li>
            <li>I ordered this oil because I was looking for natural hair oil to condition my scalp.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been applying this to my scalp at night and washing it out in the morning</li>
            <li>Apart from that, the hair ingredients are ALL NATURAL.</li>
            <li>I will use again within a couple of days to make a complete assessment of the product, but if it works the way that I think it will, this is one will be a keeper.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural product that would help regrow my hair and bring it to life again.</li>
            <li>but my hair is soft.</li>
            <li>I have hereditary balding at a young age.</li>
            <li>My girl friend is so amazed how fast it grew back.</li>
            <li>This product is NOT ALL NATURAL.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, compared the the straw like consistency before using this.</li>
            <li>However, the Brahmi oil doesn&#x27;t stay solid for more than a few minutes once I start dipping my finger in it.  </li>
            <li>This product is good for overnight use because, being water-free, it will not have a chilling effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I must say,when I washed my hair the next morning I was like WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Use a flat iron that&#x27;s gentle but straightens hair, if that&#x27;s the style you want.  </li>
            <li>I am African American with very very curly hair that often frizzes and hair breaks off in hair ties, so</li>
            <li>The second time i used it, ( a month later) I washed my hair first.</li>
            <li>The next week I repeated the exact same thing as before.</li>
            <li>In its normal state it is a solid which you must scrape to apply.</li>
            <li>in  which this really slowed my hair loss down first month to 150 hairs a day 2nd month</li>
            <li>In addition to this, I occasionally apply some powdered fenugreek seeds mixed with organic pure coconut milk.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it weekly for about 3 months now and I am definitely seeing some new growth along my hairline.</li>
            <li>There is only so much a person can do about all 3 of these causes (especially the genetics one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>I have very thin fine curly hair that grows VERY slow, and love this stuff, smelled great and did speed up the growth, its not in oil form its more like a thick goo, but as soon as you put some on you fingertips it begins to melt to oil, sounds weird but</li>
            <li>I will use no other hair oil</li>
            <li>Although this oil is in solid form, it melts very quickly so apply a small amount at a time as you want the oil on your scalp and not on your hair.</li>
            <li>It has a slight smell to it and is pretty greasy (and naturally so, its oil ;P)</li>
            <li>My scalp condition improved much quicker, after a couple of weeks of usage - used to be very dry and flaky and itchy.  </li>
            <li>RAW pre-natal vitamins (I&#x27;m not looking to get pregnant, but the ingredients and the health benefits in this product are quite good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I generally apply it twice a week and leave it on overnight.</li>
            <li>I have had a balding spot on the back of my head, but anyone could clearly see that spot filling in.</li>
            <li>I have natural african hair.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for something all natural that actually works, and this does.  </li>
            <li>This is a terrific all natural treatment for hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>I have afro-textured hair (3c/4a) and am growing it out naturally with a goal of waist-length hair in the next 3 years.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been natural for ten years.  </li>
            <li>It has only natural ingredients which is a MUST for something we apply or ingest in us.</li>
            <li>I have a itchy scalp and was looking for something to calm the constant itching down.</li>
            <li>works well...does have a slight unusual smell and a bit oily, but works well and will keep it for that!</li>
            <li>After first using I saw result - loss of hair was much less.</li>
            <li>But, other than that, I really don&#x27;t see the benefits of using it as a &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34; to hair loss.  </li>
            <li>so I read as much as I could on every review board of products I could find and I chose 2 products sold on amazon brahmi hair oil and organic bhringaraj oil I sleep with it in my hair every other night</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not dry at all.</li>
            <li>I actually like it, but it&#x27;s a little hard to describe -- it kind of reminds me of incense.  </li>
            <li>I usually get an inch of more hair every month, but now it looks like I will be getting an inch and a half now.</li>
            <li>You can wear it everyday if you want or use it as a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>I hate the smell but did notice my hair is more shiny and clean looking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I really want to grow my hair down to my waist.  </li>
            <li>and it really cut down frizz.</li>
            <li>I ordered this oil in high hopes that it would make my hair grow due to what was stated in the reviews that I read.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s much healthier now and less dry/itchy/flaky/dandruff-y.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and it&#x27;s not that dry as it used to be.</li>
            <li>and I have seen more growth in these few months, than I&#x27;ve seen in the past year since I started working on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have only usrd it once it makes my hair feel like its full and thick</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product due to all the great reviews but was only left disappointed.</li>
            <li>When solid, it is a dull olive color with a mild herbaceous smell.</li>
            <li>Will try to review in a couple of months as I need to see if there will be new hair growth in other places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was half an inch new growth which was not there before!  </li>
            <li>I have heard good things and bad things about this product.</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> really enjoying that!</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell nothing over the top.  </li>
            <li> Really amazing.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> The product does have an &amp;#34;herby&amp;#34; scent, like a nice tea.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I also use a bonnet dryer to keep it warm on my hair for about 1/2 an hour or so.  </li>
            <li> I need to use it more to make a fair rating.</li>
            <li> I guess you need to warm it up.</li>
            <li> my wife used this product so i have no idea if she liked it or not.  </li>
            <li> but if i have to guess, i would say that she liked it.  </li>
            <li> One thing I liked about this product was the ingredients did not appear to be harmful in any way.</li>
            <li> While some people are bothered by the smell I actually kind of like it.  </li>
            <li> It does turn to liquid if its warm.</li>
            <li> If you can handle the scent of this oil which is not bad once it settles, it is great to massage the scalp with.</li>
            <li> , that is a good sign to me, because of my hair type, my hair breaks very quickly .  </li>
            <li> This a good light hair oil and conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li> It also works wonderful on my two year old daughters hair growth as well.</li>
            <li> So far so good!!!</li>
            <li> The hair on the hairline was very fine</li>
            <li> Great hair massaging oil when it is hot.</li>
            <li> it truly works for me I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> I love the smell, but I guess I have to wait another two weeks to see if it has made my hair thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> My hair shed more than before.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> I am planning to order one more jar and see if i will notice any difference.</li>
            <li> i would say mostly like herbs).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this product.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair itch and fall more.</li>
            <li> but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I HAD A BALD SPOT IN THE TOP OF MY HEAD AND HAIR THINNING.</li>
            <li> I feel the longer it stays in your hair the better</li>
            <li> I will update after a couple more times.</li>
            <li> , we have been using it since July and her scalp is getting really healthy.</li>
            <li> My cat fur hair looks better in two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Leave it on overnight for the oil to work its magic.</li>
            <li> I will purchase another of the Brahmi Hair Oil as it seemed to be a better conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the herbal smell.  </li>
            <li> will purchase more soon.</li>
            <li> If you like to see your hair growth 1 inch in one month use this product and you will love it trust me.</li>
            <li> My scalp was awakening :).</li>
            <li> , I really love the performance of this product.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t let this run out before I order more.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> my hair is shiny  and looks healthy</li>
            <li> i will keep using because my scalp feels healthy after leaving on overnight</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s how I am able to determine the growth.</li>
            <li> It has an herbal scent like most ayurvedic products.  </li>
            <li> It stays moisturized for days and the hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like with a lot of creamy type products that can become overwhelming at a times.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I was confident that I was safe after reviewing the ingredients in this product, until I used it.</li>
            <li> It smoothes out my curly roots wonderfully and it has changed the texture of my hair so it is almost like White hair.</li>
            <li> Noooo does not work at all.waste of money, my hair kept falling more than before, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> OK BYE</li>
            <li> My remaining hair feels silky and healthy -</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I put it on top of the oil.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year and love it.</li>
            <li> more then 10 minutes fades your color.</li>
            <li> Very exciting!  </li>
            <li> But so far, so good!</li>
            <li> She doesnt scratch her scalp and we keep her hair/scalp VERY clean.  </li>
            <li> Thank goodness coconut oil is good for dogs and there seemed to be no ill effects of this.</li>
            <li> I uses whith others ayurvedic oils mahabhringaraj and bhrami powder and my hair is growing strong ,healthy and declined to almost nothing what I get.</li>
            <li> Because the weather is changing and becoming cooler, my hair seems to be shedding alot.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important as well to make sure you follow the directions and MASSAGE the oil into your scalp, don&#x27;t just rub it on.  </li>
            <li> After three weeks of using this product my bald spot in the top of my head filled in.</li>
            <li> but it washes of easily and leaves the hair supple and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Nothwithstanding, it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It washes out easily.</li>

            <li> The scent is a strong herbal scent, reminds me a mixture of indian sage and tyme.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll most certainly buy more if I think I still need it.  :)</li>
            <li> Strong super herbs :).</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and color treated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many hair oils and most of them have mineral oil as the first ingredient.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month and see fine hairs coming in along my hairline.  </li>
            <li> My hair does seem to have grown more quickly ..</li>
            <li> But, since there isn&#x27;t any warning on the product label or on the seller&#x27;s page about pregnant women using this oil, I thought I had better share my findings.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This oil is mild and works great on sensitive scalp too.</li>
            <li> I am trying another brand that has mostly oils (dr organics) and seems to be a nice scalp treatment, but it does not leave my hair as soft and manageable as the Brahmi hair oil.  </li>
            <li> so it hasn&#x27;t been a huge issue.  </li>
            <li> This product is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Another important note:  this product leaves my hair with some body....</li>
            <li> 10,000mcg, Maximum Strength, 100 Tablets]] for hair growth and this sulfate free shampoo</li>
            <li> I am seeing baby hairs growing in areas that have been smooth for years.  </li>
            <li> There is genuine shine and plenty of body.</li>
            <li> I love that it seems to calm my itchy scalp and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  </li>
            <li> The two spots thinning in the front of my head are almost completely filled in.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and really powerful, more product details see on http://hvast.com.ua/brahmi-volshebnoe-maslo-dlya-rosta-volos/</li>
            <li> If you want to grow your hair longer this really works...a bit sticky and not the greatest smelling, but noticed a definite increase in hair growth.</li>
            <li> And it feels good on skin, I will definitely get another jar when will run out :))</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny, full, bouncy, strong, and voluminous.</li>
            <li> This really works!!!</li>
            <li> Yes, it has a unique smell.</li>
            <li> That way I can more accurately measure out how much I plan to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works best when applied to each individual section of hair, particularly at the ends and roots, right before blowdrying the section.</li>
            <li> I experienced some shedding from this oil which was not normal for me.</li>
            <li> When tthis jar is empty I will happily purchase another one</li>
            <li> This oil smells like sweet herbs.</li>
            <li> It feels really cool and moist on the scalp.</li>
            <li> This make my hair nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair was soft and it had a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li> I cannot give a full review on this product as of yet.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much.</li>
            <li> My hair is really getting better with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for hair growth for six months and it increased my hair growth tremendously.</li>
            <li> The fact that it seems to sell out so quickly should tell you something.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am literally in a logic battle with myself even now, because as a science and math teacher, I can&#x27;t make sense of that quick growth, but it&#x27;s there.  </li>
            <li> The Red and White Label products are WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> I found out that Gotu Kola can cause miscarriages in pregnant women, and it is advised that it is not used by pregnant women at any stage of their pregnancy, neither ingested, nor applied in any form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it 2x a week at most, but normally don&#x27;t use it for 3 weeks after coloring since leaving it on for</li>
            <li> Its not unpleasant</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be looking to see if I can get more than the 1/2 inch of new hair growth each month.  </li>
            <li> but nothing yet..it keeps my scalp from being dry and feels good when I massage it in..</li>
            <li> I know that everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but if this worked for me, I am pretty sure it will work for many others.</li>
            <li> I put it in the fridge overnight to get solid making it easier to apply Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> Before I started using this product, I could easily see the entire top of my scalp when I looked in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Being three months pregnant myself, I read that and washed the oil out of my hair and off my skin right away.</li>
            <li> So far i LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> To be honest you can do that with any product and get the same results.</li>
            <li> I would love to be PC and call out a texture number like my natural contemporaries but that would not make sense to the lay person.</li>
            <li> It liquifies quickly so something to be aware of.  </li>
            <li> Love yourself, love your hair, and give thanks that your hair is long and growing.  </li>
            <li> it melts right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with Brahmi products for hair health and new hair growth when they are massaged into the scalp and left on for between 45 minutes and several hours.</li>
            <li> I see the beautiful hair of the Middle Eastern women and thought there must be some treatment for such glorious results.</li>
            <li> First of all, only been using it for 2 weeks so jury&#x27;s still out on whether this will effectively boost my hair growth.</li>
            <li> Does have a very strong smell, so be advised to use this at night and follow next day with shampooing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product at the same time as oral supplements for hair re-growth, so I can&#x27;t say much about its effectiveness on its own.  </li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong, but my dry scalp seems to enjoy it from time to time.</li>
            <li> I have a texture again, I might even get bold enough one day and have my natural hair connoisseurs rate it, in the meantime I am able to pull my hair back in a pony tail (well nice afro puff) without a struggle.</li>
            <li> I give it a rating of 3 at first because of the smell and feel.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve started warming this oil with some avocado oil and using it as a hot oil treatment before cowashing my hair.</li>
            <li> The first time i oiled my scalp with it, placed a plastice bag over my head and watch an HBO movie for and hour 45 minutes then washed it out.</li>
            <li> I spray my hair with water first, then I apply this oil.</li>
            <li> It arrived in more of a solid.</li>
            <li> The Brahmi oil smells kinda funny but not a problem.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Be aware it smells like henna (to me, anyway), but I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> After using this regularly for over a month, my hair looks and feels healthy.</li>
            <li> At first I could not tell if was doing anything.</li>
            <li> This herb will make your hair grow so fast!</li>
            <li> I am interested in seeing what happens in 90 degree weather when the humidity is 100 percent.  </li>
            <li> The first ingredient in this one is Coconut oil.</li>
            <li> The first day I used I did not see any diference</li>
            <li> Today is my first time trying so</li>
            <li> This oil reminds me of coconut oil in that it is a solid at room temperature and must be warmed to become more of a liquid.  </li>
            <li> , I warmed it and used as hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> It will permanently stain clothing, as i found out the first use when i used way too much!</li>
            <li> Instead, imagine if you would, a beautiful afro that is soft and blowing in the wind, when suddenly an electrical jolt occurs and it retreats within inches of the scalp with an inability to untangle and be pull back straight.</li>
            <li> Be advised that the smell is strong - very sweet and heavy.</li>
            <li> Because the texture is so light i have to put it in a cool dry place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this made a difference in the way my long hair felt and looked so much more conditioned.</li>
            <li> most everything I have read list several main causes:  Genetics, Diet and Stress.  </li>
            <li> Im very please with the positive results.</li>
            <li> and it has been very helpful in addressing certain issues.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For those on a budget, I recommend buying Brahmi powder, mixing it with the conditioner of your choice, covering with a wet turban, leaving on for an hour or more and washing your hair out in a stainless steel sink or shower stall with tiles.</li>
            <li> I have been using this amazing product for few weeks now and my hair is definatley growing again</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been a month now of me using this; it didnt do much.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;ve realized it&#x27;s much easier to use when it is melted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I wash it out, my hair is very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it made her hair grow</li>
            <li> It stops the itching and hair breakage real well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> I wore wigs for decades, and I neglected my real hair, but decided to start babying it and growing it out about a year ago.  </li>
            <li> I really can not tell if this oil has helped or not.</li>
            <li> I could so much was falling out.  </li>
            <li> May be it really helped to me.</li>
            <li> This oil really loosens up your scalp and helps with stress.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Give it some time and it will really make your hair healthier.</li>
            <li> This product has really thickened my hair and helped it to grow.</li>
            <li> primrose oil 1000mg softgel 3 times a day which is suppose to be very beneficial for thyroid hais loss</li>
            <li> I am beginning to wonder if the Amazon reviews are real</li>
            <li> i am almost finished with the jar,it does moisturize my curly hair really well,i put it on at night and shampoo out</li>
            <li> The first day it arrived in the mail, I rubbed two teaspoons of the oil into my scalp and ends and waited about 20 minutes and then washed and conditioned as normal.  </li>
            <li> head feels very tingly throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> As you&#x27;re massaging this into your scalp, do it carefully with love.  </li>
            <li> I also really like the way it makes my scalp feel</li>
            <li> Using it for two weeks, so unsure about hair growing part for now, but it feels so very soothing on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Brahmi.</li>
            <li> My hair grows in so fast and is much stronger then before.</li>
            <li> This oil is like a solid when you get because it has coconut oil in it and that oil sometimes becomes a solid and when it gets warm in your home the oil becomes a liquid.</li>
            <li> honestly this is the only product that I&#x27;ve used and actually seen results.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this product a try after reading the reviews and WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a month and have seen significant hair growth...1 inch of healthy thick hair.</li>
            <li> While I was letting the oil sit in my hair, I did some more research on the active ingredient, Gotu Kola.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to grow their hair out and has tried everything.  </li>
            <li> I am natural, but wear my hair in a protective style (box braids), so it&#x27;s easy to apply the oil in solid form throughout my head.</li>
            <li> I have my hair in a protective style now(box braids), but I&#x27;m going to continue to use the oil and see the outcome when I take my braids down and hope for some better results.</li>
            <li> so I am able to wear it down instead of having to braid it...</li>
            <li> This product will not only thicken your hair but it will grow it and grow it quickly.</li>
            <li> so I know how quickly it can melt from a solid state.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased to say I am on my second jar of Brahmi Hair Oil and have managed to actual get my fingers through my hair without being rushed to the emergency room.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this will bring back the fullness to be able to wear my hair back in a bun!!!  </li>
            <li> But if you work in office, where no one comes into your intimate territory and sniffs your ear, then the scent is not such a big concern, as it is not as strong.</li>
            <li> BUT.. It does die down pretty quick if u dont use too much.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4c high porosity hair which tends to dry out easily.  </li>
            <li> I think that the hair was a little better)))</li>
            <li> I am African American with 4b- naturally curly hair :).</li>
            <li> Love this product; I am an African American woman with natural 4a/b hair.</li>
            <li> but a few days after I notice that my haie was better and&lt;</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s exciting is that I did my big chop (cut off all my chemically relaxed hair length) in spite of the fear of showcasing some thinning sections and edges.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to all mothers of african american children who want to grow their hair long and healthy!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser noticed right away that I was using something different.</li>
            <li> this oil made my hair very soft with the first application,then my hair just felt strong, not much shedding or breakage,i ordered a second jar.</li>
            <li> when I say it has made my hair almost like White hair, I mean that it straightens it wonderfully and hair doesn&#x27;t get broken off in my hair ties and the hair is perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li> It is a staple in my new hair journey.  </li>
            <li> has not produced any new hair believe me i look in the mirror every night.</li>
            <li> I wish i could say after 9 months i had some new growth where hair fell out</li>
            <li> Noticed new hair growth on my hairline after 2.5 months of usage.  </li>
            <li> I use a medium amount, mostly on scalp &amp; a little on hair itself then brush through,put in a ponytail or bun &amp; sleep in it then wash and wear!</li>
            <li> first, I was just using Brahmi oil solid and rubbing it on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Now, my hair looks much fuller and scalp is barely visible.  </li>
            <li> The other one came clean.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone looking to grow thick and healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to walk around in public with my hair smelling like Brahmi oil, but it&#x27;s not bad for a short while at home.</li>
            <li> That is a great visual of the texture of my off black super tough hair.</li>
            <li> Literally because my natural hair color is golden brown and it is very visible against the black color I dye it.  </li>
            <li> I will experiment by adding some essential oils with sweet base, like rose or geranium oil or ylang ylang oil which may be able to cover above and hide that too earthy scent.</li>
            <li> This is all I&#x27;ve been using in these last months, so I know for certain its the Brahmi oil.</li>
            <li> So I just use a clear shower cap and sleep with that over my head at night.</li>
            <li> Being natural, all the extra grease and moisture is really helpful.  </li>
            <li> It does not make my hair soft at all.</li>
            <li> I notieced that my hair was really soft.</li>
            <li> This Oil makes my hair really soft and managable.</li>
            <li> I can feel tingling in my scalp because I have a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> Now my hair feels soft, conditioned and is noticeably thicker.</li>
            <li> And you might want to use an old pillowcase, too.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4c type hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-make hair soft</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil because I was looking for natural hair oil to condition my scalp.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been applying this to my scalp at night and washing it out in the morning</li>
            <li> Apart from that, the hair ingredients are ALL NATURAL.</li>
            <li> I will use again within a couple of days to make a complete assessment of the product, but if it works the way that I think it will, this is one will be a keeper.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural product that would help regrow my hair and bring it to life again.</li>
            <li> but my hair is soft.</li>
            <li> I have hereditary balding at a young age.</li>
            <li> My girl friend is so amazed how fast it grew back.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT ALL NATURAL.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, compared the the straw like consistency before using this.</li>
            <li> However, the Brahmi oil doesn&#x27;t stay solid for more than a few minutes once I start dipping my finger in it.  </li>
            <li> This product is good for overnight use because, being water-free, it will not have a chilling effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I must say,when I washed my hair the next morning I was like WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Use a flat iron that&#x27;s gentle but straightens hair, if that&#x27;s the style you want.  </li>
            <li> I am African American with very very curly hair that often frizzes and hair breaks off in hair ties, so</li>
            <li> The second time i used it, ( a month later) I washed my hair first.</li>
            <li> The next week I repeated the exact same thing as before.</li>
            <li> In its normal state it is a solid which you must scrape to apply.</li>
            <li> in  which this really slowed my hair loss down first month to 150 hairs a day 2nd month</li>
            <li> In addition to this, I occasionally apply some powdered fenugreek seeds mixed with organic pure coconut milk.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it weekly for about 3 months now and I am definitely seeing some new growth along my hairline.</li>
            <li> There is only so much a person can do about all 3 of these causes (especially the genetics one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> I have very thin fine curly hair that grows VERY slow, and love this stuff, smelled great and did speed up the growth, its not in oil form its more like a thick goo, but as soon as you put some on you fingertips it begins to melt to oil, sounds weird but</li>
            <li> I will use no other hair oil</li>
            <li> Although this oil is in solid form, it melts very quickly so apply a small amount at a time as you want the oil on your scalp and not on your hair.</li>
            <li> It has a slight smell to it and is pretty greasy (and naturally so, its oil ;P)</li>
            <li> My scalp condition improved much quicker, after a couple of weeks of usage - used to be very dry and flaky and itchy.  </li>
            <li> RAW pre-natal vitamins (I&#x27;m not looking to get pregnant, but the ingredients and the health benefits in this product are quite good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I generally apply it twice a week and leave it on overnight.</li>
            <li> I have had a balding spot on the back of my head, but anyone could clearly see that spot filling in.</li>
            <li> I have natural african hair.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for something all natural that actually works, and this does.  </li>
            <li> This is a terrific all natural treatment for hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I have afro-textured hair (3c/4a) and am growing it out naturally with a goal of waist-length hair in the next 3 years.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been natural for ten years.  </li>
            <li> It has only natural ingredients which is a MUST for something we apply or ingest in us.</li>
            <li> I have a itchy scalp and was looking for something to calm the constant itching down.</li>
            <li> works well...does have a slight unusual smell and a bit oily, but works well and will keep it for that!</li>
            <li> After first using I saw result - loss of hair was much less.</li>
            <li> But, other than that, I really don&#x27;t see the benefits of using it as a &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34; to hair loss.  </li>
            <li> so I read as much as I could on every review board of products I could find and I chose 2 products sold on amazon brahmi hair oil and organic bhringaraj oil I sleep with it in my hair every other night</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not dry at all.</li>
            <li> I actually like it, but it&#x27;s a little hard to describe -- it kind of reminds me of incense.  </li>
            <li> I usually get an inch of more hair every month, but now it looks like I will be getting an inch and a half now.</li>
            <li> You can wear it everyday if you want or use it as a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell but did notice my hair is more shiny and clean looking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I really want to grow my hair down to my waist.  </li>
            <li> and it really cut down frizz.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil in high hopes that it would make my hair grow due to what was stated in the reviews that I read.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s much healthier now and less dry/itchy/flaky/dandruff-y.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and it&#x27;s not that dry as it used to be.</li>
            <li> and I have seen more growth in these few months, than I&#x27;ve seen in the past year since I started working on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have only usrd it once it makes my hair feel like its full and thick</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product due to all the great reviews but was only left disappointed.</li>
            <li> When solid, it is a dull olive color with a mild herbaceous smell.</li>
            <li> Will try to review in a couple of months as I need to see if there will be new hair growth in other places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was half an inch new growth which was not there before!  </li>
            <li> I have heard good things and bad things about this product.</li>
            <li> As far as my dry scalp, if you follow the direction of course you wont have dry scalp because you are constantly oiling then washing your hair.</li>
            <li> had to put in a spray bottle because its very runny, i couldnt see dippin my fingers in over and over &amp; not make a mess!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is working, but it does make my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> Within the past three months my scalp has been really itcy and irritated in the crown of my head.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it will thicken my hair -</li>
            <li> I use it every other day sometimes twice a day because my scalp is so dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> with very long hair (almost to the back of my knees).  </li>
            <li> Definitely make my hair extremely dry, which means there are mineral oils in there, even they didn&#x27;t mention it in the indigence.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so soft, shiny and black before.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my previously itchy flaky scalp is completely non-existent.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any increase in thickness, but I was at the end of my rope with my dry, chemically processed hair and this was a last ditch effort before I cut it all off!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it makes my hair(Im molloto, half white, half black)soft shiny with just the right amount of curl</li>
            <li> problems a few reviewers have complained about, such as shedding, the oil leaving a greasy film on hair and pillowcases, etc., can be avoided by using only a small amount up to three times per week and making sure to wash it out thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural blonde who constantly colors her hair dark and used to destroy it by constantly heat styling it..</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is very dry and this oil brings the shine and bounce back within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> To early to tell but I think that after almost a month of using it, I started to see some little baby hairs in my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have seen minor growth already around my edges</li>
            <li> I have maintained a long style of hair with this porduct and I have acne prone skin</li>
            <li> , this looked to be a few years old.  </li>
            <li> I would have said I loved it if the smell wasn&#x27;t so annoying.</li>
            <li> I never finished the jar because one of my dogs at it (got it open by chewing, then finished off the entire last half of the jar!).</li>
            <li> other conditioners have left my hair too soft and limp.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used consistently, enough to tell if hair growth is occurring, but it definitely changed my hair to a softer texture, (less dry).</li>
            <li> I immediately through it out due to the constant shedding</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been 4x&#x27;s since k have locks and wash my hair every other week.</li>
            <li> Due to stress, and other factors, I began losing my hair several years ago and recently decided it was time to start growing it</li>
            <li> This oil is lasting a very long time because I use this oil every other day on my hair.</li>
            <li> After one use my dry scalp problem is gone.  </li>
            <li> Wash, blow dry, oil, brush, braid.</li>
            <li> My hair is so dry</li>
            <li> My scalp has a tendency to get dry and flaky, and this is just the thing that helps.</li>
            <li> but ive had no new re growth it grows faster but</li>
            <li> My hair is growing faster and thicker and I can feel little hairs cropping up on my head in places where there had been just bare skin before.  </li>
            <li> less fall out with my routine of what im doing just no new regrowth at present time</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways so it will last a long time!!</li>
            <li> I occasionally get a little snow on the mountain, so to speak and since using, have not noticed any grey.</li>
            <li> My expectations were not extremely high.</li>
            <li> It has made my hair THICK very THICK from fine and damaged.</li>
            <li> I put a little tiny bit in her hair because i wanted to test before committing and let me tell you...</li>
            <li> Smells and looks a little different but waiting to see the results.</li>
            <li> I felt comfortable cutting off two inches of split ends.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this oil is that it stains my pillow cases since its a green  colored oil.</li>
            <li> The hair shed is minimal.</li>
            <li> Will come back in a few for an update.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 and my hair has been thinning for the last few years</li>
            <li> By the way, I am 62 years old, with reddish brown hair down past my waist.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair and was very surprised when I saw clumps of it coming out whenever I used this product.</li>
            <li> but hey if you&#x27;re desperate enough, you&#x27;ll try anything, right?</li>
            <li> I mean REALLY soft.</li>
            <li> I used it every day for a month because my hair seemed to be thinning, probably due to dying it every few weeks for the last 20+ years.</li>
            <li> It looks like this thick dark green goop and is really greasy.</li>
            <li> I must say I&#x27;m not happy with the smell in general which is why I&#x27;ve given it only 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> My hair absorbs this and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> in the amazon review, it says other people have had their hair returned and I am one of them.</li>
            <li> WHAT THE OTHER COMMENTS SAID.</li>
            <li> I use it like I use the other oils.</li>
            <li> This, along with a brush, a comb and all kinds of other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair growth remedies have now gone in the garbage.  </li>
            <li> I cant comment on hair growth as I also use other hair products.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> Other than the scent</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is due to the oil or to the fact that I have been taking fenugreek for the last month though.  </li>
            <li> I was sceptical about this product because I did not believe that anything would work to regrow hair on a bald spot that I had due to a traumatic event and</li>
            <li> I thought all hope was lost for thinning along my hairline due to micros.</li>
            <li> only gave it three stars because I am not able to use it at this time, and you have to choose a rating before you can post your review.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible but gave my hair a soft and more manageable feel.  </li>
            <li> My edges are so sensitive and thin due to stress and/or medications</li>
            <li> I am half Swedish and half French with very thick, coarse hair which I dye black.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I would brush it through and massage my scalp by brushing with my head upside down for 200 strokes.</li>
            <li> It drips down you face and neck.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use a product that doesn&#x27;t contain mineral oil, petroleum, DMDM Hydantoin, Methyl Paraben and other harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the Brahmi product, it&#x27;s your diet and the dried out hair due to relaxing.</li>
            <li> It came to me, the bottle covered in oil; when I opened it is was a solid, hard mass of fuzzy green.</li>
            <li> I am indian my hair is black.</li>
            <li> a black woman</li>
            <li> Worst advertising,  this is no oil in any form; just a very solid product and not even appealing.</li>
            <li> Has an odd smell that remained until I washed it out...</li>
            <li> and I will measure if I get another half inch of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used one jar of the oil, but still can&#x27;t tell the results (hard to tell because my hair is long anyway).</li>
            <li> My hair has always been quite thin, but over the last year or so has been &amp;#34;thinning out&amp;#34; from hair fall due to thyroid issues.  </li>
            <li> She burned my hair so bad that I started to be bold all over.</li>
            <li> The little gray I have is not increasing at all.</li>
            <li> (Sometimes I add a little of the Biotique Botanicals Bhringraj Hair Growth oil to it as well.)  </li>
            <li> scent takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> I have course hair so after a wash, this oil does soften a little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not offensive, but it does make me a little concerned since I work in an office.  </li>
            <li> I place it in the fridge for a little while so that it would firm up.</li>
            <li> And in a little less than a month, too!  </li>
            <li> Not good as a leave in conditioner for too long.</li>
            <li> this was noticable after using this product once a week, for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> only 2 weeks  used on my thin hair--</li>
            <li> Blow dried my hair</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> The directions say to use the hair oil every few days.  </li>
            <li> I rub the oil to my scalp and hair for a few minutes about 1-2 times per week.</li>
            <li> When I apply this product to my scalp, after a few minutes I knew it bagan to work because I felt tingles.</li>
            <li> This is Day 2 of Round 2</li>
            <li> Or i will just put it in my hair for a few hours then wash.  </li>
            <li> If your having trouble with your hair falling out or hereditary balding</li>
            <li> Waste of money if you read the directions on this product it instructs for you to leave it on for 2 hours and then rinse it out or leave it on overnight and rinse it out..</li>
            <li> This item does not grow back hair,very false advertisement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used your previous products too!</li>
            <li> Since my hair/scalp issues are due to hormone imbalance I was very skeptical that this would assist in any way, but am pleasantly surprised at the improvement.  </li>
            <li> The hair on my edges was very thin, this massage oil thickened it within a few weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> Very little, if any gray.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses the herbal odor is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> But it is not too bad, really, it all depends on your allowance.</li>
            <li> I recently had to cut my long hair because of a really bad trim I received, so I&#x27;m hoping to expedite my hair growth.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown 4inches over the past 6months.</li>
            <li> this past January(it grew</li>
            <li> there is no more dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my hair is getting thicker</li>
            <li> Not sure how it is for hair growth yet</li>
            <li> my hair is just past my shoulders</li>
            <li> I usually do it the night before and sleep with it and wash it out before I have to go to work.</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> I hardly had any hair in the drain catcher</li>
            <li> and I have little prickly hair growing in my bald spot!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just a 3 1/2 months of use, I noticed my hair which I was losing is growing back in like crazy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this at least twice a week...</li>
            <li> AND MY HAIR IS GETTING THICK</li>
            <li> I am paying it forward to all the ladies out there who suffered from slow growing hair or thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> Some other products are designed for hair growth, but some of the chemicals used are questionable.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin at the temples and crown of my head and I have tried everything you can imagine for hair growth - Monistat, emu oil, Jamaican black castor oil, minoxidil -</li>
            <li> This was not surprising due to the cold weather.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> All of my life it has been impossible to keep my hair untangled due to its thinness, but that is no longer an issue</li>
            <li> In the winter the coconut oil gets hard and it is difficult to use it.</li>
            <li> Since using this, my hair loss and greatly decreased.  </li>
            <li> I did see some results in hair growth after approximately a month of use.</li>
            <li> Not happy about this purchase.</li>
            <li> though is very weak.  </li>
            <li> your money... until they come up with a cure for Vanity... which we all deal with in our culture in one form or another... and we are all guilty of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The base is coconut oil, so I would massage it into my scalp in the evening while listening to music or watching t.v., a few times a week.</li>
            <li> But price is really expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-very expensive for a hair oil</li>
            <li> and I feel something weird going on my scalp</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s weird to explain</li>
            <li> Not strong or annoying.  </li>
            <li> Few months ago I went to the hairsalon, and the lady did a horrible job ony hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was so shiny and grew like crazy</li>
            <li> It leaves a tingly feeling on my scalp for about an hour, but nothing unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Also i would say doesn&#x27;t smell that bad )</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this oil.</li>
            <li> but the smell in not as bad as everyone says</li>
            <li> SMELLS BAD</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t help with that :(</li>
            <li> I hate coconut oil on my hair.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it truly works for me I will buy more. Im very please with the positive results. thank you very much</li>
            <li> in the amazon review, it says other people have had their hair returned and I am one of them. I have had a balding spot on the back of my head, but anyone could clearly see that spot filling in. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Love this and it did work for me</li>
            <li> This item does not grow back hair,very false advertisement.</li>
            <li> Still under trying and testing, I am just know 3 week using it, but I feel this product is good.</li>
            <li> This oil smells like sweet herbs. I give it a rating of 3 at first because of the smell and feel. I love the smell, but I guess I have to wait another two weeks to see if it has made my hair thicker and longer. It feels really cool and moist on the scalp. I leave it in overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a month now of me using this; it didnt do much. It does not make my hair soft at all. I hate coconut oil on my hair. It makes it crispy. I have natural african hair. I didnt use it 2-3 times weekly. I kinda stopped. I can tell after about 7 days when a hair growth product is working.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. I have been using this for 2 months. My hair shed more than before. I kept reading all the review it work for others but not for me.</li>
            <li> This make my hair nice and soft.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it will thicken my hair - which is why I bought it.    .</li>
            <li> I love this oil. Its very healthy for the hair.</li>
            <li> This product will not only thicken your hair but it will grow it and grow it quickly. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and the results are visible. Try it. It works!!!</li>
            <li> I used one jar of the oil, but still can&#x27;t tell the results (hard to tell because my hair is long anyway). Definitely make my hair extremely dry, which means there are mineral oils in there, even they didn&#x27;t mention it in the indigence. I am planning to order one more jar and see if i will notice any difference. I use it 2-3 times weekly, for 2 hours on my hear. Also i would say doesn&#x27;t smell that bad )i would say mostly like herbs).</li>
            <li> It is a massage oil but dont expect hair to grow. Another thing, its an oil if its heated. In its normal state it is a solid which you must scrape to apply.</li>
            <li> Sure makes my hair shinny!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used consistently, enough to tell if hair growth is occurring, but it definitely changed my hair to a softer texture, (less dry).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this product.  It is a staple in my new hair journey.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous.  After one use my dry scalp problem is gone.  It leaves my hair beautifully conditioned.  My hair does seem to have grown more quickly ..this was noticable after using this product once a week, for a few weeks.  The product does have an &amp;#34;herby&amp;#34; scent, like a nice tea.  Not strong or annoying.  Another important note:  this product leaves my hair with some body....other conditioners have left my hair too soft and limp.  By the way, I am 62 years old, with reddish brown hair down past my waist.  Very little, if any gray.  The little gray I have is not increasing at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 3 months back. I don&#x27;t write reviews until i use it for sometime. So far i LOVE this product. I have a bald spot in the front. The spot is filling up with usage of this oil. It has made my hair THICK very THICK from fine and damaged. It needs to be used as directed. Unless its used like that you can see no results. I am indian my hair is black. My hair has never felt so soft, shiny and black before. Will definitely repurchase. In fact I am thinking of stocking up !</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil as a pre-poo for about 4 wks, and I must say that I feel that my hair has thickened some what.  It leaves a tingly feeling on my scalp for about an hour, but nothing unpleasant. Does have a very strong smell, so be advised to use this at night and follow next day with shampooing. Please follow directions...will purchase again.</li>
            <li> If you can handle the scent of this oil which is not bad once it settles, it is great to massage the scalp with. I like this for a pre-oil treatment before I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil in high hopes that it would make my hair grow due to what was stated in the reviews that I read. I used this as a scalp massage once or twice a week. After massaging my scalp, I would let it sit over night or for an hour before washing. I experienced some shedding from this oil which was not normal for me. I am african american with relaxed hair. I immediately through it out due to the constant shedding i experienced.\\&quot;Everything that works for me may not work for you\\&quot;. I remember that quote and now I believe it.</li>
            <li> I am an AA woman with hair type 4 hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was just using Brahmi oil solid and rubbing it on my scalp. Now, I&#x27;ve realized it&#x27;s much easier to use when it is melted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve started warming this oil with some avocado oil and using it as a hot oil treatment before cowashing my hair. (Sometimes I add a little of the Biotique Botanicals Bhringraj Hair Growth oil to it as well.)  After putting the warmed oil on my hair, I put on a plastic hair cap and massage my scalp.  Sometimes I also use a bonnet dryer to keep it warm on my hair for about 1/2 an hour or so.  After I wash it out, my hair is very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it weekly for about 3 months now and I am definitely seeing some new growth along my hairline. I don&#x27;t think my hair is growing faster, but it is definitely getting a bit thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent takes a little getting used to. I actually like it, but it&#x27;s a little hard to describe -- it kind of reminds me of incense.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to walk around in public with my hair smelling like Brahmi oil, but it&#x27;s not bad for a short while at home.</li>
            <li> works well...does have a slight unusual smell and a bit oily, but works well and will keep it for that! only 2 weeks  used on my thin hair-- hope to see some changes</li>
            <li> Good product, used occassionally</li>
            <li> This oil is great for the scalp! I have a itchy scalp and was looking for something to calm the constant itching down. Well I think I have found the solution with this oil. My daughter and I have been using this oil for two weeks, and I could feel and see and feel the difference in our scalp. I am natural, but wear my hair in a protective style (box braids), so it&#x27;s easy to apply the oil in solid form throughout my head. I have seen minor growth already around my edges and they are looking fuller. For a healthier scalp and hair, this oil is a must!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to use a product that doesn&#x27;t contain mineral oil, petroleum, DMDM Hydantoin, Methyl Paraben and other harsh ingredients. My frontal hair line was receding and so I purchased this product after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a 3 1/2 months of use, I noticed my hair which I was losing is growing back in like crazy. This product works! Family and friends have been noticing also. Some thought I had hair transplant surgery! Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I began using this product on Nov 1, 2014. The first time i oiled my scalp with it, placed a plastice bag over my head and watch an HBO movie for and hour 45 minutes then washed it out. I notieced that my hair was really soft. The second time i used it, ( a month later) I washed my hair first. Blow dried my hair then I oiled my scalp. I brushed it reallly well then braided my hair.  i left it on for a week before I washed it out.  This Oil makes my hair really soft and managable. I mean REALLY soft. The next week I repeated the exact same thing as before. Wash, blow dry, oil, brush, braid. Wash out a week later.  It has been 7 weeks and my hair has grown 2 inches and I have my edges coming in fuzzy. After a few uses the herbal odor is hardly noticeable. When tthis jar is empty I will happily purchase another one</li>
            <li> Made my hair itch and fall more.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this product but I absolutely love it. I will use no other hair oil but this one to rub on my scalp. I can see benefits with my hair already too soon to see growth results though I will definitely post again when the growth starts. But so far, so good! I recommend this product to all mothers of african american children who want to grow their hair long and healthy! I wish my mom had used this when I was younger!</li>
            <li> NICE PRODUCT! IT DOES EXCACTLY WHAT THE OTHER COMMENTS SAID. I HAD A BALD SPOT IN THE TOP OF MY HEAD AND HAIR THINNING. I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF IT WAS FROM MY DIABETES, STRESS, OR FROM MY FAMILY TRAIT. I JUST KNOW ITS GONE AND MY HAIR IS GETTING THICK AGAIN LIKE IT WAS WHEN I WAS A CHILD.</li>
            <li> This a good light hair oil and conditioner for my hair. Because the texture is so light i have to put it in a cool dry place. When it arrived in the mail. the oil had escaped as oils do. and was all over the out side of the package. I place it in the fridge for a little while so that it would firm up. I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for hair growth for six months and it increased my hair growth tremendously. My hair has grown 4inches over the past 6months. The only downside to this oil is that it stains my pillow cases since its a green  colored oil. So I just use a clear shower cap and sleep with that over my head at night. I apply it in the morning and then cowash (wash hair with conditioner) my hair the next day. It also works wonderful on my two year old daughters hair growth as well. I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it made her hair grow considering I trimmed off 2inches of her hair this past January(it grew 4-5inches) and she didn&#x27;t suffer from any allergic reactions. I use this oil 4times a week on my scalp. Although this oil is in solid form, it melts very quickly so apply a small amount at a time as you want the oil on your scalp and not on your hair. This oil sells out all the time on amazon which is why I rated it 4stars. So stock up if this oil is a winner for you.I also use this with [[ASIN:B004H7GB9G Natrol Biotin 10,000mcg, Maximum Strength, 100 Tablets]] for hair growth and this sulfate free shampoo [[ASIN:B006I3353M Organix Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo -- 13 fl oz]].</li>
            <li> This oil is lasting a very long time because I use this oil every other day on my hair. I wash my hair at the end of the week now. I can tell my hair is growing and getting thicker. I usually get an inch of more hair every month, but now it looks like I will be getting an inch and a half now. I don&#x27;t wash my hair every time I apply this oil in my scalp. I use it like I use the other oils. I spray my hair with water first, then I apply this oil. I can feel tingling in my scalp because I have a sensitive scalp. This oil is mild and works great on sensitive scalp too. I have nothing bad to say about this oil. This oil do not smell good but afterwards the smell fades away. My scalp eats this oil up. I must say I would recommend this oil to others. This oil is like a solid when you get because it has coconut oil in it and that oil sometimes becomes a solid and when it gets warm in your home the oil becomes a liquid. Solid or liquid it can be applied to the scalp. You don&#x27;t have to was it out either. You can wear it everyday if you want or use it as a hot oil treatment. I feel the longer it stays in your hair the better it works. I use it every other day sometimes twice a day because my scalp is so dry and sensitive. This is like a medicine to my scalp. It stops the itching and hair breakage real well. I have course hair so after a wash, this oil does soften a little. I just apply to the scalp and my ends. I like this oil a lot.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a couple of times. I need to use it more to make a fair rating. I have heard good things and bad things about this product. I will update after a couple more times. It arrived in more of a solid. I rub it between my palms and massage it into my scalp.</li>
            <li> So my daughter and I both were Locs. My daughter HAD dandruff.  I put a little tiny bit in her hair because i wanted to test before committing and let me tell you...there is no more dandruff.  She doesnt scratch her scalp and we keep her hair/scalp VERY clean.  I really like this product, we have been using it since July and her scalp is getting really healthy.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4c high porosity hair which tends to dry out easily.  I wore wigs for decades, and I neglected my real hair, but decided to start babying it and growing it out about a year ago.  My hair is very thin at the temples and crown of my head and I have tried everything you can imagine for hair growth - Monistat, emu oil, Jamaican black castor oil, minoxidil - you name it.  I have to say, I am going with the Ayurvedic  products for life now after trying this oil.  I have been searching for something all natural that actually works, and this does.  It&#x27;s been two months and I have seen more growth in these few months, than I&#x27;ve seen in the past year since I started working on my hair. This is all I&#x27;ve been using in these last months, so I know for certain its the Brahmi oil. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to grow their hair out and has tried everything.  I am seeing baby hairs growing in areas that have been smooth for years.  Very exciting!  I am paying it forward to all the ladies out there who suffered from slow growing hair or thinning hair.  I know that everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but if this worked for me, I am pretty sure it will work for many others. Be blessed!</li>
            <li> I really can not tell if this oil has helped or not. As far as my dry scalp, if you follow the direction of course you wont have dry scalp because you are constantly oiling then washing your hair. To be honest you can do that with any product and get the same results. I have not noticed any growth yet and I am still experiencing a lot of hair loss. I have my hair in a protective style now(box braids), but I&#x27;m going to continue to use the oil and see the outcome when I take my braids down and hope for some better results.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  This, along with a brush, a comb and all kinds of other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair growth remedies have now gone in the garbage.  I sport my &amp;#34;baldness&amp;#34; and wear it proudly.  I am done spending money on things like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil does smell good and is probably great for the scalp.  But, other than that, I really don&#x27;t see the benefits of using it as a &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34; to hair loss.  (I used it religiously for a month)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The research on baldness is legion... and most everything I have read list several main causes:  Genetics, Diet and Stress.  There is only so much a person can do about all 3 of these causes (especially the genetics one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money... until they come up with a cure for Vanity... which we all deal with in our culture in one form or another... and we are all guilty of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You look great... if you are beautiful from the inside out.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil from Amazon in hopes of seeing some thickening of my hair.  I followed the directions but did not see any change in thickness, volum or even a reduction in hair beakage. It may work for some but not for me.</li>
            <li> My cat fur hair looks better in two weeks.  The directions say to use the hair oil every few days.  My hair is so dry I use the hair oil and coconut oil on alternating nights.  The Brahmi oil smells kinda funny but not a problem.  My hair dresser noticed the difference in my flaky scalp and breaking hair immediately.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is very dry and this oil brings the shine and bounce back within a couple of hours. It has a slight smell to it and is pretty greasy (and naturally so, its oil ;P) but it washes of easily and leaves the hair supple and easy to manage. I&#x27;ve used it to get rid of dandruff as well. Leave it on overnight for the oil to work its magic.</li>
            <li> I used it every day for a month because my hair seemed to be thinning, probably due to dying it every few weeks for the last 20+ years. Every time I washed my hair I could so much was falling out.  Since using this, my hair loss and greatly decreased.  Now my hair feels soft, conditioned and is noticeably thicker. My family noticed it before I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware it smells like henna (to me, anyway), but I don&#x27;t mind it. The base is coconut oil, so I would massage it into my scalp in the evening while listening to music or watching t.v., a few times a week. Sometimes I would brush it through and massage my scalp by brushing with my head upside down for 200 strokes. I&#x27;m guessing this made a difference in the way my long hair felt and looked so much more conditioned. I never finished the jar because one of my dogs at it (got it open by chewing, then finished off the entire last half of the jar!). Thank goodness coconut oil is good for dogs and there seemed to be no ill effects of this. I am trying another brand that has mostly oils (dr organics) and seems to be a nice scalp treatment, but it does not leave my hair as soft and manageable as the Brahmi hair oil.  I will purchase another of the Brahmi Hair Oil as it seemed to be a better conditioner.</li>
            <li> I uses whith others ayurvedic oils mahabhringaraj and bhrami powder and my hair is growing strong ,healthy and declined to almost nothing what I get. Yes Irecommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with Brahmi products for hair health and new hair growth when they are massaged into the scalp and left on for between 45 minutes and several hours. Be advised that the smell is strong - very sweet and heavy. It washes out well in a shower and leaves no residue on fiberglass shower walls. If you plan to keep it on overnight, which may well help hair growth, I suggest wearing a turban so that you don&#x27;t stain your pillowcases. And you might want to use an old pillowcase, too. This product is good for overnight use because, being water-free, it will not have a chilling effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those on a budget, I recommend buying Brahmi powder, mixing it with the conditioner of your choice, covering with a wet turban, leaving on for an hour or more and washing your hair out in a stainless steel sink or shower stall with tiles.</li>
            <li> I used it and I felt some hair growth. May be it really helped to me. But price is really expensive.</li>
            <li> This oil really loosens up your scalp and helps with stress. I love the herbal smell.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I think that the hair was a little better)))</li>
            <li> I see the beautiful hair of the Middle Eastern women and thought there must be some treatment for such glorious results. This oil is one of those treatments. I&#x27;m not too concerned about the herbal smell. It actually grew on me. However, the results of the oil on my scalp and hair is awesome.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific all natural treatment for hair and scalp. Although it is described as an oil to be poured on the scalp, mine came solidified. This was not surprising due to the cold weather. However, it has not liquefied even at room temperature. Nothwithstanding, it is easy to apply. It does melt in the hand. When solid, it is a dull olive color with a mild herbaceous smell. Once applied, the aroma dissipates. Apply one or two teaspoons and massage into the scalp. You then comb through the hair and leave on for a minimum of two to three hours before washing out. I generally apply it twice a week and leave it on overnight. It washes out easily. I must say I was impressed with the results. My hair is fine and color treated. Over the years it seems to have lost  both its luster and volume. After using this regularly for over a month, my hair looks and feels healthy. There is genuine shine and plenty of body. My hair seems to have grown faster but not thicker. I occasionally get a little snow on the mountain, so to speak and since using, have not noticed any grey. I think this is a good product that can help boost condition and shine. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Great hair massaging oil when it is hot. In the winter the coconut oil gets hard and it is difficult to use it. I guess you need to warm it up. The smell is a bit strong, but my dry scalp seems to enjoy it from time to time. It is a bit messy to use it and it has a very oily consistency. Not good as a leave in conditioner for too long. It drips down you face and neck.</li>
            <li> this oil is great. my hair grew one inch in a month. i massaged in scalp twice a day.  will purchase more soon.</li>
            <li> This oil comes solid in the jar. You can use it as a solid and rub in your hands,  it melts right away. Or I put it in the microwave for 15 secs and pour it in my hands.  I rub the oil to my scalp and hair for a few minutes about 1-2 times per week. It does have a smell but its not off putting in my opinion. Directions say to wash out, I DON&#x27;T wash out until wash day. I have noticed that my previously itchy flaky scalp is completely non-existent.  The hair shed is minimal. I cant comment on hair growth as I also use other hair products.  I have natural 4c type hair. My hair absorbs this and a little goes a long way.  I use this along with Ayurvedic rosemary thyme henna hair tonic.</li>
            <li> If you like to see your hair growth 1 inch in one month use this product and you will love it trust me.IAM  a black woman and i have  been using this product for two months now  and my hair growth about 2 1/2 inch and i still use it.</li>
            <li> my wife used this product so i have no idea if she liked it or not.  but if i have to guess, i would say that she liked it.  thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading other reviews. My expectations were not extremely high. One thing I liked about this product was the ingredients did not appear to be harmful in any way. Some other products are designed for hair growth, but some of the chemicals used are questionable. This product does not appear to have any ingredients that could harm the users. I did see some results in hair growth after approximately a month of use.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-make hair soft&lt;br /&gt;-promotes hair growth a lot&lt;br /&gt;-reduces hair fall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-very expensive for a hair oil&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil because I was looking for natural hair oil to condition my scalp. After reading the reviews, I was concerned about the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit. It smells like the Henna plant, which I don&#x27;t mind. If you have ever gotten mehndi designs done, it smells like that. In addition, I am hoping to stimulate my hair growth.. I recently had to cut my long hair because of a really bad trim I received, so I&#x27;m hoping to expedite my hair growth. I&#x27;m crossing my fingers for great results!</li>
            <li> Worst advertising,  this is no oil in any form; just a very solid product and not even appealing. I am very disappointed. Actually do not want to rate this product.</li>
            <li> My hair has been thicker and softer since using this. At first I could not tell if was doing anything. Give it some time and it will really make your hair healthier.</li>
            <li> I have used this product 1 year ago. I would have said I loved it if the smell wasn&#x27;t so annoying. This herb will make your hair grow so fast! When I apply this product to my scalp, after a few minutes I knew it bagan to work because I felt tingles. My scalp was awakening :). I saw result after a month. This stuff works!!! I am African American with 4b- naturally curly hair :). I would have gave 5 stars just don&#x27;t like the smell left over on my pillow. Strong super herbs :). You must wash this out after a couple of hours smell lingers.. Strong [[ASIN:B0002OMOIA Brahmi Oil - Ayurvedic Hair Growth massage oil]]Herbally smell.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this oil.  First of all, only been using it for 2 weeks so jury&#x27;s still out on whether this will effectively boost my hair growth. I have afro-textured hair (3c/4a) and am growing it out naturally with a goal of waist-length hair in the next 3 years.  I&#x27;ll be looking to see if I can get more than the 1/2 inch of new hair growth each month.  If I do, this will be added to my arsenal of highly-prized oils.  I must say I&#x27;m not happy with the smell in general which is why I&#x27;ve given it only 4 stars.  It&#x27;s not offensive, but it does make me a little concerned since I work in an office.  So far I&#x27;ve been applying this to my scalp at night and washing it out in the morning so it hasn&#x27;t been a huge issue.  I am interested in seeing what happens in 90 degree weather when the humidity is 100 percent.  I love that it seems to calm my itchy scalp and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  I use coconut oil regularly so I know how quickly it can melt from a solid state.  However, the Brahmi oil doesn&#x27;t stay solid for more than a few minutes once I start dipping my finger in it.  It liquifies quickly so something to be aware of.  Other than the scent, I really love the performance of this product.  So I would definitely recommend it. The fact that it seems to sell out so quickly should tell you something.  I won&#x27;t let this run out before I order more.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 pieces of this oil. One was covered in oil, but froze, as it&#x27;s coconut oil, which hardens at below room temperature. The other one came clean. Apart from that, the hair ingredients are ALL NATURAL. I&#x27;ve tried many hair oils and most of them have mineral oil as the first ingredient. The first ingredient in this one is Coconut oil. You have to dip you finger in the bottle to pick up a piece and rub it in your palms to get back to fluid form. It smells like henna and I&#x27;m very happy after using it once.</li>
            <li> Has an odd smell that remained until I washed it out...Very different than what is in the 8oz. bottle.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. I leave it on overnight. I&#x27;m not sure if my hair is getting thicker but I&#x27;ll meep using it. It&#x27;s only been 4x&#x27;s since k have locks and wash my hair every other week.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair and scalp feel!</li>
            <li> If you want to grow your hair longer this really works...a bit sticky and not the greatest smelling, but noticed a definite increase in hair growth.</li>
            <li> Love this product; I am an African American woman with natural 4a/b hair. I have been using this oil for 7 months. I mix this oil with castor oil and jojoba oil, and use it as my hair growth oil. I apply it to my scalp every three days and shampoo or co-wash my hair at the end of the week. This product has really thickened my hair and helped it to grow. It is one of my staple products. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to grow thick and healthy hair. The customer service was excellent, prompt and neatly packaged.</li>
            <li> I started losing my hair all over my head i am hyperthyroid(graves disease) discovered in jan 2012 at that time I was losing over 1000 hairs a day so I read as much as I could on every review board of products I could find and I chose 2 products sold on amazon brahmi hair oil and organic bhringaraj oil I sleep with it in my hair every other night lord my pillow cases are trashed even to know I rub it in all over my hair scalp massage then use what i put in my scalp to massage into rest of my hair then tie it up in a bun with a hair tie..in feb of 2012 i started taking evening primrose oil 1000mg softgel 3 times a day which is suppose to be very beneficial for thyroid hais loss in  which this really slowed my hair loss down first month to 150 hairs a day 2nd month 60-70 hairs a day to now 20-30 hairs a day fallout...my hair is not growing back yet i rotate the brahmi then next time use bhringaraj oil then i use for a week brahmi again my hair is shiny  and looks healthy but ive had no new re growth it grows faster but has not produced any new hair believe me i look in the mirror every night.I am stable as of my blood test results for hyperthyroid with thyroid meds.some have reported growth on here I wish i could say after 9 months i had some new growth where hair fell out but nothing yet..it keeps my scalp from being dry and feels good when I massage it in..so my review is I have shinier hair in 9 months of use less fall out with my routine of what im doing just no new regrowth at present time this is oct 2012 the scent does not bother me i use oxy cleaner in the wash to help with stains on pillow cases i will keep using because my scalp feels healthy after leaving on overnight</li>
            <li> This really works!!! The first day I used I did not see any diference but a few days after I notice that my haie was better and&lt;br /&gt;them I realized that was the product!!!!!! Really amazing.....Love it! If you are having problem please try you will not regreted!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is working, but it does make my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> I must say I&#x27;ve read a ton of reviews regarding this product before I ordered it.  I&#x27;m African American and I&#x27;ve been natural for ten years.  Within the past three months my scalp has been really itcy and irritated in the crown of my head.  I used the product the same day it came in the mail.  I followed the directions on the packaging and I must say,when I washed my hair the next morning I was like WOW!!! My hair was soft and it had a nice shine to it. Because the weather is changing and becoming cooler, my hair seems to be shedding alot.  I hardly had any hair in the drain catcher, that is a good sign to me, because of my hair type, my hair breaks very quickly .  As I&#x27;m writing this post its been a couple of hours since I&#x27;ve washed my hair.  My scalp does not feel itchy.  It has a pleasant smell nothing over the top.  I will use again within a couple of days to make a complete assessment of the product, but if it works the way that I think it will, this is one will be a keeper.</li>
            <li> I am beginning to wonder if the Amazon reviews are real</li>
            <li> Works great! I put it in my hair then french braid it and wash it out the next day. My hair is softer and longer than ever</li>
            <li> Not sure how it is for hair growth yet but the smell in not as bad as everyone says</li>
            <li> I just brought this product and used it.  It smells horrible but gave my hair a soft and more manageable feel.  Love It!!!!!!</li>
            <li> i am almost finished with the jar,it does moisturize my curly hair really well,i put it on at night and shampoo out,it doesnt smell that bad,a bit herbal,however i dint have any growth from using it,maybe it works for some people not all,but i would buy again simply as a good moisturizer or oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I have awesomely wonderous super curly hair. I would love to be PC and call out a texture number like my natural contemporaries but that would not make sense to the lay person. Instead, imagine if you would, a beautiful afro that is soft and blowing in the wind, when suddenly an electrical jolt occurs and it retreats within inches of the scalp with an inability to untangle and be pull back straight. That is a great visual of the texture of my off black super tough hair. I am pleased to say I am on my second jar of Brahmi Hair Oil and have managed to actual get my fingers through my hair without being rushed to the emergency room. I have a texture again, I might even get bold enough one day and have my natural hair connoisseurs rate it, in the meantime I am able to pull my hair back in a pony tail (well nice afro puff) without a struggle. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am half Swedish and half French with very thick, coarse hair which I dye black.  I am growing out a bob haircut from last May and my hair is just past my shoulders now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I really want to grow my hair down to my waist.  This is a big hair goal for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this Brahmi oil about a week ago.  The first day it arrived in the mail, I rubbed two teaspoons of the oil into my scalp and ends and waited about 20 minutes and then washed and conditioned as normal.  In four days, I looked in the mirror and couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes.  There was half an inch new growth which was not there before!  Literally because my natural hair color is golden brown and it is very visible against the black color I dye it.  I was estatic obviously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am literally in a logic battle with myself even now, because as a science and math teacher, I can&#x27;t make sense of that quick growth, but it&#x27;s there.  So, now I am in a second experiment.  This is Day 2 of Round 2 and I will measure if I get another half inch of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My head feels very tingly throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m taking Garden of Life RAW pre-natal vitamins (I&#x27;m not looking to get pregnant, but the ingredients and the health benefits in this product are quite good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence about this product, I&#x27;d say buy it!</li>
            <li> Yes, it has a unique smell. But I love it!  I use both the Brahmi Hair oil in the jar and the oil in the bottle. I use it daily, and  I leave it in. It feels great when rubbed into scalp after a shampoo.  The growth is wonderful (My hair is shoulder length on the sides and longer in the back.  I felt comfortable cutting off two inches of split ends. I have \\&quot;mixed hair\\&quot;. The rubbing of the scalp stimulates the hair growth, so does your beliefs and thoughts on the topic.  As you&#x27;re massaging this into your scalp, do it carefully with love.  Love yourself, love your hair, and give thanks that your hair is long and growing.  For those who claim their hair is relaxed and its falling out.  It&#x27;s not the Brahmi product, it&#x27;s your diet and the dried out hair due to relaxing. Use a flat iron that&#x27;s gentle but straightens hair, if that&#x27;s the style you want.  I Love The Products!  Great Job Vadik Herbs.  I&#x27;ve used your previous products too! The Red and White Label products are WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> I have the slowest growing hair in the world.  I tried this oil and after 3weeks I noticed about 1/2\\&quot; growth. For me that&#x27;s a lot. I had colored hair so that&#x27;s how I am able to determine the growth. I hate the smell but did notice my hair is more shiny and clean looking. My hair is still falling out so it didn&#x27;t help with that :( overall I would buy again!</li>
            <li> Today is my first time trying so I cannot give a full review on this product as of yet. I will say it does have an odor. Its not unpleasant but it doesn&#x27;t smell delicious either. It is a solid at room temperature but turns to an oil once you rub it in your hands. I have read nothing but good reviews on this product so hopefully I will get some good results.</li>
            <li> I have very thin fine curly hair that grows VERY slow, and love this stuff, smelled great and did speed up the growth, its not in oil form its more like a thick goo, but as soon as you put some on you fingertips it begins to melt to oil, sounds weird but great stuff, even my husband liked the smell lol and applied and massaged it in for me 4 or 5 nights a week, will def buy again</li>
            <li> Thank you  very  good  stuff! I will buy again thank you</li>
            <li> I am a white woman, age 26, with wavy hair.  Due to stress, and other factors, I began losing my hair several years ago and recently decided it was time to start growing it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product at the same time as oral supplements for hair re-growth, so I can&#x27;t say much about its effectiveness on its own.  However, it definitely seems to help.  And in a little less than a month, too!  My hair is growing faster and thicker and I can feel little hairs cropping up on my head in places where there had been just bare skin before.  YES!  I also really like the way it makes my scalp feel - it&#x27;s much healthier now and less dry/itchy/flaky/dandruff-y.  I store my jar of Brahmi oil inside a plastic ziplock bag in the fridge when I&#x27;m not using it.  Then scoop out what I need with a spoon and rub it between my fingers until it melts.  That way I can more accurately measure out how much I plan to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems a few reviewers have complained about, such as shedding, the oil leaving a greasy film on hair and pillowcases, etc., can be avoided by using only a small amount up to three times per week and making sure to wash it out thoroughly.  (And maybe using a pillow cover.)  It&#x27;s important as well to make sure you follow the directions and MASSAGE the oil into your scalp, don&#x27;t just rub it on.  Rubbing the scalp can irritate it and lead to shedding.  While some people are bothered by the smell I actually kind of like it.  I find it soothing and I fall asleep faster on the nights when I apply the oil before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my jar runs out I&#x27;ll most certainly buy more if I think I still need it.  :)</li>
            <li> Few months ago I went to the hairsalon, and the lady did a horrible job ony hair. She burned my hair so bad that I started to be bold all over. I was looking for a natural product that would help regrow my hair and bring it to life again. I have been using this amazing product for few weeks now and my hair is definatley growing again and it&#x27;s not dry at all. My hair is soft and it&#x27;s not that dry as it used to be. It&#x27;s amazing and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent service, will reorder</li>
            <li> This oil reminds me of coconut oil in that it is a solid at room temperature and must be warmed to become more of a liquid.  It has an herbal scent like most ayurvedic products.  It looks like this thick dark green goop and is really greasy. Being natural, all the extra grease and moisture is really helpful.  I use it as a deep moisturizing treatment before i shampoo my hair. Sometimes I&#x27;ll put it in my hair and sleep with it overnight then wash the next day. Or i will just put it in my hair for a few hours then wash.  I also put it in a bottle to make it easier to dispense when using it to oil my scalp.  My hair loves this stuff. It stays moisturized for days and the hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like with a lot of creamy type products that can become overwhelming at a times.  A little goes a long ways so it will last a long time!! I love it!</li>
            <li> Масло для роста волос, лучше для себя еще не нашла, это мой лубимый продукт!! действительно масло работает, после него волосы гуще и ускоряется рост!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;ve only been using for a month so I haven&#x27;t seen any growth but my hair is soft. Will come back in a few for an update.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!! I have hereditary balding at a young age. I&#x27;ve tried a number of products, but nothing worked. After three weeks of using this product my bald spot in the top of my head filled in. The two spots thinning in the front of my head are almost completely filled in. If your having trouble with your hair falling out or hereditary balding this is the product you want to use. My hair is richer, and thicker. My girl friend is so amazed how fast it grew back.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to Propylene Glycol and search tirelessly for products that don&#x27;t contain the chemical. I was confident that I was safe after reviewing the ingredients in this product, until I used it. This product is NOT ALL NATURAL.</li>
            <li> Waste of money if you read the directions on this product it instructs for you to leave it on for 2 hours and then rinse it out or leave it on overnight and rinse it out.. its an oil and I havent seen any results whats so ever.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product today and I feel something weird going on my scalp it&#x27;s weird to explain but I recommend this to everyone it looks like it works I will be updating this</li>
            <li> The hair on my edges was very thin, this massage oil thickened it within a few weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> To early to tell but I think that after almost a month of using it, I started to see some little baby hairs in my scalp. (Crossing my fingers)&lt;br /&gt;I will post as time progresses.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I love this product so much. It smoothes out my curly roots wonderfully and it has changed the texture of my hair so it is almost like White hair. I am African American with very very curly hair that often frizzes and hair breaks off in hair ties, so when I say it has made my hair almost like White hair, I mean that it straightens it wonderfully and hair doesn&#x27;t get broken off in my hair ties and the hair is perfectly smooth. It works best when applied to each individual section of hair, particularly at the ends and roots, right before blowdrying the section. Great great product! Definitely will buy it again! Definitely! Again, I am not disappointed by the excellent quality of Indian hair oils.</li>
            <li> Noooo does not work at all.waste of money, my hair kept falling more than before, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product due to all the great reviews but was only left disappointed. When i used this product, it made my hair come out in big clumps whenever I washed or brushed my hair which never happens! I have very thick, long hair and was very surprised when I saw clumps of it coming out whenever I used this product. Once I stopped, so did the hair loss. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> SMELLS BAD NO DIDN&#x27;T WORK I THROW IN TRASH</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any increase in thickness, but I was at the end of my rope with my dry, chemically processed hair and this was a last ditch effort before I cut it all off! My hair is soft, compared the the straw like consistency before using this.My hair dresser noticed right away that I was using something different. I have maintained a long style of hair with this porduct and I have acne prone skin so I like that I have not had any increased breakouts on my hair line from this. I massage into my scalp only 2 a week to begin with and now once a week. I usually do it the night before and sleep with it and wash it out before I have to go to work.</li>
            <li> It came to me, the bottle covered in oil; when I opened it is was a solid, hard mass of fuzzy green. Oil to me is fluid, this looked to be a few years old.  Not happy about this purchase.</li>
            <li> Using it for two weeks, so unsure about hair growing part for now, but it feels so very soothing on my scalp. My scalp has a tendency to get dry and flaky, and this is just the thing that helps. It has only natural ingredients which is a MUST for something we apply or ingest in us. The scent is a strong herbal scent, reminds me a mixture of indian sage and tyme. I will experiment by adding some essential oils with sweet base, like rose or geranium oil or ylang ylang oil which may be able to cover above and hide that too earthy scent. But it is not too bad, really, it all depends on your allowance. Lets say, if you are going on a date with someone you know well, then maybe that wouldn&#x27;t be a thing to put on before. But if you work in office, where no one comes into your intimate territory and sniffs your ear, then the scent is not such a big concern, as it is not as strong. it smells stronger in the jar than on your head. And it feels good on skin, I will definitely get another jar when will run out :))</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a month and have seen significant hair growth...1 inch of healthy thick hair. The smell is a bit strong. I&#x27;m 37 and my hair has been thinning for the last few years honestly this is the only product that I&#x27;ve used and actually seen results. My next step was bosley cause I didn&#x27;t know what else to do. But now I may have found a solution.I will keep you posted on the progress.</li>
            <li> Noticed new hair growth on my hairline after 2.5 months of usage.  Not sure if it is due to the oil or to the fact that I have been taking fenugreek for the last month though.  My scalp condition improved much quicker, after a couple of weeks of usage - used to be very dry and flaky and itchy.  I am oiling scalp 3 times per week overnight, then washing my hair in the morning with a mix of shikakai/aritha powders, plus amla or hibiscus.  I am now out of this product and am switching to brahmi/ amla oil from the same supplier, as I had purchased it along with the brahmi oil.  Will try to review in a couple of months as I need to see if there will be new hair growth in other places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out that the word brahmi is used for two different herbs  - centella asiatica (gotu kola), which is used in this product, and bacopa monnieri.  From reading on websites of some Indian producers, it is bacopa monnieri that is actually used in traditional Brahmi oil.  I also found one US supplier that uses both herbs in their Brahmi oil.  Does anybody know which one is actually used in Ayurvedic Brahmi oil?</li>
            <li> Threw it out - it smelled rancid.  Terrible.</li>
            <li> I GET IT ON TIMES GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE I REALLY LOVE IT, GOOD PERFOMANCE, EXCELLENT JOB , SEE YOU NEXT TIMES OK BYE</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month and see fine hairs coming in along my hairline.  My edges are so sensitive and thin due to stress and/or medications I currently take for Lupus.  Hopefully this will bring back the fullness to be able to wear my hair back in a bun!!!  So far so good!!!</li>
            <li> Good product! Not greasy and really powerful, more product details see on http://hvast.com.ua/brahmi-volshebnoe-maslo-dlya-rosta-volos/</li>
            <li> My hair was so shiny and grew like crazy it was shoulder length and now mid-back, I warmed it and used as hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical about this product because I did not believe that anything would work to regrow hair on a bald spot that I had due to a traumatic event and the stress it caused. I decided to give this product a try after reading the reviews and WOW!!! It actually works!! I have only used it for two weeks and I have little prickly hair growing in my bald spot!! My remaining hair feels silky and healthy - it hasn&#x27;t been that way in several years!! I love this stuff!!! Give it a try!!!</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s working but I like the concept.  the oil itself looks legitimate and it does separate if you dont use it for awhile but hey if you&#x27;re desperate enough, you&#x27;ll try anything, right?</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I&#x27;ve applied this to my scalp about twice a week and after a month my hair has grown an inch.</li>
            <li> This product is EXCELLENT!!! I thought all hope was lost for thinning along my hairline due to micros. This product brought it back. The hair on the hairline was very fine but now it has gotten thicker along with the rest of my hair. Amazingly good stuff. It does turn to liquid if its warm. I put it in the fridge overnight to get solid making it easier to apply Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> This product is great. I have only usrd it once it makes my hair feel like its full and thick</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I have used it close to two months now. I do see good hair growth. My hair has stopped falling. I love it. Thanks to Brahmi.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had enough time to evaluate fully.  It is definitely wholesome oil.  The jar it shipped in though is very weak.  I was cracked and leaking on arrival.  I rescued it and put in in a violet glass jar.</li>
            <li> Just tried the product. Smells and looks a little different but waiting to see the results. Hopefully it works and I will see results soon.</li>
            <li> this oil made my hair very soft with the first application,then my hair just felt strong, not much shedding or breakage,i ordered a second jar.</li>
            <li> I have been using this at least twice a week... sometimes 3X a week for the last 6 weeks and it has been very helpful in addressing certain issues.  I am 60 y.o. with very long hair (almost to the back of my knees).  My hair has always been quite thin, but over the last year or so has been &amp;#34;thinning out&amp;#34; from hair fall due to thyroid issues.  Since my hair/scalp issues are due to hormone imbalance I was very skeptical that this would assist in any way, but am pleasantly surprised at the improvement.  Before I started using this product, I could easily see the entire top of my scalp when I looked in the mirror.  Now, my hair looks much fuller and scalp is barely visible.  In addition to this, I occasionally apply some powdered fenugreek seeds mixed with organic pure coconut milk.  I put it on top of the oil.  All of my life it has been impossible to keep my hair untangled due to its thinness, but that is no longer an issue so I am able to wear it down instead of having to braid it... really enjoying that!</li>
            <li> Have been using about a week. had to put in a spray bottle because its very runny, i couldnt see dippin my fingers in over and over &amp; not make a mess! Im already almost out. the smell is horrid! BUT.. It does die down pretty quick if u dont use too much. Other than that, it makes my hair(Im molloto, half white, half black)soft shiny with just the right amount of curl and it really cut down frizz. My goal was wash and wear hair and this does it! I use a medium amount, mostly on scalp &amp; a little on hair itself then brush through,put in a ponytail or bun &amp; sleep in it then wash and wear! Before laying on my pillow i take a towel and wipe off excess oil blotting hair and ive had no problem with staining pillowcases. It will permanently stain clothing, as i found out the first use when i used way too much! But no problems since. will definately buy again or try similar products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural blonde who constantly colors her hair dark and used to destroy it by constantly heat styling it.. I LOVE this product. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year and love it. My hair grows in so fast and is much stronger then before. I use it 2x a week at most, but normally don&#x27;t use it for 3 weeks after coloring since leaving it on for more then 10 minutes fades your color. I&#x27;ll leave the container in the bath tub to melt it, massage it into my roots and then run some through the ends, sleep wth a shower cap on and leave it in overnight, and then shampoo it out the next morning. It leaves my hair shiny, full, bouncy, strong, and voluminous.</li>
            <li> My hair is really getting better with this product. After first using I saw result - loss of hair was much less. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The smell is not as pungent as I have read about and can be muted after the wash out with lemon and coconut oil mix or a misting of rosewater post conditioning.  I have been using this for a month and have retained and gained length on my type 4(a,b,and c) teeny afro. What&#x27;s exciting is that I did my big chop (cut off all my chemically relaxed hair length) in spite of the fear of showcasing some thinning sections and edges. This product has stimulated hair growth and retention in those areas, helping me rock my kinky fro style with thicker fuller volume. Please try for yourself and adhere to the directions despite any impatience. It is helping a problem I&#x27;ve struggled with years.</li>
            <li> too oily not for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this after reading all the wonderful results that people had gotten with this oil. After I received it, I used it almost immediately on my scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes. While I was letting the oil sit in my hair, I did some more research on the active ingredient, Gotu Kola. I found out that Gotu Kola can cause miscarriages in pregnant women, and it is advised that it is not used by pregnant women at any stage of their pregnancy, neither ingested, nor applied in any form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being three months pregnant myself, I read that and washed the oil out of my hair and off my skin right away. After I have my baby, I&#x27;ll try the oil again, and give a proper review of the benefits. But, since there isn&#x27;t any warning on the product label or on the seller&#x27;s page about pregnant women using this oil, I thought I had better share my findings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it three stars because I am not able to use it at this time, and you have to choose a rating before you can post your review.</li>
