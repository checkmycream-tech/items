            <li>Please do the research to see how great Parent oils are, and the outstanding company Yes; see if Parent oils are the answer for you they were for me.</li>
            <li>Good stuff and works better than fish oil for me.</li>

            <li>Love this supplement for these reasons.</li>
            <li>YES PARENT ESSENTIAL OILS are the best on the market.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched, and this seems to be the best deal for Parent Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li>Need to take it longer to see more benefits</li>
            <li>/&gt;PEO is not disgusting, anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its much better for you than fish oil and well made product out there.</li>

            <li>I found taking this great product improved my health by at least 20% and is a good vegan alternative to fish oil products.</li>

            <li>only product on the market to get all the Omega ratios correct for good health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read &#x27;</li>
            <li>In my opinion this \\&quot;YES\\&quot; essential oil product is by far the best on the market today, although, it&#x27;s expensive, however, if you want the best you have to pay for it.</li>
            <li>I am not achy anymore and find it&#x27;s a great source of fatty acids.</li>
            <li>Buying in a larger quantity at a discount makes for a nice deal.</li>
            <li>We used Brian Peskin&#x27;s oils in the past and they&#x27;ve been the most effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a completely natural and vegetarian product which is easy on our digestive system.</li>
            <li>I seem to sleep better when I take this product regularly.</li>
            <li>Balanced, and therefore even more essential!</li>
            <li>I have been taking these supplements for years and notice that they help keep my skin look younger and more moisturized than when I don&#x27;t take them.</li>
            <li>We really like using these instead of fish oil.</li>
            <li>These pills were recommended to me by a friend who is really into holistic medicine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth doing the research and understanding why these should be used instead of regular fish oil.</li>
            <li>Wish this would become a cream or a shampoo that could be absorbed differently.</li>
            <li>They seem to do the job, and when you buy a 4-pack, it&#x27;s a better deal in the long run (especially if you take it every day).</li>
            <li>They were kept cool and dry on closet and yet stick together.</li>
            <li>I feel better, not sure of PEO&#x27;s credit, though.</li>
            <li>After hearing that Fish Oils are not good for you (not the kind of EFAs the body is supposed to get), I bought these.  </li>
            <li>You really do feel better after a few weeks, but it&#x27;s short lived when you quit taking them, and takes weeks to restart.</li>
            <li>product may be good but bought 3 bottles and all capsules stick together and half the bottle goes to waste.  </li>
            <li>am following new discovery.&lt;br</li>

            <li> This YES product is a combination of several EFA&#x27;s however label is cleverly designed so one doesn&#x27;t know the breakdown of each EFA so difficult to duplicate or replace with less expensive products, and a budget concern.</li>
            <li> It is difficult finding an Omega 3 which also included an Omega 6 that was from a plant, natural, and not produced from a fish.</li>

            <li> Easy to use product that follows the Brain Peskin protocol.</li>
            <li> My practitioners advised me to seek out these oils after experimenting with fish oils that made me ill.  I feel good when I take them and I believe that after several months, they are helping me to regain my health.  The science behind these products seems sound.</li>
            <li> I seem to sleep better when I take this product regularly.</li>
            <li> Great product! I always get what I want and very quickly.</li>
            <li> Had to send these back due to a reaction to the formulation.</li>
            <li> It is suppose to be replacing the Fish Oil craze and is heathier...&lt;br /&gt;without killing fish ! Competitive pricing too.</li>
            <li> These are just plain essential.  The best oils.  My body knows this.  I use these twice a day.  Love this supplement for these reasons.</li>
            <li> Balanced, and therefore even more essential!</li>
            <li> I like that these nutrients are obtained from seeds. It&#x27;s a completely natural and vegetarian product which is easy on our digestive system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd order of this product. Buying in a larger quantity at a discount makes for a nice deal. I can feel the difference in my health using Parent Essential Oils.  It does not seem like the serving size would be enough to make a difference but it does.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, great shipper</li>
            <li> Prescribed by my doctor 6 years ago.  It&#x27;s the best supplement I take. It helped to reduce my blood pressure and keeps it in check.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised.  Well protected packaging.</li>
            <li> YES PARENT ESSENTIAL OILS are the best on the market.  Good for overall health, heart and keeps the body happy!  I found taking this great product improved my health by at least 20% and is a good vegan alternative to fish oil products.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this \\&quot;YES\\&quot; essential oil product is by far the best on the market today, although, it&#x27;s expensive, however, if you want the best you have to pay for it. Amazon has the best prices and the best delivery.</li>
            <li> I was taking these from another company, and they were slightly more expensive. I tried these to save a few bucks, and I get the same result.</li>
            <li> We really like using these instead of fish oil. They were recommended to us by our doctor. There is no after taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched, and this seems to be the best deal for Parent Essential Oils.  It&#x27;s worth doing the research and understanding why these should be used instead of regular fish oil.</li>
            <li> Good stuff and works better than fish oil for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff changed my life. I am not achy anymore and find it&#x27;s a great source of fatty acids.</li>
            <li> Got on time, GREAT ítem</li>
            <li> These oils are great! We used Brian Peskin&#x27;s oils in the past and they&#x27;ve been the most effective. Appreciate his research on omegas.</li>
            <li> the best out there,  was researched by my doctor,  i travel alot and sometimes cant get all my omegas,  this guarantees i do.</li>
            <li> why take fish pills when u can be taking something organic?? Need i say anymore? organic is the only way to go!</li>
            <li> An excellent product at a great price. Recent studies show men taking fish oils have a higher incidence of prostrate cancer.&lt;br /&gt;Omega 6 plant based oils are superior! (see Brian Peskin&#x27;s book)</li>
            <li> You really do feel better after a few weeks, but it&#x27;s short lived when you quit taking them, and takes weeks to restart. So don&#x27;t start this unless you can keep going.</li>
            <li> noticed a difference when I started taking the product. My skin is definitely  softer. Need to take it longer to see more benefits</li>
            <li> product may be good but bought 3 bottles and all capsules stick together and half the bottle goes to waste.  They were kept cool and dry on closet and yet stick together.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t fish oils after reading Brian Peskin&#x27;s research on efas.  This is the only efa I use.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot.....an excellent source of Omega 6 &amp; 3.</li>
            <li> Convenient, qualit.y product</li>
            <li> This YES product is a combination of several EFA&#x27;s however label is cleverly designed so one doesn&#x27;t know the breakdown of each EFA so difficult to duplicate or replace with less expensive products, and a budget concern.</li>
            <li> It is difficult finding an Omega 3 which also included an Omega 6 that was from a plant, natural, and not produced from a fish. I use it faithfully and do recommend using this combination and/or product.</li>
            <li> I take these. For the energy Carol tx.</li>
            <li> I thought fish oil was beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;Now experts say &amp;#34;drop fish oil, take PEO&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I am following new discovery.&lt;br /&gt;PEO is not disgusting, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;And I feel better, not sure of PEO&#x27;s credit, though.</li>
            <li> GREAT HEALTH SUPPLEMENT</li>
            <li> A must for every woman. Give your brain some food. Wish this would become a cream or a shampoo that could be absorbed differently. Not a fan of horse pills</li>
            <li> Great product that everyone should take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only product on the market to get all the Omega ratios correct for good health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read &#x27;The Hidden Story of Cancer&amp;#34; to see why.</li>
            <li> Great Product and Great Price for a 4 pack of YES and something that is better than fish oils.&lt;br /&gt;I usually purchase single packs from [...]&lt;br /&gt;but found the 4 pack special and am a happy purchaser.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these supplements for years and notice that they help keep my skin look younger and more moisturized than when I don&#x27;t take them.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended  this product a couple of years ago. I believe it&#x27;s a factor in helping maintain my over all health. Getting low and will reorder soon.</li>
            <li> This is a great supplement to take and at a great price from what we were paying in the doctors office.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good idea to skip the fish oil and take this recommended product. Google Brian Peskin to read up on parent essential oils.</li>
            <li> These pills were recommended to me by a friend who is really into holistic medicine.  They&#x27;re job is to improve cardiac health over the long haul.  Are they doing that?  Can&#x27;t say as I have only been on them for over a month and have not had any blood work done.  Extra energy?  Puh-lease.  I&#x27;ll be more than happy to give 2 more stars after I&#x27;ve been testsed in a few months.</li>
            <li> Please do the research to see how great Parent oils are, and the outstanding company Yes; see if Parent oils are the answer for you they were for me.</li>
            <li> After hearing that Fish Oils are not good for you (not the kind of EFAs the body is supposed to get), I bought these.  They seem to do the job, and when you buy a 4-pack, it&#x27;s a better deal in the long run (especially if you take it every day).</li>
            <li> This is a great product that ive used for years.  Its much better for you than fish oil and well made product out there.</li>
            <li> Easy to swallow and no fishy burping afterwards.  This product recommended to me by a bio chemist, who uses it personally.  I will definitely continue using.</li>
            <li> Prescribed by my doctor. I take the prescribed dosage twiice daily&#x27;</li>
