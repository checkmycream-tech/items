            <li>Gotta Love It!!</li>
            <li>I just love this perfume, it arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Love it smells awesome</li>
            <li>When I wear it, people ask what it is, so it is a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is a good price point and does not overpower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is light and beautiful, and most times garners wonderful compliments....especially from the  Men  </li>
            <li>It has disappeared from department stores and I was thrilled to find it at Amazon</li>
            <li>This is a nice sexy scent.</li>
            <li>Neither has it available anymore, darn it!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite....</li>
            <li>But I had not been able to find it for quite awhile.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wear many perfumes/scents as they give me headaches, but this one doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>And I have to say that I like it on her. :)</li>
            <li>I love this sweet fragrance!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>When I wear it, I smell like sweet candy!  </li>
            <li>I have always used this product and love the fresh light scent.  </li>
            <li>The ones (had to buy two to get free shipping) from &lt;soap.com&gt;</li>
            <li>I was happy to have foud it for her one last time.</li>
            <li>This has been one of my favorite colognes for years and the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making it easy!</li>
            <li>Anyone who comes near me says I smell spectacular.  </li>
            <li>Ici is her favorite Eau De Toilette and the price on ebay is much better than anywhere else that it can be found locally.</li>
            <li>I like the fresh fragrance of Ici by Coty for Women.  </li>
            <li>The actual perfume was perfect, but the perfume box was extremely damaged which made me have to take it out to give it as a gift and the person did not know what it was.</li>
            <li>It was very easy and i will keep useing amazon for further ordering.</li>
            <li>Now, her granddaughters are borrowing it from her - a great floral scent, feminine, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>A little pricy but good luck</li>
            <li>I love the cute little bottle, too!</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thank you for giving me back the smell that I and my husband love so much!</li>
            <li>This is the only place I can find ICI which is my daughter&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li>I hope I&#x27;ll be able to find it in the future.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used it since the day I first had it given to me as a gift.  </li>
            <li>This product was exactly what i was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s nowhere near as strong or as lingering as it was when I bought it as a teen.</li>
            <li>I was very sad but happy that I could find it here!</li>
            <li>Walgreen&#x27;s and Meijer are the last stores to carry this product and most times is not stocked on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find in the stores, so it is nice to know that it still exists.  </li>
            <li>bottles are perhaps 2X larger than the one I got at Walmart, but the Parfum is worth finding.</li>
            <li>It was a fantastic buy, and I got a half dozen bottles in this</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the Eau de Toilette is not as strong a scent as what I originally had (must&#x27;ve been an Eau de Parfum), so I have to say I&#x27;m not as enamored with it.  </li>
            <li>We gave it to my 85 year old mother in law for Christmas</li>
            <li>I use it frequently.</li>
            <li>This is very hard to find in stores, love this product, the only i will use.</li>

            <li> Getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for over 20 years and it is getting harder and harder to find retail --</li>
            <li> They stopped selling this at my usual store, and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The Parfum was $16 at Walmart (and before that, I got it for even less at a discount grocery store).  </li>
            <li> There are little particles floating in the bottle.</li>
            <li> but I like to use this to make the expensive stuff last longer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find anymore!</li>
            <li> Very subtle fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I was frantic until I found it here.  </li>
            <li> I have expensive perfume</li>
            <li> Disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> and she loves it and excepts it for a gift and is disappointed  when she doesn&#x27;t get a bottle.</li>

            <li> This is a nice sexy scent. Getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cologne!!!!!</li>
            <li> not over powering. bought this years ago for myself and always got compliments. We gave it to my 85 year old mother in law for Christmas and she loves it and excepts it for a gift and is disappointed  when she doesn&#x27;t get a bottle. She says she gets compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorite colognes for years and the price is very reasonable.  I use it frequently.</li>
            <li> The package arrived the day after I ordered it....how did they do that??  Unfortunately, the Eau de Toilette is not as strong a scent as what I originally had (must&#x27;ve been an Eau de Parfum), so I have to say I&#x27;m not as enamored with it.  The Parfum was $16 at Walmart (and before that, I got it for even less at a discount grocery store).  Neither has it available anymore, darn it!  The ones (had to buy two to get free shipping) from &lt;soap.com&gt; (via Amazon) were $23 each....bottles are perhaps 2X larger than the one I got at Walmart, but the Parfum is worth finding.</li>
