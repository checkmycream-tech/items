            <li>Great quality :)</li>
            <li>i like the medal ones better.</li>
            <li>These arrived quickly and just as described, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>I have so many that I am more willing to dispose as necessary.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase them again!</li>
            <li>I might be able to deal with the length, but I do expect an orange stick worth its salt to have one end be beveled with a flat (not pointy) end.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the price is super high for this item.</li>
            <li>Kinda glad they&#x27;re not to long.</li>
            <li>It is far better to use the wooden cuticle pushers than the metal in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll just file the tips down to get more use out of them.</li>
            <li>I have trouble finding these at local shops anymore, but they&#x27;ve long been a favorite as a gently way to push back my cuticles.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>

            <li> The quality is indistinguishable from the name-brand ones, and these are far less expensive.</li>

            <li> These are a God send.  It is far better to use the wooden cuticle pushers than the metal in my opinion.  The skin responds differently.  I have so many that I am more willing to dispose as necessary.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll just file the tips down to get more use out of them.</li>
            <li> You get a big bundle, as in the picture. These will last forever for me.</li>
            <li> These sticks are a perfect size...much easier to use than the longer ones. They are also of good quality.</li>
            <li> not a fan of the orange wood stick. i like the medal ones better. does the job though.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed!! Great quality :)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to find these in stores. Perfect for what I needed</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding these at local shops anymore, but they&#x27;ve long been a favorite as a gently way to push back my cuticles. These arrived quickly and just as described, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Looking at all the local beauty supplies and I&#x27;ve been to plenty being a nail tech student the price is super high for this item.</li>
            <li> I use these for crafts as well as for my nails. They work well without splintering.</li>
            <li> These are short and pointy on both ends. I might be able to deal with the length, but I do expect an orange stick worth its salt to have one end be beveled with a flat (not pointy) end.&lt;br /&gt;I am returning these.</li>
            <li> Too long. In description said they were 3inches long, but were 4 1/2.</li>
            <li> I buy these to give away with Jamberry samples and for use at parties. The quality is indistinguishable from the name-brand ones, and these are far less expensive. I will certainly purchase them again!</li>
            <li> Awesome they have the right size to work with and the quality is good .</li>
            <li> Work great! Kinda glad they&#x27;re not to long.</li>
