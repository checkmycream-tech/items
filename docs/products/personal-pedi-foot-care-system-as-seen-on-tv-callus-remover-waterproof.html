            <li>It was ok until plastic pieces broke while I was using it.  </li>
            <li>works much better.  </li>
            <li>Thought this was going to be much better than it is.</li>
            <li>okay if you just need a touch up, but not for anything more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works better</li>
            <li>The reason I rated 4 stars was because I would like for it to have more power.  </li>
            <li>I was able to purchase at a discount to test and review.</li>
            <li>works well,it would be better if i could plug it in,,</li>
            <li>Loved it - has helped me keep my feet much prettier!</li>
            <li>This product works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.. not quite as strong as I thought,  if you give even slightest pressure against your foot the roller head will stop.</li>
            <li>Loved it so much i bought one for a friend.</li>
            <li>Pedi foot care system is easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you want to make sure that your feet are clean.</li>
            <li>It is easy to change from the buffering to the polishing head.</li>
            <li>box is nice and full of details and a full description.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>Husband says work fine</li>
            <li>foor is as smooth as my 3 month baby...</li>
            <li>/&gt;i wish they have something like that for the rest of the body .. to make as smooth as a baby</li>
            <li>Does a great job on getting the dry skin off</li>
            <li>I wish that it would of come with batteries but other than that this product is great</li>
            <li>Very impressed with this little device, I must admit, even if it is made in China (haha).</li>
            <li>love that this is not super loud, and that it is waterproof!&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to use and provides great results!&lt;br /&gt;Beats the cost and aggravation of getting a pedicure!&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to receive this at a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Make sure you&#x27;re using brand new batteries.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate and works very well.</li>
            <li>the loose skin is gone and my feet have not felt this good in&lt;br /&gt;Decades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing and feeling a nice difference each day as I remove more dead skin.  </li>
            <li>After using the Personal Pedi, and the Buffer, my feet were smooth and sexy.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it ...&lt;</li>
            <li>I rarely attend my feet</li>
            <li>Other than those two cons, this system works great in getting rid of your callouses and is more effective and less work than using a normal pumice stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The device broke the first day when I try putting on batteries.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good though, and the sander attachment seems to last a fairly long time.</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries are easy enough to install.</li>
            <li>The system uses two AA batteries and the machine gets a little warm the longer you use it.</li>
            <li>so go ahead and put them in and get ready to have smoother feet</li>
            <li>To me, this works very well.  </li>
            <li>Once you determine how much pressure you can use, it will become habit and you will have no problem.</li>
            <li>If you apply too much pressure, it automatically stops spinning so you don&#x27;t accidentally hurt yourself .To</li>
            <li>With that said, this is so much easier and faster than using a pumice stone..</li>
            <li>works just as advertized and shipping was fast</li>
            <li>Bought it for my wife and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have rough or big calluses,so this little gadget is great just to keep my heels smooth.</li>
            <li>I prefer to sit down after a shower and use it while my skin is very moist and I can better see what I am doing vs. using in the shower or bath.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish these roller replacements were cheaper, and that&#x27;s probably the main qualm I have with this product.</li>
            <li>With fresh batteries installed, this little gem is worth its weight in gold!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My feet love the removal of dead skin and reduction of callous thickness.</li>
            <li>I usually do not write reviews but had to on this product.  </li>
            <li>I had to stop it multiple times because it became too hot on my feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is kind of hard to get it to snap back together after adding batteries.  </li>
            <li>The Personal Pedi Foot Care System by EMSON makes removing your heel callouses so much easier.</li>
            <li>but when i do I use a pumice stone and scrub and scrub until my feet feel soft .In</li>
            <li>and i wish i could have a faster way to get soft feet and this callus remover does that.</li>
            <li>Gently rotate back and forth or side to side on the area you want for 2-3 seconds.</li>
            <li>This is a very ineffective personal pedi.  </li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure how long these rollers will last until you have to replace them, but after the third use, the sanding roller seems a little less effective.</li>
            <li>I first tried it on dry skin and that works</li>
            <li>Make sure you have plenty of AAA batteries on hand though, because if you use it everyday, or you are sharing it with others in your household, the batteries will frequently need changed--possibly as much as every few days.</li>
            <li>Lightly run over your hard spots and if it still doesn&#x27;t work do it when you get out of the bath/shower.</li>
            <li>People need to be aware that you can&#x27;t put it tight against the skin.  </li>
            <li>The roller just removes the skin and it is not painful or hard to use.</li>

            <li> The roller just removes the skin and it is not painful or hard to use.</li>
            <li> Not great but not bad enough for me to return.</li>
            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Before I started using the Personal Pedi, my feet were rough, dry, cracking, and just gross.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it gets so dry and cracked, they start ripping, peeling, and bleeding.</li>
            <li> Waterproof works by rotating and filing away at your heel, and can work either if your feet are dry or wet.</li>
            <li> My feet always get very dry and cracked and I am now using this Pedi food care system.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> The harder the callus the longer this will take.</li>
            <li> Not happy though how fast the rollers</li>
            <li> No more unsightly cracked white skin!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a black rubber band type thing that goes around the edge to seal it in</li>
            <li> This makes a tight seal if you&#x27;re using in the shower or bath.  </li>
            <li> so I could start wearing sandals again without feeling ashamed of my feet, but the pumice stones take a lot of strength and work trying to sand off all the dead skin off my feet.</li>
            <li> It was a bit messy but if you do it over a trashcan or in the shower, it minimizes the mess.th.</li>
            <li> Had my doubts because of having bought a few things in the past.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Product came cut open and BROKEN!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You use the wheel to slowly take down callouses and leave behind smoother</li>
            <li> It also does not take hardly any pressure to correctly use it.</li>
            <li> Do not press hard.</li>
            <li> I am preventing the thick build-up of skin that causes cracking by using this after a shower when my skin is softer.  </li>
            <li> I have really bad and deep callouses on the heel of my both my feet.</li>
            <li> sorta Dumb ... wifey used it once or twice.  </li>
            <li> summer the feet look so dry and bad</li>
            <li> Poor this item does not work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen bad reviews because people hold it to tightly to the skin</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Horrible product, does not have enough power to do the job.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Loved it - has helped me keep my feet much prettier!</li>
            <li> It was for my Husband, he loves  it.</li>
            <li> The device broke the first day when I try putting on batteries.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have rough or big calluses,so this little gadget is great just to keep my heels smooth.</li>
            <li> sorta Dumb ... wifey used it once or twice.  meh</li>
            <li> This is the best product EVER!!!!  I usually do not write reviews but had to on this product.  Left my feet smoother than when I leave the salon.</li>
            <li> I just received this item in the mail today (ordered off of Choxi) and immediately started using it. Before I started using the Personal Pedi, my feet were rough, dry, cracking, and just gross. After using the Personal Pedi, and the Buffer, my feet were smooth and sexy. I freaking LOVE this contraption.&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe about this product is that it seems to overheat. I had to stop it multiple times because it became too hot on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> it was a gift and they love it.</li>
            <li> With fresh batteries installed, this little gem is worth its weight in gold! Loving being pampered too!</li>
            <li> My feet have been needing this!  It&#x27;s summer and I was getting embarrassed by the state of my heels. My feet always get very dry and cracked and I am now using this Pedi food care system. I&#x27;m seeing and feeling a nice difference each day as I remove more dead skin.  I am preventing the thick build-up of skin that causes cracking by using this after a shower when my skin is softer.  It&#x27;s more effective this way I&#x27;ve seen.  I first tried it on dry skin and that works too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries are easy enough to install. There&#x27;s a black rubber band type thing that goes around the edge to seal it in and then you twist the end to open and shut for batteries.  This makes a tight seal if you&#x27;re using in the shower or bath.  I prefer to sit down after a shower and use it while my skin is very moist and I can better see what I am doing vs. using in the shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shop a lot on Amazon and love health and beauty products, so I was thrilled to receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  I will continue using this and I like the smoother feel of my heels and feet.  It&#x27;s like a mini belt sander for sure.  The roller just removes the skin and it is not painful or hard to use.</li>

I&#x27;ve tried using various pumice stones to help me get rid of the callouses so I could start wearing sandals again without feeling ashamed of my feet, but the pumice stones take a lot of strength and work trying to sand off all the dead skin off my feet. The Personal Pedi Foot Care System by EMSON makes removing your heel callouses so much easier. The sanding roller actually works and after just using it once, I could already see the vast improvement of the look of my heels! No more unsightly cracked white skin! The system uses two AA batteries and the machine gets a little warm the longer you use it. I&#x27;m not quite sure how long these rollers will last until you have to replace them, but after the third use, the sanding roller seems a little less effective. I wish these roller replacements were cheaper, and that&#x27;s probably the main qualm I have with this product. Purchasing replacement rollers could get pricey. I would also prefer the product use an rechargeable adapter rather than batteries. That way, you could recharge your machine using an outlet rather than having to replace the batteries so often. Other than those two cons, this system works great in getting rid of your callouses and is more effective and less work than using a normal pumice stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for testing purposes in order to give my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why y&#x27;all say it don&#x27;t work or it stops when you press it. Make sure you&#x27;re using brand new batteries. It also does not take hardly any pressure to correctly use it. Lightly run over your hard spots and if it still doesn&#x27;t work do it when you get out of the bath/shower. If it still doesn&#x27;t work there is a user error!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected. The roller head does not last. Had to replace the head after 2 uses. Disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Great product; takes feet to a wonderful soft feel and makes them look &amp;#34;almost new&amp;#34;. Also, this item is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> works as it says on tv</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.. not quite as strong as I thought,  if you give even slightest pressure against your foot the roller head will stop.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;The box is nice and full of details and a full description.&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect for gift giving!&lt;br /&gt;Give your feet the treatment they deserve!&lt;br /&gt;This Pedi foot care system is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It needs batteries so go ahead and put them in and get ready to have smoother feet soon!&lt;br /&gt;You use the wheel to slowly take down callouses and leave behind smoother feet.&lt;br /&gt;I love that this is not super loud, and that it is waterproof!&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to use and provides great results!&lt;br /&gt;Beats the cost and aggravation of getting a pedicure!&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to receive this at a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing ... it took me 15 minutes on each foot .. but it was worth it ...&lt;br /&gt;my foor is as smooth as my 3 month baby...&lt;br /&gt;i wish they have something like that for the rest of the body .. to make as smooth as a baby</li>
            <li> It was ok until plastic pieces broke while I was using it.  I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this item</li>
            <li> To me, this works very well.  I have another brand I used before getting this one and the Personal Pedi Foot Care System works much better.  People need to be aware that you can&#x27;t put it tight against the skin.  I&#x27;ve seen bad reviews because people hold it to tightly to the skin and they say it doesn&#x27;t spin.  You need to experiment with it.  Once you determine how much pressure you can use, it will become habit and you will have no problem.</li>
            <li> I am so very impressed with this product...I rarely attend my feet but when i do I use a pumice stone and scrub and scrub until my feet feel soft .In summer the feet look so dry and bad and i wish i could have a faster way to get soft feet and this callus remover does that. Personal Pedi Foot Care System AS SEEN ON TV Callus Remover, Waterproof works by rotating and filing away at your heel, and can work either if your feet are dry or wet. If you apply too much pressure, it automatically stops spinning so you don&#x27;t accidentally hurt yourself .To use the callus remover you want to make sure that your feet are clean. Gently rotate back and forth or side to side on the area you want for 2-3 seconds. Do not press hard. Stop and check to see if you have the smoothness you desire. Repeat until you get the results you want. The harder the callus the longer this will take. With that said, this is so much easier and faster than using a pumice stone.. I tried this before and after a shower and it worked great. It was a bit messy but if you do it over a trashcan or in the shower, it minimizes the mess.th.For faster remover ,apply a callus removing cream or gel and then use this callus remover after that has been on the feet for about 5 minutes.I use it after shower as its water proof. only reason i am giving 4 is because i wish it has a rechargeable batteries  .I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this little device, I must admit, even if it is made in China (haha). Works pretty good though, and the sander attachment seems to last a fairly long time. Make sure you have plenty of AAA batteries on hand though, because if you use it everyday, or you are sharing it with others in your household, the batteries will frequently need changed--possibly as much as every few days.</li>
            <li> Had my doubts because of having bought a few things in the past.&lt;br /&gt;But this one does what it says it will. My feet have.never been like&lt;br /&gt;This.all the loose skin is gone and my feet have not felt this good in&lt;br /&gt;Decades.</li>
            <li> Loved it so much i bought one for a friend.</li>
            <li> Thought this was going to be much better than it is. Is not the As Seen On TV one like I read. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Horrible product, does not have enough power to do the job.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift. After about 2 weeks,this item didn&#x27;t work, it seamstres seems it was defective from the manufacturer.There was no connection between the battery and the connectors in the area where you  place the battery.</li>
            <li> This is a very ineffective personal pedi.  Put any amount of pressure on it and it stops the roller in its track.  It would take hours to deal with calluses.  So, it works okay if you just need a touch up, but not for anything more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample product from EMSON.</li>
            <li> Does a great job on getting the dry skin off</li>
            <li> Horrible. Product came cut open and BROKEN! How can I get a refund?</li>
            <li> works just as advertized and shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Works better I thought it would</li>
            <li> Excellent. Not happy though how fast the rollers</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good.  It is easy to change from the buffering to the polishing head. It is kind of hard to get it to snap back together after adding batteries.  The reason is it&#x27;s waterproof and that type of seal is needed to ensure that water doesn&#x27;t get in the batteries.  The reason I rated 4 stars was because I would like for it to have more power.  It does work and my feet are smoother.  I would recommend.  I was able to purchase at a discount to test and review.</li>
            <li> Had to take batteries out for unit to turn off.</li>
            <li> works well,it would be better if i could plug it in,,</li>
            <li> Poor this item does not work Amazon have refused my request to pick this item up</li>
            <li> Very happy with it. Bought it for my wife and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Its wasnt as good as it said it was</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised. Easy to operate and works very well.</li>
            <li> I wish that it would of come with batteries but other than that this product is great</li>
            <li> It is just &amp;#34;0k&amp;#34;.  Not great but not bad enough for me to return.</li>
