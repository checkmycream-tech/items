            <li>I&#x27;ll happily give 5 stars for how much I enjoy using this product and the wonderful customer service I received.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product, it&#x27;s done a great job of exfoliating my skin and removing all makeup and dirt every time I use it.</li>
            <li>It does a good job cleaning my face and body</li>
            <li>This is a really good produce</li>
            <li>I gave this face brush about 6 months of use before commenting, as I wanted to provide a thorough and fair review.</li>
            <li>good for the money.</li>
            <li>My skin never looked and felt so good.</li>
            <li>Face and body brushes feel good too.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist said  exfoliation(within reason) was good.</li>
            <li>Thank you for a good product.</li>
            <li>I loved the way it cleaned my face, and I loved the body brush (I never had a chance to use the pumice stone).</li>
            <li>We all know that a scrub is good for the face.  </li>
            <li>It needs a good scrub too.  </li>
            <li>Good tool.  </li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>and it does a good job at removing dirt and oil.</li>
            <li>The Olay has a good \\&quot;swirl\\&quot; to it; but this one you can feel the power.  </li>
            <li>We have purchased the brush for two teenagers and both have had good results.</li>
            <li>I have always loved Sephora and truly trust all of the products they sell.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t  expecting miracles or to look 20 again, but I feel good about my skin now.</li>
            <li>and it felt so good</li>
            <li>I loved, loved, loved this product.</li>
            <li>It feels wonderful to clean my skin with the brushes and my feet look amazing after using the pumice stone.</li>
            <li>Received it before delivery date and am very pleased with it</li>
            <li>It works great, and I do feel like my face is cleaner and more responsive to the medications that I apply.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with both the product and the results I&#x27;ve seen on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushes rotate nicely and feel so good on the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The included interchangeable brush heads are very nice and seem appropriate for intended usages.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>First got this a couple months ago and it worked great!</li>
            <li>Oh I Love it!</li>
            <li>I get the best results by wetting my face with fairly hot water, smearing a liberal amount of acne scrub all over my face and throat (like a mask), and then using the brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>I love my Pro Skin Care System from ToiletTree!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The first time I received it, I used it for about a week with wonderful results, but it started shutting off on its own</li>
            <li>This unit is amazing for its price.</li>
            <li>So amazing since I had not even had a chance to return the one to Amazon yet.</li>
            <li>Really amazing in this day &amp; age.</li>
            <li>: 1) use with things don&#x27;t bubble a lot on its own (soap etc) 2)</li>
            <li>That being said, here is my honest opinion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The waterproof feature has proven effective</li>
            <li>I love this thing, and receiving truly great customer service from ToiletTree has just made me want to recommend it even more.</li>
            <li>and I love how good it cleans</li>
            <li>What a nice addition to your product line.</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast, I have nothing but great things to say about this product!</li>
            <li>My wife requested as part of her own cleansing regime.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure they will work as good as the face brush.</li>
            <li>and I wanted a brush that could be used with my own cleansers</li>
            <li>it would have lasted longer because I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using apricot scrub for years and this has been a good alternative as it will save me money and works better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I hope this review helps those looking for good exfoliation without the harshness of most exfoliating cleansers.  </li>
            <li>However, this one is very inexpensive and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very happy with the results so far!  </li>
            <li>Her skin is smooth and bright now.</li>
            <li>but surprisingly this gadget worked so well to clean my face.</li>
            <li>Washing your face with an exfoliating face wash is great, but not as consistent of an exfoliation as you&#x27;ll get with this system.</li>
            <li>Aside from that, it works beautifully, and I really like the product.</li>
            <li>Love the versatility.</li>
            <li>I love that its WATER PROOF, so I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the pumice stone yet, but I&#x27;ll be sure to do so soon.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>anyways, love it love it.</li>
            <li>I have the olay one which was okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad that I chose this instead of spending hundreds of dollars on a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial brush that I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product several months ago for myself and was so impressed with it that I purchased another one as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>I have been so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>My breakouts are reduced, my persistent blackheads are almost gone, I haven&#x27;t had any peeling, and I feel better about my skin than I have in</li>
            <li>I have used it twice daily since it arrived and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I look forward to more improvements in my skin over time.</li>
            <li>I was able to extract the top batteries.</li>
            <li>What I saved on this model, I was able to splurge on my cleanser and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Guess it&#x27;s ok for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li>Love this product for 2 reasons: 1.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It is more than I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad it spins instead of vibrates.&lt;br</li>
            <li>: The item arrived in tip top condition and in a timely manner to an APO/FPO area.</li>
            <li>I dare to say it&#x27;s much better than Clarisonic</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the variety of attachments.</li>
            <li>It works just as described and includes more brush options for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin look.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad to have found</li>
            <li>and I love the results.  </li>
            <li>So many of the cleansing brushes have pre-moistened pads</li>
            <li>It magically started working for a while</li>
            <li>I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Love this product and this company.  </li>
            <li>I find that any face cream soaks in much better and my skin is feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>The product is great, but I really would expect it to work for longer than a month.</li>
            <li>If I have to spend $35 every month, then I am better off paying the money for the Clarisonic that lasts (all of my friends that have</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to use in the shower.</li>
            <li>Also, the customer service is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product as an upgrade to my Olay system; and while I was quite satisfied with my Olay system, this one exceeded my expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love the additional brushes for the body and feet.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love that it is waterproof so I can take it in the shower with me.</li>
            <li>I think it works just as well as the clarisonic and at a better price.</li>
            <li>I dare say my feel even look more youthful.</li>
            <li>I use this once a day and have really found it to be a great product.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not for acne just for better cleansing(.</li>
            <li>Price is great, shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>love this product</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that you have to change out the batteries but in all its wonderful.</li>
            <li>, saved me a lot of money I can use on more beauty products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can use on more beauty products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this skin care system.</li>
            <li>I love how I&#x27;ve reduced how much cleanser I need as the speedy rotating brush lathers very nicely.</li>
            <li>I have used it with good results and have noticed an improvement in my skin tone and complexion when I am able to use it consistently.  </li>
            <li>Now that I have a new one, it had been giving me great results.  </li>
            <li>This product is great - my face feels so soft!</li>
            <li>If you have acne or the occasional breakout, this is very good at clearing your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love how soft and effective this product is!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worked great for me so far.</li>
            <li>She too loved it so much that my daughter (her Mother) purchased one for herself.</li>
            <li>It is a good product at a very affordable price.  </li>
            <li>This system, from ToiletTree, had good reviews and the price was quite reasonable.</li>
            <li>It appears to be of good quality and my skin feels very smooth and soft after using it.</li>
            <li>and I have increased my stars to 4 instead of 3 due to excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>A Zogan massage later and my face is good to go!</li>
            <li>There was no way I was going to spend over $100 on one, so I researched around amazon and other websites to determine what the best product would be.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Heads change easily.</li>
            <li>It suds up micely and gives a clean and refreshing felling and look.</li>
            <li>love it in the shower  works great and have had no problems at all in the last 2 months.</li>
            <li>If you put a soap that foams up easily it will fling everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I have updated my rating form a 2-star to 5-star; I love the product, and the customer service itself is enough to win my business over &amp; over.</li>
            <li>It was easy to put in the batteries that it thankfully came with.</li>
            <li>I use it with a very mild non-sudsing cleanser every morning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Whenever my hormones fluctuate and I can feel a breakout coming on or see a pimple, I always use a brush to get in the pores and it goes away very quickly.</li>
            <li>The rotation is strong and my batteries lasted for about 3 months, using it twice a day.</li>
            <li>This product has strong rotations of the brush</li>
            <li>I thought it was too big at first, but its perfect.</li>
            <li>the product works just fine now.  </li>
            <li>(Luckily my husband fell in love with me anyway - acne and all).  </li>
            <li>it was fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to spend more money and get a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Love the facial and body exfoliators and the pumice attachment is great for keeping your feet nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this facial cleanser and would buy it again.  </li>
            <li>then another one because I liked it so much.  </li>
            <li>I liked the way the company handled my situation so much that I noticed on the product info sheet that they also made a skin care system.  </li>
            <li>The facial brush works great and is just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>It arrived packaged great and in a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy using this with my nightly cleansing routine.</li>
            <li>It was easy to clean the brushes.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise a great product which I will continue to use daily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t dread looking in the mirror in the morning, and I enjoy using it every night or morning.  </li>
            <li>got to brushing my face with a light PH balanced foaming cleanser (Alpha Hydrox foaming cleanser if you would like to know)</li>
            <li>Quality, ease of use, and price are great but needs a lower speed to use daily.</li>
            <li>I wish I had found this great tool earlier!</li>
            <li>We really like the fact that it is shower safe and we have ours hanging in the shower readily available!</li>
            <li>The professional skin care system by ToiletTree is a good product for the price.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve decided that I will probably never find a product as good as the old one I had.</li>
            <li>I have tried the cheaper olay brand and this is definitely far superior to that junk.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my new ToiletTree face brush.  </li>
            <li>My skin visibly looked more fresh, clean and brighter than before.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I found another brush that is quickly helping to repair the damage (though not the embarrassment) that this brush caused while still using my favorite facewash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily, I found another brush that is quickly helping to repair the damage (though not the embarrassment) that this brush caused while still using my favorite facewash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super easy to use</li>
            <li>I just got mine today and was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>I bought it any way and so far I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>
            <li>many others, I was interested in a Clarisonic (Mia or Mia 2) but just could not justify spending the money.  </li>
            <li>And as a bonus, it has reduced my redness significantly.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>and i feel clean and silky</li>
            <li>MUST clean the brushes after use.  </li>
            <li>I have clean face now</li>
            <li>When I use it, about once a week, it makes my face feel really clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased to be able to review the Professional Skin Care System by ToiletTree.  </li>
            <li>To clean it, I touch it on a bar of soap while it is rotating, then hold it on my palm to let the soap scrub between the bristle, then rinse it in water.  </li>
            <li>It rinses clean if I do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so this is getting my face clean and leaves my skin feeling</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen my flakey dry patches greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>This is the third skin care system that I have tried and it is by far the best one.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin feeling clean and freah.</li>
            <li>bristles are very soft and effective.</li>
            <li>It works very well, your skin will feel very smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>When I first opened it, I used it on a facial bar; it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>The batteries work for a long time, perfect size, soft brush, might buy another just in case this one ever breaks.</li>
            <li>Is it really true?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how super clean one&#x27;s face becomes after using it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace a battery operated  facial brush that I bought many, many years ago that is no longer available.</li>
            <li>I would have given this the full 5 stars</li>
            <li>(I think) and it still has full battery charge.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates &amp; prepares my skin to absorb my vitamin c serum &amp; moisturizer more readily.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much, I bought one to send to my daughter.</li>
            <li>A Zogan massage later and my face is good to go!oney</li>
            <li>Cool.</li>
            <li>When I got home, I did some research on some more reasonably priced alternatives.</li>
            <li>However, as others here have stated, the customer service was outstanding and agreed to ship me a new one, free of charge, without hassle.</li>
            <li>cleanser is great and cleans my face extremely well.</li>
            <li>The other attachments for the body and feet are great.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I am so happy with this product.</li>
            <li>It is a nice exfoliator but still gentle with the gentle brush.  </li>
            <li>I love how it comes with many different attachments.</li>
            <li>If you have any problems, they are super responsive and accommodating.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased, especially since they contacted me before I even had a chance to contact them or return the item to Amazon.</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied with this cleaner.</li>
            <li>longer life span seems reasonable against any superior cleaning action that MIGHT go with the percussion action, and am satisfied thinking thusly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tools have held up beautifully and the product was received much faster than expected.</li>
            <li>Good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>The large body brush has been great on my dry legs.</li>
            <li>Ive heard many mixed reviews on this product and how it breaks easily.</li>
            <li>Fits in your hand comfortably and cery very to use.</li>
            <li>I use the soft brush to cleanse my face twice a day, and it exfoliates perfectly without being harsh or abrasive.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin like me, one run through with the brush is more than plenty.  </li>
            <li>The different brushes are nice.</li>
            <li>The different colors are nice too.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>, even the batteries rarely need to be replaced.</li>
            <li>I love the spinning action on it</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>and it is well worth the affordable price.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t perfect - but it is MUCH improved, and I only wish this tool had been around when I was a teenager and in my younger, dating years.  </li>
            <li>I use the soft face brush twice a day and have seen a great improvement in my pores and overall skin clarity.</li>
            <li>I also love that my heels are soft when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth it</li>
            <li>and I have used all of the adapters so far and love them all.</li>
            <li>but it is larger than that and fits nicely in my hand.</li>
            <li>I feel it gives my face a better overall clean.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise, I felt and saw a difference right away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to say what I love the most about it, because it all adds up to one amazing product that leaves the skin on my face baby soft.  </li>
            <li>The large one is a little harder perfect for the body and smaller ones are more gentle and soft great for the face.</li>
            <li>and I cannot see spending more when you get more bang for your buck from this sweet little beauty!</li>
            <li>(be sure to have something on hand to open the battery compartment, I used nail clippers and it was quick)</li>
            <li>I have even tried it myself and must admit this is pretty powerful for a battery</li>
            <li>I emailed ToiletTree and they sent me a new one for free.</li>
            <li>Using the product once a day is keeping my skin bright and healthy looking and helping to reduce dry skin caused by the dry, winter air.</li>
            <li>Me - Chinese, fair and sensitive skin, oily T-Zone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very gentle on skin</li>
            <li>Wish you made a plugin, but so far the batteries have been fine.</li>
            <li>I did a little research in finding a good face scrubbing product for my price range, and this caught my eye.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to purchase the ToiletTree face brush given its many positive reviews and great price, especially when compared to other much more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>Whereas most facial brushes are water resistant.</li>
            <li>My teenage girls love it as well.</li>
            <li>In fact ended up ordering another for a family member after they saw it and were interested.</li>
            <li>Just wish there were better storage for the different sized cleaners.</li>
            <li>Met my expectations and the product is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>My skin is not only improving, but I have a glow and clarity that is better than before I went on the ToiletTree brush detour.</li>
            <li>My skin is not only improving, but I have a glow and clarity that is better than before I went on the ToiletTree brush detour.</li>
            <li>I considered the cleanser somewhat gentle since I only experienced occasional dryness.  </li>
            <li>doing the job, just it only have one speed power, ok for the first time user.will</li>
            <li>The first problem I had was that after about 6 months, the brush would not turn on or off sometimes.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more products from this company.</li>
            <li>It would have helped my skin so much!  </li>
            <li>First review:  </li>
            <li>My first experience with this company was with their Water Pik.  </li>
            <li>The first one died, I called and was promply sent another one.  </li>
            <li>It takes 4 batteries, so try not to use it too fast!</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>I guess I will always be looking for and expecting the same as the brush I&#x27;ve had for many years</li>
            <li>Its very affordable too!</li>
            <li>When finished just rinse well and apply your moisturizer, this form of exfoliation will leave your skin fresh glowing and ready to accept your moisturizer as it will absorb easier.</li>
            <li>I got it in blue and love it.</li>
            <li>I initially bought the system because of all of the reviews and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a larger brush to use on your body.  </li>
            <li>Initially, made by skin \\&quot;feel\\&quot; more clean and soft than it did with hand washing</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my Toilet Tree Professional Care System.</li>
            <li>Though this is my first time using anything like this, my guess is it&#x27;s just as good as the more expensive models out there.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and clean after using it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I decided on toilet tree, and after a week I love it.</li>
            <li>Gives your face a good deep scrub that regular face wash just can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very affordable product compared to similar products on the market (some are $100 or more).  </li>
            <li>Because of their favorable reviews I also purchased this product with positive results.  </li>
            <li>There were many days where I wished I didn&#x27;t have to go into my high exposure management role at work because I was embarrased for my team and co-workers to see my skin and my obvious attempts to hide the blemishes on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once the outer layer of dry skin has been removed with the brush, my skin absorbs acne medicine, serum, and moisturizer so much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having a lot of problems with dry skin this winter, but I&#x27;m allergic to many OTC scrubs.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t as dry and it does look more radiant.</li>
            <li>Felt like the motor was strong and it seemed like it was gonna last for quite some time.</li>
            <li>My initial AA batteries have been in for a month and are still going strong.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and really cleans deep into the pores.  </li>
            <li>Comes with a large brush and a gentle pumice stone.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used a better one in which to compare it to, but it is definitely strong enough without being too rough on the skin.</li>
            <li>it can really happen.</li>
            <li>Fast, efficient service from Toilettree Products.  </li>
            <li>the brushes are gentle to the skin</li>
            <li>I wish they had some way of storing the system better after use rather than replacing the wet attachments in the plastic pre-formed packaging...</li>
            <li>&quot; so to speak, and I really regret doing so.</li>
            <li>&quot; so to speak, and I really regret doing so.</li>
            <li>I have also dropped it in the shower a couple times and it seems to be very durable.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe it took me my whole life until now to find a product that did something for my blackheads.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>but the batteries that wnt into the scrubber were absolutely wedged in.  </li>
            <li>The rotation is gentle, and yet it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It can really give power</li>
            <li>It came today and I&#x27;ve used it twice, once on my face, once on my whole body.</li>
            <li>Product works really well.</li>
            <li>I really like the results.</li>
            <li>It performs better than expected</li>
            <li>It has a very affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>The company seems very committed to customer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Also, watch out for when it spins too fast--</li>
            <li>What I really like is that you can use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>My skin tends to get very oily which clogs my pores</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the pumice stone does not work very well.</li>
            <li>so much, I will probably by another just to keep in the shower</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The brush cleans my face so well, and it is left light and airy.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t think a month in, a couple times a week, should show that much wear and tear.</li>
            <li>It just does not seem to snap in as well as the brushes, or maybe I am applying too much pressure during use.</li>
            <li>This one I really feel does that.</li>
            <li>but it turns out this busy geek Mommy does care more than she thought about such things!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love the deep but not harsh cleansing I get from the softest face attachment.</li>
            <li>I replaced the batteries with brand new ones, turned it on, and the motor pretty much turned on and then gradually died within seconds.</li>
            <li>Easy to use; several types of brushes for different needs are quickly switched out.</li>
            <li>I have a very thick, ethnic skin so the medium brush works best for me because my skin is not sensitive by any means.</li>
            <li>The choice of less and more firm facial brush heads is very nice.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the medium brush feels too hard on my sensitive skin, so the soft brush is perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li>My no fail test of facial brushes is that if I am able to press down hard on the brush with my hand and it doesn&#x27;t stop, then it is powerful enough and will do a great job.</li>
            <li>My facial skin can handle a more coarse brush; and I much prefer that to a softer one.  </li>
            <li>The directions are short and sweet.</li>
            <li>The only thing that kept it from receiving a full five stars is the fact that the pumice stone will often fall out of the handle when I move it away from my skin after use.</li>
            <li>It leaves me a little pink for 15 minutes or so, so plan for that, but it feels great and has eliminated my need for moisturizer (I may still need it in the winter, though - we&#x27;ll see).</li>
            <li>I tried it &amp; live it!</li>
            <li>Great costumer service (very rare),the guy gave me a solution to the problem but sadly the battery didn&#x27;t come out</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s contemplating getting her own in pink (mine is blue).</li>
            <li>and I feel like I am getting more out of the facial cleanser when I use the facial brush with it.</li>
            <li>I have used my facial brush once a day for several months now &amp; love the results.  </li>
            <li>It really helps me stay clear now!</li>
            <li>I really like the Professional Skin Care System!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product if you are looking for a skin care system.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product-</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I believe I may have to use it a little longer in order to see more positive results, but so far, I do like what I am experiencing.  </li>
            <li>I have not had experience with any other similar item, but I feel this skin care system fulfills its claims and does a nice job.</li>
            <li>device.&lt;br /&gt;Rotation speed is enough to clean but not spray soap all over the place and has a far amount of torque so you can apply pressure without making the head stop spinning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the Toiletree Professional Skin Care System.</li>
            <li>I use my normal cleanser, but I use the exfoliating brush rather than the cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li>and I use the firmer brush if I feel my skin needs more help in getting rid of stubborn dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this product, I thought perhaps it was a bit redundant</li>
            <li>My sister is actually borrowing right now because of what it did to my skin</li>
            <li>It comes with batteries, so you can get started right away, and everything is simple to set up and use.  </li>
            <li>Spent a little more on this one, but it comes with several heads and the brush itself is more sturdy.</li>
            <li>I use the softer brush when my skin is feeling a little more sensitive</li>
            <li>They live them.</li>
            <li>The new one has had no problems.</li>
            <li>I received two new pumice heads in the mail</li>
            <li>(Yes, I put in new batteries.)Wish</li>
            <li>I was hoping it was just the batteries, but when I put new ones in, it still did not work.</li>
            <li>It comes with four useful brushes, including a sensitive, regular, and body brush as well as a pumace attachment&lt;</li>
            <li>But I really wanted to try a skin brush because I have had several friends who talked about how much it helped their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>A very soft brush is also included along with a body and pumice stone brush.</li>
            <li>Please let me know if you have any questions.he EXACT SAME products and frequency as with the ToiletTree brush, and the results are not even comparable.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li>: Be aware of what soap you put on the facial brush.</li>
            <li>No more magic.  </li>
            <li>I called the enclosed customer service number, and a human being answered, heard my problem, and express shipped me a whole new unit at no cost!</li>
            <li>I have not used the pumice stone, and when I used the body brush from the first purchase, it felt a little awkward at first, but I think it will be better with more uses.  </li>
            <li>I am always trying new products that promise to clear up and prevent breakouts and improve skin tone.</li>
            <li>I chose to get another new one since I really like this cleanser, and he assured me that they have had a new production of the cleansers since I received the second one in July.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the soft bristle first for cleansing, then I go over the same areas again with the medium bristle brush for exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I would recommend starting out with the sensitive skin attachment first until you get use to the power of this tool.</li>
            <li>When using for your feet with the stone, it works Moderately well, I mainly use it for cleaning my face, but the foot stone is a nice feature along with the body scrubbing head (which I feel runs a bit slow for the size of the brush).</li>
            <li>Once I switched to the sensitive brush until I got use to it, it&#x27;s been amazing, my skin broke out at first as expected, to get rid of all of the dirt and oil hiding deep down inside.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s waterproof, because I don&#x27;t have to be careful to keep it dry.  </li>
            <li>It definitely does as it says and I&#x27;m sure I can get use to the slightly slower speed.</li>
            <li>It has helped immensely in shrinking the large pores around my nose &amp; on my chin.  </li>
            <li>When my sisters and I recently enjoyed a spa day, we were given a hard sell for a Clairsonic skincare system.</li>
            <li>The brush is&lt;br /&gt;Alittle rough and really doesn&#x27;t work very well for the face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- ToiletTree is clearly dedicated to customer service and satisfaction...not to be taken for granted these days!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I have skin issues and try to weit till my skin is clear and healed before I use it.</li>
            <li>so I can only use the soft bristle brush which will wear out faster, that isn&#x27;t really any fault of the product though.</li>
            <li>It even helped clear up my blackheads which nothing else seemed to do.</li>
            <li>It has not irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have short hair, which I am really thankful.</li>
            <li>I also got several intense cystic acne that are still recovering and may even scar.</li>
            <li>The brushes are too soft.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive, acne-prone skin, and it has done wonders for my complexion.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday to wash my face and afterwards my skin is radient and smooth.</li>
            <li>This has helped my acne considerably.</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>There was a marked improvement in the look of my skin after one use.  </li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when the product arrived.</li>
            <li>so I switched them for some reusable ones and that fixed the problem.</li>
            <li>Not heavy to hold.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate or make my skin red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommending to others.</li>
            <li>like I got a peeling and it just has been this professional skin care system that has done the job.</li>
            <li>but so far Ive had it for Months</li>
            <li>and so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really felt this prepped my skin well for my facial regimen.</li>
            <li>really felt this prepped my skin well for my facial regimen.</li>
            <li>and I looked awake early this morning.</li>
            <li>For the price I still think it is worth it if you are not ready to invest $100</li>
            <li>but I have not experienced any breakouts because the brush does a good job at deep cleansing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that they stand behind their product.</li>
            <li>Since this is the only mechanized brush I have ever owned, I am not certain how important that difference is.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s powerful; the motor won&#x27;t stop even if you press the brushes to your face quite firmly, unlike other similar products.  </li>
            <li>and I find it&#x27;s very powerful without harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>(July, 2013)&lt;br /&gt;The original batteries that came with the unit lasted about 3 months with everyday use.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised by the size of the brush because I was half expecting a little rinky dink brush like the kind you can buy at the supermarket</li>
            <li>I finally gave into purchasing a Clarisonic Aria, which I have been using for just ONE WEEK with the EXACT SAME products and frequency as with the ToiletTree brush, and the results are not even comparable.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended a high priced facial cleaning brush/system, but I couldn&#x27;t stomach the price.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase this again and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>The product includes a large body brush, soft facial brush, medium facial brush and pumice stone.  </li>
            <li>so I would definitely recommend this for someone who has normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>When I went to replace the batteries finally, the product broke (water somehow got into the battery container, with new batteries the product wouldn&#x27;t turn off).</li>
            <li>I received an email from the company the very next day and they are sending me a new one to replace the one that broke.</li>
            <li>The customer service is FANTASTIC, and it looks like the company really stands behind their product.</li>
            <li>This works really well to loosen the dry skin.</li>
            <li>I only used the soft brush on my face since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The only downside is my skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>major Cons:&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly effective; after use every few days for several weeks I&#x27;m noticing my dark spots fading a bit.  </li>
            <li>I found this device to be just right for my skin, not too slow and not too fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Pretty in Pink with ToiletTree&#x27;s new Professional Skin Care System (ordered the pink one).</li>
            <li>I developed a regular collection of breakouts on my chin, my forehead, and on either side of my lips.</li>
            <li>As I get older I also have noticed really dry and flaky skin.</li>
            <li>The soft brush scrubber I use both day and night with my facial cleanser</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used the softest brush</li>
            <li>Be careful with it on your face with it can make it pretty red if you hold</li>
            <li>Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser, for normal to oily skin]]</li>
            <li>However, since part of what I paid for was the unit&#x27;s warranty and ToiletTree has stood behind its warranty with outstanding customer service</li>
            <li>Love the way they stand behind their products.  </li>
            <li>Overall great bang for the buck compared to other expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I have only used it about five times and the other night I heard this funny noise.  </li>
            <li>The soft brush is just soft enough, and the exfoliating brush isn&#x27;t too rough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other products that left my skin feeling less than clean and sometimes even irritated.</li>
            <li>I tried the stiff  brush for the first go around</li>
            <li>As mentioned previously, this product is very competitively priced&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive combination skin that needs a little help with shedding off old skin cells so that the new ones come up and bring out a softer complexion.  </li>
            <li>The batteries are replaced easily by just using a coin to turn the little dial button on the bottom and the cover pops out easily, no struggling with it like I had to do with the Olay</li>
            <li>I called their customer service and the lady was extremely helpful and immediately replaced my cleanser with a new one.</li>
            <li>It is really water proof, you get one hard and one soft brush, and you can get refill brushes.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ll happily give 5 stars for how much I enjoy using this product and the wonderful customer service I received.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product, it&#x27;s done a great job of exfoliating my skin and removing all makeup and dirt every time I use it.</li>
            <li> It does a good job cleaning my face and body</li>
            <li> This is a really good produce</li>
            <li> I gave this face brush about 6 months of use before commenting, as I wanted to provide a thorough and fair review.</li>
            <li> good for the money.</li>
            <li> My skin never looked and felt so good.</li>
            <li> Face and body brushes feel good too.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist said  exfoliation(within reason) was good.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a good product.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it cleaned my face, and I loved the body brush (I never had a chance to use the pumice stone).</li>
            <li> We all know that a scrub is good for the face.  </li>
            <li> It needs a good scrub too.  </li>
            <li> Good tool.  </li>
            <li> Good price</li>
            <li> and it does a good job at removing dirt and oil.</li>
            <li> The Olay has a good \\&quot;swirl\\&quot; to it; but this one you can feel the power.  </li>
            <li> We have purchased the brush for two teenagers and both have had good results.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Sephora and truly trust all of the products they sell.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t  expecting miracles or to look 20 again, but I feel good about my skin now.</li>
            <li> and it felt so good</li>
            <li> I loved, loved, loved this product.</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful to clean my skin with the brushes and my feet look amazing after using the pumice stone.</li>
            <li> Received it before delivery date and am very pleased with it</li>
            <li> It works great, and I do feel like my face is cleaner and more responsive to the medications that I apply.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with both the product and the results I&#x27;ve seen on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes rotate nicely and feel so good on the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The included interchangeable brush heads are very nice and seem appropriate for intended usages.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> First got this a couple months ago and it worked great!</li>
            <li> Oh I Love it!</li>
            <li> I get the best results by wetting my face with fairly hot water, smearing a liberal amount of acne scrub all over my face and throat (like a mask), and then using the brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found it!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this thing!</li>
            <li> I love my Pro Skin Care System from ToiletTree!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> The first time I received it, I used it for about a week with wonderful results, but it started shutting off on its own</li>
            <li> This unit is amazing for its price.</li>
            <li> So amazing since I had not even had a chance to return the one to Amazon yet.</li>
            <li> Really amazing in this day &amp; age.</li>
            <li> : 1) use with things don&#x27;t bubble a lot on its own (soap etc) 2)</li>
            <li> That being said, here is my honest opinion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The waterproof feature has proven effective</li>
            <li> I love this thing, and receiving truly great customer service from ToiletTree has just made me want to recommend it even more.</li>
            <li> and I love how good it cleans</li>
            <li> What a nice addition to your product line.</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast, I have nothing but great things to say about this product!</li>
            <li> My wife requested as part of her own cleansing regime.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure they will work as good as the face brush.</li>
            <li> and I wanted a brush that could be used with my own cleansers</li>
            <li> it would have lasted longer because I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using apricot scrub for years and this has been a good alternative as it will save me money and works better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I hope this review helps those looking for good exfoliation without the harshness of most exfoliating cleansers.  </li>
            <li> However, this one is very inexpensive and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very happy with the results so far!  </li>
            <li> Her skin is smooth and bright now.</li>
            <li> but surprisingly this gadget worked so well to clean my face.</li>
            <li> Washing your face with an exfoliating face wash is great, but not as consistent of an exfoliation as you&#x27;ll get with this system.</li>
            <li> Aside from that, it works beautifully, and I really like the product.</li>
            <li> Love the versatility.</li>
            <li> I love that its WATER PROOF, so I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the pumice stone yet, but I&#x27;ll be sure to do so soon.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> anyways, love it love it.</li>
            <li> I have the olay one which was okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad that I chose this instead of spending hundreds of dollars on a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial brush that I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product several months ago for myself and was so impressed with it that I purchased another one as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> I have been so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> My breakouts are reduced, my persistent blackheads are almost gone, I haven&#x27;t had any peeling, and I feel better about my skin than I have in</li>
            <li> I have used it twice daily since it arrived and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I look forward to more improvements in my skin over time.</li>
            <li> I was able to extract the top batteries.</li>
            <li> What I saved on this model, I was able to splurge on my cleanser and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Guess it&#x27;s ok for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li> Love this product for 2 reasons: 1.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It is more than I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad it spins instead of vibrates.&lt;br</li>
            <li> : The item arrived in tip top condition and in a timely manner to an APO/FPO area.</li>
            <li> I dare to say it&#x27;s much better than Clarisonic</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the variety of attachments.</li>
            <li> It works just as described and includes more brush options for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin look.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m glad to have found</li>
            <li> and I love the results.  </li>
            <li> So many of the cleansing brushes have pre-moistened pads</li>
            <li> It magically started working for a while</li>
            <li> I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Love this product and this company.  </li>
            <li> I find that any face cream soaks in much better and my skin is feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Thank you :)</li>
            <li> The product is great, but I really would expect it to work for longer than a month.</li>
            <li> If I have to spend $35 every month, then I am better off paying the money for the Clarisonic that lasts (all of my friends that have</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> Also, the customer service is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as an upgrade to my Olay system; and while I was quite satisfied with my Olay system, this one exceeded my expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love the additional brushes for the body and feet.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> and I love that it is waterproof so I can take it in the shower with me.</li>
            <li> I think it works just as well as the clarisonic and at a better price.</li>
            <li> I dare say my feel even look more youthful.</li>
            <li> I use this once a day and have really found it to be a great product.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not for acne just for better cleansing(.</li>
            <li> Price is great, shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> love this product</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that you have to change out the batteries but in all its wonderful.</li>
            <li> , saved me a lot of money I can use on more beauty products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can use on more beauty products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this skin care system.</li>
            <li> I love how I&#x27;ve reduced how much cleanser I need as the speedy rotating brush lathers very nicely.</li>
            <li> I have used it with good results and have noticed an improvement in my skin tone and complexion when I am able to use it consistently.  </li>
            <li> Now that I have a new one, it had been giving me great results.  </li>
            <li> This product is great - my face feels so soft!</li>
            <li> If you have acne or the occasional breakout, this is very good at clearing your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love how soft and effective this product is!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worked great for me so far.</li>
            <li> She too loved it so much that my daughter (her Mother) purchased one for herself.</li>
            <li> It is a good product at a very affordable price.  </li>
            <li> This system, from ToiletTree, had good reviews and the price was quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> It appears to be of good quality and my skin feels very smooth and soft after using it.</li>
            <li> and I have increased my stars to 4 instead of 3 due to excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> A Zogan massage later and my face is good to go!</li>
            <li> There was no way I was going to spend over $100 on one, so I researched around amazon and other websites to determine what the best product would be.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Heads change easily.</li>
            <li> It suds up micely and gives a clean and refreshing felling and look.</li>
            <li> love it in the shower  works great and have had no problems at all in the last 2 months.</li>
            <li> If you put a soap that foams up easily it will fling everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I have updated my rating form a 2-star to 5-star; I love the product, and the customer service itself is enough to win my business over &amp; over.</li>
            <li> It was easy to put in the batteries that it thankfully came with.</li>
            <li> I use it with a very mild non-sudsing cleanser every morning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Whenever my hormones fluctuate and I can feel a breakout coming on or see a pimple, I always use a brush to get in the pores and it goes away very quickly.</li>
            <li> The rotation is strong and my batteries lasted for about 3 months, using it twice a day.</li>
            <li> This product has strong rotations of the brush</li>
            <li> I thought it was too big at first, but its perfect.</li>
            <li> the product works just fine now.  </li>
            <li> (Luckily my husband fell in love with me anyway - acne and all).  </li>
            <li> it was fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it to spend more money and get a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Love the facial and body exfoliators and the pumice attachment is great for keeping your feet nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this facial cleanser and would buy it again.  </li>
            <li> then another one because I liked it so much.  </li>
            <li> I liked the way the company handled my situation so much that I noticed on the product info sheet that they also made a skin care system.  </li>
            <li> The facial brush works great and is just as advertised.  </li>
            <li> It arrived packaged great and in a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy using this with my nightly cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> It was easy to clean the brushes.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise a great product which I will continue to use daily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dread looking in the mirror in the morning, and I enjoy using it every night or morning.  </li>
            <li> got to brushing my face with a light PH balanced foaming cleanser (Alpha Hydrox foaming cleanser if you would like to know)</li>
            <li> Quality, ease of use, and price are great but needs a lower speed to use daily.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this great tool earlier!</li>
            <li> We really like the fact that it is shower safe and we have ours hanging in the shower readily available!</li>
            <li> The professional skin care system by ToiletTree is a good product for the price.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve decided that I will probably never find a product as good as the old one I had.</li>
            <li> I have tried the cheaper olay brand and this is definitely far superior to that junk.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my new ToiletTree face brush.  </li>
            <li> My skin visibly looked more fresh, clean and brighter than before.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I found another brush that is quickly helping to repair the damage (though not the embarrassment) that this brush caused while still using my favorite facewash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily, I found another brush that is quickly helping to repair the damage (though not the embarrassment) that this brush caused while still using my favorite facewash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super easy to use</li>
            <li> I just got mine today and was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> I bought it any way and so far I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>
            <li> many others, I was interested in a Clarisonic (Mia or Mia 2) but just could not justify spending the money.  </li>
            <li> And as a bonus, it has reduced my redness significantly.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> and i feel clean and silky</li>
            <li> MUST clean the brushes after use.  </li>
            <li> I have clean face now</li>
            <li> When I use it, about once a week, it makes my face feel really clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased to be able to review the Professional Skin Care System by ToiletTree.  </li>
            <li> To clean it, I touch it on a bar of soap while it is rotating, then hold it on my palm to let the soap scrub between the bristle, then rinse it in water.  </li>
            <li> It rinses clean if I do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so this is getting my face clean and leaves my skin feeling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen my flakey dry patches greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> This is the third skin care system that I have tried and it is by far the best one.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin feeling clean and freah.</li>
            <li> bristles are very soft and effective.</li>
            <li> It works very well, your skin will feel very smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> When I first opened it, I used it on a facial bar; it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The batteries work for a long time, perfect size, soft brush, might buy another just in case this one ever breaks.</li>
            <li> Is it really true?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how super clean one&#x27;s face becomes after using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a battery operated  facial brush that I bought many, many years ago that is no longer available.</li>
            <li> I would have given this the full 5 stars</li>
            <li> (I think) and it still has full battery charge.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates &amp; prepares my skin to absorb my vitamin c serum &amp; moisturizer more readily.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much, I bought one to send to my daughter.</li>
            <li> A Zogan massage later and my face is good to go!oney</li>
            <li> Cool.</li>
            <li> When I got home, I did some research on some more reasonably priced alternatives.</li>
            <li> However, as others here have stated, the customer service was outstanding and agreed to ship me a new one, free of charge, without hassle.</li>
            <li> cleanser is great and cleans my face extremely well.</li>
            <li> The other attachments for the body and feet are great.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I am so happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It is a nice exfoliator but still gentle with the gentle brush.  </li>
            <li> I love how it comes with many different attachments.</li>
            <li> If you have any problems, they are super responsive and accommodating.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased, especially since they contacted me before I even had a chance to contact them or return the item to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Overall very satisfied with this cleaner.</li>
            <li> longer life span seems reasonable against any superior cleaning action that MIGHT go with the percussion action, and am satisfied thinking thusly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tools have held up beautifully and the product was received much faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> The large body brush has been great on my dry legs.</li>
            <li> Ive heard many mixed reviews on this product and how it breaks easily.</li>
            <li> Fits in your hand comfortably and cery very to use.</li>
            <li> I use the soft brush to cleanse my face twice a day, and it exfoliates perfectly without being harsh or abrasive.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like me, one run through with the brush is more than plenty.  </li>
            <li> The different brushes are nice.</li>
            <li> The different colors are nice too.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> , even the batteries rarely need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I love the spinning action on it</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> and it is well worth the affordable price.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t perfect - but it is MUCH improved, and I only wish this tool had been around when I was a teenager and in my younger, dating years.  </li>
            <li> I use the soft face brush twice a day and have seen a great improvement in my pores and overall skin clarity.</li>
            <li> I also love that my heels are soft when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth it</li>
            <li> and I have used all of the adapters so far and love them all.</li>
            <li> but it is larger than that and fits nicely in my hand.</li>
            <li> I feel it gives my face a better overall clean.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise, I felt and saw a difference right away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say what I love the most about it, because it all adds up to one amazing product that leaves the skin on my face baby soft.  </li>
            <li> The large one is a little harder perfect for the body and smaller ones are more gentle and soft great for the face.</li>
            <li> and I cannot see spending more when you get more bang for your buck from this sweet little beauty!</li>
            <li> (be sure to have something on hand to open the battery compartment, I used nail clippers and it was quick)</li>
            <li> I have even tried it myself and must admit this is pretty powerful for a battery</li>
            <li> I emailed ToiletTree and they sent me a new one for free.</li>
            <li> Using the product once a day is keeping my skin bright and healthy looking and helping to reduce dry skin caused by the dry, winter air.</li>
            <li> Me - Chinese, fair and sensitive skin, oily T-Zone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very gentle on skin</li>
            <li> Wish you made a plugin, but so far the batteries have been fine.</li>
            <li> I did a little research in finding a good face scrubbing product for my price range, and this caught my eye.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to purchase the ToiletTree face brush given its many positive reviews and great price, especially when compared to other much more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Whereas most facial brushes are water resistant.</li>
            <li> My teenage girls love it as well.</li>
            <li> In fact ended up ordering another for a family member after they saw it and were interested.</li>
            <li> Just wish there were better storage for the different sized cleaners.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations and the product is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> My skin is not only improving, but I have a glow and clarity that is better than before I went on the ToiletTree brush detour.</li>
            <li> My skin is not only improving, but I have a glow and clarity that is better than before I went on the ToiletTree brush detour.</li>
            <li> I considered the cleanser somewhat gentle since I only experienced occasional dryness.  </li>
            <li> doing the job, just it only have one speed power, ok for the first time user.will</li>
            <li> The first problem I had was that after about 6 months, the brush would not turn on or off sometimes.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more products from this company.</li>
            <li> It would have helped my skin so much!  </li>
            <li> First review:  </li>
            <li> My first experience with this company was with their Water Pik.  </li>
            <li> The first one died, I called and was promply sent another one.  </li>
            <li> It takes 4 batteries, so try not to use it too fast!</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> I guess I will always be looking for and expecting the same as the brush I&#x27;ve had for many years</li>
            <li> Its very affordable too!</li>
            <li> When finished just rinse well and apply your moisturizer, this form of exfoliation will leave your skin fresh glowing and ready to accept your moisturizer as it will absorb easier.</li>
            <li> I got it in blue and love it.</li>
            <li> I initially bought the system because of all of the reviews and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love that it has a larger brush to use on your body.  </li>
            <li> Initially, made by skin \\&quot;feel\\&quot; more clean and soft than it did with hand washing</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my Toilet Tree Professional Care System.</li>
            <li> Though this is my first time using anything like this, my guess is it&#x27;s just as good as the more expensive models out there.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I decided on toilet tree, and after a week I love it.</li>
            <li> Gives your face a good deep scrub that regular face wash just can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very affordable product compared to similar products on the market (some are $100 or more).  </li>
            <li> Because of their favorable reviews I also purchased this product with positive results.  </li>
            <li> There were many days where I wished I didn&#x27;t have to go into my high exposure management role at work because I was embarrased for my team and co-workers to see my skin and my obvious attempts to hide the blemishes on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once the outer layer of dry skin has been removed with the brush, my skin absorbs acne medicine, serum, and moisturizer so much better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a lot of problems with dry skin this winter, but I&#x27;m allergic to many OTC scrubs.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t as dry and it does look more radiant.</li>
            <li> Felt like the motor was strong and it seemed like it was gonna last for quite some time.</li>
            <li> My initial AA batteries have been in for a month and are still going strong.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and really cleans deep into the pores.  </li>
            <li> Comes with a large brush and a gentle pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used a better one in which to compare it to, but it is definitely strong enough without being too rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> it can really happen.</li>
            <li> Fast, efficient service from Toilettree Products.  </li>
            <li> the brushes are gentle to the skin</li>
            <li> I wish they had some way of storing the system better after use rather than replacing the wet attachments in the plastic pre-formed packaging...</li>
            <li> &quot; so to speak, and I really regret doing so.</li>
            <li> &quot; so to speak, and I really regret doing so.</li>
            <li> I have also dropped it in the shower a couple times and it seems to be very durable.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe it took me my whole life until now to find a product that did something for my blackheads.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> but the batteries that wnt into the scrubber were absolutely wedged in.  </li>
            <li> The rotation is gentle, and yet it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It can really give power</li>
            <li> It came today and I&#x27;ve used it twice, once on my face, once on my whole body.</li>
            <li> Product works really well.</li>
            <li> I really like the results.</li>
            <li> It performs better than expected</li>
            <li> It has a very affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> The company seems very committed to customer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Also, watch out for when it spins too fast--</li>
            <li> What I really like is that you can use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> My skin tends to get very oily which clogs my pores</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the pumice stone does not work very well.</li>
            <li> so much, I will probably by another just to keep in the shower</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The brush cleans my face so well, and it is left light and airy.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t think a month in, a couple times a week, should show that much wear and tear.</li>
            <li> It just does not seem to snap in as well as the brushes, or maybe I am applying too much pressure during use.</li>
            <li> This one I really feel does that.</li>
            <li> but it turns out this busy geek Mommy does care more than she thought about such things!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love the deep but not harsh cleansing I get from the softest face attachment.</li>
            <li> I replaced the batteries with brand new ones, turned it on, and the motor pretty much turned on and then gradually died within seconds.</li>
            <li> Easy to use; several types of brushes for different needs are quickly switched out.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick, ethnic skin so the medium brush works best for me because my skin is not sensitive by any means.</li>
            <li> The choice of less and more firm facial brush heads is very nice.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the medium brush feels too hard on my sensitive skin, so the soft brush is perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li> My no fail test of facial brushes is that if I am able to press down hard on the brush with my hand and it doesn&#x27;t stop, then it is powerful enough and will do a great job.</li>
            <li> My facial skin can handle a more coarse brush; and I much prefer that to a softer one.  </li>
            <li> The directions are short and sweet.</li>
            <li> The only thing that kept it from receiving a full five stars is the fact that the pumice stone will often fall out of the handle when I move it away from my skin after use.</li>
            <li> It leaves me a little pink for 15 minutes or so, so plan for that, but it feels great and has eliminated my need for moisturizer (I may still need it in the winter, though - we&#x27;ll see).</li>
            <li> I tried it &amp; live it!</li>
            <li> Great costumer service (very rare),the guy gave me a solution to the problem but sadly the battery didn&#x27;t come out</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s contemplating getting her own in pink (mine is blue).</li>
            <li> and I feel like I am getting more out of the facial cleanser when I use the facial brush with it.</li>
            <li> I have used my facial brush once a day for several months now &amp; love the results.  </li>
            <li> It really helps me stay clear now!</li>
            <li> I really like the Professional Skin Care System!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product if you are looking for a skin care system.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product-</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I believe I may have to use it a little longer in order to see more positive results, but so far, I do like what I am experiencing.  </li>
            <li> I have not had experience with any other similar item, but I feel this skin care system fulfills its claims and does a nice job.</li>
            <li> device.&lt;br /&gt;Rotation speed is enough to clean but not spray soap all over the place and has a far amount of torque so you can apply pressure without making the head stop spinning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the Toiletree Professional Skin Care System.</li>
            <li> I use my normal cleanser, but I use the exfoliating brush rather than the cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li> and I use the firmer brush if I feel my skin needs more help in getting rid of stubborn dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this product, I thought perhaps it was a bit redundant</li>
            <li> My sister is actually borrowing right now because of what it did to my skin</li>
            <li> It comes with batteries, so you can get started right away, and everything is simple to set up and use.  </li>
            <li> Spent a little more on this one, but it comes with several heads and the brush itself is more sturdy.</li>
            <li> I use the softer brush when my skin is feeling a little more sensitive</li>
            <li> They live them.</li>
            <li> The new one has had no problems.</li>
            <li> I received two new pumice heads in the mail</li>
            <li> (Yes, I put in new batteries.)Wish</li>
            <li> I was hoping it was just the batteries, but when I put new ones in, it still did not work.</li>
            <li> It comes with four useful brushes, including a sensitive, regular, and body brush as well as a pumace attachment&lt;</li>
            <li> But I really wanted to try a skin brush because I have had several friends who talked about how much it helped their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> A very soft brush is also included along with a body and pumice stone brush.</li>
            <li> Please let me know if you have any questions.he EXACT SAME products and frequency as with the ToiletTree brush, and the results are not even comparable.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li> : Be aware of what soap you put on the facial brush.</li>
            <li> No more magic.  </li>
            <li> I called the enclosed customer service number, and a human being answered, heard my problem, and express shipped me a whole new unit at no cost!</li>
            <li> I have not used the pumice stone, and when I used the body brush from the first purchase, it felt a little awkward at first, but I think it will be better with more uses.  </li>
            <li> I am always trying new products that promise to clear up and prevent breakouts and improve skin tone.</li>
            <li> I chose to get another new one since I really like this cleanser, and he assured me that they have had a new production of the cleansers since I received the second one in July.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the soft bristle first for cleansing, then I go over the same areas again with the medium bristle brush for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I would recommend starting out with the sensitive skin attachment first until you get use to the power of this tool.</li>
            <li> When using for your feet with the stone, it works Moderately well, I mainly use it for cleaning my face, but the foot stone is a nice feature along with the body scrubbing head (which I feel runs a bit slow for the size of the brush).</li>
            <li> Once I switched to the sensitive brush until I got use to it, it&#x27;s been amazing, my skin broke out at first as expected, to get rid of all of the dirt and oil hiding deep down inside.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s waterproof, because I don&#x27;t have to be careful to keep it dry.  </li>
            <li> It definitely does as it says and I&#x27;m sure I can get use to the slightly slower speed.</li>
            <li> It has helped immensely in shrinking the large pores around my nose &amp; on my chin.  </li>
            <li> When my sisters and I recently enjoyed a spa day, we were given a hard sell for a Clairsonic skincare system.</li>
            <li> The brush is&lt;br /&gt;Alittle rough and really doesn&#x27;t work very well for the face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- ToiletTree is clearly dedicated to customer service and satisfaction...not to be taken for granted these days!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I have skin issues and try to weit till my skin is clear and healed before I use it.</li>
            <li> so I can only use the soft bristle brush which will wear out faster, that isn&#x27;t really any fault of the product though.</li>
            <li> It even helped clear up my blackheads which nothing else seemed to do.</li>
            <li> It has not irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have short hair, which I am really thankful.</li>
            <li> I also got several intense cystic acne that are still recovering and may even scar.</li>
            <li> The brushes are too soft.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive, acne-prone skin, and it has done wonders for my complexion.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday to wash my face and afterwards my skin is radient and smooth.</li>
            <li> This has helped my acne considerably.</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> There was a marked improvement in the look of my skin after one use.  </li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when the product arrived.</li>
            <li> so I switched them for some reusable ones and that fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> Not heavy to hold.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate or make my skin red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommending to others.</li>
            <li> like I got a peeling and it just has been this professional skin care system that has done the job.</li>
            <li> but so far Ive had it for Months</li>
            <li> and so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really felt this prepped my skin well for my facial regimen.</li>
            <li> really felt this prepped my skin well for my facial regimen.</li>
            <li> and I looked awake early this morning.</li>
            <li> For the price I still think it is worth it if you are not ready to invest $100</li>
            <li> but I have not experienced any breakouts because the brush does a good job at deep cleansing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that they stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> Since this is the only mechanized brush I have ever owned, I am not certain how important that difference is.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s powerful; the motor won&#x27;t stop even if you press the brushes to your face quite firmly, unlike other similar products.  </li>
            <li> and I find it&#x27;s very powerful without harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> (July, 2013)&lt;br /&gt;The original batteries that came with the unit lasted about 3 months with everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised by the size of the brush because I was half expecting a little rinky dink brush like the kind you can buy at the supermarket</li>
            <li> I finally gave into purchasing a Clarisonic Aria, which I have been using for just ONE WEEK with the EXACT SAME products and frequency as with the ToiletTree brush, and the results are not even comparable.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended a high priced facial cleaning brush/system, but I couldn&#x27;t stomach the price.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase this again and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> The product includes a large body brush, soft facial brush, medium facial brush and pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> so I would definitely recommend this for someone who has normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> When I went to replace the batteries finally, the product broke (water somehow got into the battery container, with new batteries the product wouldn&#x27;t turn off).</li>
            <li> I received an email from the company the very next day and they are sending me a new one to replace the one that broke.</li>
            <li> The customer service is FANTASTIC, and it looks like the company really stands behind their product.</li>
            <li> This works really well to loosen the dry skin.</li>
            <li> I only used the soft brush on my face since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The only downside is my skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> major Cons:&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly effective; after use every few days for several weeks I&#x27;m noticing my dark spots fading a bit.  </li>
            <li> I found this device to be just right for my skin, not too slow and not too fast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Pretty in Pink with ToiletTree&#x27;s new Professional Skin Care System (ordered the pink one).</li>
            <li> I developed a regular collection of breakouts on my chin, my forehead, and on either side of my lips.</li>
            <li> As I get older I also have noticed really dry and flaky skin.</li>
            <li> The soft brush scrubber I use both day and night with my facial cleanser</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used the softest brush</li>
            <li> Be careful with it on your face with it can make it pretty red if you hold</li>
            <li> Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser, for normal to oily skin]]</li>
            <li> However, since part of what I paid for was the unit&#x27;s warranty and ToiletTree has stood behind its warranty with outstanding customer service</li>
            <li> Love the way they stand behind their products.  </li>
            <li> Overall great bang for the buck compared to other expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I have only used it about five times and the other night I heard this funny noise.  </li>
            <li> The soft brush is just soft enough, and the exfoliating brush isn&#x27;t too rough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other products that left my skin feeling less than clean and sometimes even irritated.</li>
            <li> I tried the stiff  brush for the first go around</li>
            <li> As mentioned previously, this product is very competitively priced&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive combination skin that needs a little help with shedding off old skin cells so that the new ones come up and bring out a softer complexion.  </li>
            <li> The batteries are replaced easily by just using a coin to turn the little dial button on the bottom and the cover pops out easily, no struggling with it like I had to do with the Olay</li>
            <li> I called their customer service and the lady was extremely helpful and immediately replaced my cleanser with a new one.</li>
            <li> It is really water proof, you get one hard and one soft brush, and you can get refill brushes.  </li>
            <li> so he jut down my address and got a new facial brush system today.</li>
            <li> Then I thought it needed new batteries because it slowed down and just seemed like the power was gone.  </li>
            <li> With this brush I get a deep clean without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> After giving it some thought, I figured that a rotary action should be mechanically less wearing than a percussion action, and that trade off of expected</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t spin flat on the face.  </li>
            <li> well and the batteries seem to be lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be using this all year long as part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Hold the brush head flat to your skin, do not apply pressure.</li>
            <li> My sensitive face is a little red after using.  </li>
            <li> They also are smaller after being cleansed, and dry out faster.  </li>
            <li> Recently I&#x27;ve had breakouts and it helps my acne dry up and heal faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and the constant buildup of dry flaky skin is diminished with each use.  </li>
            <li> I have only tried the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush head, but it cleans my skin well and doesn&#x27;t feel too soft or too harsh.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to rate how long the motor lasts.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried it, I thought the speed was a bit slow, but once I used it, the speed was just right (not to say that it&#x27;s weak, because it&#x27;s not).</li>
            <li> I desperately went to see my dermatologist, and she helped me to understand that any time you scrub your skin, it will \\&quot;feel\\&quot; soft and clean...</li>
            <li> Within a few uses, the skin on my face began to clear up.</li>
            <li> And by the way, for those who has long hair..</li>
            <li> if you got long hair, tie it into a ponytail and use a hairband..or just avoid forehead altogether ...</li>
            <li> The battery life lasts incredibly long, which</li>
            <li> I purchased the same unit in pink for my mother for Christmas, then got jealous and bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> I t too long in one spot.</li>
            <li> but I caught myself before I did it too long.</li>
            <li> Also included two small brushes; both with very soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> Seems to cleanse extremely well after only a couple uses.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this over the other brand.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand I have only used item one time.</li>
            <li> On the other hand the body brush works wonders as well because I tend to get breakouts on my back and it leaves my skin feeling like silk.</li>
            <li> This is a bit of a hassle as I have to let the brushes thoroughly dry before I can put it up.</li>
            <li> I want it to completely dry in between uses.  </li>
            <li> Thank god it was short, I gotten away with only messy facewash washed hair....</li>
            <li> This second one started acting up a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I am not one to spend a small fortune on beauty products (hence why I did not immediately purchase the Clarisonic), so I completely understand your desire to try to get the same quality for less money.</li>
            <li> I am not one to spend a small fortune on beauty products (hence why I did not immediately purchase the Clarisonic), so I completely understand your desire to try to get the same quality for less money.</li>
            <li> Replaced with brand new batteries, and it spins for about 5 seconds(really slowly) and then shuts off.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates the blemishes and they appear less red.  </li>
            <li> Item came right away, looked new, works correctly, I have nothing bad to say about item.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I think the brushes are a little cheap because although it says it is &amp;#34;splash free&amp;#34;, after a month it does spray/splash when I use it.</li>
            <li> I ordered it not because I had bad skin, but because I wanted a trusty exfoliation method to keep my face looking young and fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday, and I definitely see results.  </li>
            <li> It was never dropped and I never really changed out of one brush.</li>
            <li> but this brush and its circular rotation method (rather than pulsing, like the higher quality brands) is not ideal for the face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Etude House Pore cleansing foam for the last few months before trying it out with the face brush.  </li>
            <li> That tells me the company really stands behind their product.</li>
            <li> I do not have rough feet at all</li>
            <li> The brushes are not overly rough.</li>
            <li> Then rinse, apply cleanser to your wet skin and off you go.</li>
            <li> I went back a second time for some trouble areas and my skin felt raw afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Too harsh for daily use due to circular motion.</li>
            <li> Hard to differentiate between the soft and hard brushes other than a barely noticeable change in color</li>
            <li> When I use toner after cleansing there is very little, if anything, left on the cotton pad</li>
            <li> I use the other brushes for knees, elbows and feet.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li> suggestion to other buyers is to not use the batteries shipped with the scrubber.</li>
            <li> Keep this in my shower, the loop lets it hang like other accessories.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> It also comes with other head attachments</li>
            <li> but I found that the speed was not what I was used to with my other brush.</li>
            <li> This facial brush was a waste of money because it stopped working a few months after I purchased it.</li>
            <li> If I let up, it turns off (and I have to push it hard enough to keep it on it literally hurts my finger).</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because I never tried any products by this brand before</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bristles are already showing signs of wear.</li>
            <li> I tried shaking it out, leaving it upright so it can slide down and hoping that baby oil would help.</li>
            <li> This product works but it struggles as the motor slows down when I apply the brush to my face.  </li>
            <li> So, the batteries literally got stuck 3/4 of the way down.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago and agree with what other users have said.</li>
            <li> Invest in a more expensive one if you have to, but do not buy this one because it will fail you.</li>
            <li> But the batteries that shipped with the unit were slightly over-sized AAs.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews of previous people who had already purchased this product.  </li>
            <li> I have to use much less product.  </li>
            <li> I previously purchased a Clarisonic believing the brushes rotated.</li>
            <li> After less than a month, it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a Clarisonic type tool for less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from a bad acne and my dermatologist recommended me to apply an special soap onto my face with a brush, so on my search to get it on amazon, I found out this one, and just using it for a couple of days</li>
            <li> As I frown at the mess it created, I continued cleaning my face with is thing And hair on my forehead</li>
            <li> The body brush covers a lot of area in just a little time, &amp; I happen to use it for my face too while I&#x27;m in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well-made with heavy duty plastic and quality brush fibers.</li>
            <li> With regular use (4-6 times per week), my acne got WAY WORSE than it was before using this brush.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now with excelent results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are few face products that I would consider to be \\&quot;game-changers\\</li>
            <li> but it does not seem to even scratch the surface of removing dead skin.</li>
            <li> My face feels softer and I know that the dead skin cells are gone.</li>
            <li> and I use it EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> I was concerned with the fact that this product only had rave reviews, I mean, at least someone must have had an issue with it.</li>
            <li> The only small complaint would be that it scratches the face a little bit when using the hard brush.</li>
            <li> I have to push it really hard to get it to turn on (even my husband had a hard time pushing it hard enough), and hold it down if I want it to stay on.</li>
            <li> I started with the normal brush and it was brutal on my skin, so I changed to the soft brush.</li>
            <li> Getting compliments from her is no easy feat.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to scrub too hard!</li>
            <li> In the past, I used Olay&#x27;s ProX brush</li>
            <li> Not sure what has happened.</li>
            <li> The skin cleansing system worked as described, if not better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived promptly and in a sturdy, small box.  </li>
            <li> Sounds excessive, I know, but at that price, it&#x27;s doable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using it was very simple, nothing complicated.</li>
            <li> Not a very good product.  </li>
            <li> At least one of them should be hard and can be used for brushing toe nails.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it every day for 1-2 minutes and my skin has not had any negative effects.  </li>
            <li> the Clarisonic have had it at least a year with no problems).&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:</li>
            <li> are cream inside the brush compartment so that while the brush is spinning the wash slowly comes out.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of purchasing this product due to the price alone.</li>
            <li> I tried to press down as hard as I could looking for anything, something wrong to be dissatisfied with this brush, but the motor kept turning and the brush was still brushing my skin</li>
            <li> Was a bit disappointed, as I had got the impression this brush has a percussion rather than rotary action.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate ToiletTree&#x27;s attempt to cater to those seeking a less expensive option.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate ToiletTree&#x27;s attempt to cater to those seeking a less expensive option.</li>
            <li> Not a pleasant time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple face scrubs with rotating heads since and have been disappointed everytime until now.  </li>
            <li> Now my skin is smoother and it started to get rid of the evil black heads around the nose area that are not easy to destroy.</li>
            <li> and I can not go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> sadly none of those methods worked and I called Tolietree and ask for assistance about the product.</li>
            <li> It saved me 100s of dollars for not wasting my expensive Shiseido soaps on my palms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The power button, again, wasn&#x27;t always responsive and when it did turn on, the brush speed would randomly vary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased a cleaning brush before because they were so expensive.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I will update my rating if I get a refund (and will probably try it again if I get a refund in the hopes I just had a bad one).</li>
            <li> Disappointed to say the least....especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am very frustrated...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Easy to use. Heads change easily. Love the versatility.</li>
            <li> Bought because my Mary Kay facial brush died after 3 weeks of use (it was not a battery problem). Spent a little more on this one, but it comes with several heads and the brush itself is more sturdy. I thought it was too big at first, but its perfect. I love that its WATER PROOF, so I can use it in the shower. Whereas most facial brushes are water resistant. This brush is perfect and I would buy it all over again. I also like that I can buy a pack of replacement heads when I need them.</li>
            <li> Wish I had this gadget 10 yrs ago... It&#x27;s well-made with heavy duty plastic and quality brush fibers. It has not irritated my sensitive skin. Great feature : can be used in shower and bath. Just purchased #2 as gift for mom. Love this &amp; she deserves the experience, as well.</li>
            <li> When I first opened it, I used it on a facial bar; it&#x27;s great. But Pandora&#x27;s box opened when I tried it with a face wash. My face became the ground zero of foam firework. The foam has gotten all over my tank, my mirror, my bathroom wall...... And by the way, for those who has long hair.. Do Not ignore another review posted about a girl&#x27;s hair got caught in the spinning brush..(I think that was a two star review) it can really happen. I have short hair, which I am really thankful. As I frown at the mess it created, I continued cleaning my face with is thing And hair on my forehead gotten caught in the bristle of the brush. Thank god it was short, I gotten away with only messy facewash washed hair.... Rule of thumb for use this product: 1) use with things don&#x27;t bubble a lot on its own (soap etc) 2) if you got long hair, tie it into a ponytail and use a hairband..or just avoid forehead altogether ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday, and I definitely see results.  I haven&#x27;t used the pumice stone yet, but I&#x27;ll be sure to do so soon.</li>
            <li> In the past, I used Olay&#x27;s ProX brush but, when I lost it, I decided to try this brand.  I am very happy that I did.  It is waterproof and comes with a variety of brush sizes that after time are replaceable.</li>
            <li> The brushes rotate nicely and feel so good on the skin. My skin feels soft and clean after using it. My teenage girls love it as well. We really like the fact that it is shower safe and we have ours hanging in the shower readily available! Highly recommend this product if you are looking for a skin care system.</li>
            <li> Fast, efficient service from Toilettree Products.  Completely satisfied with the product.  In fact ended up ordering another for a family member after they saw it and were interested.</li>
            <li> Not a very good product.  I can&#x27;t turn the darn thing off without taking out the batteries.  I have only used it about five times and the other night I heard this funny noise.  It was the brush.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My face is glowing from using it. Would highly recommend. Just wish there were better storage for the different sized cleaners.</li>
            <li> My skin looked great after using this. I only used the soft brush on my face since I have sensitive skin. I also used the body brush an it was fantastic. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> It does a good job cleaning my face and body</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. Her skin is smooth and bright now. She would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This facial brush was a waste of money because it stopped working a few months after I purchased it. Invest in a more expensive one if you have to, but do not buy this one because it will fail you. I do not recommend this facial brush.</li>
            <li> OMG where have you been? This is a really good produce and I can not go wrong with it. its quarter the price of the clarisonic and i was about to go out and buy it at Sephora. anyways, love it love it. the brushes are gentle to the skin and i feel clean and silky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 1/04/14&lt;br /&gt;disaster!: My battery got stuck in product. I tried shaking it out, leaving it upright so it can slide down and hoping that baby oil would help. sadly none of those methods worked and I called Tolietree and ask for assistance about the product. Great costumer service (very rare),the guy gave me a solution to the problem but sadly the battery didn&#x27;t come out so he jut down my address and got a new facial brush system today.</li>
            <li> my daughter had requested a specific brand name but when I read the ratings they were dismal so i looked around and found this one.  She loves it.  Works great and she loves the attachments.  highly recommend it</li>
            <li> First got this a couple months ago and it worked great! Felt like the motor was strong and it seemed like it was gonna last for quite some time. Then I thought it needed new batteries because it slowed down and just seemed like the power was gone.  Replaced with brand new batteries, and it spins for about 5 seconds(really slowly) and then shuts off. Not sure what has happened. It was never dropped and I never really changed out of one brush. Disappointed to say the least....especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  The brush is&lt;br /&gt;Alittle rough and really doesn&#x27;t work very well for the face.  Doesn&#x27;t spin flat on the face.  Haven&#x27;t used the body brush yet.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations and the product is exactly what I was looking for.  Received it before delivery date and am very pleased with it</li>
            <li> Works well...just need to remember to use it...I wish they had some way of storing the system better after use rather than replacing the wet attachments in the plastic pre-formed packaging...</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to purchase the ToiletTree face brush given its many positive reviews and great price, especially when compared to other much more expensive brushes. I ordered it not because I had bad skin, but because I wanted a trusty exfoliation method to keep my face looking young and fresh. I gave this face brush about 6 months of use before commenting, as I wanted to provide a thorough and fair review. That being said, here is my honest opinion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some pros:&lt;br /&gt;- As mentioned previously, this product is very competitively priced&lt;br /&gt;- The battery life lasts incredibly long, which I appreciate!&lt;br /&gt;- It comes with four useful brushes, including a sensitive, regular, and body brush as well as a pumace attachment&lt;br /&gt;- The waterproof feature has proven effective&lt;br /&gt;- ToiletTree is clearly dedicated to customer service and satisfaction...not to be taken for granted these days!&lt;br /&gt;- Initially, made by skin \\&quot;feel\\&quot; more clean and soft than it did with hand washing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Major, major Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- With regular use (4-6 times per week), my acne got WAY WORSE than it was before using this brush. I developed a regular collection of breakouts on my chin, my forehead, and on either side of my lips. I also got several intense cystic acne that are still recovering and may even scar. There were many days where I wished I didn&#x27;t have to go into my high exposure management role at work because I was embarrased for my team and co-workers to see my skin and my obvious attempts to hide the blemishes on my face.&lt;br /&gt;- I desperately went to see my dermatologist, and she helped me to understand that any time you scrub your skin, it will \\&quot;feel\\&quot; soft and clean...but this brush and its circular rotation method (rather than pulsing, like the higher quality brands) is not ideal for the face. She explained that this method actually irritates and pulls on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;- I finally gave into purchasing a Clarisonic Aria, which I have been using for just ONE WEEK with the EXACT SAME products and frequency as with the ToiletTree brush, and the results are not even comparable. My skin is not only improving, but I have a glow and clarity that is better than before I went on the ToiletTree brush detour. Again, this is afer just ONE WEEK of use with the Clarisonic Aria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I have seen incredible results using the Clarisonic Aria with my go-to facewash, and I could not be more grateful! I am not one to spend a small fortune on beauty products (hence why I did not immediately purchase the Clarisonic), so I completely understand your desire to try to get the same quality for less money. I also appreciate ToiletTree&#x27;s attempt to cater to those seeking a less expensive option. But when it comes to face brushes, do yourself a favor and invest in one that will help and not hurt your skin. I tried to \\&quot;cut corners\\&quot; so to speak, and I really regret doing so. Luckily, I found another brush that is quickly helping to repair the damage (though not the embarrassment) that this brush caused while still using my favorite facewash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review is helpful to you! Please let me know if you have any questions.he EXACT SAME products and frequency as with the ToiletTree brush, and the results are not even comparable.

            <li> Me - Chinese, fair and sensitive skin, oily T-Zone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Etude House Pore cleansing foam for the last few months before trying it out with the face brush.  I considered the cleanser somewhat gentle since I only experienced occasional dryness.  I tried the same cleanser with the brush and I could tell a difference in the smoothness of my skin.  I tried the stiff  brush for the first go around and all I can say is OUCHHHHHHHHHH.  I thought my skin was going to be ripped off!  Switched to the softer brush and it was gentler on my skin.  If you have sensitive skin like me, one run through with the brush is more than plenty.  I went back a second time for some trouble areas and my skin felt raw afterwards.  Lesson learned!  Overall I do like the brush and plan on using it daily.</li>
            <li> The brushes are too soft. At least one of them should be hard and can be used for brushing toe nails.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Much larger than I was expecting but it just makes it easier to hold in the shower, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now with excelent results.</li>
            <li> MUST clean the brushes after use.  My sensitive face is a little red after using.  I use it about once a week.  It is a nice exfoliator but still gentle with the gentle brush.  I use the other brushes for knees, elbows and feet.&lt;br /&gt;Works well and the batteries seem to be lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> I used this in the shower because it is waterproof, however the button got stuck on and wouldn&#x27;t shut off! Had to throw it away after 2 months.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on skin and you can control it well by the amount of pressure you apply.  Comes with a large brush and a gentle pumice stone.  Also included two small brushes; both with very soft bristles.  Seems to cleanse extremely well after only a couple uses.  I have also dropped it in the shower a couple times and it seems to be very durable.  After about a week, my pores are getting smaller by the minute! Can&#x27;t believe it took me my whole life until now to find a product that did something for my blackheads.</li>
            <li> I got two of these for my two daughters. They live them. The different brushes are nice. The larger brush is for your body and the smaller ones are for your face. The large one is a little harder perfect for the body and smaller ones are more gentle and soft great for the face. They used it with bodywash or facewash. It suds up micely and gives a clean and refreshing felling and look. The pumice stone is mice for the feet. The size is perfect. I thought it would be smaller but it isn&#x27;t. Fits in your hand comfortably and cery very to use. They use it daily. The different colors are nice too. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product works but it struggles as the motor slows down when I apply the brush to my face.  I stopped using it after a couple months as it was not doing the job.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended a high priced facial cleaning brush/system, but I couldn&#x27;t stomach the price.  I read reviews and decided to purchase this one.  It works great, and I do feel like my face is cleaner and more responsive to the medications that I apply.  My initial AA batteries have been in for a month and are still going strong.</li>
            <li> The shipping on this item took forever! But once it was finally here (almost a week later) I tried it &amp; live it! Gives your face a good deep scrub that regular face wash just can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> The professional skin care system by ToiletTree is a good product for the price.  I have used it with good results and have noticed an improvement in my skin tone and complexion when I am able to use it consistently.  The drawback for this product is that it does not include any type of storage case.  I kept the box and re-store all the parts in the box each time I use it.  This is a bit of a hassle as I have to let the brushes thoroughly dry before I can put it up.</li>
            <li> doing the job, just it only have one speed power, ok for the first time user.will do the job. good for the money.</li>
            <li> This unit is amazing for its price. It saved me 100s of dollars for not wasting my expensive Shiseido soaps on my palms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used a better one in which to compare it to, but it is definitely strong enough without being too rough on the skin. It works great I have the olay one which was okay but this one is amaze-balls in comparison! Does its job exfoliates and leaves beautiful skin. Oh I Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser in January 2013 and even though I have had two issues with the product since then, ToiletTree&#x27;s customer service has come through for me both times. The first problem I had was that after about 6 months, the brush would not turn on or off sometimes. So when it did turn on, I would sometimes have to unscrew the battery housing on the bottom of the handle to turn it off. I called their customer service and the lady was extremely helpful and immediately replaced my cleanser with a new one. This second one started acting up a few days ago. The power button, again, wasn&#x27;t always responsive and when it did turn on, the brush speed would randomly vary. I called ToiletTree&#x27;s customer service again, and the gentleman immediately offered to replace it or refund my money. I chose to get another new one since I really like this cleanser, and he assured me that they have had a new production of the cleansers since I received the second one in July.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is great and cleans my face extremely well. I use the soft brush to cleanse my face twice a day, and it exfoliates perfectly without being harsh or abrasive. I&#x27;m really glad that I chose this instead of spending hundreds of dollars on a Clarisonic. If it weren&#x27;t for the two hiccups I have had with it, it would be a 5-star product. But since I&#x27;ve had two issues, the cleanser itself is 4-stars. However, since part of what I paid for was the unit&#x27;s warranty and ToiletTree has stood behind its warranty with outstanding customer service, that is what pushes my rating back up to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> love it in the shower  works great and have had no problems at all in the last 2 months.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial brush that I have ever had.  The batteries work for a long time, perfect size, soft brush, might buy another just in case this one ever breaks.</li>
            <li> I have had this facial brush for awhile and I really like it.  It does a very good job scrubbing your face.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting a facial skin care brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product several months ago for myself and was so impressed with it that I purchased another one as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.  She too loved it so much that my daughter (her Mother) purchased one for herself.</li>
            <li> I have been so pleased with this product. I am in my late 30s and I have sensitive, acne-prone skin, and it has done wonders for my complexion. For two months I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and neck twice daily with Neutrogena All-in-One Acne Control scrub. I get the best results by wetting my face with fairly hot water, smearing a liberal amount of acne scrub all over my face and throat (like a mask), and then using the brush. I use the soft bristle first for cleansing, then I go over the same areas again with the medium bristle brush for exfoliation. It leaves me a little pink for 15 minutes or so, so plan for that, but it feels great and has eliminated my need for moisturizer (I may still need it in the winter, though - we&#x27;ll see). My breakouts are reduced, my persistent blackheads are almost gone, I haven&#x27;t had any peeling, and I feel better about my skin than I have in 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must also tell you that the machine broke after I used it for a week (the mechanism that allows you to change the brush heads fell off). I called the enclosed customer service number, and a human being answered, heard my problem, and express shipped me a whole new unit at no cost! The new one has had no problems. I love this thing, and receiving truly great customer service from ToiletTree has just made me want to recommend it even more. You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I purchased this cleanser recently after reading and researching several similar products. I have used it twice daily since it arrived and am very happy with it. My skin is definitely cleaner and clearer. I look forward to more improvements in my skin over time.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my new ToiletTree face brush.  It appears to be of good quality and my skin feels very smooth and soft after using it.</li>
            <li> the product works just fine now.  But the batteries that shipped with the unit were slightly over-sized AAs. So, the batteries literally got stuck 3/4 of the way down. I was able to extract the top batteries. but the batteries that wnt into the scrubber were absolutely wedged in.  it took me over two hours to get them out.&lt;br /&gt;After that I put in regular sized Duracell batteries. Problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion to other buyers is to not use the batteries shipped with the scrubber. Recycle them and put in Duracell, Energizer, etc.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again. It broke after 6 months. It&#x27;s worth it to spend more money and get a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> My facial pores are noticably cleaner.  You can&#x27;t beat the price, and the attachments are a bonus. The rotation is gentle, and yet it still gets the job done. The large body brush has been great on my dry legs. What I saved on this model, I was able to splurge on my cleanser and moisturizer. I&#x27;m totally happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I dropped the unit when the pumice tip was on and it immediately broke. Otherwise, the brushes work well. I&#x27;ve never had another unit of this type so I can&#x27;t compare. Guess it&#x27;s ok for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 2/12/14. I was contacted by customer service as they read the review. I received two new pumice heads in the mail and I have increased my stars to 4 instead of 3 due to excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> I absolutly love this product!!!! Amazing quality!!! I use it everyday to wash my face and afterwards my skin is radient and smooth. I would definitely recommend this! Five stars!</li>
            <li> Love this product for 2 reasons: 1. Quality 2. Treats my acne.&lt;br /&gt;1. Durable and long-lasting. This product stands up to daily use in the shower and several drops. (oops) It can really give power exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;2. This has helped my acne considerably. I started with the normal brush and it was brutal on my skin, so I changed to the soft brush. It really helps me stay clear now!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is more than I had hoped for. It has held up great, even the batteries rarely need to be replaced. The tools have held up beautifully and the product was received much faster than expected. Would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago and agree with what other users have said. The product feels great on my face and helped a lot with skin problems I was having. The rotation is strong and my batteries lasted for about 3 months, using it twice a day. When I went to replace the batteries finally, the product broke (water somehow got into the battery container, with new batteries the product wouldn&#x27;t turn off). However, as others here have stated, the customer service was outstanding and agreed to ship me a new one, free of charge, without hassle. I&#x27;ll happily give 5 stars for how much I enjoy using this product and the wonderful customer service I received.</li>
            <li> I just got mine today and was so excited to try it out. I popped in the batteries (CORRECTLY!), and popped the lid back on and locked it. When I tried to turn it on, nothing happened! I then tried to take the batteries out and reinsert them but one of the batteries won&#x27;t even come out. I am very frustrated...</li>
            <li> Works great and cleans my face great. I would buy another one and I love how good it cleans</li>
            <li> I have clean face now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Pretty in Pink with ToiletTree&#x27;s new Professional Skin Care System (ordered the pink one). Love the facial and body exfoliators and the pumice attachment is great for keeping your feet nice and soft. My skin never looked and felt so good. What a nice addition to your product line. Great job ToiletTree!</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift, and the owner says she loves it!</li>
            <li> I was concerned with the fact that this product only had rave reviews, I mean, at least someone must have had an issue with it. I bought it any way and so far I&#x27;m very glad I did. It came today and I&#x27;ve used it twice, once on my face, once on my whole body. My skin feels so soft! My sister is actually borrowing right now because of what it did to my skin and she&#x27;s contemplating getting her own in pink (mine is blue). You can&#x27;t beat the price! I love the spinning action on it and I&#x27;m glad it spins instead of vibrates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for a while and it just now ran out of batteries, and that&#x27;s with three people using it regularly. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Skin Cleansing System Facial Brush &amp; Body Care Kit for Women &amp; Men, in 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The item arrived in tip top condition and in a timely manner to an APO/FPO area. The skin cleansing system worked as described, if not better. Within a few uses, the skin on my face began to clear up. I dare to say it&#x27;s much better than Clarisonic and it is well worth the affordable price. It is durable and quality made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Be aware of what soap you put on the facial brush. If you put a soap that foams up easily it will fling everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I received mine a week ago and haven&#x27;t had a break out since. I can see my pores getting smaller each time I use it. I love how it comes with many different attachments. It is a great product at a really great price!</li>
            <li> Product works really well. Especially pumice stone. Feet never looked so good! Face and body brushes feel good too. Good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It&#x27;s hard to say what I love the most about it, because it all adds up to one amazing product that leaves the skin on my face baby soft.  I love that it&#x27;s waterproof, because I don&#x27;t have to be careful to keep it dry.  I love that it&#x27;s powerful; the motor won&#x27;t stop even if you press the brushes to your face quite firmly, unlike other similar products.  It comes with batteries, so you can get started right away, and everything is simple to set up and use.  Shipping was extremely fast, I have nothing but great things to say about this product!</li>
            <li> My wife requested as part of her own cleansing regime. I have even tried it myself and must admit this is pretty powerful for a battery device.&lt;br /&gt;Rotation speed is enough to clean but not spray soap all over the place and has a far amount of torque so you can apply pressure without making the head stop spinning.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone looking for a good scrub up !</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews of previous people who had already purchased this product.  Because of their favorable reviews I also purchased this product with positive results.  It is easy to use and really cleans deep into the pores.  I am happy with this facial cleanser and would buy it again.  I recommend this product to friends and family.  I have not had experience with any other similar item, but I feel this skin care system fulfills its claims and does a nice job.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and it&#x27;s working great.  It&#x27;s a very affordable product compared to similar products on the market (some are $100 or more).  Using the product once a day is keeping my skin bright and healthy looking and helping to reduce dry skin caused by the dry, winter air.</li>
            <li> I really like the results. Both my teenage daughter and I feel that our acne has improved. As I get older I also have noticed really dry and flaky skin. This works really well to loosen the dry skin. Can&#x27;t imagine doing without it from now on.</li>
            <li> This product is great - my face feels so soft! I love the variety of attachments. My husband even commented on how \\&quot;different\\&quot; his skin felt after trying it. I will definitely buy more products from this company.</li>
            <li> I purchased the same unit in pink for my mother for Christmas, then got jealous and bought one for myself. WOW.  She had asked for the Clairsonic, but I noticed this one had stronger reviews.  I would definitely recommend this over the other brand.  It works just as described and includes more brush options for a fraction of the price.  It&#x27;s surprisingly effective; after use every few days for several weeks I&#x27;m noticing my dark spots fading a bit.  There was a marked improvement in the look of my skin after one use.  The product includes a large body brush, soft facial brush, medium facial brush and pumice stone.  I use my regular daily cleanser and it works great.  I highly recommend this product- it works as described!</li>
            <li> Everythi g showed up as published and the quality is great. Gf was very happy with it!  Be careful with it on your face with it can make it pretty red if you hold I t too long in one spot.</li>
            <li> When I use it, about once a week, it makes my face feel really clean. I haven&#x27;t tried the foot or body brush attachment yet but I&#x27;m sure they will work as good as the face brush. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Couldn&#x27;t wait to receive this. Received within 7 days of purchase. Did a great job on my skin. Love the way it makes my skin look. Would definitely recommend to others. Great buy.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my Toilet Tree Professional Care System. It performs better than expected and I have been exceptionally happy with the performance of the product.  I purchased this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Item came right away, looked new, works correctly, I have nothing bad to say about item. On the other hand I have only used item one time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased to be able to review the Professional Skin Care System by ToiletTree.  It arrived two weeks ago and I have used it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many others, I was interested in a Clarisonic (Mia or Mia 2) but just could not justify spending the money.  The Clarisonic is said to work on about 90% of the population.  What if I were part of the 10% that wasn&#x27;t helped by it??  I just couldn&#x27;t spend over $100 on something that *may* not work. But I really wanted to try a skin brush because I have had several friends who talked about how much it helped their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did extensive research on various skin brushes before choosing this one.  I chose it because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It has a very affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;2. It had excellent reviews on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;3. It is a US company&lt;br /&gt;4. The company seems very committed to customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with both the product and the results I&#x27;ve seen on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I will review the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived promptly and in a sturdy, small box.  It came with three brushes and a pumice stone attachment.  The brushes rotate (they do not vibrate or use sonic technology, like the Clarisonic).  It uses four AA batteries.  The battery compartment uses a coin to twist it into lock position.  The construction seems solid.  It is water resistant but I don&#x27;t like to leave it in the shower.  I want it to completely dry in between uses.  To clean it, I touch it on a bar of soap while it is rotating, then hold it on my palm to let the soap scrub between the bristle, then rinse it in water.  It rinses clean if I do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I will review the results on my skin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the results so far!  Thankfully, I am part of the 90% that benefits from using a skin brush.  I have only tried the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush head, but it cleans my skin well and doesn&#x27;t feel too soft or too harsh.  I&#x27;ve used it every day for 1-2 minutes and my skin has not had any negative effects.  My skin feels smoother and looks brighter after using it.  I have acne-prone skin and my acne has been healing faster.  It exfoliates the blemishes and they appear less red.  They also are smaller after being cleansed, and dry out faster.  Once the outer layer of dry skin has been removed with the brush, my skin absorbs acne medicine, serum, and moisturizer so much better.  I have to use much less product.  The acne medicine seems to absorb and work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are few face products that I would consider to be \\&quot;game-changers\\&quot; but this is one of them!  My skin isn&#x27;t perfect - but it is MUCH improved, and I only wish this tool had been around when I was a teenager and in my younger, dating years.  It would have helped my skin so much!  (Luckily my husband fell in love with me anyway - acne and all).  But I&#x27;m glad to have found the skin cleansing brush now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wondering about purchasing one, I recommend giving it a try!  I have never used a Clarisonic so I don&#x27;t know if it works as well.  But I do know is that the ToiletTree model has worked for me.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it!  It is a good product at a very affordable price.  I&#x27;m a believer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (July, 2013)&lt;br /&gt;The original batteries that came with the unit lasted about 3 months with everyday use.  I continue to use this every night before bed and I love the results.  I replaced the head after 3 months as well.  I unreservedly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Keep this in my shower, the loop lets it hang like other accessories.&lt;br /&gt;Easy-to-use, I like that you don&#x27;t have to charge it and you can change batteries.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very soft and effective.</li>
            <li> First review:  So far so good.  I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to rate how long the motor lasts.  I like the rotation of the brush and the speed of the rotation.  It cleans well and seems to be made well.  So many of the cleansing brushes have pre-moistened pads and I wanted a brush that could be used with my own cleansers and I didn&#x27;t want to have to keep buying refills.  I do not have sensitive skin so I use the medium brush for my face and it works well.  When I use toner after cleansing there is very little, if anything, left on the cotton pad so this is getting my face clean and leaves my skin feeling smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Edited review:  This machine cleans well.  The problem came after quite a bit of use (7 months later).  The button malfunctioned.  I had to use a screwdriver to turn it off.  It magically started working for a while and then the same problem.  No more magic.  It turns on but wont turn off by pressing the button.  (Yes, I put in new batteries.)Wish it would have lasted longer because I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH MY GOSH!  The company actually sent me a replacement brush at no charge to me.  Is it really true?  Yes, indeed.  5 Stars for ToiletTree Products.</li>
            <li> Was a bit disappointed, as I had got the impression this brush has a percussion rather than rotary action. It is in fact rotary. Since this is the only mechanized brush I have ever owned, I am not certain how important that difference is. After giving it some thought, I figured that a rotary action should be mechanically less wearing than a percussion action, and that trade off of expected longer life span seems reasonable against any superior cleaning action that MIGHT go with the percussion action, and am satisfied thinking thusly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included interchangeable brush heads are very nice and seem appropriate for intended usages. The choice of less and more firm facial brush heads is very nice. The brush is attractive and works well. I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> My first experience with this company was with their Water Pik.  I purchased one and then another one because I liked it so much.  The first one died, I called and was promply sent another one.  I liked the way the company handled my situation so much that I noticed on the product info sheet that they also made a skin care system.  I had been wanting one but the cost was prohibitive for me.  This one is affordable and works great.  Love this product and this company.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased a Clarisonic believing the brushes rotated. They did not so it was returned. This product has a selection of rotating brushes, plus a pumice stone for your feet. I am very pleased and the price was very fair for what it does. I&#x27;m amazed at how super clean one&#x27;s face becomes after using it. I find that any face cream soaks in much better and my skin is feeling refreshed. My dermatologist said  exfoliation(within reason) was good. About once a week I use it with St. Ives apricot scrub and it works beautifully. Wish you made a plugin, but so far the batteries have been fine. Thank you for a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product, it&#x27;s done a great job of exfoliating my skin and removing all makeup and dirt every time I use it. I ordered it last year in May so I&#x27;ve had it almost a year, and it just stopped working last week. I replaced the batteries with brand new ones, turned it on, and the motor pretty much turned on and then gradually died within seconds. I&#x27;m trying to find whether or not there&#x27;s a warranty on this product, anybody know? I would continue using it and buying the brushes if it would work properly...???</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stop spinning when you apply pressure. I&#x27;ve had it for months and still works like a charm! And yes it is waterproof!</li>
            <li> This facial and body brush definitely cleans the dirt &amp; grit off your face &amp; body. The only small complaint would be that it scratches the face a little bit when using the hard brush. Also, watch out for when it spins too fast-- it will entwine in your hair &amp; rip out some hair. Not a pleasant time. It takes 4 batteries, so try not to use it too fast!</li>
            <li> I found this device to be just right for my skin, not too slow and not too fast.  The other attachments for the body and feet are great.  What I really like is that you can use it in the shower.  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when the product arrived. I used it later on the day it arrived. To my surprise, I felt and saw a difference right away. And as a bonus, it has reduced my redness significantly. The only downside to this product is that it&#x27;s not chargeable. Other than that, I am so happy with this product. Thank you :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a lot of problems with dry skin this winter, but I&#x27;m allergic to many OTC scrubs. This is perfect for me!  I&#x27;ve seen my flakey dry patches greatly reduced. I use my normal cleanser, but I use the exfoliating brush rather than the cleansing brush.  I will definitely be using this all year long as part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I loved, loved, loved this product. I loved the way it cleaned my face, and I loved the body brush (I never had a chance to use the pumice stone). It works as well as the Clarisonic several of my friends have, with one exception.  After less than a month, it stopped working. I was hoping it was just the batteries, but when I put new ones in, it still did not work. The on/off button broke. I have to push it really hard to get it to turn on (even my husband had a hard time pushing it hard enough), and hold it down if I want it to stay on. If I let up, it turns off (and I have to push it hard enough to keep it on it literally hurts my finger). I am returning it to Amazon. I will update my rating if I get a refund (and will probably try it again if I get a refund in the hopes I just had a bad one). The product is great, but I really would expect it to work for longer than a month. If I have to spend $35 every month, then I am better off paying the money for the Clarisonic that lasts (all of my friends that have the Clarisonic have had it at least a year with no problems).&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The customer service is FANTASTIC, and it looks like the company really stands behind their product. I received an email from the company the very next day and they are sending me a new one to replace the one that broke. So amazing since I had not even had a chance to return the one to Amazon yet. I will update later.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have updated my rating form a 2-star to 5-star; I love the product, and the customer service itself is enough to win my business over &amp; over. I received a replacement with postage to return the one that broke so the company could look into it. That tells me the company really stands behind their product. I am very pleased, especially since they contacted me before I even had a chance to contact them or return the item to Amazon. Really amazing in this day &amp; age. Thank you ToiletTree!!</li>
            <li> We all know that a scrub is good for the face.  Well, your body is covered with nothing but skin.  It needs a good scrub too.  Good tool.  Good price</li>
            <li> The facial brush works great and is just as advertised.  It arrived packaged great and in a short amount of time.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product! I was a little skeptical at first because I never tried any products by this brand before but surprisingly this gadget worked so well to clean my face. The soft brush scrubber I use both day and night with my facial cleanser and it does a good job at removing dirt and oil. How do I know....? I can actually see the dirt residue on the brush once I am done cleansing my face and my skin has a radiant glow when I am finished. My skin tends to get very oily which clogs my pores but I have not experienced any breakouts because the brush does a good job at deep cleansing. I use the exfoliating brush once a week because it is too abrasive to use daily. I recommended this to my sister since she has the same skin type I have so I would definitely recommend this for someone who has normal to oily skin. This has been a great investment for me. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the pumice stone does not work very well. I do not have rough feet at all but it does not seem to even scratch the surface of removing dead skin. On the other hand the body brush works wonders as well because I tend to get breakouts on my back and it leaves my skin feeling like silk. I guess that also depends on the type of cleanser you use. Overall great bang for the buck compared to other expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Enjoy using this with my nightly cleansing routine. Works very well!</li>
            <li> well made.it does what it needs to do.The brushes are not overly rough.I just wish there was a way to put the face wash are cream inside the brush compartment so that while the brush is spinning the wash slowly comes out.I have skin issues and try to weit till my skin is clear and healed before I use it.I do see the exstra dirt it lifts off of the face.</li>
            <li> Works as promised! I use it on my face every day, and my skin and pores are reaping the benefits!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a Clarisonic type tool for less. This does just the trick. It exfoliates well and has 4 interchangeable heads. I use the soft face brush twice a day and have seen a great improvement in my pores and overall skin clarity. Unfortunately I think the brushes are a little cheap because although it says it is &amp;#34;splash free&amp;#34;, after a month it does spray/splash when I use it. It&#x27;s better to use in the shower. For the price I still think it is worth it if you are not ready to invest $100+ in a Clarisonic Brush.</li>
            <li> Though this is my first time using anything like this, my guess is it&#x27;s just as good as the more expensive models out there. Also, the customer service is phenomenal. If you have any problems, they are super responsive and accommodating.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a month now and I love it! I&#x27;ve been using apricot scrub for years and this has been a good alternative as it will save me money and works better in my opinion. It exfoliates my skin without causing irritation. Recently I&#x27;ve had breakouts and it helps my acne dry up and heal faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple weeks the unit I received wouldn&#x27;t turn off so I had to take out the batteries every time I used it. I emailed ToiletTree and they sent me a new one for free. It&#x27;s nice that they stand behind their product. Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as an upgrade to my Olay system; and while I was quite satisfied with my Olay system, this one exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that there are multiple brush heads (two for face; one for body; and a pumice stone) gives me a total body cleansing system.  My facial skin can handle a more coarse brush; and I much prefer that to a softer one.  I feel it gives my face a better overall clean.  I also like the power of the system versus the Olay.  The Olay has a good \\&quot;swirl\\&quot; to it; but this one you can feel the power.  It&#x27;s just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much, I will probably by another just to keep in the shower so I don&#x27;t have to keep remembering to remove it from the sink and bring it into the shower with me.  Sounds excessive, I know, but at that price, it&#x27;s doable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product 100% exceeds my expectations.  I had a similar face scrub several years ago and I wore it out. Unfortuately, it was discontinued and I couldn&#x27;t re-order.  I&#x27;ve tried multiple face scrubs with rotating heads since and have been disappointed everytime until now.  This one is superior to my inital scrub and I&#x27;m so happy to have found this.</li>
            <li> I wanted to write a review for this product for a while.  The first time I received it, I used it for about a week with wonderful results, but it started shutting off on its own and I had to keep pressing the button to turn it back on.  I had to return it and reorder since I could not replace it.  Now that I have a new one, it had been giving me great results.  I have dry, sensitive combination skin that needs a little help with shedding off old skin cells so that the new ones come up and bring out a softer complexion.  I believe I may have to use it a little longer in order to see more positive results, but so far, I do like what I am experiencing.  My skin feels softer and the constant buildup of dry flaky skin is diminished with each use.  I use the softer brush when my skin is feeling a little more sensitive and I use the firmer brush if I feel my skin needs more help in getting rid of stubborn dead skin cells.  I have not used the pumice stone, and when I used the body brush from the first purchase, it felt a little awkward at first, but I think it will be better with more uses.  I hope this review helps those looking for good exfoliation without the harshness of most exfoliating cleansers.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like the Professional Skin Care System! I use it whenever I have an extra moment in the shower. My face appreciates the extra attention as well as my feet! My face feels softer and I know that the dead skin cells are gone. I also love that my heels are soft when I get out of the shower. {I was given this product to review}</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely fantastic!  The brush cleans my face so well, and it is left light and airy.  I love the additional brushes for the body and feet.  The price is great as well.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. It has a lot of power and I love that it is waterproof so I can take it in the shower with me. I use this with the [[ASIN:B001ET79H8 Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser, for normal to oily skin]] and I feel like I am getting more out of the facial cleanser when I use the facial brush with it. I think it works just as well as the clarisonic and at a better price. It also comes with other head attachments and I use them all daily. This product is well worth it and everyone needs one. The only problem was the batteries that came with it. It made the brush stop and go so I switched them for some reusable ones and that fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this product, I thought perhaps it was a bit redundant but then after trying it I see it as decadent pampering. It feels wonderful to clean my skin with the brushes and my feet look amazing after using the pumice stone. My skin isn&#x27;t as dry and it does look more radiant. I dare say my feel even look more youthful. I didn&#x27;t think that mattered to me but it turns out this busy geek Mommy does care more than she thought about such things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It was easy to put in the batteries that it thankfully came with. (be sure to have something on hand to open the battery compartment, I used nail clippers and it was quick) Using it was very simple, nothing complicated. It was easy to clean the brushes. The directions are short and sweet.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a battery operated  facial brush that I bought many, many years ago that is no longer available. I would have given this the full 5 stars but I found that the speed was not what I was used to with my other brush. It definitely does as it says and I&#x27;m sure I can get use to the slightly slower speed. I guess I will always be looking for and expecting the same as the brush I&#x27;ve had for many years but I&#x27;ve decided that I will probably never find a product as good as the old one I had.</li>
            <li> I am using this once a day to improve my skin care regime.  I&#x27;ve never purchased a cleaning brush before because they were so expensive.  However, this one is very inexpensive and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  Super easy to use and because it&#x27;s water-proof I keep it in my shower and that&#x27;s where I use it (it can get a bit messy...splatter).  I&#x27;ve been using it about two weeks now (I think) and it still has full battery charge.</li>
            <li> This face scrubber feels like QUALITY. It works very well, your skin will feel very smooth and clean. Just be careful not to scrub too hard!</li>
            <li> Love how soft and effective this product is! I did a little research in finding a good face scrubbing product for my price range, and this caught my eye. And like a lot of people wrote, it&#x27;s great for the price! When I first tried it, I thought the speed was a bit slow, but once I used it, the speed was just right (not to say that it&#x27;s weak, because it&#x27;s not). When using for your feet with the stone, it works Moderately well, I mainly use it for cleaning my face, but the foot stone is a nice feature along with the body scrubbing head (which I feel runs a bit slow for the size of the brush). All in all, this is a great buy. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with it yet in the 4 weeks I have used it (:</li>
            <li> This is the third skin care system that I have tried and it is by far the best one.  It is really water proof, you get one hard and one soft brush, and you can get refill brushes.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the way they stand behind their products.  We have purchased the brush for two teenagers and both have had good results.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! It only has 1 speed, but that is not a problem for me. Definitely waterproof...assuming you aren&#x27;t always opening the battery compartment as some others reviews have pointed out. The body brush covers a lot of area in just a little time, &amp; I happen to use it for my face too while I&#x27;m in the shower. I could not be happier with this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this item just about a month - and using it 3-4 times a week. I have very sensitive skin and I love the deep but not harsh cleansing I get from the softest face attachment. My only complaint is that the bristles are already showing signs of wear. I wouldn&#x27;t think a month in, a couple times a week, should show that much wear and tear.</li>
            <li> I have used my facial brush once a day for several months now &amp; love the results.  It has helped immensely in shrinking the large pores around my nose &amp; on my chin.  I use it with a very mild non-sudsing cleanser every morning.  It exfoliates &amp; prepares my skin to absorb my vitamin c serum &amp; moisturizer more readily.  I used to have a lot of flaking around my nose but that has gone away since I started using this brush.  I love it so much, I bought one to send to my daughter.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of purchasing this product due to the price alone. I have always loved Sephora and truly trust all of the products they sell. Instead of purchasing the clairisonic I decided to give this a try and for $34 I wasn&#x27;t going to be too upset if it ended up not working. This product has strong rotations of the brush and I have used all of the adapters so far and love them all. I would recommend starting out with the sensitive skin attachment first until you get use to the power of this tool. I started with the regular and even though I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I was being too rough on my skin just because I wasn&#x27;t use to this tool. It&#x27;s not the brush that&#x27;s the problem, it&#x27;s the user sometimes. Once I switched to the sensitive brush until I got use to it, it&#x27;s been amazing, my skin broke out at first as expected, to get rid of all of the dirt and oil hiding deep down inside. Now my skin is smoother and it started to get rid of the evil black heads around the nose area that are not easy to destroy.</li>
            <li> I use this once a day and have really found it to be a great product.  Its very affordable too!</li>
            <li> I really like the Toiletree Professional Skin Care System. Easy to use; several types of brushes for different needs are quickly switched out. Not heavy to hold. Have used it every day for a week and my skin definitely feels softer and cleaner (I&#x27;m a senior so it&#x27;s not for acne just for better cleansing(. Price is great, shipping was fast. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works well. Lightweight, but not chintzy. I don&#x27;t know if it is better than the expensive competition as I&#x27;ve not tried them. I have tried the cheaper olay brand and this is definitely far superior to that junk. Overall very satisfied with this cleaner.</li>
            <li> I love my Pro Skin Care System from ToiletTree! It is constructed well, does a great job and you can order replacement heads when it&#x27;s time for them. It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s waterproof too... if you know how to properly exfoliate then you will not have a problem with this puppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash your face/skin/feet before using, use a product made for makeup removal before using. Then rinse, apply cleanser to your wet skin and off you go. Hold the brush head flat to your skin, do not apply pressure. When finished just rinse well and apply your moisturizer, this form of exfoliation will leave your skin fresh glowing and ready to accept your moisturizer as it will absorb easier. As time goes on you skin will become smoother, discolorations will lighten and wrinkles soften.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and I cannot see spending more when you get more bang for your buck from this sweet little beauty!</li>
            <li> I purchased this scrubber because I felt like the majority of my skin problems were caused by lack of exfoliation. Washing your face with an exfoliating face wash is great, but not as consistent of an exfoliation as you&#x27;ll get with this system. I&#x27;ve had it about a week now and it&#x27;s worked great for me so far. The soft brush is just soft enough, and the exfoliating brush isn&#x27;t too rough. The only downsides I can think of would be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: Not rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;2: No case&lt;br /&gt;3: Hard to differentiate between the soft and hard brushes other than a barely noticeable change in color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise a great product which I will continue to use daily.</li>
            <li> Its so relaxing to use. I got it in blue and love it. Keeps my skin feeling clean and freah. I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate or make my skin red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommending to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47 and was seeing the difference in my face, I&#x27;ve been using this skin care and I can actually see the difference, my face is clearer and just looks rejuvenated. I wasn&#x27;t  expecting miracles or to look 20 again, but I feel good about my skin now. I don&#x27;t dread looking in the mirror in the morning, and I enjoy using it every night or morning.  I recommend it, awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from a bad acne and my dermatologist recommended me to apply an special soap onto my face with a brush, so on my search to get it on amazon, I found out this one, and just using it for a couple of days and I can see the difference on my face, it looks like it was polished, like I got a peeling and it just has been this professional skin care system that has done the job. Very happy for purchasing it.</li>
            <li> The face brush I used it 2 time and the 3rd time the brush fell into a million pieces. I wouldn&#x27;t buy or recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Ive heard many mixed reviews on this product and how it breaks easily. but so far Ive had it for Months and I use it EVERYDAY and so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints. The only downfall is that you have to change out the batteries but in all its wonderful. It cleans my face beautifully.</li>
            <li> I initially bought the system because of all of the reviews and I am glad I did. I was surprised by the size of the brush because I was half expecting a little rinky dink brush like the kind you can buy at the supermarket but it is larger than that and fits nicely in my hand. My no fail test of facial brushes is that if I am able to press down hard on the brush with my hand and it doesn&#x27;t stop, then it is powerful enough and will do a great job. I tried to press down as hard as I could looking for anything, something wrong to be dissatisfied with this brush, but the motor kept turning and the brush was still brushing my skin powerfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that it came with a stand of some sort but it does come with a strap so you may hang it up that way, I just don&#x27;t have anywhere to hang it but I will probably find something to use as a stand. No big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to brushing my face with a light PH balanced foaming cleanser (Alpha Hydrox foaming cleanser if you would like to know) and it felt so good, I didn&#x27;t want to stop but I caught myself before I did it too long. I could see some gross junk in my pores physically being brushed out in the mirror. My skin visibly looked more fresh, clean and brighter than before. I have a very thick, ethnic skin so the medium brush works best for me because my skin is not sensitive by any means. A very soft brush is also included along with a body and pumice stone brush. The batteries are replaced easily by just using a coin to turn the little dial button on the bottom and the cover pops out easily, no struggling with it like I had to do with the Olay brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever my hormones fluctuate and I can feel a breakout coming on or see a pimple, I always use a brush to get in the pores and it goes away very quickly. If you have acne or the occasional breakout, this is very good at clearing your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the money to buy the Clairsonic and was about to but then I saw this, saved me a lot of money I can use on more beauty products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really felt this prepped my skin well for my facial regimen. I applied my AHA lotion on afterward and it felt great sinking in. A Zogan massage later and my face is good to go!oney I can use on more beauty products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really felt this prepped my skin well for my facial regimen. I applied my AHA lotion on afterward and it felt great sinking in. A Zogan massage later and my face is good to go!</li>
            <li> Great skin care kit. I like the accessories included for the face and body. Cool. I would definitely purchase this again and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> When my sisters and I recently enjoyed a spa day, we were given a hard sell for a Clairsonic skincare system. When I got home, I did some research on some more reasonably priced alternatives. This system, from ToiletTree, had good reviews and the price was quite reasonable. The only thing that kept it from receiving a full five stars is the fact that the pumice stone will often fall out of the handle when I move it away from my skin after use. It just does not seem to snap in as well as the brushes, or maybe I am applying too much pressure during use. Aside from that, it works beautifully, and I really like the product.</li>
            <li> Quality, ease of use, and price are great but needs a lower speed to use daily. Too harsh for daily use due to circular motion.</li>
            <li> I have always had problematic skin. With this brush I get a deep clean without irritating my skin. I love that it has a larger brush to use on your body.  My skin is clearer than ever and I can use it in the shower. The fact that it comes with batteries is an added bonus.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this skin care system. I&#x27;ve had other products that left my skin feeling less than clean and sometimes even irritated. So far I&#x27;ve only used the softest brush and I find it&#x27;s very powerful without harsh on my skin. I love how I&#x27;ve reduced how much cleanser I need as the speedy rotating brush lathers very nicely. I wish I had found this great tool earlier!</li>
            <li> I bought this product coming to the conclusion that I needed a facial cleansing brush.  There was no way I was going to spend over $100 on one, so I researched around amazon and other websites to determine what the best product would be. I decided on toilet tree, and after a week I love it. My grandmother commented and said my face was glowing and I looked awake early this morning. Getting compliments from her is no easy feat. Sometimes the medium brush feels too hard on my sensitive skin, so the soft brush is perfect for daily use. I&#x27;ve noticed that the blackheads on my nose have cleared up and my face looks smoother. I am very happy with this purchase and I recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product. My skin feels great after using it with a good face wash. The only downside is my skin is very sensitive so I can only use the soft bristle brush which will wear out faster, that isn&#x27;t really any fault of the product though.</li>
            <li> I am always trying new products that promise to clear up and prevent breakouts and improve skin tone. This one I really feel does that. Within three days I already noticed a difference in my skin: clearer and smoother. It even helped clear up my blackheads which nothing else seemed to do. Very happy with this product. I even bought one for my sister that also said the same thing.</li>
