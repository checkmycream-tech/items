            <li>Shipping was quick from this company.</li>
            <li>this one works better than the other did when it was new lol</li>
            <li>It is great but keep it dry; do not allow water to come near it.  </li>
            <li>This product looks great but only worked for one time only.  </li>

            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend it...</li>
            <li>This little Wahl is great for a quick trim of facial hair prior to applying makeup.</li>
            <li>It is a bid fragile so if you&#x27;re not doing anything heavy duty, it is a good product.</li>
            <li>And if you do still try it for that, make sure you have plenty of time for them to grow back before you have to go out in public or have company over or have people see you at all. .</li>
            <li>Tried a brand new battery, but no luck.  </li>
            <li>overall i recommend a different one, that is not as cheap as this one.</li>
            <li>This is the second one we owned, the first died within a month, this one died within 10 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li>This little trimmer seems fine.  </li>
            <li>this cause my old one died out&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad it was only a few bucks.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, durable and small in size.  </li>
            <li>This little shaver  is small, handy and does the job well.  </li>
            <li>there is not much more to say about this trimmer worth the $10.00</li>
            <li>Very sharp and cuts very close.</li>

            <li> Very sharp and cuts very close.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, this does not look like the picture in that its definitely a pink color instead of Red.</li>

            <li> Certainly not as close as a razor, but close enough.</li>
            <li> It was broken right out of the box.</li>
            <li> The attachment (should I have ever been able to use the thing) is oddly shaped and only allows one length cutting.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other trimmers and was not satisfied with them, I recommend this item highly,</li>
            <li> Which would normally not be a problem, but don&#x27;t try using it to trim your eye brows, even with the comb attachment that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> The little attachment comb has two different slots for determining the length of the hair.</li>
            <li> Other than the color difference, it works well!</li>
            <li> Blades don&#x27;t seem very sharp, not as close a shave as the Remington I used to have.</li>

            <li> The thing lasted a few weeks before it broke.</li>
            <li> Finally found one that isn&#x27;t so weak!</li>
            <li> I use a small drop of the oil used on hair clippers.</li>
            <li> Compared with the Conair, which has a reversible attachment for long and short brow trimming, this is crap.</li>
            <li> Now that I have learned the hard way to *not</li>
            <li> feels a little awkward in my hand</li>
            <li> Poorly constructed junk.</li>
            <li> This is very creepy- at least for me.</li>
            <li> but it was useless.</li>
            <li> I am afraid I will lose track of the attachment.</li>
            <li> Wahl should be ashamed peddling worthless crap like this.  </li>

            <li> Item is as described, works well.</li>
            <li> Product broke down in few months.. Worked great when it was working.</li>
            <li> Already quit working!</li>
            <li> Fairly cheap quality.  Wife dropped it on the bathroom counter and it came apart a several pieces.  It goes back together but hasn&#x27;t worked properly since.  May have a part out of place but it appears to be put together as intended.</li>
            <li> It works great. It is a bid fragile so if you&#x27;re not doing anything heavy duty, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I have only owned this about 24 hours. To my surprise, this does not look like the picture in that its definitely a pink color instead of Red. Other than the color difference, it works well! I would have given it 5 stars if the picture represented the actual product.</li>
            <li> love this item. This is my second one loved it so much that I had to by the exact same one. The price was reasonable and the shipping was fast. I have purchased other trimmers and was not satisfied with them, I recommend this item highly,</li>
            <li> This little trimmer seems fine.  I haven&#x27;t used it much yet but it seems well made. I am afraid I will lose track of the attachment. I have used previous Wahl products that have lasted for years.</li>
            <li> It works well, but...it died after only two uses. It was a complete waste of money. I don&#x27;t suspect that I&#x27;ll be buying another one anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I used it twice and it the second time i tried using it it didn&#x27;t turn on, i tried changing the battery but it was useless. It works fine, but only if it would have lasted. The cap broke as soon as i got it but i didn&#x27;t mind that. overall i recommend a different one, that is not as cheap as this one. You get what you pay for is at hand.</li>
            <li> The no nonsense simplicity of this product makes us wonder where this has been all this time. It will trim those unruly hairs from any \\&quot;nether region\\&quot; of the body. Certainly not as close as a razor, but close enough. The eyebrow attachment also means that nothing has to be disassembled to put the attachment on either. The little attachment comb has two different slots for determining the length of the hair. Don&#x27;t pluck those eyebrows, they just come back thicker than ever. Give &#x27;em a trim with this little gadget.</li>
            <li> Blades don&#x27;t seem very sharp, not as close a shave as the Remington I used to have.</li>
            <li> cheaply made and does not work well</li>
            <li> Good seller, good product, reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This little Wahl is great for a quick trim of facial hair prior to applying makeup. It&#x27;s convenient, easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> When it works it&#x27;s great, however they quickly breakdown.  This is the second one we owned, the first died within a month, this one died within 10 minutes of use.  Wahl should be ashamed peddling worthless crap like this.  It&#x27;s cheaply made and extremely poor quality, stay away.</li>
            <li> Works great especially around the edges.</li>
            <li> It took a little while before the item arrived. But nevertheless it came as described.</li>
            <li> Love it... will order again</li>
            <li> this little trimmer works very good it does its job there is not much more to say about this trimmer worth the $10.00 would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Perfect razor for the bikini area!  Easy to use, durable and small in size.  Highly recommended!  I&#x27;m buying a second one at this price.</li>
            <li> works well. easy to take any where. i tell any one looking to go for it and buy. good price as well.</li>
            <li> Finally found one that isn&#x27;t so weak!</li>
            <li> I have used a product like this before.  It is great but keep it dry; do not allow water to come near it.  I oil the blades from time to time.  this is just my preference.  I use a small drop of the oil used on hair clippers.</li>
            <li> It works great, especially for hair on your face.</li>
            <li> works ok. gotta keep moving the head to get it going again.</li>
            <li> Good item, works well, bought many different brands in the past.. This one seems to be the best so far</li>
            <li> I tried to use is third time today and It did not work. This is very creepy- at least for me. Spend five more dollars and get better one. I don&#x27;t refer this to no body.</li>
            <li> Love it.  didnt get xtra blades -- need to try to find or reorder one of these</li>
            <li> This works awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Bought this cause my old one died out&lt;br /&gt;And this one works better than the other did when it was new lol</li>
            <li> I have had this item one week and it conked out already.  :(&lt;br /&gt;I used it once, it worked fine but the second time - zip wouldn&#x27;t start.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this in February and it worked okay, then worked intermittently, and now has totally quit...looks pretty but just not well made....this is only May so it didn&#x27;t even last three months.....</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work. Tried several times to make it work but it never worked.&lt;br /&gt;Changed batteries still not working.&lt;br /&gt;Junk.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and cuts very close. Which would normally not be a problem, but don&#x27;t try using it to trim your eye brows, even with the comb attachment that comes with it.  Now that I have learned the hard way to *not* use it to trim your eye brows, it is wonderful for other trimming uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure **not** to use it on your eye brows. And if you do still try it for that, make sure you have plenty of time for them to grow back before you have to go out in public or have company over or have people see you at all. .</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much more than it works as it should. feels a little awkward in my hand but oh well.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS A REPLACEMENT FOR THE ONE I HAD ORDERED SOME YRS AGO FROM THE &amp;#34;AS SEEN ON TV&amp;#34; INFOMERICALS.&lt;br /&gt;THIS DO WHAT I NEED  THAT LITTLE HAIR THAT SEEMS TO APPEAR SINCE I PASSED 50 IS SO ANNOYING. THIS GETS RID OF IT NO PAIN.</li>
            <li> There should no a No Star option.  This product looks great but only worked for one time only.  Tried a brand new battery, but no luck.  Just \\&quot;dead as a doornail\\&quot; after one use.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to trim eyebrows, as the trimmer we have is a popular item in our house and I wanted a spare. It was broken right out of the box. Poorly constructed junk. Compared with the one I have, this doesn&#x27;t hold up. The attachment (should I have ever been able to use the thing) is oddly shaped and only allows one length cutting. Compared with the Conair, which has a reversible attachment for long and short brow trimming, this is crap. Amazon was great, though, and refunded the cost immediately. Cheap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It works great and last for a very long time</li>
            <li> This little shaver  is small, handy and does the job well.  It takes just one battery and I use it once a week for facial hair removal.  It cuts close to the skin and has an attachment for trimming eyebrows.  I am pleased with my purchase and recommend this product.  Shipping was quick from this company.</li>
            <li> This lil thing works but feels really cheap because it is!  It broke when I GENTLY tapped it!  Non returnable.  Glad it was only a few bucks.</li>
            <li> I use this just for my nose hair and it is very easy to use and the blade is just right anddidn&#x27;t cut the inside of my nose like the last two I had. Thanks</li>
            <li> Wonderful colour, wonderful item, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Wow...is this a great detailer!  I absolutely recommend it...but then what do you expect from a Wahl product!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this for myself as a replacement for one tha got dropped by my granddaughter.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> The thing lasted a few weeks before it broke.</li>
