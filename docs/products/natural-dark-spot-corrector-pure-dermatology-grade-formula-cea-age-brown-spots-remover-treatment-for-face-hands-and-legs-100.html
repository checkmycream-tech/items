            <li>I have used this product for a month and have not seen any improvement in skin tone or change in the dark spots on my arms, wish I had bought a product that was more expensive but had higher positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Will finish &amp;#34;bottle&amp;#34;, but get no more unless significant improvement.</li>
            <li>I have suffered with dark spots for more than 20 years and  spent tons of money on different  product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, but it feels nice on my face and it does seem to have lightened a few spots already!</li>

            <li> Been using twice a day for last three weeks, so far i have not seen any impact at all on few black spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I will keep using it until the bottle is empty</li>
            <li> Ifinished the whole corrector, just for the small brown spot on both my checks but did not see any difference, I used it day and night believing that it will go out after I finished but not good result.  </li>
            <li> I am using the product and have noticed a difference already in my dark age spots that are fading.</li>
            <li> It appears to be making a difference in the dark spots on my hands.</li>
            <li> but i do put it around my dark circles and have seen some lightening.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t effect my dark spot</li>
            <li> It takes times for dark spots to go away</li>
            <li> A small drop goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a month and have seen just the slightest change in the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the long term effects yet but will update when I do!</li>
            <li> I just started using it, and am using it on my face and a few other areas I have noticed spots.  </li>
            <li> I use this over the ones I have previously bought at the drugstore after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I hate perfumed lotions for my face and this has a very mild lotion smell.</li>
            <li> just a little does the trick</li>
            <li> See little change.  </li>
            <li> I am concentrating on  a spot on my hand as a test subject!  </li>
            <li> Sorry but will not recommend to anybody.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this product.</li>

            <li> I am using the product and have noticed a difference already in my dark age spots that are fading.</li>
            <li> I spend my mony for nathing.Don&#x27;t work on my&lt;br /&gt; Hands &amp; I lost mony.;(((((</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week or so now.  The change is not instant. I will continue to use it. It appears to be making a difference in the dark spots on my hands.</li>
            <li> I just started using this -Maximum Spot  Corrector-I think I could use a gallon or so of this serum!  It doesn&#x27;t smell-it doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate my skin or eyes.  My eyes are very senstive to most cosmetics. I&#x27;m 64 &amp; just started noticing these age spots pop up any where they please. I figure now as soon as I notice a new one-I&#x27;ll put this cream on it. I am concentrating on  a spot on my hand as a test subject!  I swear it is fading!  Thanks for a great product!</li>
