            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>IT SEEMED TO HAVE MORE BOUNCE AND BODY</li>
            <li>Okay so I absolutely love the product.</li>
            <li>She had paid quit a bit more for hers.</li>
            <li>The best pair of flat irons I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li>**excuse the length, but it&#x27;s just awesome!</li>
            <li>I received this very quickly and I love it.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair even more smooth -</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t damage her hair.</li>
            <li>Gets my hair nice and straight with a lot of shine!</li>
            <li>The flat iron itself is really good and the quality is amazing.</li>
            <li>If you place the straightener a certain way, you will see that you can add a bit of bounce to your own bangs/cut in just seconds and in one motion.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair, but rather it leaves it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I finally found this one and its been great.</li>
            <li>this is my new favorite tool!</li>
            <li>In addition, it heats up to 430 degrees which makes the straightening process significantly faster.</li>
            <li>Make sure to let LeAngelique do all the work, you just have to hold it, press down, and watch the transformation before your very own eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure to let LeAngelique do all the work, you just have to hold it, press down, and watch the transformation before your very own eyes.    </li>
            <li>It lasts a very long time and gives great results.</li>
            <li>I love the color and it leaves my hair straight and smooth.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use to have gorgeous curls that last all day!</li>
            <li>Could really use better insulating over the heating plate area.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly</li>
            <li>This straightener Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>After using straightener after straightener, including the new InStyler, I was not quite satisfied until I purchased this.  </li>
            <li>The 100% ceramic plates offer great protection and less damage to the hair.</li>
            <li>With this, you are able to go from wavy to flat in just one easy run-through.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s all good because now I have a pink one.</li>
            <li>with this she only has to do it once to get nice smooth hair, she really loves it.</li>
            <li>I love it so far.</li>
            <li>Its defenitely worth it.</li>
            <li>i received my product so far it&#x27;s look ok</li>
            <li>I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A NICE LIFE WITH THIS FLAT IRON</li>
            <li>and I explained to them how I would be making a hefty investment if I bought it right on the spot</li>
            <li>This is the first straigtener that I have owned, and probably will remain to be the only one that I will ever own.</li>
            <li>It is worth the investment; I saw this product at a county fair a few weeks ago and as they were pressing my hair, I could see a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t even have to use my smoothing serum really!   </li>
            <li>I got a reasonable price (39.00) and it is certainly worth that.</li>
            <li>It gets hot</li>
            <li>It gets really hot even if you have it on a lower setting.</li>
            <li>Not what I am used to after using a different brand of many years.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON.</li>
            <li>UNLIKE MOST FLAT IRONS THAT STRAIGHTEN YOUR HAIR AND MAKE IT LIFELESS</li>
            <li>It straightens my hair in ONE smooth motion and my hair is soft, silky and straight.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a good flat iron that would not burn my hair for a long time.</li>
            <li>However, I do recommend this product to all girls with varying hair texture as it works very well.  </li>
            <li>If you want straight hair without buildup/burns/hassle/damage, invest in the LeAngelique straightener.  </li>
            <li>The shippment was fast and I really appreciate that</li>
            <li>I HAVE NOT USED IT TO TRANSITION MY HAIR FROM CURLY TO STRAIGHT</li>
            <li>Fortunately it&#x27;s available here for about a third of the price.</li>
            <li>I think that this works alot better than any of those other irons out there.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Especially the tourmaline flat irons, which I feel damages more than styles.  </li>
            <li>Purchased after was told by a stylist it was a good long lasting flat iron.  </li>
            <li>amazon, I was able to buy this in half the price!  </li>
            <li>My last flat iron pulled out my hair with every stroke, but this one glides smoothly over.</li>
            <li>If I use this, it will tug my hair and I will start shedding a lot because you can hear the flat iron burning my hair to a crisp.</li>
            <li>I HAVE NATURALLY CURLY HAIR WHEN IT IS WASHED.</li>
            <li>This Pro-Select flat iron is the real deal.</li>
            <li>-the only drawback I&#x27;ve noticed so far is that the outside of the iron gets REALLY hot and will burn the heck out of your neck or hand if it touches you.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the fact that it has such a high heat setting that it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I had no reason to be skeptical because this flat iron is absolutely AMAZING!</li>
            <li>It is such a waste of money because I know I could buy a Remington straightener for the same price but have it do so much more.</li>
            <li>What I like most about this flat iron compared to all the cheapo ones I&#x27;ve had in the past is that it doesn&#x27;t snag and pull at my hair.</li>
            <li>THE ONLY THING IS MAYBE BECAUSE IT IS NEW</li>
            <li>It does take maybe a minute longer to heat up than my old one (which heated up almost instantly) but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>who&#x27;s hair is extremely curly and it made her hair pin straight.</li>
            <li>If you were to go to the direct Le Angelique website, this flat iron retails for $145.95.</li>
            <li>I must admit when I first purchased this flat iron I was a bit skeptical because the price was so low from the original retail price.</li>
            <li>Really smoothes and straightens the hair with alot less damage.  </li>

            <li> Really smoothes and straightens the hair with alot less damage.  </li>
            <li> I bought this same flat iron about 4yrs ago and made the mistake of dropping it, thus cracking the 100% ceramic plates.  </li>
            <li> I recently got cut-across bangs that were pretty dull and without life/bounce.  </li>
            <li> It flat irons like a dream</li>
            <li> and I have saved money going to a salon and letting them flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> I used for about 5 months, approximately once a week, and it would get very hot on the outside and eventually would not turn on anymore.  </li>
            <li> BUT THAT IS NOT A MAJOR ISSUE</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron in stores at a local TJ Maxx and it was probably good the first few times I&#x27;ve used it, but now it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> NOT ONLY IS IT PINK</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for products that do only half the job and only claim they can straighten your hair yet</li>
            <li> Only reason I needed to buy this one was, because after 7 years I dropped my first one, one too many times and cracked the ceramic :&#x27;(.</li>
            <li> For the rest of my hair, with other straighteners, I would have to repeatedly go over one area to get the desired look (flat) for my hair.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;d just loose the damn thing anyway.</li>
            <li> it pulls and tugs on my hair and leaves it feeling very dry.</li>
            <li> I wasted time and money trying several other so-called ceramic flat irons, but they burned and damaged my hair.  </li>
            <li> but the product was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast--it arrived sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> but it still smelled and the product was not what I had expected it to be.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I will only be using mine between hair cutes, to tame down curls that sticks out.</li>
            <li> Plus, the ceramic plates don&#x27;t damage your hair, as they and other reviewers rightfully claim.  </li>
            <li> Anyways she has really thick hair that even with one of the chi brands she had to run it threw the same place 3 times...</li>
            <li> AS YOU PULL IT DOWN YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black girl</li>
            <li> Even if for some odd reason you don&#x27;t end up liking it..at least you only wasted $40 instead of $100.  </li>
            <li> Take it from someone who believed it and actually paid for the InStyler and was let down because of false claim and advertisement that it works for every hair texture.  </li>

            <li> is missing converter for the power</li>

            <li> This product is awesome for me!  After using straightener after straightener, including the new InStyler, I was not quite satisfied until I purchased this.  The InStyler does nothing close to LeAngelique.  It straightens my  hair under 15 minutes (with other models, it took at least 30 minutes, twice the time).  I am an African-American girl with thick and semi-wavy hair and I understand that there is a scarcity of flat-iron products out there for my demographic.  However, I do recommend this product to all girls with varying hair texture as it works very well.  It is worth the investment; I saw this product at a county fair a few weeks ago and as they were pressing my hair, I could see a difference right away.  They were working with a $99 straightener and I explained to them how I would be making a hefty investment if I bought it right on the spot; that&#x27;s how convinced I was to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With amazon, I was able to buy this in half the price!  If you want straight hair without buildup/burns/hassle/damage, invest in the LeAngelique straightener.  I recently got cut-across bangs that were pretty dull and without life/bounce.  If you place the straightener a certain way, you will see that you can add a bit of bounce to your own bangs/cut in just seconds and in one motion.  For the rest of my hair, with other straighteners, I would have to repeatedly go over one area to get the desired look (flat) for my hair.  With this, you are able to go from wavy to flat in just one easy run-through.  Plus, the ceramic plates don&#x27;t damage your hair, as they and other reviewers rightfully claim.  You will be pleased with it and glad that you made the choice to buy it.  It&#x27;s convenient; you can pack it in its pouch, store it away when not in use, and take it during travel!  Also, you can customize your own order (choose the skin of your straightener).  Don&#x27;t fall for products that do only half the job and only claim they can straighten your hair yet don&#x27;t verify it in one take on their commercials.  Take it from someone who believed it and actually paid for the InStyler and was let down because of false claim and advertisement that it works for every hair texture.  Make sure to let LeAngelique do all the work, you just have to hold it, press down, and watch the transformation before your very own eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**excuse the length, but it&#x27;s just awesome!eir commercials.

            <li> I received this very quickly and I love it. I had one of these in the past but I broke it. They had the best price.</li>
            <li> This is the first straigtener that I have owned, and probably will remain to be the only one that I will ever own. It doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair, but rather it leaves it smooth and shiny. Not to mention the fact that it has such a high heat setting that it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is my second one. Only reason I needed to buy this one was, because after 7 years I dropped my first one, one too many times and cracked the ceramic :&#x27;(. But it&#x27;s all good because now I have a pink one. Gets my hair nice and straight with a lot of shine!</li>
            <li> I bought this same flat iron about 4yrs ago and made the mistake of dropping it, thus cracking the 100% ceramic plates.  I wasted time and money trying several other so-called ceramic flat irons, but they burned and damaged my hair.  This Pro-Select flat iron is the real deal. Much to my delight I found it here at the best price ever!  The shipping was fast--it arrived sooner than I expected. I recommend it to everyone who compliments me on my hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife who didnt want me to buy her a straightener but after seeing the price and doing some research i couldnt resist. Anyways she has really thick hair that even with one of the chi brands she had to run it threw the same place 3 times...with this she only has to do it once to get nice smooth hair, she really loves it. It took about 2 minutes to heat up to the max which is 420 degrees i belive. Great product.</li>
            <li> The product had a rubbery smell and I thought that it would go away after a couple of uses but it still smelled and the product was not what I had expected it to be. The shippment was fast and I really appreciate that but the product was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I must admit when I first purchased this flat iron I was a bit skeptical because the price was so low from the original retail price. I had no reason to be skeptical because this flat iron is absolutely AMAZING! I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it and I know you&#x27;ll be happy too once you try it out :D</li>
            <li> My daughter has thin hair that had been previously damaged by a cheaper hair straightener. She just had to have this one and is SO happy with it. It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t damage her hair.</li>
            <li> I have gone through so many straighteners and i got this straightener over two years ago and it still works perfectly. it is the best straightener i have ever had.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron in stores at a local TJ Maxx and it was probably good the first few times I&#x27;ve used it, but now it&#x27;s terrible. I feel like it&#x27;s just a regular clothing iron burning and damaging my hair. I have thin hair and so I have a ton of split and damaged ends. If I use this, it will tug my hair and I will start shedding a lot because you can hear the flat iron burning my hair to a crisp. It is such a waste of money because I know I could buy a Remington straightener for the same price but have it do so much more. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Looks can definitely be deceiving because it says hair professionals use it but I don&#x27;t believe it at all.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON. NOT ONLY IS IT PINK &#x3D;) BUT IT WORKS GREAT. I HAVE NATURALLY CURLY HAIR WHEN IT IS WASHED. I HAVE NOT USED IT TO TRANSITION MY HAIR FROM CURLY TO STRAIGHT BUT I DID USE IT WHILE MY HAIR WAS STRAIGHTENED. UNLIKE MOST FLAT IRONS THAT STRAIGHTEN YOUR HAIR AND MAKE IT LIFELESS WHEN I STRAIGHTED MY BANG IT SEEMED TO HAVE MORE BOUNCE AND BODY WHEN I WAS DONE THE ONLY THING IS MAYBE BECAUSE IT IS NEW IT FIRMLY !! HOLDS UR HAIR AS YOU PULL IT DOWN YOUR HAIR BUT THAT IS NOT A MAJOR ISSUE I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A NICE LIFE WITH THIS FLAT IRON</li>
            <li> I just got this yesterday and i love it! I hadn&#x27;t bought a straightener since maybe &#x27;07 or &#x27;08. I was using the Bed Head Rockstar straightener and when it finally broke a week ago i was disappointed they didn&#x27;t make it anymore. Until that is i came across this, now i&#x27;m glad it broke! It&#x27;s similar to what i had..shape and size..but it just feels different. It makes my hair even more smooth - i don&#x27;t even have to use my smoothing serum really!   I was looking at a couple different straighteners online and i thought the Chi was a little too expensive and i saw a bunch of bad reviews online so decided against it. Could not find any really bad reviews online for this so if you are thinking about buying this just do it! Even if for some odd reason you don&#x27;t end up liking it..at least you only wasted $40 instead of $100.  It does take maybe a minute longer to heat up than my old one (which heated up almost instantly) but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I think it was also suppose to come with some kind of travel pouch..it didn&#x27;t but again, doesn&#x27;t bother me i&#x27;d just loose the damn thing anyway.</li>
            <li> this is my new favorite tool! Quick and easy to use to have gorgeous curls that last all day!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a good flat iron that would not burn my hair for a long time. I finally found this one and its been great. Its very light and compact. The ceramic plates are great and do not burn your hair or leave a burn smell at all. I love it so far. I love the color and it leaves my hair straight and smooth. Its defenitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Purchased after was told by a stylist it was a good long lasting flat iron.  I used for about 5 months, approximately once a week, and it would get very hot on the outside and eventually would not turn on anymore.  I would not suggest this brand. I have has others that worked and lasted longer....</li>
            <li> The best pair of flat irons I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li> I got a reasonable price (39.00) and it is certainly worth that. It heats up quickly -the only drawback I&#x27;ve noticed so far is that the outside of the iron gets REALLY hot and will burn the heck out of your neck or hand if it touches you. Could really use better insulating over the heating plate area.</li>
            <li> Okay so I absolutely love the product. It flat irons like a dream and I have saved money going to a salon and letting them flat iron my hair. It gets hot but hey what can you say when you paid 50 dollars for a 100 dollar product. The only thing I was dissappointed about was not recieving a travel bag. I feel cheated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the Le Angelique Pro- Select Straightener. My daughter bought a simular straightener from her hair styleist. She had paid quit a bit more for hers. I will only be using mine between hair cutes, to tame down curls that sticks out.</li>
            <li> This straightener is amazing and i use it several times a week. It lasts a very long time and gives great results.</li>
            <li> This le Angelique is Simply awesome. This straightener Heats up quickly. It also Straightens smoothly and effectively! Really a good buy!</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money.  I used it 5 times and then it broke.  Would not heat up.  I  had to throw it in the trash.  Do not buy this!</li>
            <li> I actually have the red one and it works like a charm! It gets really hot even if you have it on a lower setting. It straightens my hair in ONE smooth motion and my hair is soft, silky and straight. What I like most about this flat iron compared to all the cheapo ones I&#x27;ve had in the past is that it doesn&#x27;t snag and pull at my hair. My last flat iron pulled out my hair with every stroke, but this one glides smoothly over. Nice curved design. I&#x27;m assuming it probably works for ALL hair types. I&#x27;m a black girl and it works beautiful wonders with my hair. I used it on my niece who&#x27;s hair is extremely curly and it made her hair pin straight. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the one that it shows in picture. The one I got is no different than something I would buy from Wal-Mart. Does not do a good job at all.</li>
            <li> Let me start off with the fact that this product looked used when I received it. Markings and a tiny chip on the plates. It does not do a good job at straightening my hair or curling it... it pulls and tugs on my hair and leaves it feeling very dry. Not what I am used to after using a different brand of many years. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> If you were to go to the direct Le Angelique website, this flat iron retails for $145.95. Fortunately it&#x27;s available here for about a third of the price. The flat iron itself is really good and the quality is amazing. The 100% ceramic plates offer great protection and less damage to the hair. In addition, it heats up to 430 degrees which makes the straightening process significantly faster. The swivel cord eliminates the hassle when styling hair. It&#x27;s a steal for the price and is offered in a variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife. She loved it. It arrived on time as stated when bought it on line. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had an issue with frizzy hair, but I have to say this iron has been my greatest hair tool ever.  You won&#x27;t regret buying this.  Really smoothes and straightens the hair with alot less damage.  I think that this works alot better than any of those other irons out there.  Especially the tourmaline flat irons, which I feel damages more than styles.  Take a chance and you won&#x27;t regret it.  Definately a good buy.</li>
            <li> i received my product so far it&#x27;s look ok&lt;br /&gt;but i have something i buy this product as it work as international volts&lt;br /&gt;but i found that I cannot use it as the cable not working there is missing converter for the power didn&#x27;t send with it</li>
