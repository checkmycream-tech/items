            <li>but again, for the price, this is a great CRUELTY-FREE!!!</li>
            <li>This is a great product!</li>
            <li>Very happy with how it feels and looks.</li>
            <li>I set it with translucent powder and it gives me a perfect finish!</li>
            <li>I use this every day under my makeup, it also gives great coverage when I wear it alone for lighter makeup days!</li>
            <li>It works great on set and stays on because of the oil under the lights for my actors, but I can&#x27;t wear it myself without getting tons of acne from clogged pours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is just all over amazingly great</li>
            <li>The coverage isn&#x27;t that great</li>
            <li>This covers great.  </li>
            <li>For the price, this is a good tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>If you want a cheap foundation then this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li>The price is great for anyone who wants to give a tinted moisturizer a try!  </li>
            <li>tan only compared to the moon, and my face puts her craters to shame, so my quest for the perfect foundation is never ending.</li>
            <li>ELF has another line of foundation that has better color matches.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I have never in my life had so many issues with a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to people who don&#x27;t like to use a foundation because it gives them more pimples and breakouts.</li>
            <li>I love e.l.f.</li>
            <li>moisturize, so it works better as a primer</li>
            <li>LOVE this product, I buy it all the time.</li>
            <li>I have always used a foundation but now that it is winter I wanted to try something more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It is great for anyone who wants to try a tinted moisturizer but doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I will by more Elf products.</li>
            <li>While e.l.f.&#x27;s product feels just fine on the face (it feels and smells more like a tinted sunscreen),</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really rub in that easily and kind of leaves a line on my jawline.  </li>
            <li>Applies well and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a light coverage for the summer so that your face won&#x27;t melt off give this a try.</li>
            <li>fast service, nice packaging.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m naturally very pale and this moisturizer just happens to be the best thing!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want a full makeup look, and still have some sun protection.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t expect full coverage from a \\&quot;tinted\\&quot; moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, if you&#x27;re looking for a true tinted MOISTURIZER, this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li>I never understand how this product gets such good reviews from people.</li>
            <li>this wasn&#x27;t true to its color.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say anything about the quality of the moisturizer (although I tried a bit of it and it seemed to feel okay)</li>
            <li>The quality is not as good as some of the $25++ tinted moisturizers I&#x27;ve used from other brands (Urban Decay is my favorite!!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for everyday use and you can defiantly tell the difference!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It covers just enough and is nice and creamy.</li>
            <li>The product packaging states whether it&#x27;s for individuals with pink or yellow undertones, which is helpful &amp; probably the best thing about the item, but I don&#x27;t think Amazon&#x27;s descriptions or photographs give you this information.  </li>
            <li>This may work for people at the darker end of the pale spectrum with perfect skin who are looking for a somewhat-subtle glow, but for anyone who considers themselves even kind of pale, I say look on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of tint making this product 2 in 1 for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price is right ($3 at Target)&lt;br /&gt;Cruelty</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve started using Maybelline Dream Fresh BB Cream, and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The lightest shade that I could find was porcelain, but it states that it&#x27;s for people with yellow undertones, which means that if you have very fair skin with pink undertones (many blondes w/ blue eyes, for instance)</li>
            <li>I like the texture very much.</li>
            <li>One drip from your water glass, or a rain drop, anything, and that spot very noticeably slides right off your face - and possibly right on to your blouse.</li>
            <li>In an attempt to help heal my acne, I&#x27;ve begun dipping into tinted moisturizers and, unfortunately, my search for the perfect product continues.</li>
            <li>When I firsr used it, It made my skin look smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>So - just be aware of that.  </li>
            <li>The E.L.F. tinted moisturizers retail for $3 at Target as well as on the company&#x27;s main website, so first, you&#x27;re paying too much on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m REALLY fair, so its hard to find foundations or tinted moisturizers that match my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Very orange when applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d describe it more as a minimal coverage mattifying foundation w/ sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I assumed porcelain, their lightest color offered here, would be similar to ivory, for people with fair, pink skin, but I guess that was too much to hope for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of this product on the skin.</li>
            <li>It helps give just the right coverage for a casual/ natural day look.</li>
            <li>The good news is that you can layer it for thicker coverage, so if you are a tan girl (or a pale girl who wants to look like a carrot) who wants an extra shot of radiance, then this product may work for you.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this tinted moisturizer compared to the feel of liquid foundation; however, I found that even the palest color is too dark for me.  </li>
            <li>But I still love to wear this when I&#x27;m outside in the heat and don&#x27;t want a full face of makeup but still want a little something.</li>
            <li>I recommend buying from the store or directly from the ELF website because it is much cheaper than buying from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Even though the e.l.f. tinted moisturizer is really cheap, it&#x27;s not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t unusually sensitive, so I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>because the coloring was just so completely off.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It did an okay job in terms of coverage, but as other people have mentioned, it&#x27;s a bit heavy for moisturizer, and the texture was really greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only reason this isn&#x27;t 5 stars is because I&#x27;m very oily and in general TMs don&#x27;t have staying power for me.</li>
            <li>And my biggest problem, after using it once it made me break out, even though I do NOT have acne-prone skin and I can normally switch between all sorts of different beauty products without getting zits.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s way too dark to be called Porcelain.</li>
            <li>anice starting point for a natural look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m half Asian/half Caucasian with yellow undertones, so porcelain worked pretty well for me, shade</li>
            <li>First of all, it feels heavy and sits on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is a little thin for my liking and it really doesn&#x27;t seem to be any more moisturizing then my regular foundation.  </li>

            <li> It is a little thin for my liking and it really doesn&#x27;t seem to be any more moisturizing then my regular foundation.  </li>
            <li> Now maybe this is a weird definition of porcelain I&#x27;m unaware of, but if that&#x27;s the lightest color they have then they&#x27;re isolating a huge chunk of customers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very pale redhead and the lightest color was VERY orange.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t like heavy foundation, or you have oily or sensitive skin</li>
            <li> When I first tried this TM, I liked the feel and texture but the color was awful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale, but not terribly pale -</li>
            <li> \\&quot;porcelain\\&quot; color is dark yellow.</li>
            <li> I bought it in Almond, which is a deep tan, a little darker then my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> reason why I can&#x27;t give this product three stars is because after only a couple of uses, my skin got a little blotchy (no acne, just redness).</li>
            <li> the color (&#x27;porcelain&#x27;) is way too dark for my uses.</li>
            <li> This was the lightest they have, and I figured Id try it, but even Porcelain is too dark.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So be warned, if you are any paler than tan with yellow undertones, there is no color of this that will suit you (at least not on amazon, anyway).</li>
            <li> the lightest shade is too dark and orange for pale skin&lt;</li>
            <li> It gives a little and almost invisible amount of coverage</li>
            <li> think  it evens my skin tone out a little bit</li>
            <li> Perhaps after I get a little sun this summer I can try it again.  </li>
            <li> To start with it is not a moisturizer, like it says, it is really a heavy concealer with tons of oil.</li>
            <li> (although I could see how people would like it if they got a matching shade), and it actually made my skin worse by giving me pimples.</li>
            <li> I played around with it a little and found that if you use very little the color will blend out and still cover redness.</li>
            <li> This product is very sheer, and I still look like I&#x27;m using a fake tanner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not to mention this moisturizer was really Thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> You have to use a very small amount at a time, because otherwise it looks streaky and builds up on your skin.</li>
            <li> Also, if you&#x27;re some sort of masochist and want to put this crap on your face, go to Target or Walmart where it&#x27;s only $3.</li>
            <li> I can usually wear the lightest or next lightest foundation color without a problem, so I was very disappointed that this color didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> Worst of all though, it not even a little water-proof.</li>
            <li> stars because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a BAD product</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s just a bad product for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to my worst enemy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product is very sheer, and I still look like I&#x27;m using a fake tanner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tan only compared to the moon, and my face puts her craters to shame, so my quest for the perfect foundation is never ending. In an attempt to help heal my acne, I&#x27;ve begun dipping into tinted moisturizers and, unfortunately, my search for the perfect product continues. While e.l.f.&#x27;s product feels just fine on the face (it feels and smells more like a tinted sunscreen), the color (&#x27;porcelain&#x27;) is way too dark for my uses. For comparison, I use N2/W2 of L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s Tru Match. This may work for people at the darker end of the pale spectrum with perfect skin who are looking for a somewhat-subtle glow, but for anyone who considers themselves even kind of pale, I say look on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a BAD product--it&#x27;s just a bad product for me. The good news is that you can layer it for thicker coverage, so if you are a tan girl (or a pale girl who wants to look like a carrot) who wants an extra shot of radiance, then this product may work for you.</li>
            <li> Aweful. This is not porcelain! Not a color match whatsoever. Very orange when applied. ELF has another line of foundation that has better color matches. This specific product is a no go.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a good tinted moisturizer. I recommend buying from the store or directly from the ELF website because it is much cheaper than buying from Amazon. The quality is not as good as some of the $25++ tinted moisturizers I&#x27;ve used from other brands (Urban Decay is my favorite!!) but again, for the price, this is a great CRUELTY-FREE!!! tinted moisturizer. :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible. First, it&#x27;s way too dark to be called Porcelain. It feels greasy and instead of setting with powder, just turns cakey. Worst of all though, it not even a little water-proof. One drip from your water glass, or a rain drop, anything, and that spot very noticeably slides right off your face - and possibly right on to your blouse. I have never in my life had so many issues with a tinted moisturizer. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to my worst enemy. Also, if you&#x27;re some sort of masochist and want to put this crap on your face, go to Target or Walmart where it&#x27;s only $3.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try for my days I don&#x27;t want a full makeup look, and still have some sun protection. This is a great product! Very happy with how it feels and looks. It helps give just the right coverage for a casual/ natural day look. I would recommend this to my clients and buy it again.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of tint making this product 2 in 1 for me. It covers just enough and is nice and creamy. I like the texture very much.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to people who don&#x27;t like to use a foundation because it gives them more pimples and breakouts. It gives a little and almost invisible amount of coverage and I don&#x27;t get any breakouts from it!</li>
            <li> I love e.l.f. items and this was no exception. Applies well and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is right ($3 at Target)&lt;br /&gt;Cruelty free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the lightest shade is too dark and orange for pale skin&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t moisturize, so it works better as a primer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this product a 1 because of my personal experience. I bought this product at target for 3 dollars. When I firsr used it, It made my skin look smooth and soft. Recently I used it and wore it for about 9 hours through the day and when I took it off my skin has red bumps all over it. Itchy red bumps everywhere. I would definitely suggest doing a patch test on your arm or neck before using the product on your face.</li>
            <li> This product is only $3.00 at Walmart where I purchased it. To start with it is not a moisturizer, like it says, it is really a heavy concealer with tons of oil. It works great on set and stays on because of the oil under the lights for my actors, but I can&#x27;t wear it myself without getting tons of acne from clogged pours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like heavy foundation, or you have oily or sensitive skin you should avoid this product. If you want a cheap foundation then this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> It is just all over amazingly great but you can get it for $3.00 on the e.l.f. website.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product, I buy it all the time. It&#x27;s great for everyday use and you can defiantly tell the difference!&lt;br /&gt;I think  it evens my skin tone out a little bit, I&#x27;m naturally very pale and this moisturizer just happens to be the best thing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m REALLY fair, so its hard to find foundations or tinted moisturizers that match my skin tone. This was the lightest they have, and I figured Id try it, but even Porcelain is too dark. Not to mention this moisturizer was really Thick and sticky. It felt like I was rubbing tar on my face.</li>
            <li> I have always used a foundation but now that it is winter I wanted to try something more moisturizing.  The price is great for anyone who wants to give a tinted moisturizer a try!  I bought it in Almond, which is a deep tan, a little darker then my skin tone.  It doesn&#x27;t really rub in that easily and kind of leaves a line on my jawline.  The coverage isn&#x27;t that great but I wouldn&#x27;t expect full coverage from a \\&quot;tinted\\&quot; moisturizer.  It is a little thin for my liking and it really doesn&#x27;t seem to be any more moisturizing then my regular foundation.  It is great for anyone who wants to try a tinted moisturizer but doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently gotten on the tinted moisturizer bandwagon &amp; decided to try this out.  The E.L.F. tinted moisturizers retail for $3 at Target as well as on the company&#x27;s main website, so first, you&#x27;re paying too much on Amazon.  Second, this stuff isn&#x27;t moisturizing at all.  I&#x27;d describe it more as a minimal coverage mattifying foundation w/ sunscreen.  So - just be aware of that.  The texture is thick-ish, but I didn&#x27;t have an issue with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read various reviews for this product online that were critical of the shades.  The product packaging states whether it&#x27;s for individuals with pink or yellow undertones, which is helpful &amp; probably the best thing about the item, but I don&#x27;t think Amazon&#x27;s descriptions or photographs give you this information.  The lightest shade that I could find was porcelain, but it states that it&#x27;s for people with yellow undertones, which means that if you have very fair skin with pink undertones (many blondes w/ blue eyes, for instance) you might be out of luck.  I&#x27;m half Asian/half Caucasian with yellow undertones, so porcelain worked pretty well for me, shade wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you&#x27;re looking for a true tinted MOISTURIZER, this isn&#x27;t it.  Also, there just isn&#x27;t enough diversity in the shades.</li>
            <li> I never understand how this product gets such good reviews from people. First of all, it feels heavy and sits on my skin. It does not moisturize at all. You have to use a very small amount at a time, because otherwise it looks streaky and builds up on your skin. The lightest shade, porcelain, makes me look orange. And my biggest problem, after using it once it made me break out, even though I do NOT have acne-prone skin and I can normally switch between all sorts of different beauty products without getting zits. Even though the e.l.f. tinted moisturizer is really cheap, it&#x27;s not worth the money at all. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize, the &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t match my skin tone (although I could see how people would like it if they got a matching shade), and it actually made my skin worse by giving me pimples. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this tinted moisturizer compared to the feel of liquid foundation; however, I found that even the palest color is too dark for me.  I&#x27;m pale, but not terribly pale - I can usually wear the lightest or next lightest foundation color without a problem, so I was very disappointed that this color didn&#x27;t work for me.  Perhaps after I get a little sun this summer I can try it again.  In the meantime, I&#x27;ll be keeping my fingers crossed that they come out with a lighter shade.</li>
            <li> This is a tinted moisturizer, so if you have a lot of imperfections to cover up stick with your foundation. If you are looking for a light coverage for the summer so that your face won&#x27;t melt off give this a try. Got mine in sand and I absolutely love it. I set it with translucent powder and it gives me a perfect finish!</li>
            <li> This covers great.  I purchased while on sale.  I would purchase it again when the tube I have runs out.</li>
            <li> I use this every day under my makeup, it also gives great coverage when I wear it alone for lighter makeup days! Love it</li>
            <li> I bought this a year ago to bring on a family vacation. I wanted a tinted moisturizer with SPF so I wouldn&#x27;t burn or have to bring my legit foundation and concealer with me. It did an okay job in terms of coverage, but as other people have mentioned, it&#x27;s a bit heavy for moisturizer, and the texture was really greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I can&#x27;t give this product three stars is because after only a couple of uses, my skin got a little blotchy (no acne, just redness). The blotches went away after I stopped using it. My skin isn&#x27;t unusually sensitive, so I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using Maybelline Dream Fresh BB Cream, and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this TM, I liked the feel and texture but the color was awful. I&#x27;m a very pale redhead and the lightest color was VERY orange. I played around with it a little and found that if you use very little the color will blend out and still cover redness. The only reason this isn&#x27;t 5 stars is because I&#x27;m very oily and in general TMs don&#x27;t have staying power for me. But I still love to wear this when I&#x27;m outside in the heat and don&#x27;t want a full face of makeup but still want a little something.</li>
            <li> i am pasty white. this wasn&#x27;t true to its color. probably won&#x27;t buy again.  lke elf products but i would take their essential tinted moisturizer even though its a smaller tube.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say anything about the quality of the moisturizer (although I tried a bit of it and it seemed to feel okay) because the coloring was just so completely off.&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;porcelain\\&quot; color is dark yellow. Now maybe this is a weird definition of porcelain I&#x27;m unaware of, but if that&#x27;s the lightest color they have then they&#x27;re isolating a huge chunk of customers. I assumed porcelain, their lightest color offered here, would be similar to ivory, for people with fair, pink skin, but I guess that was too much to hope for.&lt;br /&gt;So be warned, if you are any paler than tan with yellow undertones, there is no color of this that will suit you (at least not on amazon, anyway).</li>
            <li> Once you put it on it feels like your applying a melted sunscreen on your face. I like the color and minerals but something about the texture makes me want to give it a 4 star</li>
            <li> fast service, nice packaging. I really like the feel of this product on the skin. found it to even out my skin worn alone.  anice starting point for a natural look. I will by more Elf products.</li>
