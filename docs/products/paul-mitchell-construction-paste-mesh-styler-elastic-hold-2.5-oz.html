            <li>I thought paul mitchell was the good stuff for guys who want style that doesn&#x27;t look greasy,</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>This is called &amp;#34;construction paste&amp;#34; and is ideal for those who have fine hair or thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>Great price, better than in the salon or beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>and I could already tell I liked it.</li>
            <li>Nice smell that fades after a while.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, but for me I almost HAVE to cocktail products.</li>
            <li>This has been by far the best product for me.</li>
            <li>My husband got some of this for a free sample and he loved it.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my husband who says it has a very good hold, and he would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great first step before using the hair dryer.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t flake as many others do.</li>
            <li>I had the 1.5 oz container and it lasted about a year or more.</li>
            <li>Great product for adding body and texture  to straight hair.</li>
            <li>The paste seems more liquid than it used to be.</li>
            <li>Now just feels more like water.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best mens hair product out there.</li>
            <li>My husband love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Paul Mitchell user for many years.</li>
            <li>My hair is thinning slightly on top and the Construction Paste was supposed to add volume because of it&#x27;s fibrous makeup.</li>
            <li>and they included a free traveling size construction paste!</li>
            <li>required17 more words</li>
            <li>required17 more words required17</li>
            <li>more words required.</li>
            <li>You can find a more pleasant smelling and much cheaper product from a department store.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Enjoy many of his products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a perfect product like this for a very long time!!  </li>
            <li>Holds all day and brushes out easily.  </li>
            <li>Allowed me to shape my hair immediately, and I could easily adjust it during the day.</li>
            <li>Washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>Besides the price, its a great product, I have very strong hair, but a small dollop of this gives me a really nice hold.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, at first I found the smell off putting and kinda chemically, but after about a month of using it, I almost like the smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great product for guys who need a lot of hold and texture, some separation and a mostly -but not completely-</li>
            <li>Straight from the road work zone that has been delaying your commute by 20 minutes for months comes the top construction paste ever made!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for that slightly messy look.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Paul for handcrafting the finest hair product ever experienced by human beings.</li>
            <li>Clean and strong hold with the ability to move around like pomade, but without all the grease.</li>
            <li>I know this product is primarily for men, but my stylist started using it in my hair</li>
            <li>Smooth, non-sticky, webby goodness.</li>
            <li>the plus side, it definitely added thickness to my hair and looks great.</li>
            <li>But a couple months ago when I was leaving my barber after a haircut he gave me a travel size bottle of this as a free sample he got for his business.</li>
            <li>Works great on short hair</li>
            <li>Thanks Mitch!!!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake, lasts all day, and is super easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>I was originally showed this product by my hair dresser.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out and smells great.</li>
            <li>This is great for a classic short hair look.17 more words</li>
            <li>From store bought axe to online exclusive salon certified mega curated special putties, everything I used made my hair look good for that 2 mins from the time of application to when I walked outside, and then it all went downhill from there.</li>
            <li>You sure don&#x27;t need much to keep your hair from being unruly.</li>
            <li>It took me a whole minute to get used to the smell, but now I love it.</li>
            <li>It fades quickly though</li>
            <li>On the positive side, it does wash out of my hair easily</li>
            <li>The price is totally worth it compared to a drawer full of products that didn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li>Great for messy or clean</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and super straight</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sticky, which is good for hold, it smells nice, it has a slight shine which really is only there to provide better separation and texture.</li>
            <li>A pea size drop keeps my limp hair happy.</li>
            <li>Great product, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or too firm.</li>
            <li>The product is good for keeping short hair with a modern look.</li>
            <li>great hold not overly stiff</li>
            <li>, this is great for your hair, it doesn&#x27;t feel stiff and crunchy, but holds all day.</li>
            <li>Shipping is super fast!</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>- you can&#x27;t make a cheap knockoff of construction paste, It&#x27;s the real deal, it&#x27;s sealed up fresh and new in the box.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product when I got a haircut and the barber used this product in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Most cremes don&#x27;t have enough holding power.  </li>
            <li>So if you are female, it might compete with your lovely perfume.</li>
            <li>I came home and my hair looked even BETTER than when I left.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>It has a very strong smell (smells like chemicals) and makes your hair feel dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>The product: it&#x27;s a very tacky paste that has the amazing property of holding very well but not being hard like glue; your style will still bounce and move - the BEST and only reason to buy this of course: it doesn&#x27;t create flakes or that crunchy feeling at the end of the day slash next day.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely fantastic for my short spiked doo!!!  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I have used this hair paste for a while and really like it.</li>
            <li>Reasonable control without stiffness or oily.</li>
            <li>Its very lemony-ginger.</li>
            <li>That seems to really work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very chemically smell - almost like household cleaner.</li>
            <li>hair thickness - great for thin hair</li>
            <li>Really like the consistency.  </li>
            <li>this is the real thing; You can buy one from a salon and tell by the texture and tackiness of the stuff</li>
            <li>Husband loves this product, and it is a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Because my hair tends to fall flat fast, I&#x27;ve tried everything from hard waxes/soft waxes/gels/sprays etc and this is by far the best for me.</li>
            <li>This product has made it so simple to deal with my hair when I need to get ready quick.  </li>
            <li>I have short spiked hair and use this product to give me good separation with a slight moist look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tiny tube and runs out quickly.  </li>
            <li>Gets more sticky when you add a little water, which lets you reshape.</li>
            <li>When you open the cap the paste is the consistency of tooth-paste and has strings when you pull it away, much like hot glue.</li>
            <li>My husband love this because it keeps his hair down in a natural look</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Elastic Hold Mesh and have found it to be more stiff than elastic.  </li>
            <li>i have longer hair for a guy and really like how this holds it back without looking too shiny and greasy, but this stuff costs way too much.  </li>
            <li>I first tried this in a sample bottle and bought this bigger one to replace it.  </li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell Construction Paste is the only thing that I have found that provides lasting hold that isn&#x27;t crispy and also washes out cleanly.</li>
            <li>Its not my favorite only b/c it leaves a matte finish that can appear a little frizzy by the end of the day here in FL.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it has a nice smell: barely noticeable and not at all &amp;#34;manly.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I bought this product hoping for my hair to look naturally spiked</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently cocktailing this with the Mitch Reformer, and they work very well together.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It used to have more of a thick pasty feel.</li>
            <li>Product as expected and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>And even though $17 is a bit pricey even for regular use, one tube of this easily lasts me over 3-4 months of everyday use.</li>
            <li>It really lasts a long time and it has virtually no odor.</li>
            <li>This is a big bottle but it will last you FOREVER because you don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need any additional finishing product (unless you have a special need, such as extreme hold -- if so, you might use some of the Hardwired Spiking Glue from the same line).</li>
            <li>I use a little bit when my hair is damp and then use a little more after I&#x27;m completely styled.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a woman with very thick short hair (a nice feminine cut) who recently moved to the east coast in the summer (read:</li>
            <li>I have used several comparable products and although this is expensive I really do like it more than the others.</li>
            <li>It makes his hair stay how he wants it but not get all crunchy or oily looking like other gels.</li>
            <li>At first I just threw it in the back of the cabinet and ignored it until I ran out of my then favorite hair pomanade and was in desperate need to fix my hair for a wedding I had to go to.</li>
            <li>Anyways to make a long review short, LESS than a pea sized amount of this bad boy gives my full head of super unruly, super straight hair all day hold and maximum pliability without making it feel greasy or crunchy or heavy.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a very chemically smell - almost like household cleaner.</li>
            <li> hair thickness - great for thin hair</li>
            <li> Really like the consistency.  </li>
            <li> this is the real thing; You can buy one from a salon and tell by the texture and tackiness of the stuff</li>
            <li> Husband loves this product, and it is a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Because my hair tends to fall flat fast, I&#x27;ve tried everything from hard waxes/soft waxes/gels/sprays etc and this is by far the best for me.</li>
            <li> This product has made it so simple to deal with my hair when I need to get ready quick.  </li>
            <li> I have short spiked hair and use this product to give me good separation with a slight moist look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny tube and runs out quickly.  </li>
            <li> Gets more sticky when you add a little water, which lets you reshape.</li>
            <li> When you open the cap the paste is the consistency of tooth-paste and has strings when you pull it away, much like hot glue.</li>
            <li> My husband love this because it keeps his hair down in a natural look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Elastic Hold Mesh and have found it to be more stiff than elastic.  </li>
            <li> i have longer hair for a guy and really like how this holds it back without looking too shiny and greasy, but this stuff costs way too much.  </li>
            <li> I first tried this in a sample bottle and bought this bigger one to replace it.  </li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell Construction Paste is the only thing that I have found that provides lasting hold that isn&#x27;t crispy and also washes out cleanly.</li>
            <li> Its not my favorite only b/c it leaves a matte finish that can appear a little frizzy by the end of the day here in FL.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it has a nice smell: barely noticeable and not at all &amp;#34;manly.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping for my hair to look naturally spiked</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently cocktailing this with the Mitch Reformer, and they work very well together.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It used to have more of a thick pasty feel.</li>
            <li> Product as expected and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> And even though $17 is a bit pricey even for regular use, one tube of this easily lasts me over 3-4 months of everyday use.</li>
            <li> It really lasts a long time and it has virtually no odor.</li>
            <li> This is a big bottle but it will last you FOREVER because you don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need any additional finishing product (unless you have a special need, such as extreme hold -- if so, you might use some of the Hardwired Spiking Glue from the same line).</li>
            <li> I use a little bit when my hair is damp and then use a little more after I&#x27;m completely styled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman with very thick short hair (a nice feminine cut) who recently moved to the east coast in the summer (read:</li>
            <li> I have used several comparable products and although this is expensive I really do like it more than the others.</li>
            <li> It makes his hair stay how he wants it but not get all crunchy or oily looking like other gels.</li>
            <li> At first I just threw it in the back of the cabinet and ignored it until I ran out of my then favorite hair pomanade and was in desperate need to fix my hair for a wedding I had to go to.</li>
            <li> Anyways to make a long review short, LESS than a pea sized amount of this bad boy gives my full head of super unruly, super straight hair all day hold and maximum pliability without making it feel greasy or crunchy or heavy.</li>
            <li> My hair has two cowlicks that I&#x27;ve worked to tame for my whole life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already on my 2nd tube, this thing lasts long too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at how little you actually need.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome,and you only need a TINY tiny bit, like about half a marble&#x27;s size of it squeezed into your hand, rub it on your fingers, and go to town.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long time user of Redken Rewind styling paste.  </li>
            <li> This hair paste holds your hair all day long, and you can still style it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It was a long battle and I eventually gave up and stopped caring.</li>
            <li> It will hold all day long and not flake or start to frizz.  </li>
            <li> The gel works as I had hoped, not to sticky but keeps my thick and heavy hair out of my face, plus the shipping was quick and efficient.</li>
            <li> It gives me the look I want, without that extra crunchyness or stickiness that other products leave my hair with.</li>
            <li> dry wax accumulated).  </li>
            <li> This paste works well enough for a guy with thin straight hair who&#x27;s seeking to mix it up a bit.</li>
            <li> When I pull my helmet it off, my hair looks like Frankenstein but this product totally bounces back with just a few waves of your hand.</li>
            <li> If you need an extra firm hold, and can afford it, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always spent as little as possible on personal care stuff, but my wife got me a tube of this for a gift</li>
            <li> I use less of this product to do the same style as with Rewind.  </li>
            <li> Took some getting used to when changing from a long time use of an other product.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 more tubes just to see if it was a bad tube, but both tubes DID NOT work.</li>
            <li> Everything came as expected so will use these people again</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling sticky like some extra firm products do.</li>
            <li> I always put it in, let it dry, and then mess up my hair again, because it still gives it the hold I want without the too-much-hair-gel-middle-school-dance look.</li>
            <li> recommend working a small amount through damp hair and blow drying, to get the overall shape and volume the way you want it.</li>
            <li> It adds a bit of shine, so not right if you&#x27;re looking for a mat apprearance.</li>
            <li> Give him enough textured to work with his hair but its not grease or too hard...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have the issue with nothing holding my hair down unless it is the gel glue, this stuff works and is truly elastic.  </li>
            <li> Was looking forward to using this product-I&#x27;ve been using Paul Mitchell Dry Wax for the past year and was looking for something which would wash out of my hair (</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying other gel products</li>
            <li> but you still get slight whiffs of it throughout the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little less costly, but that is typical of PM products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with very thick, dark hair, that has a slight wave, that I style into a messy-ish quiff/pompadour, think Nick Wooster meets Robert Pattinson.</li>
            <li> This hair goo has a material that resembles little elastic threads in it.</li>
            <li> it makes 100s of little strings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only a little amount required and not oily at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crew&#x27;s Fiber for a few years now, decided to mix it up by using this.</li>
            <li> A few seconds working it into my hair</li>
            <li> The boxes are not damaged or expired or marked weird or anything like that.</li>
            <li> Hard to find &amp; expensive, but a high quality hair product</li>
            <li> It has a very strong smell (smells like chemicals), to me the smell is awful.</li>
            <li> It will mess with your eyes if you get it on your hand and touch your eye at all!</li>
            <li> Not to mention the last bit is nearly impossible to get out of the tube (and at $7 an ounce you bet I&#x27;m struggling for that last drop).  </li>
            <li> Keeps your hair looking slick all day..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells like bathtub cleaner&lt;br /&gt;Expensive for a small bottle</li>
            <li> but if you have read the review this far, chances are you have failed on enough hair products that spending $17 on this one might not seem that bad after all.</li>
            <li> Anyways, all I&#x27;m saying is, not all hair products work well with everyone&#x27;s hair (ugh genetics), so if you&#x27;ve been having a hard time taming your hair and nothing seems to work, give this a try.</li>
            <li> only gripe is that the product stinks for about an hour after you put it in your hair.</li>
            <li> you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> guess I was wrong.</li>
            <li> My hair has an unpleasant crunch which I didn&#x27;t expect.  </li>
            <li> I have very difficult hair.  </li>
            <li> This was one of the worst products ive ever used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is all I use and I love the smell</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband who says it has a very good hold, and he would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I have very difficult hair.  This product has made it so simple to deal with my hair when I need to get ready quick.  I wish it was a little less costly, but that is typical of PM products.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely fantastic for my short spiked doo!!!  Holds all day and brushes out easily.  Doesn&#x27;t leave any build-up&lt;br /&gt;either.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a perfect product like this for a very long time!!  Thanks Mitch!!!  Oh...this product is great for both  men and women!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman with very thick short hair (a nice feminine cut) who recently moved to the east coast in the summer (read: it&#x27;s HUMID). My hair has two cowlicks that I&#x27;ve worked to tame for my whole life. This has been by far the best product for me. A little goes a long way and it has a nice smell: barely noticeable and not at all &amp;#34;manly.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is called &amp;#34;construction paste&amp;#34; and is ideal for those who have fine hair or thinning hair.  Gives good body to comb without it looking like a styling gel.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. It will mess with your eyes if you get it on your hand and touch your eye at all!</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair looking slick all day.. Great quality product!  Don&#x27;t waste your money buying other gel products go for this one.</li>
            <li> The best ever holds great.  Don&#x27;t even know you have anything on your hair.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, smells nice.</li>
            <li> This was one of the worst products ive ever used. It has a very strong smell (smells like chemicals) and makes your hair feel dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product. Doesn&#x27;t flake as many others do. I&#x27;m surprised at how little you actually need. So, this small&lt;br /&gt;tube will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  If you suffer from &amp;#34;whispy&amp;#34; hair or &amp;#34;fly-aways&amp;#34; this is the product for you.  Throw your hair in a pony tail and use a tiny bit of this to make your hair look like you actually did something to it!  I first tried this in a sample bottle and bought this bigger one to replace it.  This is a big bottle but it will last you FOREVER because you don&#x27;t need to use much.  I had the 1.5 oz container and it lasted about a year or more.</li>
            <li> Great product for adding body and texture  to straight hair. One tube can seemingly last &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34;. It adds a bit of shine, so not right if you&#x27;re looking for a mat apprearance.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> i have longer hair for a guy and really like how this holds it back without looking too shiny and greasy, but this stuff costs way too much.  It&#x27;s a tiny tube and runs out quickly.  Not to mention the last bit is nearly impossible to get out of the tube (and at $7 an ounce you bet I&#x27;m struggling for that last drop).  Will try something else simply because I don&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars a year on hair product</li>
            <li> I first tried this product when I got a haircut and the barber used this product in my hair.  I really like it.  It lets you style your hair however you want but does not glue your hair in place.  Perfect for that slightly messy look.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have used several comparable products and although this is expensive I really do like it more than the others.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff for two years and loved it. Allowed me to shape my hair immediately, and I could easily adjust it during the day. The last 3 tubes of this stuff have just not been the same. The paste seems more liquid than it used to be. It used to have more of a thick pasty feel. Now just feels more like water. I bought 2 more tubes just to see if it was a bad tube, but both tubes DID NOT work. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happened, but I will be looking for a different product.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best mens hair product out there. I&#x27;ve used hair products from Tigi, American Crew, Axe - wax, paste, cream, putty, clay. Paul Mitchell Construction Paste is the only thing that I have found that provides lasting hold that isn&#x27;t crispy and also washes out cleanly. The price is totally worth it compared to a drawer full of products that didn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> Hard to find &amp; expensive, but a high quality hair product</li>
            <li> This hair goo has a material that resembles little elastic threads in it. You sure don&#x27;t need much to keep your hair from being unruly. It really lasts a long time and it has virtually no odor. I&#x27;m not always a big fan of Paul Mitchell products but this one is a keeper for my medium haircut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always spent as little as possible on personal care stuff, but my wife got me a tube of this for a gift and it&#x27;s great.  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different pastes and pomades and they&#x27;re all either too liquid or too sticky, but this stuff somehow ends up just right.  And it smells good.</li>
            <li> Good fragrance and hold.</li>
            <li> I have used this hair paste for a while and really like it. It provides the hold that I need without drying my hair out or making it look shiny.</li>
            <li> Long time user of Redken Rewind styling paste.  Now a convert to Paul Mitchell Mitch Construction Paste.  I use less of this product to do the same style as with Rewind.  No itchy, scratchy feeling after 8 hours of application.  Washes out easily.  I don&#x27;t care for gels, or pomades.  Most cremes don&#x27;t have enough holding power.  This paste works well enough for a guy with thin straight hair who&#x27;s seeking to mix it up a bit.</li>
            <li> Straight from the road work zone that has been delaying your commute by 20 minutes for months comes the top construction paste ever made!  Look like a champion of your craft instantly with the paste that gets the people going!  Thank you, Paul for handcrafting the finest hair product ever experienced by human beings.</li>
            <li> great hold not overly stiff</li>
            <li> I like this product. Its not my favorite only b/c it leaves a matte finish that can appear a little frizzy by the end of the day here in FL. It also has a man&#x27;s woodsy smell. So if you are female, it might compete with your lovely perfume.</li>
            <li> My husband love this product. Give him enough textured to work with his hair but its not grease or too hard... He has short hair!</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this stuff and he has tried lots of similar products!</li>
            <li> Everything came as expected so will use these people again</li>
            <li> Was looking forward to using this product-I&#x27;ve been using Paul Mitchell Dry Wax for the past year and was looking for something which would wash out of my hair (dry wax accumulated).  I&#x27;ve been using this Elastic Hold Mesh and have found it to be more stiff than elastic.  My hair has an unpleasant crunch which I didn&#x27;t expect.  On the positive side, it does wash out of my hair easily but it&#x27;s not worth the money. You can find a more pleasant smelling and much cheaper product from a department store.</li>
            <li> I have used dozens of styling products, from mousses and gels to pomades, waxes, and pastes. This product is the very best. It gives your hair thickness, shape, and structure, all while leaving your hair with a natural-looking finish that allows for movement and reshaping ability throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend working a small amount through damp hair and blow drying, to get the overall shape and volume the way you want it. Then work an additional amount of this product through the ends to define the texture and finish the style. You don&#x27;t need any additional finishing product (unless you have a special need, such as extreme hold -- if so, you might use some of the Hardwired Spiking Glue from the same line).</li>
            <li> It has a very strong smell (smells like chemicals), to me the smell is awful. I applied it once. I wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crew&#x27;s Fiber for a few years now, decided to mix it up by using this. This hair paste holds your hair all day long, and you can still style it throughout the day. I&#x27;m already on my 2nd tube, this thing lasts long too.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I need.</li>
            <li> The gel works as I had hoped, not to sticky but keeps my thick and heavy hair out of my face, plus the shipping was quick and efficient.</li>
            <li> Only thing I put in my hair! Clean and strong hold with the ability to move around like pomade, but without all the grease. Incredible product!</li>
            <li> I was originally showed this product by my hair dresser. She likes to play with it, as when you rub it in your hands and then pull them apart it makes 100s of little strings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this is great for your hair, it doesn&#x27;t feel stiff and crunchy, but holds all day. I always put it in, let it dry, and then mess up my hair again, because it still gives it the hold I want without the too-much-hair-gel-middle-school-dance look.</li>
            <li> Excellent styling product!</li>
            <li> Have used this for years.  Reasonable control without stiffness or oily.</li>
            <li> I know this product is primarily for men, but my stylist started using it in my hair and I love it! I&#x27;ve always rocked a shorter style (and I have thinner hair) and with that, I&#x27;ve always needed a wax or something similar to do-the-do. Because my hair tends to fall flat fast, I&#x27;ve tried everything from hard waxes/soft waxes/gels/sprays etc and this is by far the best for me. It doesn&#x27;t flake, lasts all day, and is super easy to wash out. It took me a whole minute to get used to the smell, but now I love it. Its very lemony-ginger. I use a little bit when my hair is damp and then use a little more after I&#x27;m completely styled. That seems to really work. It stays all day AND I ride a motorcycle, so it lasts through taking my helmet on and off. When I pull my helmet it off, my hair looks like Frankenstein but this product totally bounces back with just a few waves of your hand.</li>
            <li> Smooth, non-sticky, webby goodness. This paste is just what my hair needed. It gives me the look I want, without that extra crunchyness or stickiness that other products leave my hair with. Lasts days, looks great, feels great.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s a great first step before using the hair dryer. I use it to get my hair in place before the final style and I always follow up with another Mitch product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great holding cream without the greasy feel. I&#x27;ve been a Paul Mitchell user for many years. Enjoy many of his products.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after it was recommended to me from a friend. My hair is thinning slightly on top and the Construction Paste was supposed to add volume because of it&#x27;s fibrous makeup. When you open the cap the paste is the consistency of tooth-paste and has strings when you pull it away, much like hot glue. A few seconds working it into my hair and I could already tell I liked it. Great for messy or clean styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that the product stinks for about an hour after you put it in your hair. It&#x27;s a very chemically smell - almost like household cleaner. It fades quickly though but you still get slight whiffs of it throughout the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it definitely added thickness to my hair and looks great. It doesn&#x27;t seem to flake either and doesn&#x27;t get crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft and malleable hold&lt;br /&gt;Increases hair thickness - great for thin hair&lt;br /&gt;At 2.5 ounces, you can carry it onto an airplane&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells like bathtub cleaner&lt;br /&gt;Expensive for a small bottle</li>
            <li> Really like the consistency.  Does not clump your hair and it is not sticky.  Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out and smells great.</li>
            <li> The product: it&#x27;s a very tacky paste that has the amazing property of holding very well but not being hard like glue; your style will still bounce and move - the BEST and only reason to buy this of course: it doesn&#x27;t create flakes or that crunchy feeling at the end of the day slash next day. you know what I mean. This stuff is awesome,and you only need a TINY tiny bit, like about half a marble&#x27;s size of it squeezed into your hand, rub it on your fingers, and go to town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on buying Paul Mitchel on Amazon: I&#x27;ve bought this 4 times on Amazon now; realtalk: while everywhere that isn&#x27;t a salon is technically &#x27;grey-market&#x27; this is the real thing; You can buy one from a salon and tell by the texture and tackiness of the stuff - you can&#x27;t make a cheap knockoff of construction paste, It&#x27;s the real deal, it&#x27;s sealed up fresh and new in the box. The boxes are not damaged or expired or marked weird or anything like that. Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair styling creme that my sons will use. Not sticky, but holds the style well. Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping for my hair to look naturally spiked but it looks watery. I thought paul mitchell was the good stuff for guys who want style that doesn&#x27;t look greasy, guess I was wrong.</li>
            <li> A pea size drop keeps my limp hair happy.</li>
            <li> Product as expected and very fast delivery. Husband loves this product, and it is a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have short spiked hair and use this product to give me good separation with a slight moist look. The product works great but if you wear glasses or shades on your head, the product WILL transfer to the lens. If I am going out at night and do not expect to wear shades, then I use this. It holds well and lasts all night. For daytime use, when I may wear shades, I use Bumble and Bumble Grooming Cream as it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li> My husband got some of this for a free sample and he loved it. It makes his hair stay how he wants it but not get all crunchy or oily looking like other gels.</li>
            <li> If you like to look like a model from GQ, this hair paste for you. The ladies literally follow me around the grocery store wondering what type of cheese I am going to purchase next to put on tiny bread squares.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with my hair for years now. My hair is fine and super straight and I&#x27;ve tried every product you can find online or in stores to help mend my hair. From store bought axe to online exclusive salon certified mega curated special putties, everything I used made my hair look good for that 2 mins from the time of application to when I walked outside, and then it all went downhill from there. It was a long battle and I eventually gave up and stopped caring. But a couple months ago when I was leaving my barber after a haircut he gave me a travel size bottle of this as a free sample he got for his business. At first I just threw it in the back of the cabinet and ignored it until I ran out of my then favorite hair pomanade and was in desperate need to fix my hair for a wedding I had to go to. Low and behold I found this in the back of my drawer, slapped some on and walked out the door. Literally changed my entire day. I came home and my hair looked even BETTER than when I left. This product ACTUALLY did what everyone else claimed their product would do: all day hold that you can change and mold through the day. Anyways to make a long review short, LESS than a pea sized amount of this bad boy gives my full head of super unruly, super straight hair all day hold and maximum pliability without making it feel greasy or crunchy or heavy. Anyways, all I&#x27;m saying is, not all hair products work well with everyone&#x27;s hair (ugh genetics), so if you&#x27;ve been having a hard time taming your hair and nothing seems to work, give this a try. I know it seems pricey but if you have read the review this far, chances are you have failed on enough hair products that spending $17 on this one might not seem that bad after all. I don&#x27;t know how to find the trial size of this stuff, ask your salon if they have it and try it out before you buy it if you are reluctant. And even though $17 is a bit pricey even for regular use, one tube of this easily lasts me over 3-4 months of everyday use.</li>
            <li> I would complain about price but I got 2 of these on sale. Besides the price, its a great product, I have very strong hair, but a small dollop of this gives me a really nice hold. Also it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling sticky like some extra firm products do. I&#x27;ll be honest, at first I found the smell off putting and kinda chemically, but after about a month of using it, I almost like the smell. If you need an extra firm hold, and can afford it, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Big surprise when i opened the package! Good price and they included a free traveling size construction paste! The product is good for keeping short hair with a modern look.</li>
            <li> Took some getting used to when changing from a long time use of an other product. Works great on short hair</li>
            <li> Gets more sticky when you add a little water, which lets you reshape. Nice smell that fades after a while. So does the&lt;br /&gt;Greasy gel look, but the hold stays all day.</li>
            <li> If you want to stick your hair in the air this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only a little amount required and not oily at all.</li>
            <li> My husband love this because it keeps his hair down in a natural look</li>
            <li> This is great for a classic short hair look.17 more words required17 more words required17 more words required17 more words required. done.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Great product, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or too firm.</li>
            <li> I have the issue with nothing holding my hair down unless it is the gel glue, this stuff works and is truly elastic.  It will hold all day long and not flake or start to frizz.  Great price, better than in the salon or beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with very thick, dark hair, that has a slight wave, that I style into a messy-ish quiff/pompadour, think Nick Wooster meets Robert Pattinson. I&#x27;ve tried tons of products and this is one that definitely stands out. It&#x27;s very sticky, which is good for hold, it smells nice, it has a slight shine which really is only there to provide better separation and texture. I almost always have to cocktail a couple of products together, this works well on it&#x27;s own, but for me I almost HAVE to cocktail products. I&#x27;m currently cocktailing this with the Mitch Reformer, and they work very well together.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product for guys who need a lot of hold and texture, some separation and a mostly -but not completely- matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Started using this product several months ago and decided to look for it on Amazon. Found it and the price was a couple dollars cheaper then I had been buying it for. Shipping is super fast!</li>
