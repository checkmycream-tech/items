    <ol>
            <li> I got a sample of these in a magazine and ran off to buy them.  Your face feels clean after using this cleansing oil.  It doesn&#x27;t leave an oil film behind.  Love this to clean make-up off after a long day.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face every other day.  It is very rich and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a year. Love that my face was not dry the entire winter.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love, this oil.  I got this package and split it up as two gifts for my nonbelieving friends.  So much better than drugstore soaps loaded with chemicals.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair look and feels smooth .</li>
            <li> This is the BEST makeup removing cleanser that I&#x27;ve ever used . . . and I&#x27;ve used a lot.  It gently, but thoroughly removes all makeup, including mascara.  Love it!</li>
            <li> great for travel, I went abroad for 3 weeks and more than half a bottle was still left with daily use! highly recommended</li>
            <li> I usually buy the larger size, but these little ones are perfect for air travel. The product is great. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite make-up remover.  I was grateful to find it on Amazon.  I gave the smaller sized bottles as gifts last Christmas.  It is a good product.</li>
            <li> Really good cleansing oil. No special smell, which is the way I like it. Too much smell makes me nauseous. This cleanses really well. Even though I have oily/combination skin, this works. And its like a massage for your face. What&#x27;s not to like?!</li>
            <li> I have used jojoba oil as a cleanser in the past and liked it.  However, this one seemed to aggravate my sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ll be pitching this one out.</li>
            <li> Been using this product, but have not seen any results...</li>
            <li> Takes off eye makeup instantly. Love this product.</li>
            <li> The BEST cleansing product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Got a sample of DHC Deep Cleansing Oil and loved it!!  My 16 year old daughter tried to and loved it too, so we ordered the small &#x3D; 2 pack, one for her, one for me.  I just reordered a larger one to refill our small pumps.  Cleans amazingly well, my skin looks amazing (53) my daughter&#x27;s acne is almost gone.  I LOVE this oil.</li>
            <li> Some of the best make-up removers on the market! Have hard to remove waterproof mascara and hate spending so much time scrubbing your face raw? this stuff makes all that dirt and makeup dissolve with warm water. Amazing! The Japanese know what they&#x27;re doing</li>
            <li> Works great at removing waterproof makeup and cleansing skin. Unlike other cleansing oils, I find the fact that you can wash your face after with water makes a big difference for me as I like being able to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my face with water after the oil. This stuff removes the toughest of waterproof mascara, including Urban Decay&#x27;s Cannonball and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. These are perfect travel size. I haven&#x27;t used them for travel but think they will work great because of the cap, which seems secure.</li>
            <li> love this so much, especially during the winter. having oily and prone to acne skin is very complicated, with this product I do not need to use any face wash, this is all I use during the winter and it keeps my skin balanced, and more importantly doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I usually but the large bottle but bough this since I travel so much. Perfect size and airline friendly.</li>
            <li> removes make up well and does not leave a greasy feel</li>
            <li> Great price, great product. Cleanse my face without leaving it greasy.</li>
            <li> Great for travel.  I use the larger dispensors for home use</li>
            <li> This product cleared the shelves in my bathroom. I threw out my face washes, masks, peels...  I feel as though it balances my combination skin,and my breakouts only occur after two or three nights of skipping the bedtime face wash. I had previously used many $8 products from the drugstore, religiously, and while my breakouts were minimal, my skin felt dry and itchy and then a few hours later, greasy and gross.  This oil gives my face the ability to be clean and blemish free without feeling as though I&#x27;ve had an astringent poured on my face. Another plus is that there is no need to wet your skin before applying.  In the mornings I just massage some on my face,hop in the shower, rinse it off, then continue with my shower routine. I prefer to buy this in a pack of two because I keep one at home and the other in my makeup bag for an emergency ;)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years and I really love it. My skin are cleansed well by it and gets smooth. It doesn&#x27;t remove necessary natural oils my skin.</li>
            <li> DHC cleansing oils are the best. This small 2-pack is great as a gift and look very cute. Hopefully my friends will love it.</li>
            <li> Really gets makeup off. Nothing else works better (other than the Clinique balm)</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of extra rinsing to get off, but does leave my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> A great oil for removing make-up and dirt from your pores.  It rinses off well with warm water and makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> good. i&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
            <li> Great cleanser, removes all makup without leaving your skin feeling dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> Love they make the travel size.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried the DHC Cleansing oil.  I like it very much and am encouraging others to try it</li>
            <li> I was shopping around for something comparable to Shu Uemura cleansing oil with a decent price so I tried DHC. It&#x27;s ok. I wasn&#x27;t impressed and it took one too many attempts to cleanse to actually get everything I wanted to, but then again I&#x27;m coming with the standards of Shu Uemura quality, so if you&#x27;re okay with just average, this product isn&#x27;t too bad. I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again though because I know better is out there.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing oil.  Purchased the smaller bottles for travel.  Love the way it cleans your face and at the same time wipes off the make-up.  Not oily at all.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would not wash my face with anything else. It makes skin feel fresh without being oily or drying. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> The best cleanser sold on the planet.</li>
