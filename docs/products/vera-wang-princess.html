            <li>:o)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this perfume - really, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I LOVED the smell.</li>
            <li>I bought the gift set with the lotion and purse size bottle and that made it a really good deal for $60.</li>
            <li>My friend who was with me kept commenting on how good I smelled, and I also couldn&#x27;t help but to smell myself.</li>
            <li>, I got a comment around 2pm from someone telling me how good I smelled.    </li>
            <li>The packaging and bottle are also gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>I love the bottle!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hardly remarkable or memorable.</li>
            <li>I had fallen in love with this scent!    </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love it when I catch a whif of myself!  </li>
            <li>When I came across-ed this at Macy&#x27;s, my exact thought was BINGO!!!!  </li>
            <li>kind of has a vanilla-ish scent to it, but you don&#x27;t smell like a sugar cookie at all either.  </li>
            <li>I got this for Mother&#x27;s Day and it is so young smelling and simply wonderful.</li>
            <li>It smells NOTHING like the real Princess perfume, instead of delicious sweetness I was greeted with the smell of cheap flowers.</li>
            <li>When my boyfriend smelled it, he was very happy, he said I smelled great and like the fact it wasn&#x27;t as heavy as the winter perfume</li>
            <li>Marketing ploys aside, the scent is very light and appealing.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrant smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li>It is my all-time favorite, BUT</li>
            <li>-lasting).&lt;br /&gt;Mixes very well with body chemistry and is a great, feminine scent.</li>
            <li>I bought this a while ago and love love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I love this smell.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it a delicious fragrance, but also a Crown Jewel to let everybody know what a Princess you are!</li>
            <li>Okay so my hubby bought me a perfume I thought I wanted for Christmas, it was Estee Lauder Beyond Paradise.</li>
            <li>When I saw the purple heart shaped bottle wearing a crown I was in love.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE SCENT.</li>
            <li>THE BOTTLE IS SOOOOOO CUTE</li>
            <li>I THINK ITS MORE OF A NIGHT-OUT-ON-THE TOWN SORT OF SCENT.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments....</li>
            <li>And they throw in a fancy gift box for free!</li>
            <li>so pleased and</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a show piece to me than a workable scent, and one I like to look at and sniff but never choose to wear.</li>
            <li>Design, sure.</li>
            <li>This was in the summer and it lasted for most of the day, even in the 110 degree heat.</li>
            <li>THE BOTTLE IS ADORABLE.</li>
            <li>BUT BY AFTERNOON SCENT IS MOSTLY GONE.</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with this scent.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally in love</li>
            <li>I first found out about this perfume from one of my daughter&#x27;s friends who was joking about being able to use the pointy cap in case you ran out of pepper spray :P and I discovered the smell was pretty darn good.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for the perfect perfume for a long time.</li>
            <li>On Christmas morning, I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely the ideal fragrance for me.</li>
            <li>I love the notes of vanilla, and the fruity light smell it has.</li>
            <li>Love it, its light has a vanilla scent, it&#x27;s not a winter perfume its  a summer perfume.  </li>
            <li>I started out this smell-good quest wearing cheaper, but still delicious perfumes like Fresh White Musk and Fantasy.    </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;There are cheaper high quality perfumes that smell just as good.</li>
            <li>There are so many bold and unusual fragrances out there -- the kind you either can&#x27;t stand or absolutely love.</li>
            <li>and I was thrilled that it was the exact one you can buy at Sephora or Nordstrom for $72</li>
            <li>This is such a beautiful fragrance but don&#x27;t expect anyone to smell it  </li>
            <li>One of the rare perfumes I&#x27;ve found that blends well with warm or cool scented lotions.</li>
            <li>I have worn many perfumes, my husband prefers light, sweet, candy smells....</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t speak on behalf of Amazon sellers, but Amazon itself did a wonderful job of providing me this perfume at almost half the price of the mall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From the very first time, I smelled this in a magazine, I have adored it!  </li>
            <li>but I wanted something a little more exotic, adventurous, and warm.</li>
            <li>It is a very sweet smell that isn&#x27;t too powerful.</li>
            <li>When I found it in Amazon for just $41, I was beyond excited.</li>
            <li>BUT IM SO EXCITED TO WEAR IT.</li>
            <li>Living in such a hot and humid climate makes the need for a perfume that can make you smell good even though you&#x27;re sweating without being over powering, and this fits that need!</li>
            <li>It is the most lovely scent I have ever smelled - soft, sweet and ultra-feminine.  </li>
            <li>It is hardly noticeable to others unless they stand closely, which is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Hard to describe, but delicious to smell.  </li>
            <li>For me, it starts out sweet, floral, and almost candy-like.  </li>
            <li>It is relatively mild and doesn&#x27;t shout out</li>
            <li>that is pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>I will be a pretty princess for quite a while!  </li>
            <li>This is a great perfume but a little pricey.</li>
            <li>A great scent for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of a grown up sexy version of Love&#x27;s Baby Soft from when I was a young girl.</li>
            <li>however after wearing the scent for a while, it has a distinctive smell i really enjoy, really makes you feel royal, if you will.</li>
            <li>I am over fifty years old, and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is soft and lovely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh, feminine scent and</li>
            <li>husband really likes this perfume, which is very rare for him.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just perfect, not too harsh and not too light... plus the scent lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li>I, on the other hand, loved it. .</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t smell right and is not the right color.  </li>
            <li>I coundn&#x27;t afford it right a way,</li>
            <li>right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, it&#x27;s a great perfume for a little girl, actually.</li>
            <li>When I wear it, I just breathe in my own scent all day long.  </li>
            <li>I like this fragrance very much.</li>
            <li>I should first say, though, that my philosophy on perfumes is that they should be relatively unobtrusive; I always want the perfumes I wear to be a \\&quot;safe scent\\&quot; -- meaning, one that nobody would find offensive.</li>
            <li>When I first smelled this in a magazine, I had to take another sniff</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s not the real thing!</li>
            <li>FIRST TIME I BUY A FRAGRANCE LIKE THIS.</li>
            <li>Anyways I saw this pretty purple bottle in the shape of a heart with a crown and the title &#x27;princess&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I found this perfume when browsing a department store looking for my favorite scent, Blue by Polo Ralph Lauren.</li>
            <li>This was my first Vera Wang fragrance purchase.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it lasts the same amount of time as most perfumes (about 8 or so</li>
            <li>My husband comments on how good I smell everyday.  </li>
            <li>My only problem is even though I still smell great, in winter it seems to be more subtle then</li>
            <li>fragrance is perfect for anyone (teen or adult) and it&#x27;s great for casual uses (such as for a day at work or school).</li>
            <li>-- it is a soft, gently sweet floral with a hint of fruity-ness.</li>
            <li>it smells soft n sweet.</li>
            <li>In short: The product sold here is just an overpriced cheap knock-off of the real Vera Wang Princess - don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li>I am someone who is very particular how I smell.</li>
            <li>when i bought it, it was purely for the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who already feels like a princess or wants to feel like one!</li>
            <li>really helps out.  </li>
            <li>If you are a fan of Light Blue, then try this.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very soothing to me-</li>
            <li>This is my VERY 1st review.....</li>
            <li>This is the perfect scent for me as it is interesting, sweet without being annoying, and has enough spice and cheekiness for it not to be childish or overwhelmingly \\&quot;vanilla\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>; it is muskier than scents i&#x27;ve worn in the past but that definitely makes it more grown up and sexy.  </li>
            <li>However, when it is still within that first hour of me putting it on, people always come up to me saying, \\&quot;wow</li>
            <li>THE SCENT DOES HAVE HINT OF COTTON CANDY WITH SWEET FLOWER MIXED IN.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t get enough of this sweet floral scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Designers try to come up with new and unusual ideas for scents, so that their scent will stand out among the rest.</li>
            <li>anyways I love it still, just find it odd that the color is changing.</li>
            <li>I actually wanted beyond Paradise Blue which has a more crispy fruity aquatic smell.</li>
            <li>perfume has decent staying power -- for me, 8-10 hours</li>
            <li>Overall, a very pretty fragrance for a young woman that wants to feel like a princess.</li>
            <li>Normally, I&#x27;m a citrusy person, But I smelled this somewhere and the smell just caught my attention.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously Vera Wang Princess is not for people who like heavy, woodsy, exotic scents.  </li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t like the musky fragrances, but I don&#x27;t smell that near as much as I do the harmonious blend of mandarin, apple, lily and chocolate, and ya gotta love chocolate.</li>
            <li>girl\\&quot; but the scents of lily, apple, chocolate and a hint of vanilla blend so well and smell so intoxicating together that this is definitely my new signature scent (replacing Burberry Brit :o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is mildly sweet but not sugary or sickening in any way, though its sweet quality does seem to make it more suited for younger women rather than those looking for a more \\&quot;mature\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>Although I can still smell it on my wrist more than 10 hours later, I feel the intensity of the smell dimishes after only a couple of hours which is why I gave it only 4 stars.</li>
            <li>I love to find the small things that help keep aging at bay and having a sweeter, youthful sort of scent like this</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not too mature!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually care for Vera Wang&#x27;s scents, since their usually more floral, but</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the exact same price I paid for at Boscovs.</li>
            <li>Then again considering that I put on the scent around 7am means it does last pretty well</li>
            <li>THE SCENT IS SWEET BUT LIGHTER THAN PINK SUGAR.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes a lightly spicy citrus begins to emerge and mixes with a soft, musky vanilla.  </li>
            <li>If it had not been marketed to young girls, you would not even think of it as being girlish.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, but in the summer I might choose something cleaner or lighter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised this won a fragrance of the year award for 2006.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing a sample of this for two weeks and will be buying a bottle in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The perfume was compared to the baby soft product from days gone by...</li>
            <li>I agree with others who say it does not last as long as others -- however, for me it is perfectly adequate.</li>
            <li>It is not little girly at all.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still over half way full.</li>
            <li>So when the day finally came to buy a new bottle of perfume I bought Princess instead of Blue, the large bottle.</li>
            <li>It smells a bit similar to Aquolina Pink Sugar, but not as over-powering or overly sweet.  </li>
            <li>I am giving this scent 3 stars because it does not last long on me, but its worth the try</li>
            <li>PINK SUGAR IS PURE COTTON CANDY SCENT.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1)Despite what others might say, I would say this fragrance has a more moderate scent strength rather than a subtle that</li>
            <li>The large bottle has lasted me a long time, I&#x27;ve had it for several months now</li>
            <li>This perfume is definitely recommended for young girls...</li>
            <li>BUT now months later, I&#x27;ve noticed the color change over some months, first it was purpleish, then pink</li>
            <li>I suppose it was too sweet for her liking (she&#x27;s a big fan of perfumes like Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Green Tea and Red Door).</li>
            <li>I only use perfumes that give me that intense feeling of scent-pleasure when I first smell it, I mean my ears have to perk up when I smell it before I even consider wearing it.</li>
            <li>It is the right contrast of floral and has a little sweetness to it!</li>
            <li>If you can afford the extra and you want the scent to last, buy the lotion with it (which is probably why they made the scent not long</li>
    </ol>

            <li> THE BOTTLE IS SOOOOOO CUTE</li>
            <li> I THINK ITS MORE OF A NIGHT-OUT-ON-THE TOWN SORT OF SCENT.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments....</li>
            <li> And they throw in a fancy gift box for free!</li>
            <li> so pleased and</li>
            <li> I love the color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a show piece to me than a workable scent, and one I like to look at and sniff but never choose to wear.</li>
            <li> Design, sure.</li>
            <li> This was in the summer and it lasted for most of the day, even in the 110 degree heat.</li>
            <li> THE BOTTLE IS ADORABLE.</li>
            <li> BUT BY AFTERNOON SCENT IS MOSTLY GONE.</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with this scent.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Totally in love</li>
            <li> I first found out about this perfume from one of my daughter&#x27;s friends who was joking about being able to use the pointy cap in case you ran out of pepper spray :P and I discovered the smell was pretty darn good.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for the perfect perfume for a long time.</li>
            <li> On Christmas morning, I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely the ideal fragrance for me.</li>
            <li> I love the notes of vanilla, and the fruity light smell it has.</li>
            <li> Love it, its light has a vanilla scent, it&#x27;s not a winter perfume its  a summer perfume.  </li>
            <li> I started out this smell-good quest wearing cheaper, but still delicious perfumes like Fresh White Musk and Fantasy.    </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;There are cheaper high quality perfumes that smell just as good.</li>
            <li> There are so many bold and unusual fragrances out there -- the kind you either can&#x27;t stand or absolutely love.</li>
            <li> and I was thrilled that it was the exact one you can buy at Sephora or Nordstrom for $72</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful fragrance but don&#x27;t expect anyone to smell it  </li>
            <li> One of the rare perfumes I&#x27;ve found that blends well with warm or cool scented lotions.</li>
            <li> I have worn many perfumes, my husband prefers light, sweet, candy smells....</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t speak on behalf of Amazon sellers, but Amazon itself did a wonderful job of providing me this perfume at almost half the price of the mall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From the very first time, I smelled this in a magazine, I have adored it!  </li>
            <li> but I wanted something a little more exotic, adventurous, and warm.</li>
            <li> It is a very sweet smell that isn&#x27;t too powerful.</li>
            <li> When I found it in Amazon for just $41, I was beyond excited.</li>
            <li> BUT IM SO EXCITED TO WEAR IT.</li>
            <li> Living in such a hot and humid climate makes the need for a perfume that can make you smell good even though you&#x27;re sweating without being over powering, and this fits that need!</li>
            <li> It is the most lovely scent I have ever smelled - soft, sweet and ultra-feminine.  </li>
            <li> It is hardly noticeable to others unless they stand closely, which is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> Hard to describe, but delicious to smell.  </li>
            <li> For me, it starts out sweet, floral, and almost candy-like.  </li>
            <li> It is relatively mild and doesn&#x27;t shout out</li>
            <li> that is pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> I will be a pretty princess for quite a while!  </li>
            <li> This is a great perfume but a little pricey.</li>
            <li> A great scent for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of a grown up sexy version of Love&#x27;s Baby Soft from when I was a young girl.</li>
            <li> however after wearing the scent for a while, it has a distinctive smell i really enjoy, really makes you feel royal, if you will.</li>
            <li> I am over fifty years old, and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is soft and lovely.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fresh, feminine scent and</li>
            <li> husband really likes this perfume, which is very rare for him.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just perfect, not too harsh and not too light... plus the scent lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> I, on the other hand, loved it. .</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t smell right and is not the right color.  </li>
            <li> I coundn&#x27;t afford it right a way,</li>
            <li> right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light, it&#x27;s a great perfume for a little girl, actually.</li>
            <li> When I wear it, I just breathe in my own scent all day long.  </li>
            <li> I like this fragrance very much.</li>
            <li> I should first say, though, that my philosophy on perfumes is that they should be relatively unobtrusive; I always want the perfumes I wear to be a \\&quot;safe scent\\&quot; -- meaning, one that nobody would find offensive.</li>
            <li> When I first smelled this in a magazine, I had to take another sniff</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s not the real thing!</li>
            <li> FIRST TIME I BUY A FRAGRANCE LIKE THIS.</li>
            <li> Anyways I saw this pretty purple bottle in the shape of a heart with a crown and the title &#x27;princess&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I found this perfume when browsing a department store looking for my favorite scent, Blue by Polo Ralph Lauren.</li>
            <li> This was my first Vera Wang fragrance purchase.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it lasts the same amount of time as most perfumes (about 8 or so</li>
            <li> My husband comments on how good I smell everyday.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is even though I still smell great, in winter it seems to be more subtle then</li>
            <li> fragrance is perfect for anyone (teen or adult) and it&#x27;s great for casual uses (such as for a day at work or school).</li>
            <li> -- it is a soft, gently sweet floral with a hint of fruity-ness.</li>
            <li> it smells soft n sweet.</li>
            <li> In short: The product sold here is just an overpriced cheap knock-off of the real Vera Wang Princess - don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I am someone who is very particular how I smell.</li>
            <li> when i bought it, it was purely for the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who already feels like a princess or wants to feel like one!</li>
            <li> really helps out.  </li>
            <li> If you are a fan of Light Blue, then try this.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very soothing to me-</li>
            <li> This is my VERY 1st review.....</li>
            <li> This is the perfect scent for me as it is interesting, sweet without being annoying, and has enough spice and cheekiness for it not to be childish or overwhelmingly \\&quot;vanilla\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> ; it is muskier than scents i&#x27;ve worn in the past but that definitely makes it more grown up and sexy.  </li>
            <li> However, when it is still within that first hour of me putting it on, people always come up to me saying, \\&quot;wow</li>
            <li> THE SCENT DOES HAVE HINT OF COTTON CANDY WITH SWEET FLOWER MIXED IN.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get enough of this sweet floral scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Designers try to come up with new and unusual ideas for scents, so that their scent will stand out among the rest.</li>
            <li> anyways I love it still, just find it odd that the color is changing.</li>
            <li> I actually wanted beyond Paradise Blue which has a more crispy fruity aquatic smell.</li>
            <li> perfume has decent staying power -- for me, 8-10 hours</li>
            <li> Overall, a very pretty fragrance for a young woman that wants to feel like a princess.</li>
            <li> Normally, I&#x27;m a citrusy person, But I smelled this somewhere and the smell just caught my attention.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously Vera Wang Princess is not for people who like heavy, woodsy, exotic scents.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like the musky fragrances, but I don&#x27;t smell that near as much as I do the harmonious blend of mandarin, apple, lily and chocolate, and ya gotta love chocolate.</li>
            <li> girl\\&quot; but the scents of lily, apple, chocolate and a hint of vanilla blend so well and smell so intoxicating together that this is definitely my new signature scent (replacing Burberry Brit :o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is mildly sweet but not sugary or sickening in any way, though its sweet quality does seem to make it more suited for younger women rather than those looking for a more \\&quot;mature\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> Although I can still smell it on my wrist more than 10 hours later, I feel the intensity of the smell dimishes after only a couple of hours which is why I gave it only 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I love to find the small things that help keep aging at bay and having a sweeter, youthful sort of scent like this</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too mature!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually care for Vera Wang&#x27;s scents, since their usually more floral, but</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the exact same price I paid for at Boscovs.</li>
            <li> Then again considering that I put on the scent around 7am means it does last pretty well</li>
            <li> THE SCENT IS SWEET BUT LIGHTER THAN PINK SUGAR.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes a lightly spicy citrus begins to emerge and mixes with a soft, musky vanilla.  </li>
            <li> If it had not been marketed to young girls, you would not even think of it as being girlish.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy, but in the summer I might choose something cleaner or lighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised this won a fragrance of the year award for 2006.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing a sample of this for two weeks and will be buying a bottle in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The perfume was compared to the baby soft product from days gone by...</li>
            <li> I agree with others who say it does not last as long as others -- however, for me it is perfectly adequate.</li>
            <li> It is not little girly at all.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still over half way full.</li>
            <li> So when the day finally came to buy a new bottle of perfume I bought Princess instead of Blue, the large bottle.</li>
            <li> It smells a bit similar to Aquolina Pink Sugar, but not as over-powering or overly sweet.  </li>
            <li> I am giving this scent 3 stars because it does not last long on me, but its worth the try</li>
            <li> PINK SUGAR IS PURE COTTON CANDY SCENT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1)Despite what others might say, I would say this fragrance has a more moderate scent strength rather than a subtle that</li>
            <li> The large bottle has lasted me a long time, I&#x27;ve had it for several months now</li>
            <li> This perfume is definitely recommended for young girls...</li>
            <li> BUT now months later, I&#x27;ve noticed the color change over some months, first it was purpleish, then pink</li>
            <li> I suppose it was too sweet for her liking (she&#x27;s a big fan of perfumes like Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Green Tea and Red Door).</li>
            <li> I only use perfumes that give me that intense feeling of scent-pleasure when I first smell it, I mean my ears have to perk up when I smell it before I even consider wearing it.</li>
            <li> It is the right contrast of floral and has a little sweetness to it!</li>
            <li> If you can afford the extra and you want the scent to last, buy the lotion with it (which is probably why they made the scent not long</li>
            <li> It is difficult to explain, when you first spray it on, you can&#x27;t help but notice it smells like an edible product, but moments later, it becomes more complex, and  then mysteriously addicting.  </li>
            <li> Notes include: guava, Tahitian flower, wild tuberose, and dark chocolate&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> make a long story short -</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long unless you spray a bunch!</li>
            <li> The packaging is not as high quality as the VW Princess bottles I&#x27;ve had in the past</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time on me and the scent is warm-floral that to me seems sophistocated but not old-lady-like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my skin because other perfumes last way longer on me.</li>
            <li> The bottle for Princess caught my eye and playfully I sprayed myself and went on with my shopping, planning to buy Blue within the next few days.</li>
            <li> Hell, even though Princess has some floral notes, it is a soft oriental perfume (it&#x27;s even infused with dark chocolate and vanilla!!!)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t turn back the clock, but I&#x27;m not going down without a fight either!</li>
            <li> , now it&#x27;s green and changing into a blue color, don&#x27;t know if I missed something or if it&#x27;s maybe the \\&quot;seller\\&quot;....  </li>
            <li> Notes include: pink frosting accord, amber, woods, musk, and vanilla&lt;</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I usually notice it on myself for 2-3 hours, but hours later people are still complimenting me on it, so I think people on here just don&#x27;t realize they still smell like it.</li>
            <li> I wear the lotion combined with the spray like I do all of my other perfumes.  </li>
            <li> But I have a really hard time making it last.</li>
            <li> Not exactly worth the expense considering.  </li>
            <li> (Scents change slightly with each persons body chemistry you know)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a little bit of citrus and a little bit of vanilla \\&quot;warmth\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I was worried that this fragrance was going to be too \\&quot;little</li>
            <li> Also, I use four sprays everyday, it is never overpowering and it lasts until I wash it off.  </li>
            <li> The staying power is pretty bad, though - just a few hours.  </li>
            <li> the smell doesn&#x27;t last which is really unfortunate and the reason I cannot rate it 5 stars.    </li>
            <li> USUALLY I GO FOR SOFTER AND LIGHTER SMELLS.</li>
            <li> anyone else who&#x27;s skeptical of ordering perfumes from Amazon, they&#x27;re totally legit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t met one person it offends including my mom who gets sick by the smell of certain perfumes.</li>
            <li> He usually finds perfumes to be too old-ladyish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I actually took him to Macy&#x27;s to show him what it looked like and smelled like so he wouldn&#x27;t get it wrong.  </li>
            <li> I am not a die hard perfume person</li>
            <li> I mean, I don&#x27;t expect it to last all day, but half the day shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. :(</li>
            <li> I am a subtle person and do not wish to leave a trail of scent behind me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After purchasing a fake watered down version of this perfume off ebay 2 years ago, I was skeptical to order it from amazon</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> incase I recieved another weird version of this perfume.</li>
            <li> I would get weird looks because I kept sticking my wrists to my nose to smell myself.</li>
            <li> But it is expensive!</li>
            <li> Of course, it&#x27;s very faint by hour 10, but my intention is not to wear something that overpowers.  </li>
            <li> However, the staying power is bad.</li>
            <li> So I returned the Beyond Paradise which isn&#x27;t a bad scent</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> even from relatives who HATE perfume!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> 4 1/2 stars. This perfume is one of my all-time favorites, and currently my signature scent. I should first say, though, that my philosophy on perfumes is that they should be relatively unobtrusive; I always want the perfumes I wear to be a \\&quot;safe scent\\&quot; -- meaning, one that nobody would find offensive. There are so many bold and unusual fragrances out there -- the kind you either can&#x27;t stand or absolutely love. Designers try to come up with new and unusual ideas for scents, so that their scent will stand out among the rest. Princess is not one of these scents. It is relatively mild and doesn&#x27;t shout out I&#x27;M WEARING PERFUME, SMELL ME A MILE AWAY. However, it has plenty going for it -- it is a soft, gently sweet floral with a hint of fruity-ness. My mother says it smells a bit like lavendar. It is mildly sweet but not sugary or sickening in any way, though its sweet quality does seem to make it more suited for younger women rather than those looking for a more \\&quot;mature\\&quot; scent. I agree with others who say it does not last as long as others -- however, for me it is perfectly adequate. I usually notice it on myself for 2-3 hours, but hours later people are still complimenting me on it, so I think people on here just don&#x27;t realize they still smell like it. Overall, a very pretty fragrance for a young woman that wants to feel like a princess.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrant smell of this perfume. It is my all-time favorite, BUT the smell doesn&#x27;t last which is really unfortunate and the reason I cannot rate it 5 stars.    However, when it is still within that first hour of me putting it on, people always come up to me saying, \\&quot;wow, you smell great\\&quot;!!!</li>
            <li> When I first smelled this in a magazine, I had to take another sniff -I was not expecting it to smell as good as it did! I immediately ran out and purchased this perfume and have been wearing it ever since. This fragrance combines a blend of floral, fruity, the sweetness of candy &amp; musk all rolled into one tantalizing smell. Although I can still smell it on my wrist more than 10 hours later, I feel the intensity of the smell dimishes after only a couple of hours which is why I gave it only 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Great perfume. The appeal is too teeny-bopper-ish for my taste, and I doubt the group that would like the bottle could afford $55 for perfume. Marketing ploys aside, the scent is very light and appealing. One of the rare perfumes I&#x27;ve found that blends well with warm or cool scented lotions. However, the staying power is bad. If you can afford the extra and you want the scent to last, buy the lotion with it (which is probably why they made the scent not long-lasting).&lt;br /&gt;Mixes very well with body chemistry and is a great, feminine scent.</li>
            <li> Wanna know why a $72 perfume only cost $41? Because it&#x27;s not the real thing! I&#x27;ve been buying this perfume from Sephora for the last couple of years and everytime the cashier said \\&quot;That will be $78 (with NYC tax)\\&quot; my heart skipped a beat. When I found it in Amazon for just $41, I was beyond excited. Unfortunately my happy \\&quot;I&#x27;m saving $37\\&quot; dance came to a screeching end when I received the product and took a whiff. It smells NOTHING like the real Princess perfume, instead of delicious sweetness I was greeted with the smell of cheap flowers. Hell, even though Princess has some floral notes, it is a soft oriental perfume (it&#x27;s even infused with dark chocolate and vanilla!!!) It&#x27;s NOT suppose to smell like a hardcore floral perfume!!!     In short: The product sold here is just an overpriced cheap knock-off of the real Vera Wang Princess - don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> It is difficult to explain, when you first spray it on, you can&#x27;t help but notice it smells like an edible product, but moments later, it becomes more complex, and  then mysteriously addicting.  I can&#x27;t imagine how anyone  can say this fragance doesn&#x27;t last.  I sprayed it on my hand, and I washed it several times, and I can still smell the next day!  If it had not been marketed to young girls, you would not even think of it as being girlish.  I am over fifty years old, and absolutely love it. It is a very warm, approachable fragrance.</li>
            <li> I gave my wife the 1.7 oz Equ de Toilette and 5 days later she was *still* thanking me and raving about it! I am extremely happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely the ideal fragrance for me. However, it lasts only 10 minutes. It&#x27;s not my skin because other perfumes last way longer on me.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago and love love the smell.  I can&#x27;t remember if I got it here on on e-bay..... BUT now months later, I&#x27;ve noticed the color change over some months, first it was purpleish, then pink, now it&#x27;s green and changing into a blue color, don&#x27;t know if I missed something or if it&#x27;s maybe the \\&quot;seller\\&quot;....  anyways I love it still, just find it odd that the color is changing.</li>
            <li> I sampled this product while at Ulta. I smelled it and absolutely loved it! I wear it all the time now. The only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long unless you spray a bunch! It is a very sweet smell that isn&#x27;t too powerful. Definitely a scent for daytime or evening.</li>
            <li> This is a great perfume but a little pricey. &lt;br /&gt;There are cheaper high quality perfumes that smell just as good.</li>
            <li> I love this smell.  Normally, I&#x27;m a citrusy person, But I smelled this somewhere and the smell just caught my attention.  It&#x27;s got a little bit of citrus and a little bit of vanilla \\&quot;warmth\\&quot;  I just love it!</li>
            <li> I first found out about this perfume from one of my daughter&#x27;s friends who was joking about being able to use the pointy cap in case you ran out of pepper spray :P and I discovered the smell was pretty darn good.  I love to find the small things that help keep aging at bay and having a sweeter, youthful sort of scent like this really helps out.  These are my favorites for the rest of the aging battle:    [[ASIN:B0002JVPT4 Lancome Absolue Replenishing Cream SPF 15]]  [[ASIN:B00024Y6W2 Clinique Clarifying Lotion 3]]  [[ASIN:B000NGRJB4 Relastin, Eye Silk, 0.5 oz, 15 ml]]  [[ASIN:B0009DSSC0 SkinCeuticals Ultimate UV Defense SPF 30 3oz]]  [[ASIN:B000OHE56Y RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Serum 1oz]]    I can&#x27;t turn back the clock, but I&#x27;m not going down without a fight either!</li>
            <li> Not only is it a delicious fragrance, but also a Crown Jewel to let everybody know what a Princess you are! This makes an awesome gift for a teenager- it&#x27;s not too mature!</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of Light Blue, then try this.  It&#x27;s just perfect, not too harsh and not too light... plus the scent lasts all day long.  Expect compliments!</li>
            <li> I like this fragrance very much. It lasts a long time on me and the scent is warm-floral that to me seems sophistocated but not old-lady-like. I think it could work for any season. It&#x27;s not heavy, but in the summer I might choose something cleaner or lighter.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the perfect perfume for a long time. I bought Escada Escada and thought that was it, but after trying a sample of this I know this is the perfect one! It is the right contrast of floral and has a little sweetness to it! The bottle is also the cutest thing I have ever seen! Try this, you will not be dissapointed!</li>
            <li> Okay so my hubby bought me a perfume I thought I wanted for Christmas, it was Estee Lauder Beyond Paradise. I actually wanted beyond Paradise Blue which has a more crispy fruity aquatic smell. However Blue was sold out. I am not a die hard perfume person So I returned the Beyond Paradise which isn&#x27;t a bad scent but I wanted something a little more exotic, adventurous, and warm. When I saw the purple heart shaped bottle wearing a crown I was in love. The scent is very soothing to me- I love the notes of vanilla, and the fruity light smell it has. I usually don&#x27;t like the musky fragrances, but I don&#x27;t smell that near as much as I do the harmonious blend of mandarin, apple, lily and chocolate, and ya gotta love chocolate. I only wish I got the bigger bottle. But at 1.7 oz. I will be a pretty princess for quite a while!  A little goes a long way. Pamper the princess in you, I am over 25, and this perfume was definately made for me. It is not little girly at all. A refined fragrance for women everywhere of every age.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong. This scent is incredible. My problem is for $68, it should stay on longer then 1hr and it does not.  I can literally hold my wrist up to my nose and not smell a thing.  If this came out in an actual perfume vial I might tray again but the toilette spray just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SCENT. FIRST TIME I BUY A FRAGRANCE LIKE THIS. USUALLY I GO FOR SOFTER AND LIGHTER SMELLS. BUT IM SO EXCITED TO WEAR IT. I JUST BOUGHT IT AND CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO TRY IT. THE BOTTLE IS SOOOOOO CUTE (BUT I WOULD NEVER WEAR THAT RING). LOL    I WOULDNT RECOMMEND FOR EVERYDAY/ ALL DAY WEAR. I THINK ITS MORE OF A NIGHT-OUT-ON-THE TOWN SORT OF SCENT.</li>
            <li> I suspect I was shipped a counterfeit product via Amazon of this product.  The packaging is not as high quality as the VW Princess bottles I&#x27;ve had in the past and it doesn&#x27;t smell right and is not the right color.  I would not purchase from this website again.</li>
            <li> Hi Guys!  This is my VERY 1st review.....I HAD to do it, because this scent is amazing and needs to be exposed!  I have worn many perfumes, my husband prefers light, sweet, candy smells....i think its the vanilla in them!  Angel used to be my #1 scent.  When I came across-ed this at Macy&#x27;s, my exact thought was BINGO!!!!  This hit the nail on the head!  When I wear it, I swear I cant get enough of the scent.....I get so many compliments....even from relatives who HATE perfume!  Its amazing!  I don&#x27;t usually care for Vera Wang&#x27;s scents, since their usually more floral, but this scent....AMAZING!!!  But, I think I said that already! LOL  Buy it!  Try it! You wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance! I gave it to my mother for Xmas, who is the pickiest person on Earth, and she loved it! Quite a testimonial! I was considering buying it for my daughter from Amazon...but it&#x27;s the exact same price I paid for at Boscovs. And they throw in a fancy gift box for free! Hmm.... &lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s up with that Amazon?</li>
            <li> I have to agree with every comment. I love it!!! I got this for Mother&#x27;s Day and it is so young smelling and simply wonderful. A great scent for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> After purchasing a fake watered down version of this perfume off ebay 2 years ago, I was skeptical to order it from amazon incase I recieved another weird version of this perfume. However, it came in the mail today and I was thrilled that it was the exact one you can buy at Sephora or Nordstrom for $72 and all i had to pay was $40 for the perfume (plus the $5 optional expedited shipping)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so pleased and anyone else who&#x27;s skeptical of ordering perfumes from Amazon, they&#x27;re totally legit.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak on behalf of Amazon sellers, but Amazon itself did a wonderful job of providing me this perfume at almost half the price of the mall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume n I love it!! it smells soft n sweet. its a great choice you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> I was absently walking through the jewelry and perfume area they throw at you when you walk in department stores. Anyways I saw this pretty purple bottle in the shape of a heart with a crown and the title &#x27;princess&#x27;. Amused I picked it up and smelled it.... Oh my! I LOVED the smell. I was completly hooked and I did a test squirt on my wrists and neck to see how it worked with my body chemistry. (Scents change slightly with each persons body chemistry you know) It was divine! I bought the gift set with the lotion and purse size bottle and that made it a really good deal for $60.</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful fragrance but don&#x27;t expect anyone to smell it  cause they won&#x27;t. I put it on generously but unless someone put their nose up against my skin they couldn&#x27;t smell it. Not exactly worth the expense considering.  What a shame.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long at all. Like an hour if that. It&#x27;s very light, it&#x27;s a great perfume for a little girl, actually. Not for a woman, or not for me, anyway. It&#x27;s not that I have anything at all against the scent itself, but it&#x27;s just got substance or soul. I love the bottle! I love the color. I like the lid and the cut of the glass is great. It&#x27;s more of a show piece to me than a workable scent, and one I like to look at and sniff but never choose to wear. And if I do, I know it can&#x27;t be an all-day smell for it will wear off nearly instantly. I&#x27;m really surprised this won a fragrance of the year award for 2006. Design, sure. But perfume... it&#x27;s hardly remarkable or memorable. But it is expensive!</li>
            <li> I am someone who is very particular how I smell. I must always smell great and I must always smell distinctive. I only use perfumes that give me that intense feeling of scent-pleasure when I first smell it, I mean my ears have to perk up when I smell it before I even consider wearing it. I started out this smell-good quest wearing cheaper, but still delicious perfumes like Fresh White Musk and Fantasy.    I found this perfume when browsing a department store looking for my favorite scent, Blue by Polo Ralph Lauren. The bottle for Princess caught my eye and playfully I sprayed myself and went on with my shopping, planning to buy Blue within the next few days. My friend who was with me kept commenting on how good I smelled, and I also couldn&#x27;t help but to smell myself. This was in the summer and it lasted for most of the day, even in the 110 degree heat. I would get weird looks because I kept sticking my wrists to my nose to smell myself. I had fallen in love with this scent!    So when the day finally came to buy a new bottle of perfume I bought Princess instead of Blue, the large bottle. When my boyfriend smelled it, he was very happy, he said I smelled great and like the fact it wasn&#x27;t as heavy as the winter perfume I kept wearing in summer. Living in such a hot and humid climate makes the need for a perfume that can make you smell good even though you&#x27;re sweating without being over powering, and this fits that need! The large bottle has lasted me a long time, I&#x27;ve had it for several months now and it&#x27;s still over half way full. I use it religiously every day!    My only problem is even though I still smell great, in winter it seems to be more subtle then I like and I have to reapply the scent before I go out in the evening. Then again considering that I put on the scent around 7am means it does last pretty well, I got a comment around 2pm from someone telling me how good I smelled.    This is a great scent and I would recommend it to anyone! You get tons of compliments with it and it smells great without overpowering anyone! I haven&#x27;t met one person it offends including my mom who gets sick by the smell of certain perfumes. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> THE SCENT IS SWEET BUT LIGHTER THAN PINK SUGAR. THE SCENT DOES HAVE HINT OF COTTON CANDY WITH SWEET FLOWER MIXED IN. PINK SUGAR IS PURE COTTON CANDY SCENT. THE BOTTLE IS ADORABLE. PRINCESS IS A TOILETTE NOT PERFUME, IT WILL REQUIRE REAPPLYING. I SPRAYED IN THE MORNING BUT BY AFTERNOON SCENT IS MOSTLY GONE.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is soft and lovely.  It reminds me of a grown up sexy version of Love&#x27;s Baby Soft from when I was a young girl.</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with this scent.  It is ever-evolving.  For me, it starts out sweet, floral, and almost candy-like.  After a few minutes a lightly spicy citrus begins to emerge and mixes with a soft, musky vanilla.  Currently, it&#x27;s been 2.5 hours since I put it on and I can smell the chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This perfume has decent staying power -- for me, 8-10 hours and I only use one spray.  Of course, it&#x27;s very faint by hour 10, but my intention is not to wear something that overpowers.  It is hardly noticeable to others unless they stand closely, which is perfect for me.  I am a subtle person and do not wish to leave a trail of scent behind me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband really likes this perfume, which is very rare for him. He usually finds perfumes to be too old-ladyish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously Vera Wang Princess is not for people who like heavy, woodsy, exotic scents.  This is the perfect scent for me as it is interesting, sweet without being annoying, and has enough spice and cheekiness for it not to be childish or overwhelmingly \\&quot;vanilla\\&quot;.  I have been wearing a sample of this for two weeks and will be buying a bottle in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update 4/21/07: Still wearing this.  Received a bottle on V-Day.  Love it.  It makes me feel yummy.  Have gotten compliments on it as well.  The staying power is pretty bad, though - just a few hours.  I would take away a star for that.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great perfume.</li>
            <li> when i bought it, it was purely for the bottle.  however after wearing the scent for a while, it has a distinctive smell i really enjoy, really makes you feel royal, if you will.</li>
            <li> This was my first Vera Wang fragrance purchase.  I was hooked after smelling the magazine sample earlier last year.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this beautiful fragrance from Macy&#x27;s on Saturday.  It is the most lovely scent I have ever smelled - soft, sweet and ultra-feminine.  It smells a bit similar to Aquolina Pink Sugar, but not as over-powering or overly sweet.  The packaging and bottle are also gorgeous.  This is just perfect, every girl needs this!</li>
            <li> This perfume is definitely recommended for young girls...maybe ages 7-16.  The perfume was compared to the baby soft product from days gone by...that is pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> From the very first time, I smelled this in a magazine, I have adored it!  I coundn&#x27;t afford it right a way, (it&#x27;s more expensive than any scent I&#x27;ve purchased in the past)but I was determined to get it.  I requested it as a Christmas gift from my husband and I actually took him to Macy&#x27;s to show him what it looked like and smelled like so he wouldn&#x27;t get it wrong.  On Christmas morning, I was not disappointed!  I started wearing it that day and have not missed a day since.  My husband comments on how good I smell everyday.  I usually go for citrusy scents, so that is what I noticed first about it; it is muskier than scents i&#x27;ve worn in the past but that definitely makes it more grown up and sexy.  Also, I use four sprays everyday, it is never overpowering and it lasts until I wash it off.  The bottle is gorgeous and it makes a wonderful gift.  I highly recommend this to anyone who already feels like a princess or wants to feel like one!</li>
            <li> This is an intoxicating smell.  When I wear it, I just breathe in my own scent all day long.  I love it when I catch a whif of myself!  I get compliments on it all of the time.  I wear the lotion combined with the spray like I do all of my other perfumes.  I find the scent lasts longer that way.  It&#x27;s a fresh, feminine scent and kind of has a vanilla-ish scent to it, but you don&#x27;t smell like a sugar cookie at all either.  Hard to describe, but delicious to smell.  Everyone I know loves it!    Em  My beauty secrets:  Absolue SPF15 by Lancome, Skin Revitalizer by Relastin, and Melon Daiquiri Lip Shine by Philosophy</li>
            <li> I was worried that this fragrance was going to be too \\&quot;little girl\\&quot; but the scents of lily, apple, chocolate and a hint of vanilla blend so well and smell so intoxicating together that this is definitely my new signature scent (replacing Burberry Brit :o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend loves the smell and buries his nose in my neck when I have it on. It stays all day...there was a review that said it only stayed for an hour, but I put it on 7 hours ago and can still smell it on my wrists right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally in love :o)</li>
            <li> Love it, its light has a vanilla scent, it&#x27;s not a winter perfume its  a summer perfume.  I am giving this scent 3 stars because it does not last long on me, but its worth the try</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume - really, it&#x27;s perfect. But I have a really hard time making it last. I use the body polish, then the lotion, then three spritzes of the perfume... and my husband can&#x27;t smell it three hours later. That&#x27;s just unacceptable considering the price of all three products together! I mean, I don&#x27;t expect it to last all day, but half the day shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. :(</li>
            <li> Initially my dad got this perfume for my mom when it just came out which was about 2 or so years ago and, I&#x27;m not going to lie, my mom did not like it. I suppose it was too sweet for her liking (she&#x27;s a big fan of perfumes like Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Green Tea and Red Door). I, on the other hand, loved it. . .So . .To make a long story short - I borrow this perfume all the time! I just can&#x27;t get enough of this sweet floral scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*High Notes include: water lily, apple,mandarin, and apricot.&lt;br /&gt;*Mid Notes include: guava, Tahitian flower, wild tuberose, and dark chocolate&lt;br /&gt;*Low Notes include: pink frosting accord, amber, woods, musk, and vanilla&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips/Suggestions/Comments involving Princess:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)Despite what others might say, I would say this fragrance has a more moderate scent strength rather than a subtle that \\&quot;no one can smell\\&quot;. I&#x27;d say it lasts the same amount of time as most perfumes (about 8 or so hours)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)The fragrance is perfect for anyone (teen or adult) and it&#x27;s great for casual uses (such as for a day at work or school).</li>
