    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>That part is great.  </li>
            <li>This is good stuff</li>
            <li>It feels good going on, and you can kinda feel it working (caffeine?), but I&#x27;ve used it for months and don&#x27;t SEE a difference.  </li>
            <li>It seems like my eyes have more irritation an hour or so after application.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>For only having used the product for two days now, I have had immediate results and am very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I made the purchase</li>
            <li>The product is refreshing and tightens the skin some.</li>
            <li>More to come.</li>
            <li>I think the Keihl&#x27;s works/feels a bit better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t actually notice too much of a difference in appearance after use but it does feel pleasant under the eyes and help me feel more awake in the mornings.</li>
            <li>I started using it after reading other men&#x27;s comments on the Internet and am really happy I did.  </li>
            <li>I do not get some of the great claims that I read in other reviews.</li>
            <li>The darkness under the eyes seem to lighten quickly as well.</li>
            <li>Good stuff to eliminate dry under-eye syndrome.  </li>
            <li>I would say so far it&#x27;s OK, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference when I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>This product is good for daily application, but is most obviously effective on Monday mornings or mornings after you stay out too late.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it for any guy who wants to reduce puffy, saggy eyes and have a better, youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product like this I have tried.  </li>
            <li>so I can see that this product could easily last me a year or more.</li>
            <li>Having used this product twice now, I can definitely say the puffiness under the eyes are reduced in a matter of minutes to a normal healthy appearance.  </li>
            <li>However, after just 2 weeks of once or twice daily use I have noticeable difference in puffiness and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I went to amazon and found that product,it really works for me if I dont tell you my under eyes</li>
            <li>I used this product for almost 1 year and didn&#x27;t really notice any difference.</li>
            <li>I used it day and night for about 2 weeks and under my eye started to become VERY</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I used to much of it….</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen much difference,</li>
            <li>I tried this the first few nights after it was delivered and felt ok when I put it on.</li>
            <li>I think I felt better because I was doing something about my dark circles.</li>
            <li>but maybe I need a little more time.</li>
            <li>I discontinued use and skin returned to normal.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands but Anthony Logistics has been far superior to all other eye creams I have used.</li>
            <li>I could actually feel the tightening under my eyes which was not uncomfortable, but felt normal and natural like they are supposed to be.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this is the only acceptable form of makeup for a 25 year old man.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t removed my bags completely, but when I apply it several times a day it does lessen them some.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product is good for daily application, but is most obviously effective on Monday mornings or mornings after you stay out too late. In my opinion, this is the only acceptable form of makeup for a 25 year old man.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month...no change in darkness. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> This is an Amazon Verified Purchase that I received in May 2013 and used daily, according to directions, for 2 months.  End result:  No change in appearance of eyelids.</li>
            <li> My under eyes was so dark anything I have used nothing happen.I went to amazon and found that product,it really works for me if I dont tell you my under eyes was so dark u wouldnt beleive me.U guys should check that product out to see how it works.</li>
            <li> Use it every morning.. I use it after graveyard shifts.. I use it after the astringent and when it dries I add the moisturizer.  Lasts forever.. Will use again.</li>
            <li> This is the first product like this I have tried.  It might have improved the darkness under the eyes but it did not help with the puffiness or wrinkles.  Not sure but I think it creeps into the eyes after a while.  It seems like my eyes have more irritation an hour or so after application.  Nothing horrible or anything.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually notice too much of a difference in appearance after use but it does feel pleasant under the eyes and help me feel more awake in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Good stuff to eliminate dry under-eye syndrome.  I started using it after reading other men&#x27;s comments on the Internet and am really happy I did.  This is good stuff and I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I used this product for almost 1 year and didn&#x27;t really notice any difference. I think I felt better because I was doing something about my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Little expensive for not seeing to big results.</li>
            <li> I used it day and night for about 2 weeks and under my eye started to become VERY irritated@!#$ So I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I used to much of it…. Now I only use it 2 times a week or not at all….</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was intrigued by the caffeine added.  That part is great.  However, after just 2 weeks of once or twice daily use I have noticeable difference in puffiness and fine lines.  I love it.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 3 weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen much difference, but maybe I need a little more time.</li>
            <li> Having now turned 40, I noticed my eyes were beginning to look tired, puffy and with dark circles.  My biggest concern was the puffiness I have felt under my eyes lately.  Not only was the puffiness unsightly, it felt uncomfortable too.  Having used this product twice now, I can definitely say the puffiness under the eyes are reduced in a matter of minutes to a normal healthy appearance.  I could actually feel the tightening under my eyes which was not uncomfortable, but felt normal and natural like they are supposed to be. The darkness under the eyes seem to lighten quickly as well. I have not noticed a decrease in lines/wrinkles yet, but my wife tells me it takes a while of using the product to notice that difference.  For only having used the product for two days now, I have had immediate results and am very happy with this product.  I am glad I made the purchase and I would highly recommend it for any guy who wants to reduce puffy, saggy eyes and have a better, youthful appearance.  Also, you only have to use the slightes amount so I can see that this product could easily last me a year or more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now.  I have tried other brands but Anthony Logistics has been far superior to all other eye creams I have used.</li>

            <li> I would say so far it&#x27;s OK, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference when I don&#x27;t use it.  I will continue to try it and see what results I get.  More to come.</li>
            <li> I read some of the other reviews and was worried about the skin sensitivity as I do have sensitive skin; luckliy I have not had any issues with the product. While it does seem to help. I do not get some of the great claims that I read in other reviews. Not sure if I would pay $28 again for the product though.</li>
            <li> I tried this the first few nights after it was delivered and felt ok when I put it on. After 3 nights, my skin turned all flaky and irritated. I discontinued use and skin returned to normal.</li>
            <li> It feels good going on, and you can kinda feel it working (caffeine?), but I&#x27;ve used it for months and don&#x27;t SEE a difference.  I think the Keihl&#x27;s works/feels a bit better.</li>
