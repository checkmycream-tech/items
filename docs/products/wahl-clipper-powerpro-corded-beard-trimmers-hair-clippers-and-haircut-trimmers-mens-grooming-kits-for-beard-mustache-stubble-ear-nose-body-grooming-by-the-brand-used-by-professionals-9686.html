            <li>I&#x27;ve cut my hair and my son&#x27;s twice and it does a great job for clipping n trimming.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great for at-home use.</li>
            <li>Great ordering and receiving experience.</li>
            <li>great</li>

            <li>Great choice, would buy again.</li>
            <li>Great price.  </li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>it is very handy.</li>
            <li>Very nice trimmer...love it</li>
            <li>It does make a fair amount of noise in use, though oiling helps (and should keep it clipping happily).</li>
            <li>Excellent product and was shipped fast!!!!</li>
            <li>Good size.</li>
            <li>Wahl makes really good products</li>
            <li>It was a good buy, good investment, they are getting the job done...</li>
            <li>fair price and a good product</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>and it did good on my grizzly face muff.  </li>
            <li>And the detailer might be good for nose hair</li>
            <li>It feels great in your hands, nice and slim.</li>
            <li>It came with a surprising amount of attachments for all kinds of styling that I may never use</li>
            <li>Price good.  </li>
            <li>Good quality.  </li>
            <li>And this does not feel good.</li>
            <li>Very good product and very good attention and continue to improve thanks</li>
            <li>Great product absolutely love</li>
            <li>He was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Works great, love that it plugs in, powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although this isn&#x27;t exactly a manual razor replacement since it doesn&#x27;t shave skin-close, if you are like me and tend to let your hair grow out, using this will save you a ton of time, which for me makes it rather priceless.</li>
            <li>The amount of options you get with this trimmer is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I also use them to fade my son&#x27;s hair and give him nice edges and designs in his hair.</li>
            <li>Nice to have the three clipper sizes.  </li>
            <li>Does not provide the closeness needed for nice trimmed beard.</li>
            <li>It even works for the nose hair, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>and it came with its own case.  </li>
            <li>I own a WalMart purchased, battery powered,</li>
            <li>One of the best on the market may be more powerful than the wahl detailer.</li>
            <li>good quality for sure.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to know I have options.  </li>
            <li>With my son, it works flawless as his hair as not thick at all</li>
            <li>The motor is strong, and the detailer is good.</li>
            <li>Great product delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>I really liked it better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>Handy, light, plenty of attachments!</li>
            <li>great price right size for travel</li>
            <li>I replaced my clippers and trimmer at work, I made a very good choice, would highly recommend this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>These clippers are very light weight and do not cut well at all.  </li>
            <li>I really love this clipper/trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Compare this to an Oster, which has a much better design. .</li>
            <li>Trimming is okay, although the hair &amp; trimmer blades  occasionaly pull.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Have lost count on how many I have owned.  </li>
            <li>The plug in isn&#x27;t all that more bulky, and no matter where I would take this</li>
            <li>guide heads could be better</li>
            <li>More attachments than you could ever use or need.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;The clipper died within 5 min of use and even before that it was more pulling than cutting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better for self-use.</li>
            <li>This is not a product I would recommend to many people.</li>
            <li>And most of the attachments are superfluous.</li>
            <li>I really love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Love it, so convenient love having it being corded</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through so many cordless trimmers and the batteries on them always fade.</li>
            <li>If your looking for the perfect replacement for your Lithium Ion Wahl Trimmer, look no further.  </li>
            <li>Has more attachments than you&#x27;ll ever use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Like it much better than the cordless.</li>
            <li>The ones I had for over a year and 1/2  that I was replacing still cut better than these.  </li>
            <li>Love the quality of Wahl.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m usually satisfied with their service.</li>
            <li>These work pretty good but doesn&#x27;t get as close as I would want them to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first trimmer I&#x27;ve used of any kind of professional quality, but given that quality, as well as the price, I&#x27;m comfortable saying that I purchased the best trimmer for me.</li>
            <li>Wahl makes great professional clippers and trimmers.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s blades are the most comfortable type you can use to remove hair.</li>
            <li>Works good so far but need to use it many more times to know its durability.</li>
            <li>REALLY CUTS GOOD, SO KNOW</li>
            <li>Thanks for a superior product.</li>
            <li>I really like it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, I can&#x27;t say this is the absolute best trimmer ever, only that I got lucky and made a great purchase that I think I&#x27;ll be happy with for a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this a few years and its very precise and works awesome for beard / body</li>
            <li>Pretty good, it has a nice long cord and a good range of attachment sizes.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer blade does not seem to give the best type of sharp cut when lining around the edges of the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and easy to change heads and combs.</li>
            <li>I have interchanged the blades a couple times and it was really easy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to trim where you want and not where you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>;  Light duty would be more accurate.  </li>
            <li>These Wahl clippers are easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>still holding strong after a year of purchase</li>
            <li>Strong motor.</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer just the right size, I love that it has a cord</li>
            <li>I would not recommend to buy these if getting this to cut/shave your hair, but as a beard trimmer they are fine.</li>
            <li>The unit is light and relatively easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>All of the attachment s fit perfectly and the little bag that comes with</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only ever used cheap, battery-powered trimmers before, I decided to step up to the corded design, and man am I happy.</li>
            <li>Solid product at a great price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for several months now without any issue, a great buy</li>
            <li>I got it for beard trimming so its not a deal breaker, but its a shame I also need to have a more powerful Wahl hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>Instead of providing the buyer with superfluous, cheap accessories, the company should have focused  on maintaining the quality of there product.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for the price.  </li>
            <li>Affordable and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Wahl clipper/trimmer that seem more powerful that this.  </li>
            <li>All the blades, shavers, a combs fit.  </li>
            <li>The Clipper are made well and have great options like different blades.</li>
            <li>Comfortable in the hand, light weight, attachments are plentiful</li>
            <li>so far everything&#x27;s good...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it would be good for a professional barber</li>
            <li>Maybe good for young children.</li>
            <li>Not as good as an old set of cheap Wahl clippers(the gold ones)</li>
            <li>must say this trimmer is very powerful.</li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>Does a great job trimming your beard to a clean low level.</li>
            <li>I replaced a cheap battery-powered trimmer with it, and it is a significant improvement (not like</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with the clippers and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>i bought this because i needed something to trim my mustache a little more precise than i can with a sissors, and it works great.</li>
            <li>I bought the cordless originally for my beard but have since gone to using this.</li>
            <li>AND SO FAR, I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED...</li>
            <li>I had wanted some new clippers that could cut close and give me a nice bald look.</li>
            <li>The cord is very long, I want to say like 8ft, so I can plug it in and stand in the shower to trim my beard to keep my wife happy and not get trimmings all over the sink area.</li>
            <li>so i can shave my neck clean.</li>
            <li>I use this to clean up my sideburns and around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>only knock off a star because it has snagged on my hair which isn&#x27;t pleasant...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and powerful.</li>
            <li>All was as expected and the product is great.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good product.</li>
            <li>and it left lines all over and didn&#x27;t cut that good at all.</li>
            <li>After experiencing the incredible efficiency of this razor, I doubt I will ever be able to go back to shaving with only a manual razor, and I doubt you will, either.</li>
            <li>is true.</li>
            <li>Attachments work good and it is quiet.  </li>
            <li>The 9307 model has a huge stock at WalMart right now this 2013 summer.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how much I didn&#x27;t like this thing, considering the good reviews it had.</li>
            <li>I have had multiple Wahl recharge units, and it is nice as those adapters fit this one</li>
            <li>Way more attachments than are useful really.</li>
            <li>Even the ones that are rechargeable quickly lose their ability to charge.</li>
            <li>The cord was a risk, but I got lucky with this one.  </li>
            <li>And was delivered to quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will last a few years, but I&#x27;m not overly impressed.  </li>
            <li>I just opened the box and finished using this product for the very first time.</li>
            <li>That wasn&#x27;t clear from any descriptions, and other products seemed to have a bulky adapter for a plug, so I was unsure, and then very happy with this result.</li>
            <li>The very first time I used them, they literally blew up in my hand.</li>
            <li>Cuts hair pretty precise.</li>
            <li>Clippers were easy to hold on to as well, which I appreciated.</li>
            <li>but this time i choose one with a cord,so differant way more power after the first time i knew i would&#x27;nt need to try any other kind.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li>My complaints would be that, although it&#x27;s quite powerful, it seems to pull hair a lot.  </li>
            <li>which was exciting.</li>
            <li>3 Fixed blades that pull more than trim.  </li>
            <li>, this is powerful and versatile -</li>
            <li>Loud but way more reliable and powerful than the battery ones.</li>
            <li>Once I got it in the mail I tested it out with the pre-attached wide blade and was amazed at how quickly and easily I was able to shave.</li>
            <li>I intended to use that blade for my face, as it leaves just the right amount of stubble.</li>
            <li>do not cut right for me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right size.</li>
            <li>and I took the thing right out of the box with</li>
            <li>If I go straight at it with these they tend to get hot and sound like they are struggling.</li>
            <li>trimmer has a nice long cord.  </li>
            <li>Nice long cord.</li>
            <li>Honestly, how long does it take you to trim?</li>
            <li>Although this razor will give you a very quick and nearly painless shave (you may experience the occasional hair snag), it is important to note that neither of the two full-sized blades will give you a completely close shave and will instead give you more of a five o&#x27;clock shadow sort of look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These made him was to use the new toy and since Christmas he has been cleanly trimmed because he enjoys using them.</li>
            <li>Tried these clippers for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>So much better than any battery operated set of clippers I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;ve had several.</li>
            <li>The rest of the attachments, stainless steel blades, as a clipper/beard trimmer are worth the price.</li>
            <li>This trimmer was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Wahl beard trimmers owning.</li>
            <li>First impressions: 1)</li>
            <li>nice long cord thanks james</li>
            <li>my actual rating is more like a 4.5</li>
            <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the top portion sometimes pops off inadvertently</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Included is the ever more necessary nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Other popular models seemed to boast of smallness or compactness.</li>
            <li>nice powerful little clipper.</li>
            <li>I got tired of disposing of otherwise perfectly good trimmers just because they wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more and couldn&#x27;t accept new batteries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a month of use trimming my beard, I am quite pleased with this purchase and suspect it will long outlast anything powered by batteries.  </li>
            <li>Good trimmer, small, portable, gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>If you are in the market for the personal trimmer a AA battery trimmer will do the job better than this particular Wahl.</li>
            <li>Luckily I dropped it quick enough before getting hurt or hurting my boyfriends</li>
            <li>Snaps out and the other in very easily.</li>
            <li>Simple and strong.  </li>
            <li>bottom line is that these are inexpensive, good quality beard clippers that (hopefully) will last a long time.</li>
            <li>happy with the amount of time it took to trim my beard and after back and forth up and down</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>And who really needs to do any hair trimming away from electrical outlets</li>
            <li>The motor is noisy, the casing shakes, and the materials feel cheap (especially the cord).  </li>
            <li>The touch up blade does not cut very close to the skin either.</li>
            <li>The real deal.</li>
            <li>and it can get very close to my nose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product and ready to go at any time.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li>I expected more, for it works</li>
            <li>The Power Pro Corded Hair Clipper, Trimmer and Detailer doesn&#x27;t really trim the beard that well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and reliable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tired of devoting so much time to trimming my hair, I started searching for an electric razor and decided to buy this one since it was moderately-priced</li>
            <li>never have to buy another trimmer again thanks to this thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real step up from my battery op norelco and it was cheaper.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s really picky</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my son who absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>and I was ready.</li>
            <li>Its exactly what i need to trim the boys&#x27; hair between barber visits but its also exactly what i need to keep my goatee trimmed and professional looking.</li>
            <li>I went thru it like butter, and in just a few minutes I had a nice even trim with no noticable tugging.</li>
            <li>It appears at first glance to be adequate EXCEPT the &amp;#34;6-position trimming guide&amp;#34; appears flimsy, especially the mechanism for latching into one of the six positions.  </li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said it does most things advertised well.</li>
            <li>They are a decent replacement to the wahl chippers I had before these.</li>
            <li>Way better than the older cordless one that will only last two maybe three years !</li>
            <li>Few snags on the beard, but overall good.</li>
            <li>WOW!!  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;d love it if it was a little quieter).</li>
            <li>And the best part is the batteries will never go bad</li>
            <li>the freedom to choose amongst 1000 crappy options -- just bought the NORELCO MULTI GROOM PLUS, which has not quite as much power, is not as precise, but seems slightly more reliable and expensive</li>
            <li>Runs cool, fits contours well, long reach power cord.</li>
            <li>Plenty powerful enough.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used it for basic trimming of my goatee, but it has so many attachments I can do whatever with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have big hands, and the size and weight feel right.</li>
            <li>I am in the process of talking to Amazon right now about getting my money back.</li>
            <li>The cord is super long and this helps when in use.</li>
            <li>Also, the adjustable trimmer head (the only one long enough to trim more to lengths longer than a 1/2&amp;#34;) does not stay locked at the desired length.  </li>
            <li>They are good for those people who have sensitive skin, because they are not as sharp as some other detailer/trimmers.</li>
            <li>Cuts well , but make lot of noise for a new stuff.</li>
            <li>All new shiny, and new smelly...</li>
            <li>A man just knows when it&#x27;s time for some new trimming gear</li>
            <li>I is wise to use two mirrors ( one in front of you and one behind you) so that you can see what you are doing as you cut your hair but that would be true for any other unit.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The seem to have a powerful motor, and they are not very loud.  </li>
            <li>where it&#x27;s much easier to clean the resulting mess than over the sink.  </li>
            <li>The cord is extra long, which makes shaving over the tub easy.  </li>
            <li>This was one of my husband&#x27;s Christmas presents and, so far, he has not complained.  </li>
            <li>Does the job of trimming hair, and seems to work better than the battery operated ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>Its nice to look like i just left the barber and spent big money every day.</li>
            <li>I have always owned battery/cordless clippers and it took my old one dying to get me to shop for a new one.  </li>
            <li>so the corded function made this the perfect trimmer, EXCEPT it broke (just stopped running completely) after 4 months, leaving me stranded in the middle of vacation looking kind of rough -- It&#x27;s a shame that this product doesn&#x27;t exist at a slightly higher price point with better build quality -- there are 600+ expensive and inexpensive pieces of crap shavers out there, but I just want one that works without a battery--</li>
            <li>The naked trimmer also seems to cut pretty long, other trimmers I&#x27;ve had seem to do a better job.  </li>
            <li>The clipper blades are super sharp, so I don&#x27;t have any hair pulling.  </li>
            <li>so far</li>
            <li>Bought it for my bf after his old one bit the dust.  </li>
            <li>The beard trimmer and mini clippers seem to be the things it does well, the personal trimmer not so much.</li>
            <li>Trimming the hairline on my neck before the battery died on my old trimmer was quite a challenge.</li>
            <li>read reviews that said this was loud.  </li>
            <li>Replaced my old Wahl trimmer with this newer model.</li>
            <li>Had the old one for 15 years.</li>
            <li>So far, it has been just what he needed for trimming up his beard.</li>
            <li>thing is so loud, my ears ring for a minute after use.</li>
            <li>he loves it so far</li>
            <li>Actually, I am surprised that the clipper has worked well and reliably for quite a while now.</li>
            <li>After looking at many corded options I decided on the Wahl 9686 for a few reasons, namely the reviews of it &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34; solid and &amp;#34;man sized&amp;#34; and being in my budget.  </li>
            <li>He has killed a couple of those battery operated trimmers and pretty much gave up on trimming at all.</li>
            <li>This was my husband&#x27;s favorite Christmas present this past year.</li>
            <li>Super weak, not good for a professional, maybe good for home use</li>
            <li>Accurate product description and love the versatility of swapping the different heads for cutting and trimming.</li>
            <li>so rarely it&#x27;s almost not worth taking a star off...</li>
            <li>this one is so powerful and it hasn&#x27;t shown any sign of slowing down.</li>
            <li>Sure, there are lots of fancy pieces with it, but for pure beard trimming, it fails.  </li>
            <li>While these do give you a really close shave, after letting my beard grow out for a couple of weeks it would take me literally 30 minutes to remove all my facial hair, so I dreaded my inevitable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>addition to being fast, this razor comes with more attachments than you will likely know what to do with, three different blades, a very long cord, a compact but functional carrying case, and a small bottle of oil for maintaining the blades.</li>
            <li>Cut through my hair quickly and without the tug and pull of my previous set that left my scalp with a burning sensation.  </li>
            <li>Having had the Whal Lion cordless trimmer and liked it (it got stolen sadly)</li>
            <li>The guards and other accessories are a little on the flimsy side, but work fine.</li>
            <li>not sharp enough for professionals use</li>
            <li>It does work very well but does have a habit of sometimes getting &amp;#34;bogged&amp;#34; down with hair.  </li>
            <li>Good trimmer, decent power, had to send away for a separate nose attachment, which should just be included -- I hate the unreliability of batteries</li>
            <li>The array of cutting heads and combs mean I will be able to use this for more than simply trimming my beard.</li>
            <li>My main reason for buying this was for the 1&amp;#34; long combs for trimming my long beard (I haven&#x27;t found another beard trimmer with combs that big!).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay but pulls your hair very cheap and very disappointed.</li>
            <li>Electric shavers simply don&#x27;t shave as close as manual razors, but if you do want a really close shave, you can trim your hair with this then trim the remaining hair with a manual razor with a lot less effort than would be required without using this first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The main purpose of me buying these is to keep my beard trimmed down to a number 2.</li>

            <li> it is very handy.</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer...love it</li>
            <li> It does make a fair amount of noise in use, though oiling helps (and should keep it clipping happily).</li>
            <li> Excellent product and was shipped fast!!!!</li>
            <li> Good size.</li>
            <li> Wahl makes really good products</li>
            <li> It was a good buy, good investment, they are getting the job done...</li>
            <li> fair price and a good product</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> and it did good on my grizzly face muff.  </li>
            <li> And the detailer might be good for nose hair</li>
            <li> It feels great in your hands, nice and slim.</li>
            <li> It came with a surprising amount of attachments for all kinds of styling that I may never use</li>
            <li> Price good.  </li>
            <li> Good quality.  </li>
            <li> And this does not feel good.</li>
            <li> Very good product and very good attention and continue to improve thanks</li>
            <li> Great product absolutely love</li>
            <li> He was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Works great, love that it plugs in, powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although this isn&#x27;t exactly a manual razor replacement since it doesn&#x27;t shave skin-close, if you are like me and tend to let your hair grow out, using this will save you a ton of time, which for me makes it rather priceless.</li>
            <li> The amount of options you get with this trimmer is amazing.</li>
            <li> and I also use them to fade my son&#x27;s hair and give him nice edges and designs in his hair.</li>
            <li> Nice to have the three clipper sizes.  </li>
            <li> Does not provide the closeness needed for nice trimmed beard.</li>
            <li> It even works for the nose hair, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> and it came with its own case.  </li>
            <li> I own a WalMart purchased, battery powered,</li>
            <li> One of the best on the market may be more powerful than the wahl detailer.</li>
            <li> good quality for sure.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to know I have options.  </li>
            <li> With my son, it works flawless as his hair as not thick at all</li>
            <li> The motor is strong, and the detailer is good.</li>
            <li> Great product delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I really liked it better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> Handy, light, plenty of attachments!</li>
            <li> great price right size for travel</li>
            <li> I replaced my clippers and trimmer at work, I made a very good choice, would highly recommend this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> These clippers are very light weight and do not cut well at all.  </li>
            <li> I really love this clipper/trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Compare this to an Oster, which has a much better design. .</li>
            <li> Trimming is okay, although the hair &amp; trimmer blades  occasionaly pull.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Have lost count on how many I have owned.  </li>
            <li> The plug in isn&#x27;t all that more bulky, and no matter where I would take this</li>
            <li> guide heads could be better</li>
            <li> More attachments than you could ever use or need.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;The clipper died within 5 min of use and even before that it was more pulling than cutting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better for self-use.</li>
            <li> This is not a product I would recommend to many people.</li>
            <li> And most of the attachments are superfluous.</li>
            <li> I really love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Love it, so convenient love having it being corded</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through so many cordless trimmers and the batteries on them always fade.</li>
            <li> If your looking for the perfect replacement for your Lithium Ion Wahl Trimmer, look no further.  </li>
            <li> Has more attachments than you&#x27;ll ever use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Like it much better than the cordless.</li>
            <li> The ones I had for over a year and 1/2  that I was replacing still cut better than these.  </li>
            <li> Love the quality of Wahl.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually satisfied with their service.</li>
            <li> These work pretty good but doesn&#x27;t get as close as I would want them to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first trimmer I&#x27;ve used of any kind of professional quality, but given that quality, as well as the price, I&#x27;m comfortable saying that I purchased the best trimmer for me.</li>
            <li> Wahl makes great professional clippers and trimmers.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s blades are the most comfortable type you can use to remove hair.</li>
            <li> Works good so far but need to use it many more times to know its durability.</li>
            <li> REALLY CUTS GOOD, SO KNOW</li>
            <li> Thanks for a superior product.</li>
            <li> I really like it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, I can&#x27;t say this is the absolute best trimmer ever, only that I got lucky and made a great purchase that I think I&#x27;ll be happy with for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few years and its very precise and works awesome for beard / body</li>
            <li> Pretty good, it has a nice long cord and a good range of attachment sizes.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer blade does not seem to give the best type of sharp cut when lining around the edges of the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and easy to change heads and combs.</li>
            <li> I have interchanged the blades a couple times and it was really easy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to trim where you want and not where you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> ;  Light duty would be more accurate.  </li>
            <li> These Wahl clippers are easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> still holding strong after a year of purchase</li>
            <li> Strong motor.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer just the right size, I love that it has a cord</li>
            <li> I would not recommend to buy these if getting this to cut/shave your hair, but as a beard trimmer they are fine.</li>
            <li> The unit is light and relatively easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> All of the attachment s fit perfectly and the little bag that comes with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used cheap, battery-powered trimmers before, I decided to step up to the corded design, and man am I happy.</li>
            <li> Solid product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several months now without any issue, a great buy</li>
            <li> I got it for beard trimming so its not a deal breaker, but its a shame I also need to have a more powerful Wahl hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> Instead of providing the buyer with superfluous, cheap accessories, the company should have focused  on maintaining the quality of there product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for the price.  </li>
            <li> Affordable and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Wahl clipper/trimmer that seem more powerful that this.  </li>
            <li> All the blades, shavers, a combs fit.  </li>
            <li> The Clipper are made well and have great options like different blades.</li>
            <li> Comfortable in the hand, light weight, attachments are plentiful</li>
            <li> so far everything&#x27;s good...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it would be good for a professional barber</li>
            <li> Maybe good for young children.</li>
            <li> Not as good as an old set of cheap Wahl clippers(the gold ones)</li>
            <li> must say this trimmer is very powerful.</li>
            <li> Very powerful.</li>
            <li> Does a great job trimming your beard to a clean low level.</li>
            <li> I replaced a cheap battery-powered trimmer with it, and it is a significant improvement (not like</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with the clippers and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i needed something to trim my mustache a little more precise than i can with a sissors, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I bought the cordless originally for my beard but have since gone to using this.</li>
            <li> AND SO FAR, I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED...</li>
            <li> I had wanted some new clippers that could cut close and give me a nice bald look.</li>
            <li> The cord is very long, I want to say like 8ft, so I can plug it in and stand in the shower to trim my beard to keep my wife happy and not get trimmings all over the sink area.</li>
            <li> so i can shave my neck clean.</li>
            <li> I use this to clean up my sideburns and around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> only knock off a star because it has snagged on my hair which isn&#x27;t pleasant...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong and powerful.</li>
            <li> All was as expected and the product is great.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> and it left lines all over and didn&#x27;t cut that good at all.</li>
            <li> After experiencing the incredible efficiency of this razor, I doubt I will ever be able to go back to shaving with only a manual razor, and I doubt you will, either.</li>
            <li> is true.</li>
            <li> Attachments work good and it is quiet.  </li>
            <li> The 9307 model has a huge stock at WalMart right now this 2013 summer.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how much I didn&#x27;t like this thing, considering the good reviews it had.</li>
            <li> I have had multiple Wahl recharge units, and it is nice as those adapters fit this one</li>
            <li> Way more attachments than are useful really.</li>
            <li> Even the ones that are rechargeable quickly lose their ability to charge.</li>
            <li> The cord was a risk, but I got lucky with this one.  </li>
            <li> And was delivered to quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will last a few years, but I&#x27;m not overly impressed.  </li>
            <li> I just opened the box and finished using this product for the very first time.</li>
            <li> That wasn&#x27;t clear from any descriptions, and other products seemed to have a bulky adapter for a plug, so I was unsure, and then very happy with this result.</li>
            <li> The very first time I used them, they literally blew up in my hand.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair pretty precise.</li>
            <li> Clippers were easy to hold on to as well, which I appreciated.</li>
            <li> but this time i choose one with a cord,so differant way more power after the first time i knew i would&#x27;nt need to try any other kind.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li> My complaints would be that, although it&#x27;s quite powerful, it seems to pull hair a lot.  </li>
            <li> which was exciting.</li>
            <li> 3 Fixed blades that pull more than trim.  </li>
            <li> , this is powerful and versatile -</li>
            <li> Loud but way more reliable and powerful than the battery ones.</li>
            <li> Once I got it in the mail I tested it out with the pre-attached wide blade and was amazed at how quickly and easily I was able to shave.</li>
            <li> I intended to use that blade for my face, as it leaves just the right amount of stubble.</li>
            <li> do not cut right for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right size.</li>
            <li> and I took the thing right out of the box with</li>
            <li> If I go straight at it with these they tend to get hot and sound like they are struggling.</li>
            <li> trimmer has a nice long cord.  </li>
            <li> Nice long cord.</li>
            <li> Honestly, how long does it take you to trim?</li>
            <li> Although this razor will give you a very quick and nearly painless shave (you may experience the occasional hair snag), it is important to note that neither of the two full-sized blades will give you a completely close shave and will instead give you more of a five o&#x27;clock shadow sort of look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These made him was to use the new toy and since Christmas he has been cleanly trimmed because he enjoys using them.</li>
            <li> Tried these clippers for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> So much better than any battery operated set of clippers I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;ve had several.</li>
            <li> The rest of the attachments, stainless steel blades, as a clipper/beard trimmer are worth the price.</li>
            <li> This trimmer was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Wahl beard trimmers owning.</li>
            <li> First impressions: 1)</li>
            <li> nice long cord thanks james</li>
            <li> my actual rating is more like a 4.5</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the top portion sometimes pops off inadvertently</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Included is the ever more necessary nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Other popular models seemed to boast of smallness or compactness.</li>
            <li> nice powerful little clipper.</li>
            <li> I got tired of disposing of otherwise perfectly good trimmers just because they wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more and couldn&#x27;t accept new batteries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a month of use trimming my beard, I am quite pleased with this purchase and suspect it will long outlast anything powered by batteries.  </li>
            <li> Good trimmer, small, portable, gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> If you are in the market for the personal trimmer a AA battery trimmer will do the job better than this particular Wahl.</li>
            <li> Luckily I dropped it quick enough before getting hurt or hurting my boyfriends</li>
            <li> Snaps out and the other in very easily.</li>
            <li> Simple and strong.  </li>
            <li> bottom line is that these are inexpensive, good quality beard clippers that (hopefully) will last a long time.</li>
            <li> happy with the amount of time it took to trim my beard and after back and forth up and down</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> And who really needs to do any hair trimming away from electrical outlets</li>
            <li> The motor is noisy, the casing shakes, and the materials feel cheap (especially the cord).  </li>
            <li> The touch up blade does not cut very close to the skin either.</li>
            <li> The real deal.</li>
            <li> and it can get very close to my nose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product and ready to go at any time.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I expected more, for it works</li>
            <li> The Power Pro Corded Hair Clipper, Trimmer and Detailer doesn&#x27;t really trim the beard that well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and reliable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tired of devoting so much time to trimming my hair, I started searching for an electric razor and decided to buy this one since it was moderately-priced</li>
            <li> never have to buy another trimmer again thanks to this thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real step up from my battery op norelco and it was cheaper.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s really picky</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son who absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> and I was ready.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what i need to trim the boys&#x27; hair between barber visits but its also exactly what i need to keep my goatee trimmed and professional looking.</li>
            <li> I went thru it like butter, and in just a few minutes I had a nice even trim with no noticable tugging.</li>
            <li> It appears at first glance to be adequate EXCEPT the &amp;#34;6-position trimming guide&amp;#34; appears flimsy, especially the mechanism for latching into one of the six positions.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said it does most things advertised well.</li>
            <li> They are a decent replacement to the wahl chippers I had before these.</li>
            <li> Way better than the older cordless one that will only last two maybe three years !</li>
            <li> Few snags on the beard, but overall good.</li>
            <li> WOW!!  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d love it if it was a little quieter).</li>
            <li> And the best part is the batteries will never go bad</li>
            <li> the freedom to choose amongst 1000 crappy options -- just bought the NORELCO MULTI GROOM PLUS, which has not quite as much power, is not as precise, but seems slightly more reliable and expensive</li>
            <li> Runs cool, fits contours well, long reach power cord.</li>
            <li> Plenty powerful enough.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used it for basic trimming of my goatee, but it has so many attachments I can do whatever with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have big hands, and the size and weight feel right.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of talking to Amazon right now about getting my money back.</li>
            <li> The cord is super long and this helps when in use.</li>
            <li> Also, the adjustable trimmer head (the only one long enough to trim more to lengths longer than a 1/2&amp;#34;) does not stay locked at the desired length.  </li>
            <li> They are good for those people who have sensitive skin, because they are not as sharp as some other detailer/trimmers.</li>
            <li> Cuts well , but make lot of noise for a new stuff.</li>
            <li> All new shiny, and new smelly...</li>
            <li> A man just knows when it&#x27;s time for some new trimming gear</li>
            <li> I is wise to use two mirrors ( one in front of you and one behind you) so that you can see what you are doing as you cut your hair but that would be true for any other unit.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The seem to have a powerful motor, and they are not very loud.  </li>
            <li> where it&#x27;s much easier to clean the resulting mess than over the sink.  </li>
            <li> The cord is extra long, which makes shaving over the tub easy.  </li>
            <li> This was one of my husband&#x27;s Christmas presents and, so far, he has not complained.  </li>
            <li> Does the job of trimming hair, and seems to work better than the battery operated ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Its nice to look like i just left the barber and spent big money every day.</li>
            <li> I have always owned battery/cordless clippers and it took my old one dying to get me to shop for a new one.  </li>
            <li> so the corded function made this the perfect trimmer, EXCEPT it broke (just stopped running completely) after 4 months, leaving me stranded in the middle of vacation looking kind of rough -- It&#x27;s a shame that this product doesn&#x27;t exist at a slightly higher price point with better build quality -- there are 600+ expensive and inexpensive pieces of crap shavers out there, but I just want one that works without a battery--</li>
            <li> The naked trimmer also seems to cut pretty long, other trimmers I&#x27;ve had seem to do a better job.  </li>
            <li> The clipper blades are super sharp, so I don&#x27;t have any hair pulling.  </li>
            <li> so far</li>
            <li> Bought it for my bf after his old one bit the dust.  </li>
            <li> The beard trimmer and mini clippers seem to be the things it does well, the personal trimmer not so much.</li>
            <li> Trimming the hairline on my neck before the battery died on my old trimmer was quite a challenge.</li>
            <li> read reviews that said this was loud.  </li>
            <li> Replaced my old Wahl trimmer with this newer model.</li>
            <li> Had the old one for 15 years.</li>
            <li> So far, it has been just what he needed for trimming up his beard.</li>
            <li> thing is so loud, my ears ring for a minute after use.</li>
            <li> he loves it so far</li>
            <li> Actually, I am surprised that the clipper has worked well and reliably for quite a while now.</li>
            <li> After looking at many corded options I decided on the Wahl 9686 for a few reasons, namely the reviews of it &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34; solid and &amp;#34;man sized&amp;#34; and being in my budget.  </li>
            <li> He has killed a couple of those battery operated trimmers and pretty much gave up on trimming at all.</li>
            <li> This was my husband&#x27;s favorite Christmas present this past year.</li>
            <li> Super weak, not good for a professional, maybe good for home use</li>
            <li> Accurate product description and love the versatility of swapping the different heads for cutting and trimming.</li>
            <li> so rarely it&#x27;s almost not worth taking a star off...</li>
            <li> this one is so powerful and it hasn&#x27;t shown any sign of slowing down.</li>
            <li> Sure, there are lots of fancy pieces with it, but for pure beard trimming, it fails.  </li>
            <li> While these do give you a really close shave, after letting my beard grow out for a couple of weeks it would take me literally 30 minutes to remove all my facial hair, so I dreaded my inevitable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> addition to being fast, this razor comes with more attachments than you will likely know what to do with, three different blades, a very long cord, a compact but functional carrying case, and a small bottle of oil for maintaining the blades.</li>
            <li> Cut through my hair quickly and without the tug and pull of my previous set that left my scalp with a burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> Having had the Whal Lion cordless trimmer and liked it (it got stolen sadly)</li>
            <li> The guards and other accessories are a little on the flimsy side, but work fine.</li>
            <li> not sharp enough for professionals use</li>
            <li> It does work very well but does have a habit of sometimes getting &amp;#34;bogged&amp;#34; down with hair.  </li>
            <li> Good trimmer, decent power, had to send away for a separate nose attachment, which should just be included -- I hate the unreliability of batteries</li>
            <li> The array of cutting heads and combs mean I will be able to use this for more than simply trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> My main reason for buying this was for the 1&amp;#34; long combs for trimming my long beard (I haven&#x27;t found another beard trimmer with combs that big!).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but pulls your hair very cheap and very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Electric shavers simply don&#x27;t shave as close as manual razors, but if you do want a really close shave, you can trim your hair with this then trim the remaining hair with a manual razor with a lot less effort than would be required without using this first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The main purpose of me buying these is to keep my beard trimmed down to a number 2.</li>
            <li> it is corded so it maintains the power and does no slow down like the battery powered ones.</li>
            <li> small and probably not fit for shearing sheep or carving thick long hair off of your head in one swipe but for me it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li> Other trimmers that I&#x27;ve tried in the past actually wouldn&#x27;t get that close to my nose unless I took off the guard but with these Wahl clippers, it doesn&#x27;t matter which guard that I use as I am always able to reach that tight spot at my nose.</li>
            <li> the item i was waiting for so long the moment i plug in short my power off and smoke it up so never been even test to say if it good or bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s short enough to be considered stubble, yet long enough to show a defined beard (rather than looking like</li>
            <li> only thing I like is the long cord.</li>
            <li> I hope it will last a long time...</li>
            <li> The cord is quite long but the inexpensive case is designed well enough to hold it all together out of sight.  </li>
            <li> I just hope it last long not like the Wahl 9307-1101 Hair Trimmer &lt;&lt;</li>
            <li> Mine is pretty thick.</li>
            <li> Good by to useless dead batteries forever!!  </li>
            <li> The T blade seems very dull on mine, right out of the box.</li>
            <li> long.</li>
            <li> It is not nearly up to the quality of the made in USA Wahl products.  </li>
            <li> Especially as the clippers and battery aged.</li>
            <li> Not a professional cutter , but running well.</li>
            <li> I like the wide blade for hair lining &amp; the regular blade for mustache &amp; beard trimming.</li>
            <li> It can reach a long distance over to our shower so that I can trim over the bathtub (no water, of course!)</li>
            <li> It also has a very long cord.</li>
            <li> Use it primarily for cutting facial hair and trimming up my hair in between hair cuts.</li>
            <li> The larger cutting blade works well for light trim work around the ears.</li>
            <li> not worth returning it back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that these would be substantial enough to do my entire head, but who knows...</li>
            <li> so be careful</li>
            <li> It comes with a wide blade--I guess what they call the &amp;#34;t-blade&amp;#34;--attached.</li>
            <li> not very sharp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But i just got this and have only used for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I hope it last for along time work with it everyday</li>
            <li> but mine was a bit wet at the time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Getting the various cutting heads in and out of the main body is tricky and if not done correctly can damage them or the unit.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that it is a short learning curve to master the use of this appliance.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I did was to change the beard blade to the smaller version for ear and nose hair cutting.</li>
            <li> Pretty poor blades...wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money....</li>
            <li> And when new and fully charged I still found the power weak.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I wasted my time with cordless trimmers for so long.</li>
            <li> However, the detachable blades are very difficult to get on, the clips inside them are plastic, and the plastic covers for the blades are cheap.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve stayed sharp and haven&#x27;t burnt out yet after 4 months of weekly hair cuts.</li>
            <li> head the other day</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure why Wahl left them out.  </li>
            <li> have sharp lines at my sideburns and my goatee is outlined nicer than ever.  </li>
            <li> Both of my other Wahl clippers have these covers and I paid less for those clippers than I did for this unit.  </li>
            <li> I recently tried to trim my hair with it and it did not want to cut through my thick hair.</li>
            <li> The mechanics of the devices never caused me any problems, as i take good care of my things, but the power was just awful.  </li>
            <li> If you have tons of thick hair like I do, think about getting a bigger thing.</li>
            <li> So this review has nothing to do with Amazon directly, but then again it does because they sold them to me.&lt;br /&gt;These trimmers/clippers are poorly designed</li>
            <li> It has plenty of guts to power through my beard without even slowing down.</li>
            <li> This works extremely well!</li>
            <li> About half the size of a hair clipper</li>
            <li> Slightly underpowered but they do the job.</li>
            <li> I was tired of dealing with a cordless that didn&#x27;t have much charge or seemed a bit too slow.</li>
            <li> And I might add its about 15 dollars cheaper buying it online than at your local beauty store those guys are putting a serious markup on this product.</li>
            <li> This powers thru (so you don&#x27;t have to go extra slow) and trims very tight.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE BIT,</li>
            <li> A little lound but still gets the job done...</li>
            <li> It is a little bit noisy</li>
            <li> The attachments are a little flimsy, but they do their job.</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;ll have two sets.&lt;br /&gt;The comment about it having a little bit of vibration when in use compared to a battery operated unit</li>
            <li> A little buzzy</li>
            <li> It pulled a little</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT worth my money!</li>
            <li> Despite oiling and cleaning it repeatedly, this trimmer grabbed and pulled hairs constantly unless you went very slowly.  </li>
            <li> I find it it difficult to align and seat the hair and trimmer blades; it takes me several tries, Removing a comb almost always pulls the blade off.</li>
            <li> but I really have no need for them; I just use the cutting head that came with it.</li>
            <li> It feels and look heavy duty.</li>
            <li> They work well for a few months, and then dramatically lose power and/or battery life.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 110 volt AC motor compared to a battery that will die in a few years.  </li>
            <li> I have a little trouble seating the heads sometimes, had the small one pop off into my nose once</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other trimmers that did not require slow use.  </li>
            <li> thing is far too small to use as a hair cutting tool; moreover, I do not think that I would switch the head to the hair cutting blade because not only would it be too small for clippers, but a PHILIP SCREW DRIVER is needed to swap them around; I will therefore just keep my other clipper set and just use this one for lining.</li>
            <li> The carry bag that came with the unit is too small for the unit, the cord and all the attachments...  </li>
            <li> But no more batteries to buy.</li>
            <li> After using 3 or 4 cordless rechargeable trimmers in the past 10 years, I decided to return to a wired model.</li>
            <li> I like the small detailer.  </li>
            <li> I got a rotary shaver as a gift a couple years back that I do not use since it pulls on your hair so since I started shaving, I used either a disposable razor or one of the expensive replaceable blade ones.</li>
            <li> I shaved my face, stomach, chest, and upper arms in only a couple of minutes, something that would have taken me a miserable hour to do with a traditional razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so loud, I may need to start wearing hearing protection while cutting my sideburns.</li>
            <li> This comes with a small bag to hold the trimmer and all the attachments.</li>
            <li> The blades are dull, which of course causes the trimmers to pull your hair out of your face.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too late.</li>
            <li> I am a balding guy with thin hair and this so called heavy duty hair trimmer could not do</li>
            <li> You will need to be slow and patient with this one.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an ordinary two-prong plug!</li>
            <li> I got sick and tired of anemic battery powered beard trimmers that would die half way through a trim and finally decided to go electric.  </li>
            <li> there is a narrow head for getting into the tight places, and wider heads for cutting longer places.</li>
            <li> Too weak and takes forever to cut hair.  </li>
            <li> Weak motor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s tough to find beard trimmers that aren&#x27;t cordless.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews and tired of battery beard trimmers I bought this model.</li>
            <li> Trims behind ears for all hair types easiest of all trimmers in market.</li>
            <li> it was corded was tired of battery powered products that die and eventually batteries</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> When I accidentally plugged it in on a trip to Denmark, it fried, and I was moderately sad.  </li>
            <li> Like 3 stars sad.</li>
            <li> I feel sorry for the people buying it.</li>
            <li> The cutting edge is just 1.5 inches.&lt;br /&gt;The case is very small , of bad quality and arrived already torn.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I got sick &amp; tired of my cheapo battery operated ones crapping out on me.</li>
            <li> Its seem to struggle with cutting hair or trimming hair...</li>
            <li> Note that the 2 included cutting blades do not come with protective covers for storage.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Can not go wrong with Wahl!</li>
            <li> attachments are flimsy but very difficult to replace.  </li>
            <li> /O switch went bad.</li>
            <li> I, personally, am sick of cordless ones.  </li>
            <li> go to crap.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Solid product at a great price.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews and tired of battery beard trimmers I bought this model. I was&lt;br /&gt;not happy with the amount of time it took to trim my beard and after back and forth up and down&lt;br /&gt;side to side still didn&#x27;t cut all the hairs. I keep my beard trimmed to about 1/4&amp;#34; to 1/2&amp;#34; long. It didn&#x27;t do well for me.&lt;br /&gt;After about 5 trim attempts I threw it in the case and in the junk drawer it went.</li>
            <li> I had wanted some new clippers that could cut close and give me a nice bald look. These clippers work great for that and I also use them to fade my son&#x27;s hair and give him nice edges and designs in his hair. Definitely worth the money I paid. Only con is that the blade attachments are kinda flimsy plastic</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how much I didn&#x27;t like this thing, considering the good reviews it had. The T blade seems very dull on mine, right out of the box. I intended to use that blade for my face, as it leaves just the right amount of stubble. It seems to skip and pull hair on my face a lot, which is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had one of these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004PXIR1W Conair GMT900 iStubble Facial Trimmer]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for about 2 years before the battery finally gave out. I really liked it better. Never skipped or pulled hairs, even after two years of almost daily use.</li>
            <li> Tried these clippers for the first time today.  Cut through my hair quickly and without the tug and pull of my previous set that left my scalp with a burning sensation.  Comes with lots of attachments if you need them.  Clippers were easy to hold on to as well, which I appreciated.</li>
            <li> still holding strong after a year of purchase</li>
            <li> do not cut right for me</li>
            <li> This was one of my husband&#x27;s Christmas presents and, so far, he has not complained.  One can assume it works great!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my beard lenght</li>
            <li> I really love this clipper/trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy&lt;br /&gt;Powerful&lt;br /&gt;Lots of different tips&lt;br /&gt;Affordable&lt;br /&gt;Corded&lt;br /&gt;Easy to change the tips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None so far</li>
            <li> I find it it difficult to align and seat the hair and trimmer blades; it takes me several tries, Removing a comb almost always pulls the blade off. Compare this to an Oster, which has a much better design. . The six-position guide comb continually slipped, and I discarded it. Trimming is okay, although the hair &amp; trimmer blades  occasionaly pull. The motor is strong, and the detailer is good.</li>
            <li> Great product absolutely love</li>
            <li> Bought it for my bf after his old one bit the dust.  He was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Perfect, no complaints</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted in a corded trimmer.</li>
            <li> not sharp enough for professionals use</li>
            <li> I replaced my clippers and trimmer at work, I made a very good choice, would highly recommend this trimmer.  Wahl makes great professional clippers and trimmers.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased as a recommendation for my daughter who was pursuing a degree in horse management.  It does work very well but does have a habit of sometimes getting &amp;#34;bogged&amp;#34; down with hair.  Overall, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Never going coordless again!</li>
            <li> I love it. It feels and look heavy duty. It&#x27;s going to save me a lot of money in razor blades.</li>
            <li> Works great, love that it plugs in, powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My heads did rust after about 3 uses and storage so be careful</li>
            <li> Does the job of trimming hair, and seems to work better than the battery operated ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Lots of attachments, but I really have no need for them; I just use the cutting head that came with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several months now without any issue, a great buy whether your shaving your head or face</li>
            <li> Trims behind ears for all hair types easiest of all trimmers in market.</li>
            <li> This trims fantastically - I bought the cordless originally for my beard but have since gone to using this. My wife also uses this to do haircuts in the home.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but pulls your hair very cheap and very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Too weak and takes forever to cut hair.  I bought it as a gift for my son and after 2 months he tells me this.  I&#x27;d send it back but it&#x27;s too late.</li>
            <li> Works good so far but need to use it many more times to know its durability.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Wanted a plug in model.  Has all the attachments I want except nose hair trimmer.  Can order that attachment from Wahl from the paper that comes with the unit. The carry bag that came with the unit is too small for the unit, the cord and all the attachments...  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer, small, portable, gets the job done.  Comes with a bunch of guides and beard trimmer guides.  doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars because occassionaly it pulls at my hairs.</li>
            <li> So much better than any battery operated set of clippers I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;ve had several.</li>
            <li> I NEEDED TO BUY ONE OF THESE, AND I TRUST THE WAHL NAME...SO DECISION MADE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;VE WORKED WITH IT A LITTLE BIT, AND SO FAR, I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED...REALLY CUTS GOOD, SO KNOW WHAT TYPE OF CUT YOU WANT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> it is alright but I wouldn&#x27;t use it in beauty salon</li>
            <li> Runs cool, fits contours well, long reach power cord.</li>
            <li> Works great! All of the attachment s fit perfectly and the little bag that comes with it is very handy.</li>
            <li> Always the one to buy when buying trimmers, for me.  Have lost count on how many I have owned.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this trimmer.........it doesn&#x27;t cut close enough. If u like a two day five o&#x27;clock shadow move on to something else...obviously the same story with a one day. used it twice and dropped it in a draw....</li>
            <li> Great for trimming your beard and mustache</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said it does most things advertised well. The beard trimmer and mini clippers seem to be the things it does well, the personal trimmer not so much. If you are in the market for the personal trimmer a AA battery trimmer will do the job better than this particular Wahl. The rest of the attachments, stainless steel blades, as a clipper/beard trimmer are worth the price.</li>
            <li> After going though a lithium ion unit once every couple of years, I ditched the recharge units and wanted a plug in one. I have had multiple Wahl recharge units, and it is nice as those adapters fit this one, the only difference is this one is plug in. The cord is very long, I want to say like 8ft, so I can plug it in and stand in the shower to trim my beard to keep my wife happy and not get trimmings all over the sink area. The plug in isn&#x27;t all that more bulky, and no matter where I would take this I would always have an outlet to use so I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> guide heads could be better</li>
            <li> Good size. Solid construction. Way more attachments than are useful really. But no more batteries to buy. Even the ones that are rechargeable quickly lose their ability to charge. And who really needs to do any hair trimming away from electrical outlets anyway?This does a great job on beard and mustache for me.</li>
            <li> The amount of options you get with this trimmer is amazing. Its perfect for beards. I recently tried to trim my hair with it and it did not want to cut through my thick hair. It would pull and not cut through it. I got it for beard trimming so its not a deal breaker, but its a shame I also need to have a more powerful Wahl hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great product delivered quickly. Wahl makes really good products and I got sick &amp; tired of my cheapo battery operated ones crapping out on me. I&#x27;ve been using this one for a while now and I&#x27;m very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> This item is multifunctional. Its exactly what i need to trim the boys&#x27; hair between barber visits but its also exactly what i need to keep my goatee trimmed and professional looking. Its nice to look like i just left the barber and spent big money every day. I figure it will pay for itself in a matter of weeks. It feels sturdy and well crafted in my hand and i couldn&#x27;t be happier about my purchase.</li>
            <li> Having had the Whal Lion cordless trimmer and liked it (it got stolen sadly), I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  It is not nearly up to the quality of the made in USA Wahl products.  The motor is noisy, the casing shakes, and the materials feel cheap (especially the cord).  I&#x27;m sure it will last a few years, but I&#x27;m not overly impressed.  My main reason for buying this was for the 1&amp;#34; long combs for trimming my long beard (I haven&#x27;t found another beard trimmer with combs that big!).  The touch up blade does not cut very close to the skin either.</li>
            <li> It was a good buy, good investment, they are getting the job done... A little lound but still gets the job done...</li>
            <li> I got sick and tired of anemic battery powered beard trimmers that would die half way through a trim and finally decided to go electric.  This trimmer was exactly what I wanted.  Simple and strong.  I got tired of disposing of otherwise perfectly good trimmers just because they wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more and couldn&#x27;t accept new batteries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer has a nice long cord.  It can reach a long distance over to our shower so that I can trim over the bathtub (no water, of course!) where it&#x27;s much easier to clean the resulting mess than over the sink.  It has plenty of guts to power through my beard without even slowing down.</li>
            <li> The real deal. Nice long cord. Out performs the crappy battery trimmer I used to use. In fact, that thing was garbage. Plenty powerful enough. No complaints. I do with it came with a standard shaving head so i can shave my neck clean. I think it&#x27;s availalable, just didn&#x27;t come with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I no longer have to charge a beard/neck trimmer. Trimming the hairline on my neck before the battery died on my old trimmer was quite a challenge. Especially as the clippers and battery aged. I never have to worry about that with this electric trimmer.</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer...love it</li>
            <li> These so called pro clippers did not cut my hair with or without the combs. I tried adjusting them and still nothing.</li>
            <li> The main purpose of me buying these is to keep my beard trimmed down to a number 2. It does a great job trimming my beard but once in awhile it will snag my hair. I like how it trims my mustache and it can get very close to my nose. Other trimmers that I&#x27;ve tried in the past actually wouldn&#x27;t get that close to my nose unless I took off the guard but with these Wahl clippers, it doesn&#x27;t matter which guard that I use as I am always able to reach that tight spot at my nose. This is my first Wahl beard trimmers owning.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, it has a nice long cord and a good range of attachment sizes.  My complaints would be that, although it&#x27;s quite powerful, it seems to pull hair a lot.  The naked trimmer also seems to cut pretty long, other trimmers I&#x27;ve had seem to do a better job.  When I accidentally plugged it in on a trip to Denmark, it fried, and I was moderately sad.  Like 3 stars sad.</li>
            <li> WOW!!  I was really impressed!!!  More attachments than you could ever use or need.  Cut my hair flawlessly with no hang ups, pulls, or jams!!  This Hair Clipper has already paid for itself!!  Don&#x27;t wait!!  Buy yours today!!  You will not regret it!!  HAPPY JACK</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wrestling with rechargeable battery operated trimmers for years.  And the truth is those models just didn&#x27;t hold up.  The mechanics of the devices never caused me any problems, as i take good care of my things, but the power was just awful.  THe batteries life is a joke on all models I tried.  They die after a year. And when new and fully charged I still found the power weak.  Not here.  This guy has some juice.  The mobility issue with having a corded device is washed away with a cord that has ample length.  And all the attachments make it great for head, face, neck and body needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no nose trimmer for this device.  I only bring it up because some similar models have that option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and ready to go at any time.</li>
            <li> After using 3 or 4 cordless rechargeable trimmers in the past 10 years, I decided to return to a wired model. This trimmer is great. It is a little bit noisy but I trim my beard faster.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and product</li>
            <li> These work pretty good but doesn&#x27;t get as close as I would want them to. They do come with plenty of attachments to cut hair with but I believe they would probably benefit people with thinner hair than mine. Mine is pretty thick. They are a decent replacement to the wahl chippers I had before these.</li>
            <li> I am a balding guy with thin hair and this so called heavy duty hair trimmer could not do it.&lt;br /&gt;The clipper died within 5 min of use and even before that it was more pulling than cutting.&lt;br /&gt;The motor is weak.&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are flimsy but very difficult to replace.  The cutting edge is just 1.5 inches.&lt;br /&gt;The case is very small , of bad quality and arrived already torn.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I like is the long cord. I am sending it back.</li>
            <li> Works great. Strong motor. Nice to have the three clipper sizes.  I use it on my beard because I like the sandy look and the next day it looks sandy also, and I do not shave every day.  This is perfect because it is almost as close as a shaver.</li>
            <li> I have a little trouble seating the heads sometimes, had the small one pop off into my nose once which was exciting. Works great though.</li>
            <li> I just opened the box and finished using this product for the very first time. Moments ago. I&#x27;m not even kidding. I&#x27;ve only ever used cheap, battery-powered trimmers before, I decided to step up to the corded design, and man am I happy. I tried to do my homework when purchasing, but in the end it was still a bit of a guess. I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect. First impressions: 1) it&#x27;s an ordinary two-prong plug! That wasn&#x27;t clear from any descriptions, and other products seemed to have a bulky adapter for a plug, so I was unsure, and then very happy with this result. 2) I like the heft of it. It&#x27;s the right size. Other popular models seemed to boast of smallness or compactness. I have big hands, and the size and weight feel right. It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. 3) It&#x27;s louder than hell. It just is. That power comes with a price, but frankly I don&#x27;t give a damn. Honestly, how long does it take you to trim? Deal with it! It just doesn&#x27;t bother me. 4) The results? It comes with a wide blade--I guess what they call the &amp;#34;t-blade&amp;#34;--attached. The attachments are a little flimsy, but they do their job. I snapped on a guide, and this trimmer made short work of my bushy beard. I&#x27;d been waiting to trim until I received it. I went thru it like butter, and in just a few minutes I had a nice even trim with no noticable tugging. The power feels substantial. I don&#x27;t know why I wasted my time with cordless trimmers for so long. In conclusion, I can&#x27;t say this is the absolute best trimmer ever, only that I got lucky and made a great purchase that I think I&#x27;ll be happy with for a long time. It&#x27;s the first trimmer I&#x27;ve used of any kind of professional quality, but given that quality, as well as the price, I&#x27;m comfortable saying that I purchased the best trimmer for me.</li>
            <li> I expected more, for it works</li>
            <li> The Power Pro Corded Hair Clipper, Trimmer and Detailer doesn&#x27;t really trim the beard that well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> 3 Fixed blades that pull more than trim.  Does not provide the closeness needed for nice trimmed beard. I would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Cuts well , but make lot of noise for a new stuff. Better for self-use. Not a professional cutter , but running well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to begin by saying I only use this as a beard trimmer.  I have bigger clippers for my hair.  I&#x27;m not sure that these would be substantial enough to do my entire head, but who knows...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s tough to find beard trimmers that aren&#x27;t cordless.  I, personally, am sick of cordless ones.  They work well for a few months, and then dramatically lose power and/or battery life.  That is part of the reason I was drawn to these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews that said this was loud.  I have not had that issue.  I do use the blade oil before each use.  Perhaps that helps.  I like the small detailer.  It even works for the nose hair, which is nice.  For my beard, I use the II stubble guard.  I think it&#x27;s the perfect length.  It&#x27;s short enough to be considered stubble, yet long enough to show a defined beard (rather than looking like I just need a shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that these are inexpensive, good quality beard clippers that (hopefully) will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Its seem to struggle with cutting hair or trimming hair... maybe its just mine idk. not worth returning it back.</li>
            <li> As advertised!  Great Beard trimmer!</li>
            <li> About half the size of a hair clipper, this is powerful and versatile - I replaced a cheap battery-powered trimmer with it, and it is a significant improvement (not like I ever bothered to take the battery clipper with me when traveling anyhow). The guards and other accessories are a little on the flimsy side, but work fine. It does make a fair amount of noise in use, though oiling helps (and should keep it clipping happily).</li>
            <li> Works great.  Use it primarily for cutting facial hair and trimming up my hair in between hair cuts.</li>
            <li> great price right size for travel</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and easy to change heads and combs. I like it a lot. (I&#x27;d love it if it was a little quieter).</li>
            <li> Had it for years. Figured Id might s well finally review it. Loud but way more reliable and powerful than the battery ones.</li>
            <li> Replaced my old Wahl trimmer with this newer model. Had the old one for 15 years. I do not think all the plastic pieces it comes with are necessary. The first thing I did was to change the beard blade to the smaller version for ear and nose hair cutting. Snaps out and the other in very easily. Great product for not a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Does a great job trimming your beard to a clean low level.</li>
            <li> This is not a product I would recommend to many people. The issue here, is the motor seems lethargic at best and the blades themselves and not very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;Long plug connector&lt;br /&gt;interchangeable tips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;Motor&lt;br /&gt;Build quality&lt;br /&gt;Sharpness&lt;br /&gt;Strength of tip retainer</li>
            <li> Way better than the older cordless one that will only last two maybe three years ! But i just got this and have only used for a few weeks so far everything&#x27;s good... I hope it will last a long time...</li>
            <li> Great Trimmer Great Price</li>
            <li> I have always owned battery/cordless clippers and it took my old one dying to get me to shop for a new one.  The cord was a risk, but I got lucky with this one.  The cord is extra long, which makes shaving over the tub easy.  The clipper blades are super sharp, so I don&#x27;t have any hair pulling.  I have interchanged the blades a couple times and it was really easy.  Overall, I am very happy with the clippers and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> fair price and a good product I hope it last for along time work with it everyday nice long cord thanks james</li>
            <li> This works extremely well! So far I&#x27;ve only used it for basic trimming of my goatee, but it has so many attachments I can do whatever with it.&lt;br /&gt;I only knock off a star because it has snagged on my hair which isn&#x27;t pleasant...but it happens so rarely it&#x27;s almost not worth taking a star off...my actual rating is more like a 4.5</li>
            <li> The trimmers were a great addition to my honey&#x27;s grooming kit.  Not too big and it came with its own case.  He was very happy with the product and the price.  The shipping was fast and reliable.</li>
            <li> All was as expected and the product is great.</li>
            <li> They seems to last and last but pull on hair.</li>
            <li> the item i was waiting for so long the moment i plug in short my power off and smoke it up so never been even test to say if it good or bad</li>
            <li> This trimmer works to trim my beard, so it serves it&#x27;s purpose. However, the detachable blades are very difficult to get on, the clips inside them are plastic, and the plastic covers for the blades are cheap. And most of the attachments are superfluous. Overall, I am very disappointed in this product. Instead of providing the buyer with superfluous, cheap accessories, the company should have focused  on maintaining the quality of there product. If this trimmer is indicative of the quality of the products currently produced by this company, next time I will look for something else.</li>
            <li> Slightly underpowered but they do the job. I need to use my larger clippers prior before using these for a closer cut on my head (I am bald) If I go straight at it with these they tend to get hot and sound like they are struggling. They&#x27;ve stayed sharp and haven&#x27;t burnt out yet after 4 months of weekly hair cuts.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for the price.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the top portion sometimes pops off inadvertently and it&#x27;s a pain to pop back on.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic!!!!  Does everything you want it to do. You can make your own decision which blade is best for you for trimming. I like the wide blade for hair lining &amp; the regular blade for mustache &amp; beard trimming.</li>
            <li> Perfect for detailing your hair line, also can be used to trim mustache&#x27;s and beards. Can also be used to trim nose hairs. Affordable and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> After a month of use trimming my beard, I am quite pleased with this purchase and suspect it will long outlast anything powered by batteries.  The cord is quite long but the inexpensive case is designed well enough to hold it all together out of sight.  The array of cutting heads and combs mean I will be able to use this for more than simply trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> I was tired of dealing with a cordless that didn&#x27;t have much charge or seemed a bit too slow. This powers thru (so you don&#x27;t have to go extra slow) and trims very tight. Easy to trim where you want and not where you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few years and its very precise and works awesome for beard / body</li>
            <li> Lots of accessory attachments for different lengths of hair. Works good.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use the Wahl hair trimmer. We even have an extra one we groom our dogs with.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i needed something to trim my mustache a little more precise than i can with a sissors, and it works great. there is a narrow head for getting into the tight places, and wider heads for cutting longer places. it is corded so it maintains the power and does no slow down like the battery powered ones.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair clipper. The very first time I used them, they literally blew up in my hand. It shorted out and a big spark came out. Luckily I dropped it quick enough before getting hurt or hurting my boyfriends ear while attempting to cut his hair. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my husband and he has used them to trim his beard (they were fine),but I used them to shave our sons head the other day and it left lines all over and didn&#x27;t cut that good at all. I would not recommend to buy these if getting this to cut/shave your hair, but as a beard trimmer they are fine.</li>
            <li> This will cut your skin if you try to trim you beard with it. I do not recommended buying this.</li>
            <li> I really love this trimmer. It&#x27;s perfect for trimming between men&#x27;s brows.</li>
            <li> Weak motor.  I own a WalMart purchased, battery powered, Wahl clipper/trimmer that seem more powerful that this.  The description calls this a &amp;#34;Heavy duty hair clipper...&amp;#34;  Light duty would be more accurate.  Note that the 2 included cutting blades do not come with protective covers for storage.  Both of my other Wahl clippers have these covers and I paid less for those clippers than I did for this unit.  I use these covers all the time so I&#x27;m not sure why Wahl left them out.  The unit is light and relatively easy to handle.  The larger cutting blade works well for light trim work around the ears.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer just the right size, I love that it has a cord no batteries.just what I want .It trims great 5 stars thank u Amazon.</li>
            <li> Sure, there are lots of fancy pieces with it, but for pure beard trimming, it fails.  Despite oiling and cleaning it repeatedly, this trimmer grabbed and pulled hairs constantly unless you went very slowly.  I&#x27;ve had other trimmers that did not require slow use.  Also, the adjustable trimmer head (the only one long enough to trim more to lengths longer than a 1/2&amp;#34;) does not stay locked at the desired length.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Made in China and not up to the quality I have come to expect from Wahl&#x27;s USA-made products.  I returned it and got a Peanut.  Now there&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I got a rotary shaver as a gift a couple years back that I do not use since it pulls on your hair so since I started shaving, I used either a disposable razor or one of the expensive replaceable blade ones. While these do give you a really close shave, after letting my beard grow out for a couple of weeks it would take me literally 30 minutes to remove all my facial hair, so I dreaded my inevitable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tired of devoting so much time to trimming my hair, I started searching for an electric razor and decided to buy this one since it was moderately-priced (it&#x27;s not the cheapest one you can get, but it&#x27;s definitely not the most expensive, either), it&#x27;s made by a name brand, and it&#x27;s blades are the most comfortable type you can use to remove hair. Once I got it in the mail I tested it out with the pre-attached wide blade and was amazed at how quickly and easily I was able to shave. I shaved my face, stomach, chest, and upper arms in only a couple of minutes, something that would have taken me a miserable hour to do with a traditional razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to being fast, this razor comes with more attachments than you will likely know what to do with, three different blades, a very long cord, a compact but functional carrying case, and a small bottle of oil for maintaining the blades. Although this razor will give you a very quick and nearly painless shave (you may experience the occasional hair snag), it is important to note that neither of the two full-sized blades will give you a completely close shave and will instead give you more of a five o&#x27;clock shadow sort of look. Electric shavers simply don&#x27;t shave as close as manual razors, but if you do want a really close shave, you can trim your hair with this then trim the remaining hair with a manual razor with a lot less effort than would be required without using this first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend reading the instructions so that you know to store the blades with attachments on them to protect them, to oil the blades occasionally, etc. Although this isn&#x27;t exactly a manual razor replacement since it doesn&#x27;t shave skin-close, if you are like me and tend to let your hair grow out, using this will save you a ton of time, which for me makes it rather priceless. After experiencing the incredible efficiency of this razor, I doubt I will ever be able to go back to shaving with only a manual razor, and I doubt you will, either.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer, decent power, had to send away for a separate nose attachment, which should just be included -- I hate the unreliability of batteries so the corded function made this the perfect trimmer, EXCEPT it broke (just stopped running completely) after 4 months, leaving me stranded in the middle of vacation looking kind of rough -- It&#x27;s a shame that this product doesn&#x27;t exist at a slightly higher price point with better build quality -- there are 600+ expensive and inexpensive pieces of crap shavers out there, but I just want one that works without a battery-- so in the end, my lesson is, CAPITALISM &#x3D; the freedom to choose amongst 1000 crappy options -- just bought the NORELCO MULTI GROOM PLUS, which has not quite as much power, is not as precise, but seems slightly more reliable and expensive so my credit card company is really happy.</li>
            <li> Love it, so convenient love having it being corded</li>
            <li> The trimmer blade does not seem to give the best type of sharp cut when lining around the edges of the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;This thing is far too small to use as a hair cutting tool; moreover, I do not think that I would switch the head to the hair cutting blade because not only would it be too small for clippers, but a PHILIP SCREW DRIVER is needed to swap them around; I will therefore just keep my other clipper set and just use this one for lining.</li>
            <li> These Wahl clippers are easy to work with.  The seem to have a powerful motor, and they are not very loud.  They are good for those people who have sensitive skin, because they are not as sharp as some other detailer/trimmers.</li>
            <li> never have to buy another trimmer again thanks to this thing. I&#x27;ve been through so many cordless trimmers and the batteries on them always fade. this one is so powerful and it hasn&#x27;t shown any sign of slowing down. the only qualm I have is the headpieces sometimes pop off.</li>
            <li> If your looking for the perfect replacement for your Lithium Ion Wahl Trimmer, look no further.  This is a corded version of that unit. And the best part is the batteries will never go bad (it&#x27;s 110v ac). All the blades, shavers, a combs fit.  So you&#x27;ll have two sets.&lt;br /&gt;The comment about it having a little bit of vibration when in use compared to a battery operated unit is true. But that&#x27;s what you should expect.  HELLO!  It&#x27;s a 110 volt AC motor compared to a battery that will die in a few years.  It&#x27;s strong and powerful. Good by to useless dead batteries forever!!  I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a lot of beard trimmers but this one is my best one yet.  A little buzzy and I took the thing right out of the box with the big \\&quot;t-blade\\&quot; on it and went to trim a weeks stubble.  It pulled a little but then I figured out there was oil and oiled the blade and it did good on my grizzly face muff.  The smaller blade with the adjustable attachment is the balls for trimming beards.  And the detailer might be good for nose hair but mine was a bit wet at the time.&lt;br /&gt;I have sharp lines at my sideburns and my goatee is outlined nicer than ever.  And its trimmed even with no stray hairs.  It&#x27;s a real step up from my battery op norelco and it was cheaper.  Has more attachments than you&#x27;ll ever use.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small and probably not fit for shearing sheep or carving thick long hair off of your head in one swipe but for me it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li> Got it about a month ago. All new shiny, and new smelly... I&#x27;ve cut my hair and my son&#x27;s twice and it does a great job for clipping n trimming. If you have tons of thick hair like I do, think about getting a bigger thing. You will need to be slow and patient with this one. With my son, it works flawless as his hair as not thick at all and I can move it with regular speed without it getting stuck or anything.</li>
            <li> My brother loves this razor. He uses it an en Edger/Detailer for his hair and beard. Also uses it to buzz his hair. He&#x27;s really picky so I would definitely recommend this product. Don&#x27;t know if it would be good for a professional barber but it&#x27;s great for at-home use.</li>
            <li> Great ordering and receiving experience. Product met expectations.</li>
            <li> Great product, great ebay&#x27;r, no shipping problems!</li>
            <li> must say this trimmer is very powerful. One of the best on the market may be more powerful than the wahl detailer. And I might add its about 15 dollars cheaper buying it online than at your local beauty store those guys are putting a serious markup on this product.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift awesome value and purchase. The person who received it loves it. can&#x27;t beat this item. great</li>
            <li> The best for the price. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me ! Happy customer !!! :)</li>
            <li> Handy, light, plenty of attachments!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so loud, I may need to start wearing hearing protection while cutting my sideburns. Few snags on the beard, but overall good.</li>
            <li> Great clipper. Very powerful. Like it much better than the cordless.</li>
            <li> Had it about a month now. Works like a champ because of the t shape end it blends in great with a razor fade hair cut. I just hope it last long not like the Wahl 9307-1101 Hair Trimmer &lt;&lt;I don&#x27;t recommend buying this. It last for about 2 years and all of a sudden the motor just died out and it doesn&#x27;t blend well with razor fade. The 9307 model has a huge stock at WalMart right now this 2013 summer. I feel sorry for the people buying it. I hope the 9686 model doesn&#x27;t do the same. It feels great in your hands, nice and slim. It also has a very long cord. By the way, the outer part is not carbon fiber. It looks that way from the picture it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> Great clippers. Bought it bc it was corded was tired of battery powered products that die and eventually batteries go to crap. Haven&#x27;t had a problem with it. Don&#x27;t regret it at all.</li>
            <li> Pretty poor blades...wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money....lesson learned</li>
            <li> I went by the brand name when I ordered and this was a mistake.  These clippers are very light weight and do not cut well at all.  The ones I had for over a year and 1/2  that I was replacing still cut better than these.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Super weak, not good for a professional, maybe good for home use but I doubt it. Maybe good for young children.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son who absolutely loves it. He&#x27;s one of those guys who can grow a beard in days. He has killed a couple of those battery operated trimmers and pretty much gave up on trimming at all. This meant the caveman appearance which his mother wasn&#x27;t to found of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These made him was to use the new toy and since Christmas he has been cleanly trimmed because he enjoys using them.</li>
            <li> It plugs in so you don&#x27;t worry about batteries and if it charged!! The Clipper are made well and have great options like different blades. Great set of Clippers for Beard. I would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> A man just knows when it&#x27;s time for some new trimming gear and I was ready. I decided on going back to the cord because batteries suck. After looking at many corded options I decided on the Wahl 9686 for a few reasons, namely the reviews of it &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34; solid and &amp;#34;man sized&amp;#34; and being in my budget.  The cord is super long and this helps when in use. The motor hums and feels like it won&#x27;t quit for some time, good quality for sure. It came with a surprising amount of attachments for all kinds of styling that I may never use but it&#x27;s nice to know I have options.  Included is the ever more necessary nose hair trimmer.  I dropped the thing on my bathroom floor the second time I used it and for a moment I thought that was it. But it took the hit no problem! Great choice, would buy again.</li>
            <li> Not as good as an old set of cheap Wahl clippers(the gold ones) but they have some extra attachments</li>
            <li> This was my husband&#x27;s favorite Christmas present this past year. He hates cordless trimmers as they lose power a lot and pull hair. This comes with a small bag to hold the trimmer and all the attachments. So far, it has been just what he needed for trimming up his beard.</li>
            <li> Great price.  And was delivered to quickly</li>
            <li> I use this to clean up my sideburns and around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;This thing is so loud, my ears ring for a minute after use.</li>
            <li> A wonderful device. Getting the various cutting heads in and out of the main body is tricky and if not done correctly can damage them or the unit.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that it is a short learning curve to master the use of this appliance.  I is wise to use two mirrors ( one in front of you and one behind you) so that you can see what you are doing as you cut your hair but that would be true for any other unit.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Wahl is a great company! Had a cordless Wahl model and the rubber I/O switch went bad. Brought this model while the cordless model was getting repaired (5 year warranty, you don&#x27;t see that often).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This corded model is great! Comfortable in the hand, light weight, attachments are plentiful (I shave my head so need them all). Can not go wrong with Wahl!</li>
            <li> I have used a beard trimer for years,and i used a cordless but this time i choose one with a cord,so differant way more power after the first time i knew i would&#x27;nt need to try any other kind.This is by forqu a preiumn clipper.And with all the attachments it does it all.Thanks for a superior product.SLMc</li>
            <li> I really like it&#x27;s really good. Cuts hair pretty precise.</li>
            <li> Very good product and very good attention and continue to improve thanks</li>
            <li> Price good.  Works great.  Good quality.  Attachments work good and it is quiet.  Not noisy like some.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I barely open it and used it and it pull my hair a lot i wish i had my money back</li>
            <li> Excellent product and was shipped fast!!!! Accurate product description and love the versatility of swapping the different heads for cutting and trimming. Love the quality of Wahl. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a versatile razor.</li>
            <li> arrived yesterday on schedule. my husband used it last night...he loves it so far</li>
            <li> No! Definitely NOT worth my money! I just purchased this product from Amazon and I&#x27;m usually satisfied with their service. So this review has nothing to do with Amazon directly, but then again it does because they sold them to me.&lt;br /&gt;These trimmers/clippers are poorly designed and they do not cut (they yank your hair out!) holding them in your hands screams &amp;#34;Made in China!&amp;#34; As you can see from the pictures that I am going to post, the plastic on the guards are cheap and poorly designed. The blades are dull, which of course causes the trimmers to pull your hair out of your face. And this does not feel good. I am in the process of talking to Amazon right now about getting my money back.</li>
            <li> nice powerful little clipper. cuts my beard which is like wire no problem</li>
            <li> Just received the package.  It appears at first glance to be adequate EXCEPT the &amp;#34;6-position trimming guide&amp;#34; appears flimsy, especially the mechanism for latching into one of the six positions.  I suspect this may slip, if not immediately then eventually. UPDATE : It has worked well with no slips or breaks in the guide.  Actually, I am surprised that the clipper has worked well and reliably for quite a while now.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut close to the skin</li>
    </ol>
