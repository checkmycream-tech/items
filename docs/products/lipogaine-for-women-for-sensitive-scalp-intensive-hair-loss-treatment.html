    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, Lipogaine has caused my hairline to fill in considerably, so I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>Manoxidil works great if you are not allergic.</li>
            <li>The amount of irritation I experienced was greatly reduced, but not eliminated.  </li>
            <li>The product works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to have a product that doesn&#x27;t cause itching.</li>
            <li>Good luck to you if you try this.</li>
            <li>Additionally the cost if fair.</li>
            <li>It took a year or more for the sores to develop and it worked great up to that point.</li>
            <li>(All very lovely.)  </li>
            <li>This product goes on nicely and after a month , I thiiiiiink</li>
            <li>If i have better results, I will update.</li>
            <li>I will never be able to accept that I am losing my hair.</li>
            <li>I went on line and ascertained that many people thought the problem was with the propylene glycol.  </li>
            <li>(Also lovely.)  </li>
            <li>and i was satisfied with it all except for the fact it irritated my scalp</li>
            <li>my hair has never looked better and is alot thicker too  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s where I need it most.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll have better things to say in time.</li>
            <li>The whole point of growing more hair is for it to look good.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even use the dropper they supplied because I didn&#x27;t want to put that much on my head because I was afraid,and I guess I had good reason.</li>
            <li>I also confirmed it with the seller (The seller had very quick response, by the way).</li>
            <li>The product does not have any special odor.</li>
            <li>Not  a bad product, but didn&#x27;t rock my world either.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly.</li>
            <li>As time progress, I know I will be completely bald at the top (crown of my head).  </li>
            <li>this is very very greasy..</li>
            <li>know this product takes time to work, and unfortunately, I am not a patient person.</li>
            <li>I used it exactly as directed on the label</li>
            <li>if I use it more than once a day, if I get a red area I just put on hydrocortisone.</li>
            <li>I realized that her scalp itch was most likely caused by propylene glycol.</li>
            <li>It has been 4 months consistently using day and night.  </li>
            <li>However, I have not seen any difference in 6 mos, and I wish they had a sensitive skin 5% product available for men.  </li>
            <li>On the positive side I&#x27;ve had no allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>It is hard for me to have a nice clean head of hair and then ruin it and make my scalp look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in menopause and my hair was really thinning out around the hairline.</li>
            <li>I remember when I had so much hair.</li>
            <li>I do not know whether this stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>so please be patient and does work really well</li>
            <li>I was using Equate which is much cheaper, but it did cause an itch.</li>
            <li>After using this product consistently for two weeks I noticed new hair growing in the front.</li>
            <li>I can live with a little shine, I just want more hair!  </li>
            <li>I could never get it to grow back to its original length.</li>
            <li>However, when I entered menopause, I realized that permanent dye was the main thing causing me to lose hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would suggest that women who are older stop using permanent dye to color their hair and see if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li>and I became so bright red within a few minutes</li>
            <li>No negative reaction at all.  </li>
            <li>now, I have been using Lipogaine for approximately a year, with good results.</li>
            <li>I only used it sparingly for about 3 weeks and only 2 or 3 times a week,I just dabbed it on lightly with a cotton ball.</li>
            <li>had dyed my hair since I was a young woman and never had a problem with permanent dye.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t give me a reaction.</li>
            <li>She has been on this product for nearly two months now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a man, but needed the sensitive scalp formula.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness this sensitive skin formula came out.</li>
            <li>Ths sensitive skin version doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>However, as other people have mentioned, for some reason it really saturates your hair--you cannot apply it so that your hair does not look very greasy.  </li>
            <li>I suppose all these minoxidil compounds work about the same, because I suppose that the minoxidil is the active ingredient and the rest are primarily fillers.  </li>
            <li>So, after I would apply most of the Lipogaine around my hairline, I would take the last bit in the dropper and saturate the small section of my scalp with the shorter hair.</li>
            <li>In a few months, if my hair is back to normal or fuller, I will revisit this review with the richly deserved 5th star.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes.</li>
            <li>New hair growth is finer &amp; fragile.</li>
            <li>first ingredient is alcohol and it&#x27;s simply intolerably drying for scalp and hair, especially for the people experiencing hair loss and hair thinning - the target audience (!)</li>
            <li>The original LipoGaine left the roots of my hair stiff.</li>
            <li>So far the only thing I have noticed from this product is it is greasy.</li>
            <li>Apparently the product has to be used for six MONTHS before a difference will be noticed.  </li>
            <li>67 years old and female pattern baldness runs in both of my parents family&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Last time I used regular mens monoxidil on the front of my scalp it became very itchy and flakey and  resulted in losing my hair almost entirely in the front.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so short and thin in the top that I can no longer wear my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>However, the new growth has definitely made a difference, especially in the widow&#x27;s peak area.</li>

            <li> I do not use it every day, so a bottle lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> I will continue with this product and possibly alternate with Equate when finances are tight.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too bad, but this is better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a forgetful person and the twice a day routine</li>
            <li> It causes your hair to be packed down, even when it is dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There was also a small section of my hair that was shorter than the rest of my hair because I had to cut an enormous tangle from it years ago.</li>
            <li> I tried other products before and I was almost resigned to keep loosing hair.</li>
            <li> the other lipogaine didnt do that...</li>
            <li> I have to mix this with about half of the men&#x27;s 5% Lipogaine to grow hair a bit quicker.</li>
            <li> but if you use a little bit of gel you cannot notice the difference.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I&#x27;m looking forward to what my hair will look like in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few years ago I used manoxidil (a store brand and rogaine) and ended up going to the Doc.</li>
            <li> Then don&#x27;t put in that area for 1-2 days, it usually calms down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for six weeks and have not experienced any of the negative side effects that I read in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> So first, i must state that I did not have any bad reaction to this which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I was in a bad car accident several months ago and when my hair started heavily falling out I researched it and found that severe trauma can trigger your hair to go into a premature resting then shedding phase.</li>
            <li> I tried this one because something about the common formulations was making my scalp itch</li>
            <li> It makes your hair sticky, and I mean sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rogaine &amp; generics having irritating properties negative side effects.</li>
            <li> No good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to stop it because I was being forced to decide between having my hair fall out and having it look bad everyday.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will have to return this.</li>
            <li> This a dangerous product.</li>
            <li> my hair was thinning really badly put after using this stuff</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t do something bad to myself.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this stuff did to me but the sides of my head are numb!</li>
            <li> because of awful sores on my head.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.  </li>
            <li> The horrible scalp itch made her seek for alternatives.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even using it twice a day, but I can already see a difference in just a short while. I&#x27;m in menopause and my hair was really thinning out around the hairline. I remember when I had so much hair. I was born with a lot of hair. Anyhow, I&#x27;m looking forward to what my hair will look like in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now, I have been using Lipogaine for approximately a year, with good results. I do not use it every day, so a bottle lasts me a long time. If I have a long weekend where I don&#x27;t have to leave the house, I might use Lipogaine for two or three days in a row and then not use it again for an entire month. Also, when I leave my house to go out, I wash the product from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also exercise regularly and I can only tolerate around two applications in my hair before the product builds up and runs into my eyes when I sweat, causing irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Lipogaine has caused my hairline to fill in considerably, so I am happy with it. If I had not started using Lipogaine, my hairline would be gone by now. It had already thinned out noticeably to where I was embarrassed by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was also a small section of my hair that was shorter than the rest of my hair because I had to cut an enormous tangle from it years ago. I could never get it to grow back to its original length. So, after I would apply most of the Lipogaine around my hairline, I would take the last bit in the dropper and saturate the small section of my scalp with the shorter hair. It started to grow longer immediately. Finally!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had dyed my hair since I was a young woman and never had a problem with permanent dye. However, when I entered menopause, I realized that permanent dye was the main thing causing me to lose hair. So, another change I made is I switched to non-permanent hair dye and also began using sulfate-free shampoos. I haven&#x27;t tried \\&quot;Wen\\&quot; yet, but I noticed that with the brand I use, my hair color lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that women who are older stop using permanent dye to color their hair and see if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t give me a reaction. I am a cosmetologist and when I was in cosmetology school a rep for nioxin had us test the product on our skin and I became so bright red within a few minutes my classmates were disturbed. So first, i must state that I did not have any bad reaction to this which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;The cons are that it is oily and drippy. The whole point of growing more hair is for it to look good. It is hard for me to have a nice clean head of hair and then ruin it and make my scalp look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I know this product takes time to work, and unfortunately, I am not a patient person. I&#x27;m also a forgetful person and the twice a day routine didn&#x27;t stick with me.&lt;br /&gt;I may revisit this product when I feel like I can commit again to the routine. If i have better results, I will update. Not  a bad product, but didn&#x27;t rock my world either.</li>
            <li> So far the only thing I have noticed from this product is it is greasy. You need to apply only to scalp, DO NOT RUB, comb your hair.</li>
            <li> It worked for me. I tried other products before and I was almost resigned to keep loosing hair. After using this product consistently for two weeks I noticed new hair growing in the front. I reordered it. It is sort of sticky but if you use a little bit of gel you cannot notice the difference.</li>
            <li> I use it daily.  I had a bald patch on the side of my head from doing  a perm.  It worked like a dream. The patch of hair is back after 5 months.</li>
            <li> in spite of the fact that it is a little greasy, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your scalp like normal minoxidil products.  I can live with a little shine, I just want more hair!  On my second week, we&#x27;ll see after one month&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every Minoxidil liquid on the market. I can&#x27;t say if it worked but for me I had severe itching so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> No complaints.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for six weeks and have not experienced any of the negative side effects that I read in other reviews.  Apparently the product has to be used for six MONTHS before a difference will be noticed.  So I&#x27;m in month 2 of 6.  My physician advised that I have the type of female hair loss that responds to this treatment, so I am hopeful.</li>
            <li> Just awful!&lt;br /&gt;The first ingredient is alcohol and it&#x27;s simply intolerably drying for scalp and hair, especially for the people experiencing hair loss and hair thinning - the target audience (!)</li>
            <li> This a dangerous product. They should have put in the description that is not be used by people with BP problems.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I used manoxidil (a store brand and rogaine) and ended up going to the Doc. because of awful sores on my head.It took a year or more for the sores to develop and it worked great up to that point. Anyway I used this 2 days and the itching and rash came back immediately, Needless to say, I will have to return this. Manoxidil works great if you are not allergic. I had such high hopes. I will never be able to accept that I am losing my hair. Good luck to you if you try this.</li>
            <li> I havent used this product for ages.  Dont remember why I didnt like it.  It seems like it made my scalp itch.</li>
            <li> I used it exactly as directed on the label and it didn&#x27;t help at all. :( I will continue my search.</li>
            <li> I do not know whether this stuff really works.  Perhaps I am a hopeful user.  I do know that my head does not itch.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.  It makes your hair sticky, and I mean sticky. It causes your hair to be packed down, even when it is dry.  Just forget about trying to brush your hair or comb it.  Even after I washed my hair, I did not wash it all out.  I will never buy this stuff again.</li>
            <li> I was in a bad car accident several months ago and when my hair started heavily falling out I researched it and found that severe trauma can trigger your hair to go into a premature resting then shedding phase. This product goes on nicely and after a month , I thiiiiiink I see some stubble coming in. In a few months, if my hair is back to normal or fuller, I will revisit this review with the richly deserved 5th star.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rogaine &amp; generics having irritating properties negative side effects. I have used two bottles of Lipogain, and I am ordering my third. It works and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation or flaking. New hair growth is finer &amp; fragile. However, the new growth has definitely made a difference, especially in the widow&#x27;s peak area. Additionally the cost if fair. Truly, hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, I am 67 years old and female pattern baldness runs in both of my parents family&#x27;s. I have to mix this with about half of the men&#x27;s 5% Lipogaine to grow hair a bit quicker. I get a rash if I use it more than once a day, if I get a red area I just put on hydrocortisone. Then don&#x27;t put in that area for 1-2 days, it usually calms down. I have been using it 7 months.</li>
            <li> I suppose all these minoxidil compounds work about the same, because I suppose that the minoxidil is the active ingredient and the rest are primarily fillers.  I tried this one because something about the common formulations was making my scalp itch and (I guess the fumes) were making my eyes water and giving me nasal congestion.  (All very lovely.)  I went on line and ascertained that many people thought the problem was with the propylene glycol.  This formulation does not contain it.  I used it for a month (one bottle).  The amount of irritation I experienced was greatly reduced, but not eliminated.  However, as other people have mentioned, for some reason it really saturates your hair--you cannot apply it so that your hair does not look very greasy.  (Also lovely.)  I had to stop it because I was being forced to decide between having my hair fall out and having it look bad everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my girlfriend. She loves it. She used Rogaine for women for one month. The horrible scalp itch made her seek for alternatives. I came across this product and did some research online. I realized that her scalp itch was most likely caused by propylene glycol. I also confirmed it with the seller (The seller had very quick response, by the way). She has been on this product for nearly two months now. The product works great. Her scalp is no longer itchy. Her hair is getting fuller. The product does not have any special odor. It dries quickly. The liquid is yellowish in the bottle. But it appears colorless once it is applied to scalp.</li>
            <li> I just got this yesterday,i have been using just the regular lipogaine for women for months and i was satisfied with it all except for the fact it irritated my scalp so i decided to get this.Big difference in the liquid...this is very very greasy..the other lipogaine didnt do that...this stuff makes your hair look and feel gross.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me.  I started the treatment in January.  I am still using but do not intend to re-order. It has been 4 months consistently using day and night.  No good results.&lt;br /&gt; I have hereditary alopecia.  (female pattern baldness) My mom has it also.  My hair is so short and thin in the top that I can no longer wear my natural hair.  I also have thinning all over.  As time progress, I know I will be completely bald at the top (crown of my head).  I do not have enough hair to make a bang.  No hair on the side.  I tried this product hoping.  My hair looks the same.</li>
            <li> my hair was thinning really badly put after using this stuff my hair has never looked better and is alot thicker too  it does take time to work so please be patient and does work really well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man, but needed the sensitive scalp formula. On the positive side I&#x27;ve had no allergic reaction.  Last time I used regular mens monoxidil on the front of my scalp it became very itchy and flakey and  resulted in losing my hair almost entirely in the front.  Thank goodness it came back when I discontinued it on the front, but that&#x27;s where I need it most. Thank goodness this sensitive skin formula came out. No negative reaction at all.  It also dries relatively faster than other brands of regular minoxidil.  However, I have not seen any difference in 6 mos, and I wish they had a sensitive skin 5% product available for men.  I&#x27;ll stick with it another 3 mos. before giving up. Hopefully I&#x27;ll have better things to say in time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to have a product that doesn&#x27;t cause itching. I was using Equate which is much cheaper, but it did cause an itch. It wasn&#x27;t too bad, but this is better. Also, I like the added ingredients in LipoGaine. Equate is just minoxidil and alcohol. The original LipoGaine left the roots of my hair stiff. Ths sensitive skin version doesn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t notice a greasy texture that others reported. I will continue with this product and possibly alternate with Equate when finances are tight.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this stuff did to me but the sides of my head are numb! I only used it sparingly for about 3 weeks and only 2 or 3 times a week,I just dabbed it on lightly with a cotton ball.I hope this feeling goes away and I didn&#x27;t do something bad to myself. I might try the Pantene minoxidil instead. I didn&#x27;t even use the dropper they supplied because I didn&#x27;t want to put that much on my head because I was afraid,and I guess I had good reason.Buyer beware!! I&#x27;m waiting for my refund now.</li>
