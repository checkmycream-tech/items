            <li>Excellent quality, natural ingredients, very mild, and good for the skin.</li>
            <li>For those describing a &amp;#34;wet dog&amp;#34; smell, or otherwise pretty strong adjectives, it&#x27;s the smell of borage!!!  </li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>I use it after most washes and showers.</li>
            <li>I did not return the item because it would cost more to return it than I paid for it.  </li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love that it is silky and not gooey.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>feel the need to have to keeping re-applying it and putting on more and more.</li>
            <li>How I wish everyone would be mindful of this in the work environment, since cheap perfumed lotions give me a wicked headache!</li>
            <li>I wipe my palms on my hair, making my hair smooth with great ingredients. ;)</li>
            <li>Even though this product says it&#x27;s fragrance free, there is a light, pleasant smell to it that quickly goes away.  </li>
            <li>Great for those sensitive skin and breathing difficulties.</li>
            <li>Best hand lotion, I&#x27;ve found, for super dry skin.</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant natural smell.</li>
            <li>It hydrates skin quickly and aids with eczema!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing and smooth.</li>
            <li>She liked it so much that I decided to buy some and send it to her  </li>
            <li>You see a difference right away!</li>
            <li>My hands are very sensitive to other lotions, this one has benefited me greatly!</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly, moisturizes and isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not bad and it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>My hands look more youthful and they&#x27;re glowing and soft!</li>
            <li>Great for cracked, dry, patchy winter skin, and hands that have seen too much abuse digging in the garden.</li>
            <li>I have it right here sitting on my desk</li>
            <li>It took about a full week for me to see a difference, but once I did, as long as I apply it regularly it seems to really do a great job.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>I have ordered two more tubes in spite of my last experience.</li>
            <li>just put some on now, and I honestly don&#x27;t notice a smell, like some of the other reviewers</li>
            <li>Pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li>It has a very shiny appearance when I first put it on</li>
            <li>Normally I can&#x27;t stand that, but the fact that it works so well makes it worth it.  </li>
            <li>Great for hands-- long term use definitely shows some results- like the new layer of skin that grew while using this cream is softer and moister.</li>
            <li>It absorbs and leaves my hands feeling smooth and not dry at all.</li>
            <li>This lotion is just ok on dry hands.</li>
            <li>Prior orders of this lotion were fine.  </li>
            <li>This lotion has completely eliminated the cracks and my hands feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really does help soothe and heal damage.</li>
            <li>I have chemical sensitivities, so I use this instead of other varieties of lotion with too many additives.</li>
            <li>This is the first lotion I have tried that actually makes my hands better over the long term.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite lotion for my very dry hands.</li>
            <li>Most don&#x27;t work, some do but only for a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will reorder as needed.</li>
            <li>I can have a tube at the office without offending my cubicle neighbors by using a cream that reeks to high heaven every time I apply it.</li>
            <li>I have finally found a cream that healed my dry hands and keeps them looking and feeling good, as long as I use it a couple of times a day.  </li>
            <li>I first used the cream last winter and it worked so well.</li>
            <li>And, as near as I can tell,  this cream does not have ingredients that I know I don&#x27;t want--no urea or parabens.</li>
            <li>It is not oily at all, and it is absorbed almost immediately, unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I am always open to trying new cream or lotions, and often go to bed with bandaids and neosporin on my fingers in the hope they&#x27;ll make it through the work day tomorrow!  .  </li>
            <li>love this product, my only complaint being</li>
            <li>There is no other product like this one.</li>
            <li>The scent is barely detectable.</li>
            <li>It even healed some burns almost overnight, which I never expected.</li>
            <li>the last tube I ordered was runny and smelled like a dirty dog, I am pretty sure it was expired.  </li>
            <li>Did not much more than any other cheap brand for me.&lt;br /&gt;Despite being unscented ..</li>

            <li> Did not much more than any other cheap brand for me.&lt;br /&gt;Despite being unscented ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and</li>
            <li> I have tried many different hand creams, some very expensive department store types and some&lt;br /&gt;from the drug stores and local &amp;#34;mart&amp;#34; stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced this, and I noticed right away; it&#x27;s as if the I went back in time, reversing wear, years and damage to my skin!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I will keep ordering this lotion as long as I can find it.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes well without all the chemicals found in other lotions and creates lasting moisture on my hands with repeated use over time.</li>
            <li> Saving my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m not familiar with the key ingredient, as a guy with fingers that crack in dry cold weather, I&#x27;m grateful that this stuff works like magic.</li>
            <li> I, along with the rest of my siblings, have very dry, cracked skin that never quite seems to heal.  </li>
            <li> My hands get very dry and crack a lot during the winter months-this cream stops that, restoring the skin&#x27;s moisture.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, to the point of cracking and bleeding.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry hands as I have to wash them a lot&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> I find it works well, goes on luxuriously smoothly, and helps to heal those painful cracks in my thumbs from dry arid winters.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, Amazon has it for $2 cheaper than I have found other places.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no regrets in the least.</li>
            <li> During the cold winter months, I sometimes get small cracks in my skin right next to my thumb nails.</li>
            <li> However, the cream seems thin and not as thick as the one I first bought.</li>
            <li> After going through hundred dollar plus prescriptions for sons dry hands to only see them get worse this product cleared up his hands in 3 days.</li>
            <li> No more dry hands.</li>
            <li> My fingertips and cuticles and other parts of my hands that crack improved after using for just a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it should say &amp;#34;no artificial fragrance&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;Unsented.&amp;#34; Because it does have a smell, a mellow unpretty smell at first.</li>
            <li> but I was a bit disappointed by being forced to order more than 2, in order to get it shipped.</li>
            <li> but after a few minutes, it soaks in and is not so shiny.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I didn&#x27;t have to apply it as often throughout the day.</li>
            <li> My hands were very dry from the long cold, dry winter.  </li>
            <li> So after five minutes I can use my laptop keyboard or any other delicate surface.</li>
            <li> Because it is summer, I just tried it twice and will regularly use it when it is cold to see the effect.</li>
            <li> but I like it for the serious moisture.</li>
            <li> It saved my skin from the cold season, and I will keep using in the summer just applying less.</li>
            <li> Although the cracks are small, they are very painful.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very good product.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell or lack thereof.  Absorbs quickly, moisturizes and isn&#x27;t greasy.  Pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cream.  It has a very shiny appearance when I first put it on but after a few minutes, it soaks in and is not so shiny.  It is not greasy or sticky and I love that it is fragrance free!!!  I have finally found a cream that healed my dry hands and keeps them looking and feeling good, as long as I use it a couple of times a day.  And, as near as I can tell,  this cream does not have ingredients that I know I don&#x27;t want--no urea or parabens.</li>
            <li> ShiKai Hand Lotion has really made a wonderful difference in my skin. My hands look more youthful and they&#x27;re glowing and soft! I&#x27;ve never experienced this, and I noticed right away; it&#x27;s as if the I went back in time, reversing wear, years and damage to my skin!&lt;br /&gt;But it is greasy (oily). The bottle says it&#x27;s not, but it is. But all you have to do is wait awhile and let the oil sink in, or wipe your palms off.  I wipe my palms on my hair, making my hair smooth with great ingredients. ;)&lt;br /&gt;Also, it should say &amp;#34;no artificial fragrance&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;Unsented.&amp;#34; Because it does have a smell, a mellow unpretty smell at first. But it&#x27;s not bad and it&#x27;s totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it and try it! You see a difference right away! Great for face wrinkles and nails too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing and smooth. I like it on my hands.</li>
            <li> Great for hands-- long term use definitely shows some results- like the new layer of skin that grew while using this cream is softer and moister. It definitely has some greasiness for 10 min or so when applied, despite the packaging that says non-greasy, but I like it for the serious moisture. I use it after most washes and showers. Still stings a bit for face when my face is acting up. I use Burt&#x27;s Bees cuticle cream for the eczema-looking areas on my face.</li>
            <li> Great for those sensitive skin and breathing difficulties.</li>
            <li> The hand lotion is wonderful, once the lotion has absorbed into your skin there is no greasy feeling.  My hands were very dry from the long cold, dry winter.  I started using this product and fell in love.&lt;br /&gt;However...the last tube I ordered was runny and smelled like a dirty dog, I am pretty sure it was expired.  I did not return the item because it would cost more to return it than I paid for it.  Prior orders of this lotion were fine.  I have ordered two more tubes in spite of my last experience.</li>
            <li> Good cream but I was a bit disappointed by being forced to order more than 2, in order to get it shipped.</li>
            <li> I, along with the rest of my siblings, have very dry, cracked skin that never quite seems to heal.  I am always open to trying new cream or lotions, and often go to bed with bandaids and neosporin on my fingers in the hope they&#x27;ll make it through the work day tomorrow!  .  This hand cream has a lotion consistency, but once it is on your hands it is more greasy, almost like bag balm.  Normally I can&#x27;t stand that, but the fact that it works so well makes it worth it.  It took about a full week for me to see a difference, but once I did, as long as I apply it regularly it seems to really do a great job.  Hopefully can stick with this one a while!</li>
            <li> Love love love! My hands are very sensitive to other lotions, this one has benefited me greatly!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much better my hands look. After a few weeks, I didn&#x27;t have to apply it as often throughout the day. My hands look 20 years younger because they don&#x27;t look dehydrated and wrinkly anymore. The scent is barely detectable.</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than any hand creme I&#x27;ve ever tried and doesn&#x27;t make your hands slippery.</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle! My hands get very dry and crack a lot during the winter months-this cream stops that, restoring the skin&#x27;s moisture. It is non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Hand and Foot Cream are very good.  I love both of the products.  The price is very good and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> During the cold winter months, I sometimes get small cracks in my skin right next to my thumb nails. Although the cracks are small, they are very painful. This lotion has completely eliminated the cracks and my hands feel soft and smooth. I will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream because I am allergic to the scent and ingredients of so many others. This product is truly hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my hands and this has been the best hand cream I have ever used to help moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, to the point of cracking and bleeding.  I have tried almost every brand of &amp;#34;dry skin&amp;#34; lotion and creams out there.  Most don&#x27;t work, some do but only for a short period of time.  This is the first lotion I have tried that actually makes my hands better over the long term.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Works great. No more dry hands.</li>
            <li> Even though this product says it&#x27;s fragrance free, there is a light, pleasant smell to it that quickly goes away.  I would recommend this hand cream -- really nice!</li>
            <li> I have chemical sensitivities, so I use this instead of other varieties of lotion with too many additives. I love it. It even healed some burns almost overnight, which I never expected. I always have some on hand.</li>
            <li> This is the best all-natural hand cream I have found...and I have tried MANY! It moisturizes well without all the chemicals found in other lotions and creates lasting moisture on my hands with repeated use over time. Also, Amazon has it for $2 cheaper than I have found other places.</li>
            <li> This is an Amazing product that does what it says! A must have for you, your moms, and family! Can not say enough!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much. My hands feel very good when I use it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products in the market. It saved my skin from the cold season, and I will keep using in the summer just applying less. Love it!</li>
            <li> For those describing a &amp;#34;wet dog&amp;#34; smell, or otherwise pretty strong adjectives, it&#x27;s the smell of borage!!!  I was delighted to actually be able to smell the healing plant extract within the cream.  I find it works well, goes on luxuriously smoothly, and helps to heal those painful cracks in my thumbs from dry arid winters.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product, my only complaint being I run out of it too quickly!&lt;br /&gt;dj S. Colorado</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite lotion for my very dry hands. I love that it is silky and not gooey. It absorbs and leaves my hands feeling smooth and not dry at all. It also lasts a long time. I will keep ordering this lotion as long as I can find it. It also has a pleasant natural smell.</li>
            <li> when my daughter visited she tried this lotion which I have  She liked it so much that I decided to buy some and send it to her  I believe she will be delighted when she receives it</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m not familiar with the key ingredient, as a guy with fingers that crack in dry cold weather, I&#x27;m grateful that this stuff works like magic. I try to use it two or three times a day. Some have commented on the smell - but I can&#x27;t detect any odor at all. It is not oily at all, and it is absorbed almost immediately, unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried. So after five minutes I can use my laptop keyboard or any other delicate surface. My fingertips and cuticles and other parts of my hands that crack improved after using for just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the cost, this is exceptional cream. I highly recommend. I know men hesitate to use creams, but you don&#x27;t have to advertise it. Just try one tube, keep it out of sight, and use it privately. There&#x27;s no regrets in the least. This is really unique stuff, and I think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different hand creams, some very expensive department store types and some&lt;br /&gt;from the drug stores and local &amp;#34;mart&amp;#34; stores. I picked up a tube of this Borage therapy hand cream&lt;br /&gt;yesterday at a local health food store. I LOVE IT. I have very dry hands as I have to wash them a lot&lt;br /&gt;for my job so they actually start stinging and hurting to the point where I have to use hand cream all of&lt;br /&gt;the time. I put this on and my hands felt soothed and comforted. I have it right here sitting on my desk&lt;br /&gt;and just put some on now, and I honestly don&#x27;t notice a smell, like some of the other reviewers mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;It has safflower oil, jojoba oil and the borage seed oil in it so there will be a trace smell of oil and it also has&lt;br /&gt;shea butter in it as well. When this tube runs out I will definitely pick up another one. It&#x27;s long lasting and I&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t feel the need to have to keeping re-applying it and putting on more and more.</li>
            <li> There is no other product like this one. It hydrates skin quickly and aids with eczema! I&#x27;d recommend anyone to try this!</li>
            <li> I first used the cream last winter and it worked so well. Thus, I ordered three this time. However, the cream seems thin and not as thick as the one I first bought. Because it is summer, I just tried it twice and will regularly use it when it is cold to see the effect.</li>
            <li> This lotion is just ok on dry hands. Did not much more than any other cheap brand for me.&lt;br /&gt;Despite being unscented .. this lotion still smells (like spoiled milk)&lt;br /&gt;The scent does go away after 10 mins or so .. but not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> After going through hundred dollar plus prescriptions for sons dry hands to only see them get worse this product cleared up his hands in 3 days. Highly recommend and will reorder as needed.</li>
            <li> Best hand lotion, I&#x27;ve found, for super dry skin. And, no funky &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> Great for cracked, dry, patchy winter skin, and hands that have seen too much abuse digging in the garden. Really does help soothe and heal damage. I have used this for years and also recommend ShiKai&#x27;s facial wash, their facial moisturizer with borage oil and their body lotion. Excellent quality, natural ingredients, very mild, and good for the skin. I also appreciate that it is fragrance-free. I can have a tube at the office without offending my cubicle neighbors by using a cream that reeks to high heaven every time I apply it. How I wish everyone would be mindful of this in the work environment, since cheap perfumed lotions give me a wicked headache!</li>
            <li> Saving my dry skin.Size is good for travel</li>
