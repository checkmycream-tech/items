            <li>This shampoo Is amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells kind of like hippie-hemp.</li>
            <li>My hair gets clean, feels nice, no damage, smells good, what else can you ask for.</li>
            <li>This used to be my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I struggle when visiting most hotels.</li>
            <li>Bought this after doing quite some research..need to wait more to see any results.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair feeling and looking healthy after repeated use.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this</li>
            <li>It also seems to be working at giving my hair more volume as my brother commented that he thought my hair looked fuller just after I started using this.  </li>

            <li>There is always more shampoo in them.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and my hair.</li>
            <li>you have to use a healthy portion ....</li>
            <li>It smells nice but not too overpowering, just a clean, herbal scent.</li>
            <li>Free shipping made it a better buy.  </li>
            <li>Good one, have not used much yet...</li>
            <li>You really have to use a good conditioner after the wash.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t strongly scented, you smell a light peppermint smell, but it dissipate when you rinse.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Significantly dries out hair and leaves it tangled.</li>
            <li>Hair feels clean.</li>
            <li>It was very important to me that it cleaned my hair very well.  </li>
            <li>But after many years of buying on the site, I realize how valuable reviews are (and how I really trust them for guidance).</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has natural non-toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what makes this a men&#x27;s shampoo, but one of my female friends with shorter hair liked it, its pretty gender neutral</li>
            <li>the shampoo does clean my hair better than most of the regular and more expensive shampoos.  </li>
            <li>So I set out to find a shampoo that I was able to use in a grey water system, but had the cleaning power of your mainstream shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this after using it for a few months.  </li>

            <li>is not that much).</li>
            <li>His hair and scalp look much healthier after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It was thinning really fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this product is really helping</li>
            <li>and it is gentle on my scalp</li>
            <li>very long.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t suds as much as regular shampoos, so I use a bit more than I did of regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Decent smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, it doesn&#x27;t get as sudsy as normal shampoo, but if that is that big of a deal to you then just use a little more than normal.</li>
            <li>in all its a few bucks more than my Suave shampoo from Walmart, but besides that, you don&#x27;t have to compromise with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive scalp and find that almost any mainstream shampoo brand burns.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*It does not contain SLS (sodium laureth sulfate), which is probably why you are interested in this product in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;*It does not contain parabens or Diethanolamine or some other $%#% that some researcher may eventually link to chronic disease.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for three days now and although it hasn&#x27;t helped with less hair falling out when I wash my hair, it HAS significantly thickened my front hair so that the fullness matches the thickness with that of the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because I have a little more dandruff now.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo for my boyfriend when he started switching over to natural products.</li>
            <li>Alot stronger than you would expect for a natural, organic product.</li>
            <li>Even a lot of organic or natural shampoos result in burning skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried what seems like 100&#x27;s of organic all natural shampoo&#x27;s and</li>
            <li>I do us a natural hair gel as well.</li>
            <li>100% natural and</li>
            <li>I wanted a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>Keeps my thinning hair thick and healthy.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is a yellowish serum and has a mild smell of pinesol to it, and slightly minty.</li>
            <li>you only need a small amount quarter size at most.</li>
            <li>shampoo creates a nice, silky lather (but a little less lather than you might be used</li>
            <li>He does have to use a conditioner with it, but that&#x27;s really just because of how long his hair is.</li>
            <li>I work in a professional white collar office, so it had to hold up</li>
            <li>When I originally got this, I thought it was going to be a mistake because the bottle is so small!</li>
            <li>This took a little bit of getting use to, because it doesn&#x27;t lather up and run smoothly through your hair like your typical shampoos.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I don&#x27;t seem to have as much dandruff as usual.  </li>
            <li> It certainly does a better job than the JASON Thin-to-Thick product line which I had been using prior and hated because it caused a lot of buildup on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by the pungent smell of the shampoo while you&#x27;re rinsing because it goes away after your hair</li>
            <li> I will be ordering this regularly and trying Aubrey&#x27;s other products!</li>
            <li> After 6 months I still have one and half bottles left!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the bottle could be larger than 8oz for the price.</li>
            <li> allegedly helps strengthen your hair (because it contains biotin,</li>
            <li> : Why did you buy this company only to destroy it?  </li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo along with biotin vitamins for roughly 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li> I bought this to avoid some of the reported chemicals reported in other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I tried Head and Shoulders among other dandruff shampoos and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey for the small size, but he washes his shoulder length hair every other day and has not even used up an entire bottle yet in 3 months.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Weighs down hair.</li>
            <li> Every time I take a shower and wash my hair, I cringe with every follicle that falls out and goes down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had tried some others and my hair looked slightly greasy afterwards, this was not the case with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Price was typical.  </li>
            <li> when I would itch, I&#x27;d see little flakes come down.</li>
            <li> you sniff the bottle, it smells a little like mouthwash or medicine (but don&#x27;t worry because your hair does not retain this aroma).</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and noticed minor signs of hair loss which I believed is related to poor diet and stress.</li>
            <li> But the smell is kind of nasty.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and finding a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t either dry it out or leave it greasy is difficult.  </li>
            <li> Over the past year and a half, I have noticed a loss in hair count and thickness in comparison with the growth of hair on the rest of my scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*It&#x27;s a small bottle (8 oz.</li>
            <li> After I started using this shampoo there was no more hair on the drain and everywhere on the floor.</li>
            <li> This has made me panic and stress over solutions to stop, or at least regress,</li>
            <li> One negative is the smell.  </li>
            <li> The dollar is weak, son.&lt;br /&gt;*It does not improve your energy (or your IQ, duh).&lt;br /&gt;*When</li>
            <li> Weak lather.</li>
            <li> Which is not what you want with thin hair or balding hair.  </li>
            <li> but after some research I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals that are bad for your hair/scalp.</li>
            <li> quite expensive....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have it bad where it was visible.  </li>
            <li> That said, I will now post a (worthless?)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I never posted a review on Amazon before. But after many years of buying on the site, I realize how valuable reviews are (and how I really trust them for guidance). That said, I will now post a (worthless?) review of this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some good points:&lt;br /&gt;*This shampoo creates a nice, silky lather (but a little less lather than you might be used to).&lt;br /&gt;*It does not contain SLS (sodium laureth sulfate), which is probably why you are interested in this product in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;*It does not contain parabens or Diethanolamine or some other $%#% that some researcher may eventually link to chronic disease.&lt;br /&gt;*It does contain some \\&quot;good\\&quot; stuff like ginseng (yum).&lt;br /&gt;*It allegedly helps strengthen your hair (because it contains biotin, I guess).&lt;br /&gt;*I like the way my hair feels and smells after using it.&lt;br /&gt;*Bonus: shipping was only a dollar for some reason so the cost of one bottle came to $10.77 after tax. Father&#x27;s Day is just around the corner...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some not-so-good points:&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s a small bottle (8 oz. is not that much). The dollar is weak, son.&lt;br /&gt;*It does not improve your energy (or your IQ, duh).&lt;br /&gt;*When you sniff the bottle, it smells a little like mouthwash or medicine (but don&#x27;t worry because your hair does not retain this aroma).</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Keeps my thinning hair thick and healthy.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my boyfriend when he started switching over to natural products. He loves this shampoo and says it&#x27;s the best shampoo he has ever used. It smells nice but not too overpowering, just a clean, herbal scent. It&#x27;s a little pricey for the small size, but he washes his shoulder length hair every other day and has not even used up an entire bottle yet in 3 months. He does have to use a conditioner with it, but that&#x27;s really just because of how long his hair is. His hair and scalp look much healthier after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> So I set out to find a shampoo that I was able to use in a grey water system, but had the cleaning power of your mainstream shampoos.  I was very pleased with this after using it for a few months.  It was very important to me that it cleaned my hair very well.  I had tried some others and my hair looked slightly greasy afterwards, this was not the case with this shampoo.  I work in a professional white collar office, so it had to hold up and it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, short hair that if I don&#x27;t shower every day it will look greasy.  It doesn&#x27;t suds as much as regular shampoos, so I use a bit more than I did of regular shampoo.  The suds are also smaller bubbles, it just has a different feel.  It isn&#x27;t strongly scented, you smell a light peppermint smell, but it dissipate when you rinse.  My hair feels thicker for some reason now that I&#x27;ve used it. I don&#x27;t know what makes this a men&#x27;s shampoo, but one of my female friends with shorter hair liked it, its pretty gender neutral smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all its a few bucks more than my Suave shampoo from Walmart, but besides that, you don&#x27;t have to compromise with this shampoo.  I&#x27;m going to continue using this.</li>
            <li> Aubrey is the only shampoo my husband will use.  We purchase this thru amazon all the time and have never had any issues.</li>
            <li> Alot stronger than you would expect for a natural, organic product. This shampoo is a yellowish serum and has a mild smell of pinesol to it, and slightly minty. I like the formulation.</li>
            <li> the shampoo does clean my hair better than most of the regular and more expensive shampoos.  The smell I did not find to be &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34;, whatever that is, as advertised.  Price was typical.  Free shipping made it a better buy.  Would I buy it again?  Maybe.</li>
            <li> Its alright. Weak lather. Decent smell. Weighs down hair. Which is not what you want with thin hair or balding hair.  Not worth the money.  Try Lipogaine Big 3.</li>
            <li> Significantly dries out hair and leaves it tangled. Not to mention I have dandruff now....Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Good smell.  Hair feels clean.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand I use now. It cleans great and doesn&#x27;t make my hair fall out.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and finding a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t either dry it out or leave it greasy is difficult.  This stuff is perfect for my hair but is also nice smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2017:  This used to be my favorite shampoo.  Then Aubrey was sold.  It is no longer the same product.  Even the bottle has changed, it now has a stick on paper label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Neutraceutical Corporation: Why did you buy this company only to destroy it?  Did you not think that customers would figure it out?</li>
            <li> I am a 27-yr old male who noticed that my front-hairline and temple areas were slightly receding. Over the past year and a half, I have noticed a loss in hair count and thickness in comparison with the growth of hair on the rest of my scalp. This has made me panic and stress over solutions to stop, or at least regress, the loss of hair. Every time I take a shower and wash my hair, I cringe with every follicle that falls out and goes down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for three days now and although it hasn&#x27;t helped with less hair falling out when I wash my hair, it HAS significantly thickened my front hair so that the fullness matches the thickness with that of the rest of my hair. It certainly does a better job than the JASON Thin-to-Thick product line which I had been using prior and hated because it caused a lot of buildup on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by the pungent smell of the shampoo while you&#x27;re rinsing because it goes away after your hair dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased that the product does not contain Sodium Myreth Sulfate, which is a lesser evil of the more harmful sodium laurel sulfate/sodium dodecyl suflate (SLS/SDS) detergent chemical. JASON&#x27;s hair care product line DOES contain SMS which was another reason I tossed that brand.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great - and lathers more than I would expect! But the smell is kind of nasty. You&#x27;d think they could put some type of essential oil in it, but no. Smells kind of like hippie-hemp. And not the good kind.</li>
            <li> excelent product and price</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp and find that almost any mainstream shampoo brand burns. I struggle when visiting most hotels. Even a lot of organic or natural shampoos result in burning skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this shampoo does not burn, lathers great, and smells incredible! I will be ordering this regularly and trying Aubrey&#x27;s other products!</li>
            <li> This shampoo Is amazing. I have tried what seems like 100&#x27;s of organic all natural shampoo&#x27;s and this has to be the best. With that said I have to switch it up every couple of days to a diff one just so my scalp doesn&#x27;t  get used to it. NOTE: you only need a small amount quarter size at most. A bottle usually last me a couple months.</li>
            <li> I bought this to avoid some of the reported chemicals reported in other shampoos.  This took a little bit of getting use to, because it doesn&#x27;t lather up and run smoothly through your hair like your typical shampoos.  However, I got use to it after a week or so.  I feel it does a good job of cleaning my hair.  I use it daily with the Men&#x27;s Stock Conditioner.  One negative is the smell.  It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it goes away as soon as you rinse your hair out.</li>
            <li> great product. We are seeing results.</li>
            <li> My hair was starting to fall a lot before I discovered this shampoo. It was thinning really fast. After I started using this shampoo there was no more hair on the drain and everywhere on the floor. My hair looks fuller and healthier now. I love the fact that it has natural non-toxic ingredients. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because I have a little more dandruff now.</li>
            <li> it is just great as always</li>
            <li> Good one, have not used much yet...but seems to be a good one as of now.  Bought this after doing quite some research..need to wait more to see any results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo along with biotin vitamins for roughly 2 weeks now. I am in my late 20&#x27;s and noticed minor signs of hair loss which I believed is related to poor diet and stress. I don&#x27;t know if this product is really helping but after some research I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals that are bad for your hair/scalp. It also leaves my hair feeling and looking healthy after repeated use. My only complaint is the bottle could be larger than 8oz for the price.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this and it is gentle on my scalp and I don&#x27;t seem to have as much dandruff as usual.  It also seems to be working at giving my hair more volume as my brother commented that he thought my hair looked fuller just after I started using this.  I rated this only 4 stars because it is a bit pricy for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd bottle purchased and its worked out well. I tried Head and Shoulders among other dandruff shampoos and nothing seemed to work. I didn&#x27;t have it bad where it was visible.  I just knew cause when I would itch, I&#x27;d see little flakes come down. Since using this shampoo, itching has stopped!  I do us a natural hair gel as well.</li>
            <li> 100% natural and it works well. I buy a lot of Aubrey Organics products and I have no complaints about any of them.</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural shampoo. I didn&#x27;t want all those chemicals that most shampoos have. Did some research and came across this.  My hair gets clean, feels nice, no damage, smells good, what else can you ask for. When I originally got this, I thought it was going to be a mistake because the bottle is so small! I shower daily and bought three bottles of this. After 6 months I still have one and half bottles left! They are like bottomless bottles of shampoo. There is always more shampoo in them. I think the three bottles will last me an entire year.  It&#x27;s like they sent me a bag of holding, but instead of gems and a broadsword of +3 fire, it&#x27;s got shampoo in it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and my hair. It&#x27;s true, it doesn&#x27;t get as sudsy as normal shampoo, but if that is that big of a deal to you then just use a little more than normal.</li>
            <li> works great, if you like the scent - I do, but it does linger</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband .... he&#x27;s not a big fan of it.  The shampoo lathers but it leaves the hair tangled when you rain your hand through your hair in the shower after the wash. You really have to use a good conditioner after the wash. The shampoo is also quite runny .... you have to use a healthy portion .... I don&#x27;t think its going to last very long.&lt;br /&gt;Its quite expensive....We&#x27;ll get through this bottle but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
