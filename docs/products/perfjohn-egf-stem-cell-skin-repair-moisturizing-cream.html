            <li>This cream is gentle on all skin types and doesn&#x27;t contain harmful ingredients, making for the perfect beauty product for anyone looking for a youthful softer healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very happy with my results so far, and will continue using!&lt;br</li>
            <li>cream has a very light scent to it.</li>
            <li>It has EGF (epidermal growth factor) which has been shown to help reduce scars, promote cell regeneration, and repair damage done to the skin, and this makes it smoother, softer, and gives it a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>they started to magically disappear.</li>
            <li>: I received this product for free or at a discounted price for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>For the price, this is a wonderful product, comparable to the same seaweed-gold flecked-over-priced department store serums.  </li>
            <li>EGF Stem Cell gave me better results than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I want to make sure I am using products that I would tell my friends and family to use.</li>
            <li>but I have to say that I love how this product smell.  </li>
            <li>Manufacturers should understand that most who shop on Amazon are not on par with those who can afford to see a dermatologist or cosmetician and get beauty treatments every week if they want.  </li>
            <li>PRODUCT WAS FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.re not on par with those who can afford to see a dermatologist or cosmetician and get beauty treatments every week if they want.  </li>
            <li>PRODUCT WAS FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li>It is better try it at once,then read and read about.</li>
            <li>The product comes in a 1 oz bottle with a pump top.</li>
            <li>This cream also is combined with EGF, which has been shown to reduce the appearance of scars, promote cell regeneration, repair damage done to skin, make it smoother, softer and imparting a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>It appears more youthful and hydrated and glowy.</li>
            <li>As someone thats always looking for beauty products to help improve the appearance of my skin, I was excited to receive this Perfjohn EGF Stem Cell Anti Aging cream in the mail!</li>
            <li>I love how easily this cream goes on.</li>
            <li>It is magic cream with very exclusive light texture and pleasant sense.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m happy with the results I&#x27;m seeing.</li>
            <li>As I mentioned in the video, I received this product free of charge for my honest review and that is exactly what I showed in this video.</li>
            <li>was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>I got this product free for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li>This anti-aging cream feels creamy and light when you rub it between your fingers, and when you apply it to your skin.</li>
            <li>I respect that so much research went into this product, and the packaging is just as nice as the cream.</li>
            <li>I am really excited to see what the upcoming months will show.  </li>
            <li>I am bombarded by offers to test beauty products for free in exchange for an honest review and when they come you know that I am not going to say no.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that it has reduced some of the fine lines around my eyes and my laugh lines around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>The company claims to have produced a moisturizer full of stem cells and flakes of gold as just 2 of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>this product offers your skin when using it, I personally have seen many of these results after testing out this product for myself, but that&#x27;s not even all this product also contains hyaluronic acid, this ingredient has many amazing benefits in beauty products as well for helping your skin to retain moisture, detoxifying itself, etc.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products over the years from the inexpensive to very, very costly and this is the first product that has made any difference at all.  </li>
            <li>The results are shown so quickly in just a matter of days.</li>
            <li>product has almost no scent to it, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>but it is mild and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this anti aging cream, and I would highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Using a cream doesn&#x27;t mean you dont&#x27; feel good about your age, it just means you want you skin to be as nice as it can be.</li>
            <li>Am I happy that my face looks clearer and that with continued use the freckles and dark spots will fade?  </li>
            <li>Lovely product, and would definitely recommend it to family and friends wanting a smooth, light serum.</li>
            <li>You do not need much and it absorbs easily and without any greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I love how my face feels after I put it on... very soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>and I literally saw results after the first night of using it!</li>
            <li>I love this company, the product always delievers and it hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive skin yet!</li>
            <li>Enjoying the results so far</li>
            <li>and I wished a more natural product had been used, though this is said to be harmless).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>liked the box and the actual bottle (1 oz).  </li>
            <li>It smells like fresh flowers and I feel like I am putting perfume lotion on my face rather than an anti aging product.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t attest to the effectiveness of getting rid of crow&#x27;s feet and laugh lines.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is nice and the product should last you a while.</li>
            <li>Used as to give a product the right consistency and to bind the ingredients together, it is a petroleum product</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be surprised at the quick results!</li>
            <li>Since using this product for almost 2 weeks now; I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels hydrated, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>exactly how well it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>with most beauty creams, my only gripe is the price.  </li>
            <li>Before the cream arrived I did worry that I would be reviewing a cream that would leave my brown skin looking more ashy than further</li>
            <li>This is such a lovely cream.</li>
            <li>I can see my face has gotten overall more even and softer feeling.</li>
            <li>you want to make it last longer, take the cap off and donâ€™t use the pump :-)</li>
            <li>I recently received this as a gift from the seller and as many know</li>
            <li>When using this stem cell anti aging cream you are bound to see many of the above results.</li>
            <li>It sinks right into the skin yet is not greasy, and I&#x27;m able to layer on my foundation and sunscreen and still not feel like I have too much on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the second product from Perfjohn that I have tried, and as the other, this Perfjohn Egf Stem Cell Anti Aging Cream is top notch!!</li>
            <li>Since using this EGF stem cell gold flake cream, I&#x27;ve notice a huge different in my skin.</li>
            <li>However, when I was asked to review this product, I was intrigued because I have not really tested many anti aging cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I give this product 5 stars is because I really have noticed a difference in my skin just with 2 weeks use.  </li>
            <li>It also has real gold flakes in it</li>
            <li>The scent goes away very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and this cream works very well.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work very well</li>
            <li>When I saw what it was all about the EGF (epidermal growth factor) which stimulate cell regrowth and stem cell I was thinking hmm really?</li>
            <li>My skin is looking nicer, heathier and its nice to see it working so well in just a few days.</li>
            <li>my dark spots were definitely more prominent and my skin was dry around my cheeks and nostrils, yet oily in my Tzone.</li>
            <li>This cream is made of high quality ingredients, as its made with potent stem cell extract, which is an amazing ingredient that repairs damaged skin cells, reconstructs cell membranes, and even strengthens cell resistance in thin or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is good for morning and evening after cleansing  skin put a little magic cream and your skin after a few minute became  soft and glowing..</li>
            <li>The main thing that you will find when you read my reviews is that I will not hype up just because I received it as a gift.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer goes on beautifully, and works well to make my skin just a little brighter, and my wrinkles less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>so i highly recommend this to all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to any age group and hope that it will work as well for you as it has for me.</li>
            <li>The cream is thick but spreads nicely and feels moist but not oily.  </li>
            <li>The cream absorbs right into the skin and the fear of the heavy, white moisturizer sitting on top of my skin is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice. product.</li>
            <li>I wanted to show everyone how much this product has helped me so for the first time I showed up on camera with no make-up, natural hair pulled back from my face</li>
            <li>It is white and when you smooth it on your skin you will see tiny specks of gold that melts in as you rub it in.</li>
            <li>my skin is very soft.  </li>
            <li>But thats pretty much my only issues with it.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I love how this product doesn&#x27;t have any bad chemicals either, it&#x27;s made with safe natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I know that some people don&#x27;t like their beauty creams to have a scent as some have sensitive skin or nose</li>
            <li>I pass on all offers to reviews creams and pills but this one intrigued me.</li>
            <li>but it rubs in smooth and fluffy.</li>
            <li>I apply it directly to a scar from an allergic reaction I had about a year ago.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very heavy at all and has a light flower fragrance.</li>
            <li>However I have delicate skin which freckles easily despite the fact that I use sunscreen and also fading cream at night.  </li>
            <li>It also has a  potent stem cell extract from the Swiss apple which helps to repair damaged skin cells, reconstructs cell membranes, and it even strengthens cell resistance in thin or sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>After a while there is only so much you can say about such products.  </li>
            <li>My family have commented that it has reduced very deep wrinkles between my eyes and my skin feels soft and moist all day.</li>
            <li>making it very intriguing to say the least.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and usually facial products make my face breakout or turn red.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is very thick, so it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I think this and one other new product in combination has made a difference in my skin&#x27;s tone/texture.</li>

            <li> You&#x27;ll be surprised at the quick results!</li>
            <li> Since using this product for almost 2 weeks now; I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels hydrated, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> exactly how well it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> with most beauty creams, my only gripe is the price.  </li>
            <li> Before the cream arrived I did worry that I would be reviewing a cream that would leave my brown skin looking more ashy than further</li>
            <li> This is such a lovely cream.</li>
            <li> I can see my face has gotten overall more even and softer feeling.</li>
            <li> you want to make it last longer, take the cap off and donâ€™t use the pump :-)</li>
            <li> I recently received this as a gift from the seller and as many know</li>
            <li> When using this stem cell anti aging cream you are bound to see many of the above results.</li>
            <li> It sinks right into the skin yet is not greasy, and I&#x27;m able to layer on my foundation and sunscreen and still not feel like I have too much on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the second product from Perfjohn that I have tried, and as the other, this Perfjohn Egf Stem Cell Anti Aging Cream is top notch!!</li>
            <li> Since using this EGF stem cell gold flake cream, I&#x27;ve notice a huge different in my skin.</li>
            <li> However, when I was asked to review this product, I was intrigued because I have not really tested many anti aging cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I give this product 5 stars is because I really have noticed a difference in my skin just with 2 weeks use.  </li>
            <li> It also has real gold flakes in it</li>
            <li> The scent goes away very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and this cream works very well.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work very well</li>
            <li> When I saw what it was all about the EGF (epidermal growth factor) which stimulate cell regrowth and stem cell I was thinking hmm really?</li>
            <li> My skin is looking nicer, heathier and its nice to see it working so well in just a few days.</li>
            <li> my dark spots were definitely more prominent and my skin was dry around my cheeks and nostrils, yet oily in my Tzone.</li>
            <li> This cream is made of high quality ingredients, as its made with potent stem cell extract, which is an amazing ingredient that repairs damaged skin cells, reconstructs cell membranes, and even strengthens cell resistance in thin or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is good for morning and evening after cleansing  skin put a little magic cream and your skin after a few minute became  soft and glowing..</li>
            <li> The main thing that you will find when you read my reviews is that I will not hype up just because I received it as a gift.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer goes on beautifully, and works well to make my skin just a little brighter, and my wrinkles less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> so i highly recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to any age group and hope that it will work as well for you as it has for me.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick but spreads nicely and feels moist but not oily.  </li>
            <li> The cream absorbs right into the skin and the fear of the heavy, white moisturizer sitting on top of my skin is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice. product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to show everyone how much this product has helped me so for the first time I showed up on camera with no make-up, natural hair pulled back from my face</li>
            <li> It is white and when you smooth it on your skin you will see tiny specks of gold that melts in as you rub it in.</li>
            <li> my skin is very soft.  </li>
            <li> But thats pretty much my only issues with it.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> I love how this product doesn&#x27;t have any bad chemicals either, it&#x27;s made with safe natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I know that some people don&#x27;t like their beauty creams to have a scent as some have sensitive skin or nose</li>
            <li> I pass on all offers to reviews creams and pills but this one intrigued me.</li>
            <li> but it rubs in smooth and fluffy.</li>
            <li> I apply it directly to a scar from an allergic reaction I had about a year ago.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very heavy at all and has a light flower fragrance.</li>
            <li> However I have delicate skin which freckles easily despite the fact that I use sunscreen and also fading cream at night.  </li>
            <li> It also has a  potent stem cell extract from the Swiss apple which helps to repair damaged skin cells, reconstructs cell membranes, and it even strengthens cell resistance in thin or sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> After a while there is only so much you can say about such products.  </li>
            <li> My family have commented that it has reduced very deep wrinkles between my eyes and my skin feels soft and moist all day.</li>
            <li> making it very intriguing to say the least.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and usually facial products make my face breakout or turn red.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is very thick, so it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I think this and one other new product in combination has made a difference in my skin&#x27;s tone/texture.</li>
            <li> You can use daily to give your skin a youthful glow and tighten any loose skin.  </li>
            <li> This is one of those products that clearly state a little is meant to go a long way--and I see that it does.</li>
            <li> This cream is also compatible with sunscreens or other products you may use on your face such as foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing extreme, but it has only been 10 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dark spots are almost non existant and the slight crows feet are completely gone.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, it smells like lotion, not a heavy floral smell like some face creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a few pumps for a week, and still have a lot of product left.</li>
            <li> My face used to be dry and flaky, I had dark spots and lines around my eyes and my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any other anti aging creams that had these 2 kinds of ingredients</li>
            <li> have noticed that my skin has a youthful glow and that the random acne I get is starting to clear up.  </li>
            <li> Do I still have some freckles and dark spots?  </li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I noticed less wrinkles after using for about 10 days.</li>
            <li> I recommend anyone who needs a little anti aging help to give this a boost.</li>
            <li> It does take a few or so pumps to get it going.</li>
            <li> Not oily or heavy.</li>
            <li> noticed a difference in less than 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I especially like the smell, it very subtle and</li>
            <li> but I am not sure if that is because of the gold flakes.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect from this Cream.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using the product for at least a month to see</li>
            <li> This slightly thick cream also has Hyaluronic Acid for moisture.</li>
            <li> and I have a very bad scar over my right eye, it is noticeably dimmer than it was before I started.  </li>
            <li> This is a keeper and the price they got it at right now is insane.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for approximately 2 weeks now</li>
            <li> I have these bad side wrinkles and just after 7 days</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the second product from Perfjohn that I have tried, and as the other, this Perfjohn Egf Stem Cell Anti Aging Cream is top notch!! It has EGF (epidermal growth factor) which has been shown to help reduce scars, promote cell regeneration, and repair damage done to the skin, and this makes it smoother, softer, and gives it a healthy glow.  It also has a  potent stem cell extract from the Swiss apple which helps to repair damaged skin cells, reconstructs cell membranes, and it even strengthens cell resistance in thin or sensitive skin.  Then they also added Hyaluronic Acid which helps helps your skin to retain moisture and detoxify itself. There are gold flakes in the cream as well, but they are ground very fine, so you do not see them.&lt;br /&gt;It comes beautifully packaged surrounded by styrofoam and the bottle itself has a very attractive design.  The cream itself is very thick, so it is easy to apply.  You can use daily to give your skin a youthful glow and tighten any loose skin.  It also helps in clearing up acne, so this is a cream that is great for all ages.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that my skin has a youthful glow and that the random acne I get is starting to clear up.  I love this anti aging cream, and I would highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
            <li> Since using this EGF stem cell gold flake cream, I&#x27;ve notice a huge different in my skin. My face used to be dry and flaky, I had dark spots and lines around my eyes and my dark circles under my eyes. I&#x27;m only 30 so I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but I&#x27;m starting to get those crows feet next to my eyes. Since using this product for almost 2 weeks now; I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels hydrated, soft and smooth. The dark spots are almost non existant and the slight crows feet are completely gone. I have sensitive skin and usually facial products make my face breakout or turn red. I can honestly say I did not have any of those issues with this product. A little goes a long way, it smells like lotion, not a heavy floral smell like some face creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past. So far I&#x27;m happy with the results I&#x27;m seeing. I look forward to using the product for at least a month to see exactly how well it&#x27;s working. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Works great! Enjoying the results so far</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! The results are shown so quickly in just a matter of days. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. I have these bad side wrinkles and just after 7 days they started to magically disappear. I love how this product doesn&#x27;t have any bad chemicals either, it&#x27;s made with safe natural ingredients. This is a keeper and the price they got it at right now is insane. I&#x27;m gonna have to grab myself another bottle before the price goes up. I recommend anyone who needs a little anti aging help to give this a boost. You&#x27;ll be surprised at the quick results! Disclosure: I received this product for free or at a discounted price for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer goes on beautifully, and works well to make my skin just a little brighter, and my wrinkles less noticeable.  The ingredients are almost perfect, with Vitamin B5, Shea butter oil, stem cell extract(which has to help because the skin on the face turns over so quickly), EGF factor, Hyaluronic Acid(binds water and lubricates parts), gold flake(to add a glow?) Xantham Gum(a gelling compound and thickener)Amino Acid(building blocks), and Parfum(light scent), water and Butylene Glycol(which was my only objection.  Used as to give a product the right consistency and to bind the ingredients together, it is a petroleum product and I wished a more natural product had been used, though this is said to be harmless).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Egf Stem cell serum comes in a pump bottle which gives you just the right amount(one pump per side of face), smells very nice, and has a great consistency.  It sinks right into the skin yet is not greasy, and I&#x27;m able to layer on my foundation and sunscreen and still not feel like I have too much on my skin.  For the price, this is a wonderful product, comparable to the same seaweed-gold flecked-over-priced department store serums.  I&#x27;ve found that these type of serums do work, and finding one that isn&#x27;t over the top expensive is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a bottle to try for review purposes but I would happily but this serum again.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t work.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.  Feels good though.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to every friend and family member. At the age of 69, you name it and I&#x60;ve probably tried it. This product is head and shoulders above anything I have used before. My family have commented that it has reduced very deep wrinkles between my eyes and my skin feels soft and moist all day.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:f7aafe2899f68c8a3292ae5331253493]] EGF Stem Cell gave me better results than I was expecting. I wanted to show everyone how much this product has helped me so for the first time I showed up on camera with no make-up, natural hair pulled back from my face so i could prove to everyone that this product has helped me so much in just a few days. As I mentioned in the video, I received this product free of charge for my honest review and that is exactly what I showed in this video. I am a reviewer so I inspect items like the FBI. I want to make sure I am using products that I would tell my friends and family to use. Please watch and see for yourself what a great product EGF has made.</li>
            <li> I am bombarded by offers to test beauty products for free in exchange for an honest review and when they come you know that I am not going to say no.  Unless I keep getting asked to review the same product but by different manufacturers.  After a while there is only so much you can say about such products.  However, when I was asked to review this product, I was intrigued because I have not really tested many anti aging cream.  This one fascinated me because of the gold flakes and stem cells.  Never used a product like this so I was excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the box and the actual bottle (1 oz).  Although only 1 oz, I have been using this product day and night for 2 weeks and I use 2 or 3 pumps each time and there still is much left.  I know that some people don&#x27;t like their beauty creams to have a scent as some have sensitive skin or nose but I have to say that I love how this product smell.  It smells like fresh flowers and I feel like I am putting perfume lotion on my face rather than an anti aging product.  The cream is thick but spreads nicely and feels moist but not oily.  It leaves a nice shine but I am not sure if that is because of the gold flakes.  This cream is also compatible with sunscreens or other products you may use on your face such as foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I give this product 5 stars is because I really have noticed a difference in my skin just with 2 weeks use.  I don&#x27;t have wrinkles so I can&#x27;t attest to the effectiveness of getting rid of crow&#x27;s feet and laugh lines.  However I have delicate skin which freckles easily despite the fact that I use sunscreen and also fading cream at night.  I have noticed that my skin has gotten clearer.  Do I still have some freckles and dark spots?  Yes.  Am I happy that my face looks clearer and that with continued use the freckles and dark spots will fade?  Heck yes!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with most beauty creams, my only gripe is the price.  Manufacturers should understand that most who shop on Amazon are not on par with those who can afford to see a dermatologist or cosmetician and get beauty treatments every week if they want.  So if their target audience is consumers like me (who lives paycheck to paycheck) then they should make a product that is awesome but priced so that we can afford to buy it when it runs out.  I&#x27;m just saying what everyone else is thinkingâ€¦â€¦â€¦.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT WAS FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.re not on par with those who can afford to see a dermatologist or cosmetician and get beauty treatments every week if they want.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a week and I literally saw results after the first night of using it! I have some acne scarring and it has helped! My skin feels so great and I see my indents disappearing!</li>
            <li> It is magic cream with very exclusive light texture and pleasant sense. It is good for morning and evening after cleansing  skin put a little magic cream and your skin after a few minute became  soft and glowing..i would recommend this product for anybody.It is better try it at once,then read and read about. Please try this and you would not regret. T.</li>
            <li> I pass on all offers to reviews creams and pills but this one intrigued me. The company claims to have produced a moisturizer full of stem cells and flakes of gold as just 2 of the ingredients. Let me say that it was the gold that had my interest piqued. Before the cream arrived I did worry that I would be reviewing a cream that would leave my brown skin looking more ashy than further bronzed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the cream arrived it was wrapped in foam and plastic. The bottle was sturdy and I found that the pump dispensed a generous amount of product. This is one of those products that clearly state a little is meant to go a long way--and I see that it does. The cream absorbs right into the skin and the fear of the heavy, white moisturizer sitting on top of my skin is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice. product.</li>
            <li> This is such a lovely cream. It uses stem sells from apples how amazing is that! It also has real gold flakes in it making it very intriguing to say the least. I have not seen any other anti aging creams that had these 2 kinds of ingredients so I had to try it!  The product comes in a 1 oz bottle with a pump top. It does take a few or so pumps to get it going. The cream is a medium thickness but it rubs in smooth and fluffy. It isn&#x27;t very heavy at all and has a light flower fragrance. I love how my face feels after I put it on... very soft and refreshed. I can see my face has gotten overall more even and softer feeling. I would definitely recommend this product. I got this product free for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I noticed less wrinkles after using for about 10 days. I took a picture an then another every week to see , there was a big difference. It did help.</li>
            <li> I love beauty products! Who doesn&#x27;t? I love this company, the product always delievers and it hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive skin yet! So thats a big plus. The bottle is nice and the product should last you a while. I&#x27;ve done a few pumps for a week, and still have a lot of product left. It&#x27;s only been a week and I&#x27;ve started to notice a change. My skin is looking nicer, heathier and its nice to see it working so well in just a few days. Maybe in another week, I&#x27;ll notice a bigger difference with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has almost no scent to it, and absorbs quickly. Though you should wash your hands after applying, it makes my hands feel a bit sticky. But thats pretty much my only issues with it. So go ahead and try it! Get the lovely skin you&#x27;ve always wanted!</li>
            <li> An amazing product. I got really good results with this so i highly recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> This anti-aging cream feels creamy and light when you rub it between your fingers, and when you apply it to your skin. Not oily or heavy. I respect that so much research went into this product, and the packaging is just as nice as the cream. It came snugly packed in  a box within a box, cushion all around. Lovely product, and would definitely recommend it to family and friends wanting a smooth, light serum. Using a cream doesn&#x27;t mean you dont&#x27; feel good about your age, it just means you want you skin to be as nice as it can be.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 10 days - once a day. I apply it directly to a scar from an allergic reaction I had about a year ago. It seems to have evened out the discoloration and enhanced the overall skin texture in that area. Nothing extreme, but it has only been 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my results so far, and will continue using!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If you want to make it last longer, take the cap off and donâ€™t use the pump :-)</li>
            <li> I recently received this as a gift from the seller and as many know I do reviews for authors and sellers.  The main thing that you will find when you read my reviews is that I will not hype up just because I received it as a gift.  Our honesty is about the only thing that we all have in life that will follow you everywhere we go.  I have used this product for approximately 2 weeks now and I have a very bad scar over my right eye, it is noticeably dimmer than it was before I started.  I have tried many products over the years from the inexpensive to very, very costly and this is the first product that has made any difference at all.  I especially like the smell, it very subtle and my skin is very soft.  I have noticed that it has reduced some of the fine lines around my eyes and my laugh lines around my mouth.  I will continue to use this to see if it will continue to help my scar.  I highly recommend this product to any age group and hope that it will work as well for you as it has for me.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing cream!! Beautifully packaged. This is a cream that is derived from apples! WOW!  This slightly thick cream also has Hyaluronic Acid for moisture. I love how easily this cream goes on. A small amount goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;This cream has a very light scent to it. It did not cause me to break out in anyway. The scent goes away very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I use this cream in the morning and evening. Even though this bottle is only 1 ounce I still have a lot of product left.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference in less than 2 weeks! My skin looks bright and glowing. NOT greasy or oily just a beautiful healthy glow. I know that my skin looks better because of the compliments I&#x27;ve been receiving.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week now, during the day.  I have combination skin and am over 40 and this cream works very well.  You do not need much and it absorbs easily and without any greasy feeling.  Seems to work very well, my skin looks great.  I would recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> As someone thats always looking for beauty products to help improve the appearance of my skin, I was excited to receive this Perfjohn EGF Stem Cell Anti Aging cream in the mail! After testing this cream out for myself I have to say it does wonders for my skin!!! I definitely see results in the appearance of my skin after using this anti aging cream. This cream is made of high quality ingredients, as its made with potent stem cell extract, which is an amazing ingredient that repairs damaged skin cells, reconstructs cell membranes, and even strengthens cell resistance in thin or sensitive skin. This cream also is combined with EGF, which has been shown to reduce the appearance of scars, promote cell regeneration, repair damage done to skin, make it smoother, softer and imparting a healthy glow. All of these are amazing benefits this product offers your skin when using it, I personally have seen many of these results after testing out this product for myself, but that&#x27;s not even all this product also contains hyaluronic acid, this ingredient has many amazing benefits in beauty products as well for helping your skin to retain moisture, detoxifying itself, etc. When using this stem cell anti aging cream you are bound to see many of the above results. This cream will help to replenish your lost levels and protect that which remains. This cream is gentle on all skin types and doesn&#x27;t contain harmful ingredients, making for the perfect beauty product for anyone looking for a youthful softer healthier looking skin. I personally recommend this cream to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect from this Cream. I had not heard of anything like it. When I saw what it was all about the EGF (epidermal growth factor) which stimulate cell regrowth and stem cell I was thinking hmm really? This cream has an airless pump and dispenses the perfect amount and I only use one pump. It is white and when you smooth it on your skin you will see tiny specks of gold that melts in as you rub it in. There is a scent but it is mild and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I recently got back from Vacation and I have always had hyperpigmentation in my skin and I got a lot of sun and my dark spots were definitely more prominent and my skin was dry around my cheeks and nostrils, yet oily in my Tzone. After about a week of using this I can already see an improvement in my skins tone and texture. I have recently gotten a lot of compliments on my face and asking what I did. I think this and one other new product in combination has made a difference in my skin&#x27;s tone/texture. It appears more youthful and hydrated and glowy. I am really excited to see what the upcoming months will show.  I am thinking the EGF may be helping with my skin regrowth turnover increasing. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions.</li>
