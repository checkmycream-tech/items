            <li>It is a great flavor and my son loves it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just not been impressed.</li>
            <li>It does what it needs to, and is the best value.</li>
            <li>Great deal!</li>
            <li>It smells great to me and tastes great to her, so I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li>I bought this toothpaste for my toddler thinking it&#x27;d be good</li>
            <li>This is their favorite of all toothpastes!</li>
            <li>and we both love it!</li>
            <li>I got so many tubes of it now!</li>
            <li>But the price is good and they got used to it :)</li>
            <li>and now she is to the point of wanting to squeeze out her own paste</li>
            <li>What kind of flavor is this??  </li>
            <li>cute packaging, light and pleasant flavor.</li>
            <li>My kids love the taste and enjoy brushing their teeth (ages 1 and 3) and I am happy it fluoride free.</li>
            <li>My toddlers love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>and I love that it does not have any fluoride.</li>
            <li>daughter enjoyed the flavor, and really enjoyed the animals on the product.</li>
            <li>makes it seem to be a more trustworthy product.</li>
            <li>He love to brush his teeth now.</li>
            <li>She eats it when no one is seeing :))</li>
            <li>It came recommened from my dentist for my daughter, so I tried it and now we are fans! :)</li>
            <li>so I am sure it is the ingredients and not an allergy.</li>
            <li>Still love Amazon.</li>
            <li>but I sure hope it is safe for the kids who are continuing to use it.</li>
            <li>We have used Thomas the Train and Elmo training toothpastes which tasted much better.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s nowhere near being able to spit on her own, so we&#x27;ll be using the subscribe and save for a while!</li>
            <li>Our kids love the taste of this toothpaste and it does a good job (so far) with cleaning until they can learn to spit it out instead of swallowing.  </li>
            <li>He tolerates it just fine</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried a lot of children&#x27;s toothpastes, and our little boy likes this one best.  </li>
            <li>perfect for little ones who are learning dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>I have signed up for Subscribe and save for this item since my daughter liked it so much.</li>
            <li>It is flouride free.  </li>
            <li>I tried brushing my own teeth with this toothpaste before using it on my 13 month old, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t find the taste pleasant at all.  </li>
            <li>and overall had a pleasant smell and taste and is made in Germany...</li>
            <li>My 3 year old uses it all on her own.</li>
            <li>great to have on hand, since the little ones go through these really quickly!</li>
            <li>so we go through it quickly.  </li>
            <li>My eldest was rash free for months until she went to her cousins and used the My First Colgate toothpaste..</li>
            <li>Use it to get kids interested in brushing teeth!</li>
            <li>Luckily, my daughter seems to love the taste and was actually upset with me for taking the toothbrush away after I finished brushing her teeth.</li>
            <li>My children love this toothpaste, especially the jungle animal design on the tube which makes brushing teeth even funner for them!</li>
            <li>I have been using this toothpaste on my daughter since she first started brushing her teethed</li>
            <li>As soon as my LO broke in his first tooth we started using this product and our LO loves to brush his teeth.</li>
            <li>She calls this toothpaste \\&quot;hot flavored animals\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The value for this six pack is also much better than we would pay locally.</li>
            <li>If I tried brushing my son&#x27;s teeth with this stuff, I&#x27;m sure it would put him off brushing for a long time!</li>
            <li>It has some kind of odd fruity smell but also chemically smell, too.</li>
            <li>She initially didn&#x27;t like the taste compared to the orajel and aquafresh toddler toothpastes, however, she&#x27;s fine with it now.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to make your life easier and your kids happier!</li>
            <li>My kids like this stuff almost TOO MUCH.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the STRONGEST children&#x27;s toothpaste we&#x27;ve ever tried, and it&#x27;s very artificial/saccharine/overly-sweet.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this 6 pack of toothpaste without really reading the reviews as I just figured toothpaste is toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The second time, I got a mild rash on my hand.</li>
            <li>I was actually quite surprised that colgate didn&#x27;t have it as the BIG brands tend to use the most chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought the Colgate toddler mild fruit toothpaste without trying it first, b/c Orajel was not available from Amazon directly.</li>
            <li>Then I tried it and it nearly burnt my mouth (and I do not have sensitive tastebuds)!  </li>
            <li>Otherwise he would probably only want us to brush his mouth with pure sugar in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It really reminds me of the so-called fruit taste that&#x27;s in the numbing substance the dentist puts on the future injection site in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>We had been buying an all natural paste from amazon for a while, but forgot it when we went on vacation.</li>
            <li>I purchased in bulk for my 2 year old.</li>
            <li>Bought this large pack from Amazon but our 3y/o who honestly isnt picky said it tasted pretty bad.</li>
            <li>The reason for the 4 star is that the flavor is a little too sweet and the size of the tube is small so it does run out quickly.</li>
            <li>Outside of product clearly states 0-2 years.</li>
            <li>I ran out of my 26m old son&#x27;s regular non-fluoride toothpaste, so tried this one out.  </li>
            <li>However, after extended use, they both developed a red rash in the corner of their mouths around the ages of 1.5 to 2 years.</li>
            <li>This is the only toothpaste my 4 year old will use.</li>
            <li>my little one has been using this toothpaste since he cut his first tooth</li>
            <li>In case you weren&#x27;t aware, there is very little to be found without parabens as a preservative.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> In case you weren&#x27;t aware, there is very little to be found without parabens as a preservative.</li>
            <li> : I find that it tastes like a very strong fake cherry-ish taste, with quite a bitter after-taste.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste does tend not to last as long, but it is a smaller tube</li>
            <li> My 15 month old loves getting his teeth brushed with plain water.  </li>
            <li> The flavor of the tooth paste allows me to brush his teeth for as long as I want and he doesn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I never suspected the toothpaste because they had been using it for so long.</li>
            <li> I tried it 3 times on my 2 1/2 yr old daughter, and every time she immediately started crying and saying she didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I offered him his sippy cup and he gratefully drank it down, apparently to get the taste out of his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this stuff is ounce per ounce WAY MORE EXPENSIVE than regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> so I found Colgate hoping to have an easy, less expensive replacement.</li>
            <li> I tasted it myself and it was bitter.  </li>
            <li> Be careful when using for long periods!!!!</li>
            <li> Unlike the other reviewer I have not had problems with it being too runny.</li>
            <li> It is not runny as other reviewers have complained about, it is actually thicker than Orajel.</li>
            <li> It is NOT mild.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t subject my daughter to the flavor anymore.</li>
            <li> We have been using it for a few years</li>
            <li> I tried brushing my son&#x27;s teeth ever since he was 10 months and had a few teeth.</li>
            <li> I finally tried the taste after the 3rd time and wow, it is incredibly DISGUSTING.</li>
            <li> All of my small children use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> However, after it had shipped I read some of the reviews as an afterthought and got worried after hearing that many children and parents alike thought that it tasted horrible.</li>
            <li> Too watery and the flavor not liked by my girls.  </li>
            <li> I see that another reviewer&#x27;s dentist recommends it, and no one else complained about the flavor, but now we have 6 tubes of it to give away.</li>
            <li> By chance, we randomly discovered the toothpaste as the culprit after switching brands due to our store being out of stock.</li>
            <li> The first time we tried it for our son (age 2 1/2), he hated it.  </li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t shown any bad reaction but they did seem to notice it was different.</li>
            <li> The taste is just plain bad.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve eroded trust with my son over tooth brushing, and he eyes me warily when I get out the toothbrush...</li>
            <li> And, my son&#x27;s breath smells weird after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been spitting and drinking things to try and get the nasty taste out of my mouth for half an hour now.  </li>
            <li> It bubbles up in their mouth, too, which is awkward when they haven&#x27;t learned how to spit it out.</li>
            <li> Then my husband tasted it and made me try it too, because he couldn&#x27;t believe it was so bad.  </li>
            <li> and I felt sick.</li>
            <li> We were very disappointed with Colgate.</li>
            <li> It tasted HORRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how horrible the taste was.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great to have on hand, since the little ones go through these really quickly!</li>
            <li> My son loves the kids toothpaste so we go through it quickly.  Buying it in bulk saves us money on something we need regularly.  It is a great flavor and my son loves it!!</li>
            <li> My toddlers love this toothpaste. We have been using it for a few years and I love that it does not have any fluoride.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my 26m old son&#x27;s regular non-fluoride toothpaste, so tried this one out.  By smell, it seemed to smell \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; let&#x27;s say, so I thought he could give it a try.  Upon trying it, my son cried and ran and rubbed his tongue repeatedly on his blanket.  I offered him his sippy cup and he gratefully drank it down, apparently to get the taste out of his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then decided to taste it myself: I find that it tastes like a very strong fake cherry-ish taste, with quite a bitter after-taste.  It really reminds me of the so-called fruit taste that&#x27;s in the numbing substance the dentist puts on the future injection site in your mouth.  I personally don&#x27;t find the taste pleasant at all.  Now I&#x27;ve eroded trust with my son over tooth brushing, and he eyes me warily when I get out the toothbrush...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find the product was runny.  Outside of product clearly states 0-2 years.</li>
            <li> Too watery and the flavor not liked by my girls.  But the price is good and they got used to it :)</li>
            <li> I have signed up for Subscribe and save for this item since my daughter liked it so much. We had been buying an all natural paste from amazon for a while, but forgot it when we went on vacation. We found this colgate when we dropped by a B&amp;M store to find something. In case you weren&#x27;t aware, there is very little to be found without parabens as a preservative. I was actually quite surprised that colgate didn&#x27;t have it as the BIG brands tend to use the most chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter enjoyed the flavor, and really enjoyed the animals on the product. This toothpaste does tend not to last as long, but it is a smaller tube and now she is to the point of wanting to squeeze out her own paste and she tends to over do it.</li>
            <li> In the product description Amazon said that the product is for kids from 1 to 5 years but she you receive the product it say that the product is for 0 to 2 years, it is a fraud.</li>
            <li> My kids try to eat this by the tube. This is their favorite of all toothpastes!</li>
            <li> My toddlers ran out of Aquafresh training toothpaste so I found Colgate hoping to have an easy, less expensive replacement. I&#x27;ve just not been impressed. It has some kind of odd fruity smell but also chemically smell, too. And, my son&#x27;s breath smells weird after using it. They haven&#x27;t shown any bad reaction but they did seem to notice it was different. It bubbles up in their mouth, too, which is awkward when they haven&#x27;t learned how to spit it out. Aquafresh didn&#x27;t bubble at all and overall had a pleasant smell and taste and is made in Germany...makes it seem to be a more trustworthy product. I&#x27;d almost rather take my chances with a tiny drop of kids toothpaste than stick with this Colgate toddler one.</li>
            <li> What can i say, its a toothepaste and it does what it is supposed to. Bought it online because of the price.</li>
            <li> The information &amp; product review says for ages 1-6. I purchased in bulk for my 2 year old. When i got the box it SPECIFICALLY states for ages 0-2 and to switch to a fluoride toothpaste AFTER age 2! The description is incorrect.</li>
            <li> My children love this toothpaste, especially the jungle animal design on the tube which makes brushing teeth even funner for them! The reason for the 4 star is that the flavor is a little too sweet and the size of the tube is small so it does run out quickly. Cannot beat the subscribe and save savings though!</li>
            <li> I tried brushing my son&#x27;s teeth ever since he was 10 months and had a few teeth. He would let me do it sometimes but it was a challenge. He is now 16 months and we tried this tooth paste and it worked wonders. He love to brush his teeth now. The flavor of the tooth paste allows me to brush his teeth for as long as I want and he doesn&#x27;t mind. Highly recommend this product to make your life easier and your kids happier!</li>
            <li> My child asks for it every time. She eats it when no one is seeing :))</li>
            <li> I tried brushing my own teeth with this toothpaste before using it on my 13 month old, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  It tasted HORRIBLE.  The closest thing I could relate it to was cough medicine.  I&#x27;ve been spitting and drinking things to try and get the nasty taste out of my mouth for half an hour now.  If I tried brushing my son&#x27;s teeth with this stuff, I&#x27;m sure it would put him off brushing for a long time!</li>
            <li> Have to shake the tube before each use, otherwise, it&#x27;s too watery to stay on the toothbrush. I recommend the Orajel training toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste on my daughter since she first started brushing her teethed and we both love it! Unlike the other reviewer I have not had problems with it being too runny. I did initally shake it, but after that I did not have a problem with it. It came recommened from my dentist for my daughter, so I tried it and now we are fans! :)</li>
            <li> As soon as my LO broke in his first tooth we started using this product and our LO loves to brush his teeth. I would recommend this to everyone who has a LO.</li>
            <li> Both of my daughters used this toothpaste starting as infants with no problems. However, after extended use, they both developed a red rash in the corner of their mouths around the ages of 1.5 to 2 years. I never suspected the toothpaste because they had been using it for so long. We had several doctor appointments, various ointments, etc, but nothing worked. By chance, we randomly discovered the toothpaste as the culprit after switching brands due to our store being out of stock. Both rashes disappeared within a couple of days. My eldest was rash free for months until she went to her cousins and used the My First Colgate toothpaste..the rash immediately reappeared. My daughters have very different skin types from one another so I am sure it is the ingredients and not an allergy. Be careful when using for long periods!!!!</li>
            <li> My 3 year old uses it all on her own. She initially didn&#x27;t like the taste compared to the orajel and aquafresh toddler toothpastes, however, she&#x27;s fine with it now. It does what it needs to, and is the best value. She&#x27;s nowhere near being able to spit on her own, so we&#x27;ll be using the subscribe and save for a while!</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste my 4 year old will use. He has no cavities so I guess it is working.</li>
            <li> My 15 month old loves getting his teeth brushed with plain water.  I thought we&#x27;d jazz things up with this toothpaste.  He refused to let me brush his teeth with this toothpaste.  I tasted it myself and it was bitter.  The taste is just plain bad.</li>
            <li> My kids like this stuff almost TOO MUCH.  I ask them if they are brushing their teeth or having a snack.  My only complaint is that this stuff is ounce per ounce WAY MORE EXPENSIVE than regular toothpaste.  Why?  It doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.</li>
            <li> only toothpaste my picky toddler will tolerate</li>
            <li> The taste of this toothpaste is supposedly &amp;#34;mild fruit&amp;#34;.  It is NOT mild.  The first time we tried it for our son (age 2 1/2), he hated it.  Then my husband tasted it and made me try it too, because he couldn&#x27;t believe it was so bad.  It&#x27;s the STRONGEST children&#x27;s toothpaste we&#x27;ve ever tried, and it&#x27;s very artificial/saccharine/overly-sweet.  Even if my son DID like it, I wouldn&#x27;t want him getting used to that as a toothpaste flavor.  Otherwise he would probably only want us to brush his mouth with pure sugar in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT recommend this product.  We were very disappointed with Colgate.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried a lot of children&#x27;s toothpastes, and our little boy likes this one best.  Use it to get kids interested in brushing teeth!</li>
            <li> I bought the Colgate toddler mild fruit toothpaste without trying it first, b/c Orajel was not available from Amazon directly. It is not runny as other reviewers have complained about, it is actually thicker than Orajel. I tried it 3 times on my 2 1/2 yr old daughter, and every time she immediately started crying and saying she didn&#x27;t like it. I finally tried the taste after the 3rd time and wow, it is incredibly DISGUSTING. It tastes like plastic. I see that another reviewer&#x27;s dentist recommends it, and no one else complained about the flavor, but now we have 6 tubes of it to give away. I can&#x27;t subject my daughter to the flavor anymore. Also the product description says it is for 0-6 yo, but the tube says 0-2 yo. Oh well. Still love Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great deal! All of my small children use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve NOT tasted this toothpaste because the two times I gave it to my son, I was overwhelmed by the noxiously saccharine smell and I felt sick. The second time, I got a mild rash on my hand. He tolerates it just fine but his Mama can&#x27;t and this tube is going into the garbage. I cannot imagine WHAT is in this toothpaste that my body finds so intolerable but I sure hope it is safe for the kids who are continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this 6 pack of toothpaste without really reading the reviews as I just figured toothpaste is toothpaste. However, after it had shipped I read some of the reviews as an afterthought and got worried after hearing that many children and parents alike thought that it tasted horrible. Luckily, my daughter seems to love the taste and was actually upset with me for taking the toothbrush away after I finished brushing her teeth. It smells great to me and tastes great to her, so I&#x27;m really glad I got so many tubes of it now!</li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste on my daughter 5 times over several months.  Each time she cried.  She calls this toothpaste \\&quot;hot flavored animals\\&quot;.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this toothpaste.  I have no problem with brushing her teeth with it.  It is flouride free.  So, I don&#x27;t worry about her swallowing it.</li>
            <li> Our kids love the taste of this toothpaste and it does a good job (so far) with cleaning until they can learn to spit it out instead of swallowing.  The value for this six pack is also much better than we would pay locally.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste for my toddler thinking it&#x27;d be good considering it&#x27;s coming from a trusted brand - Colgate.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how horrible the taste was.  My boy cried every time I brushed his teeth.  Then I tried it and it nearly burnt my mouth (and I do not have sensitive tastebuds)!  What kind of flavor is this??  Way too spicy to be an infant/toddler product.</li>
            <li> My kids love the taste and enjoy brushing their teeth (ages 1 and 3) and I am happy it fluoride free.</li>
            <li> Bought this large pack from Amazon but our 3y/o who honestly isnt picky said it tasted pretty bad. I tried it tonight and agree-- this tastes like expired cherry cough syrup. Would not recommend this flavor. We have used Thomas the Train and Elmo training toothpastes which tasted much better.</li>
            <li> my little one has been using this toothpaste since he cut his first tooth and he loves brushing his teeth with it.  cute packaging, light and pleasant flavor. perfect for little ones who are learning dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> My toddler daughter hates it !! She hates the taste and now I have 7 bottle of toothpaste to give away !!</li>
