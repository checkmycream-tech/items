            <li>however now I am extremely happy that I have found a couple of products that actually work as advertised, combined with Garcinia Cambogia Extract</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a light exercise plan and a strict diet.</li>
            <li>Weight management is important to me.</li>

            <li>I bought Mango Pure Cleanse with the plan to use this product in conjunction with light exercise and a healthy diet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike many I am not taking these for weight loss tho that would be a nice bonus, but for removing toxins and overall health.</li>
            <li>Sometimes to help jump start and maintain my weight loss, I take a cleanse to clean out any gunk that may have built up.</li>
            <li>my experience with mango pure cleanse has been phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I am hopeful this will stay in the right direction!  </li>
            <li>I am in my fourth week and plan to continue juicing during the day for breakfast and lunch and eating a sensible dinner consisting of a piece of fish and a good serving of vegetables.  </li>

            <li>I enjoy doing cleanses and was excited to try my first one based on mango.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say how this product worked on it own because I took it with Garcinia Combogia 76% HCA pure.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely thrilled with the results I am seeing and would absolutely recommend this supplement to anyone who wants to shed those excess pounds.</li>
            <li>I know that, when I digest these in their more traditional forms, I lose weight and feel better.</li>

            <li>One of my biggest problems was that I ate too much, even when I was full.</li>
            <li>One of the very first things I noticed when I started taking Mango Pure Cleanse was that my appetite between meals was not as prevelant.</li>
            <li>That translates into food moving too quickly through your system to do much damage in the calorie category.</li>
            <li>I am actively trying to lose weight, eat right, and exercise for my health, not so the scale will talk nice to me</li>
            <li>Lost 4# the first week of using it.</li>

            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t believe her</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lost 4 lbs in the first week.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product with exercise and a healthy diet - it can only help!</li>
            <li>The first is that I understand the ingredients and how they work.</li>
            <li>Understanding my dietary supplements means I&#x27;m more likely to take them</li>
            <li>I have lost a couple of pounds after a week of using Mango Pure Cleanse and look forward to this being a staple in my healthy lifestyle choices in the future.</li>

            <li>high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>They clean out your system and you don&#x27;t need to take them for too long before you are all cleaned out.</li>

            <li> One of the very first things I noticed when I started taking Mango Pure Cleanse was that my appetite between meals was not as prevelant.</li>
            <li> That translates into food moving too quickly through your system to do much damage in the calorie category.</li>
            <li> I am actively trying to lose weight, eat right, and exercise for my health, not so the scale will talk nice to me</li>
            <li> Lost 4# the first week of using it.</li>
            <li> I have already dropped 3 pounds the first week and my clothes are feeling looser by the day.</li>
            <li> I am excited to find a natural supplement to help with my weight loss goals!</li>
            <li> I followed it exactly how the bottle stated.</li>
            <li> should try them too ;)</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t believe her</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost 4 lbs in the first week.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product with exercise and a healthy diet - it can only help!</li>
            <li> The first is that I understand the ingredients and how they work.</li>
            <li> Understanding my dietary supplements means I&#x27;m more likely to take them</li>
            <li> I have lost a couple of pounds after a week of using Mango Pure Cleanse and look forward to this being a staple in my healthy lifestyle choices in the future.</li>
            <li> I am positive that the positive change in my diet in addition to taking this Mango pure cleanse is the reason for this.</li>
            <li> I ordered Mango Pure Cleanse to see if this supplement could help curb my appetite.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these Mango Pure Cleanse for a couple of weeks now</li>
            <li> There is pure mango which helps the body trap fat</li>

            <li> When it arrived someone had put a sticker on the instructions which luckily I was able to remove without too much trouble.  </li>

            <li> but I decided to give this a try as I really want to lose weight.</li>
            <li> absolutely did not work at all .</li>

            <li> Thanks to the opportunity that I was give to try this product</li>
            <li> purchased based on the reviews but every body&#x27;s different (right) ;)</li>
            <li> I work out about 4-5 days per week, eat good, drink plenty of water and thought this would help me with those last few pounds.</li>
            <li> I bought this paired with the Carcinia Cambogia which was highly recommended for weight loss and help with supressing the appetite.  </li>
            <li> high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> They clean out your system and you don&#x27;t need to take them for too long before you are all cleaned out.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m very familiar with Little Debbie.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am familiar with a wide range of weightloss products here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> After having 5 children, it has been hard to get back on a good eating and exercise regimen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a month but am very interested to see what next month brings</li>
            <li> same problem with this item as pure garcinia...</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my appetite being less than it was before taking mango pure cleanse.</li>
            <li> I know this isn&#x27;t table talk exactly, but to put it delicately, the pills work well.</li>

            <li> Neither positive nor negative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled because I bought this product in order to stop my bad habit of over eating.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product would really work for other folks.</li>
            <li> I am down a few pounds in just one week actively using this mango pure cleanse.</li>
            <li> Helps you to loose weight, but you go to the bathroom a lot.</li>
            <li> My appetite has gone down (which I&#x27;ve noticed it has done the same for others, too).</li>

            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as I expected</li>
            <li> is not so harsh to where you can actually tell you&#x27;re being cleansed</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to start taking because I didn&#x27;t want to spend all day on the toilet.</li>
            <li> I recently started a new diet and exercise routine but found that I was still eating to the point of uncomfortable fullness.</li>
            <li> I made up my mind to eat better (less bad carbs and things like soda).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about other people but this product is having an effect on me.</li>

            <li> not sure what its suppose to do</li>
            <li> A blast from the past, if ya know what I mean.</li>
            <li> If yours arrives like that it says to take 1 pill twice a day with at least 8 oz of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> No....it made me sick. I followed the instructions carefully... Not worth what I paid!</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product.  Didn&#x27;t do anything it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I bought this paired with the Carcinia Cambogia which was highly recommended for weight loss and help with supressing the appetite.  After 2 1/2 weeks taking it twice a day I do not notice any weight loss nor appetite supressant.  Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what a cleanse should do and it&#x27;s not too strong.Will order again!</li>
            <li> This supplement has a very nasty taste n smell to it and it did not do the job it&#x27;s suppose to do. It was almost like taking a multivitamin vs taking a cleanser with laxative properties in it! It was horrible! Would not buy it again. Would not recommend this at all</li>
            <li> Product was delivered very quickly and in excellent condition. It has worked just as they promised it would. Lost 4# the first week of using it. Also has kept my digestive system working properly, which I was having problems with before.</li>
            <li> Totally worthless. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This supplement effectively boosts energy and suppresses appetite. It is a quick way to speed up metabolism, shed inches, and the natural high quality ingredients makes me feel great!</li>
            <li> After having 5 children, it has been hard to get back on a good eating and exercise regimen. I tend to eat and munch whenever I get the time, which in turn, leads to overeating when I actually do have the time to eat. I recently started a new diet and exercise routine but found that I was still eating to the point of uncomfortable fullness. I ordered Mango Pure Cleanse to see if this supplement could help curb my appetite. After just a few days of taking the Mango Pure Cleanse supplement, I have already noticed a decrease in my appetite! I am &amp;#34;grazing&amp;#34; more, which naturally is helping to boost my metabolism. I have already dropped 3 pounds the first week and my clothes are feeling looser by the day. I am excited to find a natural supplement to help with my weight loss goals!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me at all</li>
            <li> I would love to try this product like others but I&#x27;m a bit skeptical. I was wondering how others got a code to try it for there honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these Mango Pure Cleanse for a couple of weeks now and I feel lighter and I have more energy. I&#x27;ve made it to the gym more often! I have a friend who recommended the mango cleanse and I take their word for all things natural health so when I saw this it was a no brainer to get it. This works great, I think it&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve tried and now I feel ready to get my diet started.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful 100% all natural dietary supplement that contains all of the best weight loss ingredients in one complete supplement. There is pure mango which helps the body trap fat so the body can eliminate it and it is  loaded with B vitamins, which increase the body’s metabolism rate so your body can burn calories faster. It also contains Green Tea Extract, Raspberry Ketones and Acai Berry extract which is full of antioxidants. This really is the perfect balance of pure ingredients to help promote healthy weight loss. Since I have been using this supplement I have lost a total of 15 pounds in 3 weeks. I am absolutely thrilled with the results I am seeing and would absolutely recommend this supplement to anyone who wants to shed those excess pounds. All of the statements contained in this review are true and solely my own opinion. I purchased this product at a slight discount in order to report my results in this review.</li>
            <li> same problem with this item as pure garcinia...</li>
            <li> My appetite was surpressed, but did not lose any weight.  I was drinking 8-10 glasses of water daily and counting calories.  I am so mad at myself for believing the ads related to this product.  Do Not waste your money this does not work as promised.</li>
            <li> I enjoy doing cleanses and was excited to try my first one based on mango.  When it arrived someone had put a sticker on the instructions which luckily I was able to remove without too much trouble.  If yours arrives like that it says to take 1 pill twice a day with at least 8 oz of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tablets are small and therefor easy to swallow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike many I am not taking these for weight loss tho that would be a nice bonus, but for removing toxins and overall health. Just because it&#x27;s a cleanse don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just for your colon, toxins are stored everywhere.  Does it work?  Well I feel better after taking it so I&#x27;m going to say yes.</li>
            <li> One of the very first things I noticed when I started taking Mango Pure Cleanse was that my appetite between meals was not as prevelant. I have also noticed an increase in energy levels throughout my day. I workout in the morning, so when I take a Mango Pure Cleanse after my workout, it aids me in having increased energy throughout my day and makes my days go by without that sluggish mid-afternoon feeling. My pants are not as tight around my waste and I feel like my belly is not so bloated and appears to have lessened in size. I have lost a couple of pounds after a week of using Mango Pure Cleanse and look forward to this being a staple in my healthy lifestyle choices in the future.</li>
            <li> Helps you to loose weight, but you go to the bathroom a lot.</li>
            <li> I did not find this product helpful at all. I need to lose about 8-10lbs. I work out about 4-5 days per week, eat good, drink plenty of water and thought this would help me with those last few pounds. Don&#x27;t waste your money it did nothing that is stated it would do. I followed it exactly how the bottle stated.</li>
            <li> I just started taking it so far I really like it</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as I expected but I wasn&#x27;t completely dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any kind of changes.  Not sure if this product would really work for other folks. I actually&lt;br /&gt;stopped taking them as I didn&#x27;t see any benefit.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order this product on Amazon yet but I will because of the price I ordered online with the Garcinia comp yardage and I&#x27;ve lost 2 1/2 pounds and less than a week have more energy my appetite is gone on the cleanse is not so harsh to where you can actually tell you&#x27;re being cleansed but I&#x27;m losing weight</li>
            <li> I could not take this as it was like taking a diet pill. I could not sleep. I guess I did not expect that as it was all natural, supposedly.</li>
            <li> My husband has taken these and has lost 25 lbs.  so far so good. So I am going to try these now.</li>
            <li> Mango Pure Cleanse is a African mango extract dietary supplement that you won&#x27;t hesitate to try. I&#x27;m about to start losing weight with mango pure cleanse.you should try them too ;)</li>
            <li> Worked great I have a lot of energy. Notice a difference after the second day.</li>
            <li> This product is not what it&#x27;s hyped up to be. A waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Sometimes to help jump start and maintain my weight loss, I take a cleanse to clean out any gunk that may have built up. I know this isn&#x27;t table talk exactly, but to put it delicately, the pills work well. They clean out your system and you don&#x27;t need to take them for too long before you are all cleaned out. The product is natural and has green tea and antioxidants, which is a plus for overall health. I also gave some to a family member who was a bit stopped up, and this worked right away to help remedy that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Month not up so can not tell you how well it works.</li>
            <li> Not doing the job I thought it would.  Wont reorder unless it starts to help me.</li>
            <li> no weight loss. may be helping to lower blood sugars</li>
            <li> Neither positive nor negative.</li>
            <li> I bought Mango Pure Cleanse with the plant to use this product in conjunction with light exercise and a healthy diet. I&#x27;ve been slacking on the exercise part... but my weight keeps going down. I attribute this to my healthy diet, lots of water, and of course 2 tablets per day of my Mango Pure Cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see what my body will look like 30 days from now. I&#x27;ve recommended this to my girlfriends who would love to lose weight quickly and safely.</li>
            <li> The crap sucks. I bought it to help lose weight but I lost nothing. Do not get for weight loss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is doing anything for me</li>
            <li> I am relieved to have found a product that actually WORKS as advertised.</li>
            <li> Save your money,another gimic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product for just over a week and i&#x27;ve noticed my clothes are feeling much looser. I hopped on the scale and am already down 4 lbs from when I started. You WILL lose weight if you take mango pure cleanse regularly.</li>
            <li> I am down a few pounds in just one week actively using this mango pure cleanse. So far this has been worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about weight loss pills but I decided to give this a try as I really want to lose weight. I&#x27;ve made sure to take it exactly as prescribed, twice a day with water. I&#x27;ve even cleaned up my diet and started walking 15 minutes per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M LOSING WEIGHT!!! I&#x27;m so happy about the fact that my plan is working. These pills will work for most of you, in my opinion, but it never hurts to improve the food you eat and add some exercise to the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be reordering until I hit my weight loss goal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a boost in energy and a slight appetite reduction. I am hoping these changes will continue as I use this product more.</li>
            <li> Love it! My metabolism has kicked it up a notch. I&#x27;m more motivated to walk my dog twice a day. The extra energy is an added bonus with this mango.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Stuff works!</li>
            <li> Was Very skeptical about this one! however now I am extremely happy that I have found a couple of products that actually work as advertised, combined with Garcinia Cambogia Extract you will effortlessly see immediate results.</li>
            <li> again no effect to me</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by my friend who lost 14 lbs using Mango Pure CLeanse. At first I didn&#x27;t believe her but the results speak for themselves, she is 14 pounds lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far my experience with mango pure cleanse has been phenomenal. I&#x27;ve lost 4 lbs in the first week.</li>
            <li> I have been taking for almost 3 weeks and have gained weight, with  working out 3-4 days a week and eating fairly good.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased based on the reviews but every body&#x27;s different (right) ;)</li>
            <li> This is a Wonderful Product!!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I&#x27;ve taken Mango Pure Cleanse for almost a week now and feel my appetite has been reduced. I&#x27;m making a point to eat healthy in conjunction with this product. The result so far - down 3 lbs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel this worked for me..  I hope it dose for others.</li>
            <li> great!!!!  arrived on time.</li>
            <li> The cleanse did nothing but make me constipated.  For $39.99 - what a waste of money and disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my appetite being less than it was before taking mango pure cleanse. One of my biggest problems was that I ate too much, even when I was full. I&#x27;m thrilled because I bought this product in order to stop my bad habit of over eating.</li>
            <li> I bought Mango Pure Cleanse with the plan to use this product in conjunction with light exercise and a healthy diet. I plan on sticking to my plans this time around.  It&#x27;s been a little over a week now, and I have lost 10 pounds.  I am hopeful this will stay in the right direction!  I would recommend this product with exercise and a healthy diet - it can only help!</li>
            <li> Just another really good product that works.</li>
            <li> After a week of use my appetite has gone down. I&#x27;m just not as hungry as I used to be. I am sure that my reduced appetite will lead to me dropping some weight. Until I see the weight drop I am giving this 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great product - no jittery side effects.</li>
            <li> I did not loose any weight on these vitamins</li>
            <li> I decided to check out different natural cleanses to add in my weight loss program. When I was offered this Mango cleanse to try for a great deal just to share my honest opinion and experience, I decided to give it a try. I was a little hesitant to start taking because I didn&#x27;t want to spend all day on the toilet. So I followed the directions and took my great tasting and smelling Mango pills with a full glass of water and...waited. What was I waiting for? A blast from the past, if ya know what I mean. But, to my surprise, it never happened like that! So I continued taking for the next couple weeks and, I feel great! Lost a couple pounds and even had more energy!  Not jittery kind of energy, but the kind that you need when you have 4 kids under the age of 8! I definitely recommend  this Mango cleanse to anyone interested in a healthy cleanse!</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t feel the product stood up to the hype.</li>
            <li> Works great with Garcinia Cambogia!</li>
            <li> I took this as directed and yes I fell for the &amp;#34;Miranda Lambert&amp;#34; endorsement (for lack of a better word)&lt;br /&gt;It absolutely did not work at all . Would never buy again.</li>
            <li> I have only been taking for one week.  Have seem a small change but need to be more active.  It&#x27;s cold and wet where I live and I work and come home and huddle under the covers most days.  It will get better as the weather improves.  I will buy again and keep trying it.</li>
            <li> JUNK!!! dont waste your money</li>
            <li> i believe this product worked. i took it with the garcinia crap &amp; gained 15 lbs tho... BUT i think THIS wasnt the issue so this product does its job</li>
            <li> This may work well for some but didn&#x27;t really help me much.</li>
            <li> Bought this with hopes it would do something for me. Did absolutely nothing for me took the whole bottle with no results.would not recommended this product.</li>
            <li> My metabolism has increased and I have more energy throughout the day. This has given me the edge I need in my effort to drop weight in my belly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about other people but this product is having an effect on me. My appetite has gone down (which I&#x27;ve noticed it has done the same for others, too).</li>
            <li> The combination of ingredients in this product make it a good antioxidant and metabolism booster. I&#x27;ve been on a light exercise plan and a strict diet. Feeling great and looking great!</li>
            <li> high quality ingredients. i can really feel it working.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 1 week now and I have noticed the following:&lt;br /&gt;- my appetite isn&#x27;t as voracious as it used to be&lt;br /&gt;- my bowel movements have increased. This is good because it is cleansing my system.&lt;br /&gt;- I am down 3 lbs already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those like me who are serious about losing weight... take it seriously! Drink lots of water and try to exercise as well. It has worked for me so far.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to see any weight loss but I have noticed a difference in my metabolism.</li>
            <li> Weight management is important to me. I am overweight. I am actively trying to lose weight, eat right, and exercise for my health, not so the scale will talk nice to me again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am familiar with a wide range of weightloss products here on Amazon. Some work; some don&#x27;t. I like this one for two reasons. The first is that I understand the ingredients and how they work. Mango, akai, green tea, and pomegranate extracts are the first on the list. I know that, when I digest these in their more traditional forms, I lose weight and feel better. Understanding my dietary supplements means I&#x27;m more likely to take them consistantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second reason I like this product is that I can see results immediately. Let&#x27;s face it - mango is a colon cleanser. That translates into food moving too quickly through your system to do much damage in the calorie category. It also means no intestinal blockages or stomach cramps from digestion. When you take this, you&#x27;ll be lighter by the next day, because your intestines have been scrubbed emptied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bonus to this product is that I don&#x27;t feel as hungry. I go through periods of stress-eating. Yes, I&#x27;m very familiar with Little Debbie. So far, she&#x27;s not been looking so tasty. I&#x27;ve even slowed down on soda pop. When I was at the grocery store yesterday, the mountains of food I walked by did n&#x27;t make me hungry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed by the application of mango in a supplement, and I can&#x27;t wait to buy more!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s only been a month but am very interested to see what next month brings</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say this product was ineffective for me.  It was a waste of $40.</li>
            <li> not sure what its suppose to do</li>
            <li> Did not work but seller did refund money. Product one star seller five stars.</li>
            <li> three plus weeks&lt;br /&gt;The first week I did a fast -- I don&#x27;t recommend it for anyone this is just what I did -- I had amazing results!  I used the Mango Pure Cleanse in addition to MatchaDNA Green Tea and other supplements that I take.  I am so pleased that I had an amazing amount of energy and didn&#x27;t have an appetite! People were rooting me on and telling me they were sure it was hard for me to just not eat but I&#x27;m telling you now, it really was much easier than I thought it would be.  The following week I juiced - Again I don&#x27;t recommend this for anyone this is just what I did.  I drank my juices, ate my supplements and the Mango Pure Cleanse.  I had a great amount of energy, no impulse responses to food and a completely curbed appetite.  Week three I began to incorporate vegetables into my diet while still juicing and taking the Mango Pure Cleanse.  I am in my fourth week and plan to continue juicing during the day for breakfast and lunch and eating a sensible dinner consisting of a piece of fish and a good serving of vegetables.  I have an energy level that I haven&#x27;t had in years &amp; don&#x27;t have interest in snacking.  Thanks to the opportunity that I was give to try this product not only did I have an awesome experience but I did so at a reduced cost.</li>
            <li> Did nothing. Tastes good is the only positive I have to say</li>
            <li> No comment, wife uses for some reason</li>
            <li> I bought this product to find out if it would help me lose weight. I made up my mind to eat better (less bad carbs and things like soda). So far I am down 2.5 lbs after 4 days of use. I am positive that the positive change in my diet in addition to taking this Mango pure cleanse is the reason for this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it contains raspberry ketones which I&#x27;ve seen on tv. I figured mango extract with raspberry ketones should help me drop some pounds. I&#x27;m about a week in, been taking two per day with plenty of water and I&#x27;m feeling great.</li>
            <li> Does NOT work. Took it for a month...Nothing!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say how this product worked on it own because I took it with Garcinia Combogia 76% HCA pure. I had side affects such as really bad headaches and some cramping and a brownish vaginal discharge. I also had some bleeding. Again I don&#x27;t know if it came from the cleans or the Cambogia. However, it did keep me regulated but I go regularly any way. I had to stop taking the product because I had fibroids and my system is still sensitive as to what I put in it. So I stop taking after two days.</li>
            <li> Did not work. Rip off!</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> DIDN&#x27;T CARE FOR IT AT ALL</li>
            <li> Very disappointed! Definetly not a good colon cleanse .</li>
            <li> These supplements so far have proven to be very useful! They are definitely helping with my metabolism and I notice that I seem to look less bloated (gross!) and I feel better. I am happy that it is all natural. I&#x27;m trying to lead a healthier lifestyle and so far Mango Pure Cleanse is a big help.</li>
