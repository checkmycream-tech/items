            <li>I have used better.</li>
            <li>For the price, its okay.</li>
            <li>This is just what happened to me, you may have better luck</li>
            <li>I do all of my designs with polish, (mostly because I&#x27;m stubborn about using acrylic paint)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bough them.</li>
            <li>but the quality is top notch.</li>
            <li>The price is good, shipping is fast and they are very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>they are strong, durable and easy to use!</li>
            <li>An artist is only as strong as her tools, and these brushes are ideal for any nail artist looking to grow with their skills!</li>
            <li>It shipped right away and the package was nice and clean!</li>
            <li>oh and they are easy to clean and don&#x27;t get clumpy!</li>
            <li>I received these brushes very quickly.</li>
            <li>Very, very quick.</li>
            <li>theyre soo easy to use.</li>
            <li>Broke easily</li>
            <li>These nail art liners arrived quick!</li>
            <li>Easy to hold, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>cause I had to try and smooth the bristles together before using on my nails...  </li>
            <li>I have used them several times and they work great.</li>
            <li>: I bought a set of dotting tools from Winstonia at the same price (but with a case!), and the dotting set works great as well.</li>
            <li>So far so good haven&#x27;t used all the sizes yet</li>
            <li>They paint clean lines and are perfect for small detail.</li>
            <li>But i would really recommend these &amp;#60;3 them :)</li>
            <li>Love these brushes, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They are very light but sturdy, work very well and can withstand pure acetone.</li>
            <li>I recieved them quickly, &amp; have enjoyed using them so far just for toe nail art üòç</li>
            <li>The tips don&#x27;t split or fray and paint crisp clean lines.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve previously had to trim brushes to achieve such fine detail, and I loved having a brush that arrived read to complete more detailed designs!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>These are just the right length and thickness for nail art.</li>
            <li>These brushes work great for small details.</li>
            <li>these  small detail brushes  are working great with acrylic model paints ,, the brushes came with some repairs needed to continue use</li>
            <li>Once you remove the cap and touch the bristles, you&#x27;ll feel that they&#x27;re very soft and don&#x27;t feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li>FAST DELIVERY!</li>
            <li>Bristles are too soft they don&#x27;t hold much of a precise design</li>
            <li>After using these brushes multiple times over the past couple weeks, I am very impressed with their durability.</li>
            <li>I will be back for more.</li>
            <li>Item came exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with my purchase.;)</li>
            <li>This product came in really fast!</li>
            <li>love these definitely will buy again!</li>
            <li>The brushes work well and a great for small nail art detailing!</li>
            <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like about then is you have to clean them right away</li>
            <li>easy to use, especially for nail designs.</li>
            <li>so the brushes have to be cleaned in pure acetone.</li>
            <li>Bristles hold up and stand up straight.</li>
            <li>My 9-year old and her friends are having lots of fun using these to do nails from the DIY NailArt book.</li>
            <li>Small, light, easy to handle.</li>
            <li>For the price, not bad, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them personally.  </li>
            <li>I would only want a  little more thickness differentiation instead of same thickness different length though that is nice to.</li>
            <li>There are different sizes so if you don&#x27;t have any nail art brushes and you&#x27;re looking to buy your first set, I highly recommend getting this one!</li>
            <li>These cost a few dollars more than others found on amazon</li>
            <li>I trim my bristles down for a perfect thin lines when making a design.</li>
            <li>Cleaning them with acetone was easy too and didn&#x27;t cause the brushes to get stiff.</li>
            <li>If you decide to buy these, you won&#x27;t really need anything else because it can be used with multiple designs and can even be used as dotting tools.</li>
            <li>The brushes are exactly what I expected.. makes doing nail designs a lot easier.</li>
            <li>I opted to use the brushes over a few weeks to develop a full opinion on them.</li>
            <li>the second time I used these the silver part detached from the black part, I had to super glue them.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a different set of brushed a few months ago that stared falling apart almost right away.</li>

            <li> I purchased a different set of brushed a few months ago that stared falling apart almost right away.</li>
            <li> Not a HUGE fan, they are okay,  I thought they were a bit thick to do what I needed them for..  </li>
            <li> Wish they sold flat head brushes for one stroke nail art</li>
            <li> Dry eased with the quality especially since they are so affordable.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes, they came on the day expected which surprised me because I thought they would come late due to the fact that i ordered them during a holiday season.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using them for a long time.</li>
            <li> but it was a minor inconveiniance , they needed glueing together .</li>
            <li> They were slighty expensive once shipping was added to my total, but the quick arrival made up for the price.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy not like others I have bought that are loose and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> On time and as expected.</li>
            <li> One striper and 4 brushes ranging from small to not much bigger.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to try the other two yet.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes and they arrived less than a week after I ordered them.</li>
            <li> Winstonia never let&#x27;s me down!</li>
            <li> otherwise they&#x27;ll get hard.</li>
            <li> Which is hard to do when your nails are drying.</li>
            <li> and the bristles started to split apart on some that was annoying</li>

            <li> the second time I used these the silver part detached from the black part, I had to super glue them.  Not a HUGE fan, they are okay,  I thought they were a bit thick to do what I needed them for..  and the bristles started to split apart on some that was annoying cause I had to try and smooth the bristles together before using on my nails...  For the price, not bad, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them personally.  Oh and the caps to try and keep the bristles from damage, wouldn&#x27;t stay on all the time and then split so there goes any protection, maybe I got a bum pair?  This is just what happened to me, you may have better luck</li>
            <li> They work like they&#x27;re suppose to. Only thing I don&#x27;t like about then is you have to clean them right away otherwise they&#x27;ll get hard. Which is hard to do when your nails are drying.</li>
            <li> Winstonia never let&#x27;s me down! And i always receive my products before the shipping date!</li>
            <li> The quality was impressive thank you</li>
            <li> i like them they get the job done</li>
            <li> I was trying out the brushes and I accidentky got done on the stick of the brush so I cleaned it off with acetone and the color of the brush removed off .</li>
            <li> So far so good haven&#x27;t used all the sizes yet but I like them. Good quality brushes.</li>
            <li> Have used them a couple of times and am very happy with how great they work. Very sturdy not like others I have bought that are loose and hard to work with. Will order again</li>
            <li> An artist is only as strong as her tools, and these brushes are ideal for any nail artist looking to grow with their skills! I opted to use the brushes over a few weeks to develop a full opinion on them. After using these brushes multiple times over the past couple weeks, I am very impressed with their durability. I do all of my designs with polish, (mostly because I&#x27;m stubborn about using acrylic paint) so the brushes have to be cleaned in pure acetone. They have maintained their shape nicely, and don&#x27;t seem to have been immediately deteriorated by the acetone.  I&#x27;ve previously had to trim brushes to achieve such fine detail, and I loved having a brush that arrived read to complete more detailed designs! I look forward to using them for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them twice or three times and I really liked them. They aren&#x27;t the easiest thing but practice makes perfect. I would only want a  little more thickness differentiation instead of same thickness different length though that is nice to.</li>
            <li> Great for removing nail polish that got on your skin/cuticles! I was hoping for a smaller one for more detailing but this are great and an awesome price!</li>
            <li> I have used these brushes twice and I love them! I would buy them again if I had to. I even recommend them.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes very quickly. They paint clean lines and are perfect for small detail. The bristles don&#x27;t clump up either which is a plus. Cleaning them with acetone was easy too and didn&#x27;t cause the brushes to get stiff. I definitely recommend these for any nail art enthusiast! -Ruth of Instagram&#x27;s @RuthsNailArt</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping! The brushes are just as described and will work perfectly to do nail art!</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes and they arrived less than a week after I ordered them. They were slighty expensive once shipping was added to my total, but the quick arrival made up for the price. The brushes work well and a great for small nail art detailing!</li>
            <li> These brushes work great for small details.</li>
            <li> Thats perfect for the proce really good my wife is happy</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and brushes look good! Can&#x27;t wait to use them</li>
            <li> These nail art liners arrived quick! Very, very quick. I&#x27;ll be using them and I&#x27;m glad I bough them. Thank you.</li>
            <li> They are nice brushes. The striping brush is kinda crappy though in my opinion. The rest are amazing though</li>
            <li> These are ok brushes to work with!</li>
            <li> The brushes come in a plastic container and the bristles were covered in a plastic cap for protection. Once you remove the cap and touch the bristles, you&#x27;ll feel that they&#x27;re very soft and don&#x27;t feel cheap at all. They are very light but sturdy, work very well and can withstand pure acetone. There are different sizes so if you don&#x27;t have any nail art brushes and you&#x27;re looking to buy your first set, I highly recommend getting this one! The price is good, shipping is fast and they are very easy to use.  If you decide to buy these, you won&#x27;t really need anything else because it can be used with multiple designs and can even be used as dotting tools. Check out my blog to see the different nail art looks I&#x27;ve done using these brushes at http://ramydoesnails.blogspot.com If you look at the floral nails I did, all the dots were made using these brushes. They&#x27;re just so versatile and can be used to do anything! Definitely worth it. On my review, you&#x27;ll also see how I take care of these brushes!</li>
            <li> these brushes are amazing!!!! they came in perfect condition! theyre soo easy to use. they came 3 days after i placed the order. i tots recommend these!!!! great buy and you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and in perfect condition. One striper and 4 brushes ranging from small to not much bigger. These cost a few dollars more than others found on amazon but the quality is top notch. I have used them several times and they work great. i will be buying again from Winstonia. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also: I bought a set of dotting tools from Winstonia at the same price (but with a case!), and the dotting set works great as well.</li>
            <li> I am an artist and use this brushes all the time.  they tend to get out of shape with what I paint with that is why I order so many,&lt;br /&gt;but they are the prefect size for details.  I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> These are awesome brushes easy to use &amp; I am a beginner!! I got them along with the something blue brush set from winstonia &amp; am. Dry eased with the quality especially since they are so affordable. However I am a beginner &amp; not a licensed cosmetologist so you Mary not feel the same way I do. I recieved them quickly, &amp; have enjoyed using them so far just for toe nail art üòç</li>
            <li> Simple set of 5 brushes. That&#x27;s all I needed. They work great and are good quality. They sent them out the same day I ordered.  I would buy from this company again!</li>

            <li> Item came exactly as described. Nice brushes and I&#x27;m sure they will do the job</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use most of these brushes, but the shortest one is awesome for my leopard print nail designs.  The longest one is perfect for lines.  The delivery was on time and the price was perfect.  I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> The brushes are exactly what I expected.. makes doing nail designs a lot easier. Overall I am pleased with my purchase.;)</li>
            <li> The striper works great, as does the second-largest brush, but the bristles of the smallest brush are pushing up into the brush casing. I haven&#x27;t had the chance to try the other two yet.</li>
            <li> It shipped right away and the package was nice and clean! Wonderful.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and are perfect for nail designs. They are just what I needed.</li>
