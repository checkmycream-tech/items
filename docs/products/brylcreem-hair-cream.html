            <li>For many years i searched for something like this product without being successful.</li>
            <li>And, because more than a year has passed, I have no recourse!</li>
            <li>This is really a nice cream.</li>
            <li>an oldie but goodie when you want that kind of look.</li>
            <li>makes my hair look great, manageable, nice and clean.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty great.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for more than 5 years</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since 1972 ----Love this stuff -</li>
            <li>I used hairspray for a number of years, and after using Brylcreem for three days I can tell that my hair feels more moisturized and healthy even when I don&#x27;t have any product in it.</li>
            <li>And come back to the best product in the men&#x27;s hair styling world ever.</li>
            <li>i love this product because it is not too greasy</li>
            <li>we all love brylcreem.</li>
            <li>Been using this for maybe 35 years or more.</li>
            <li>not at all greasy, and better than any rinse I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I used to love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I usually top it off with some pomade</li>
            <li>THEY HAVE  THINNED IT OUT &amp; ADDED MORE WATER ,</li>
            <li>, THE ORIGANAL WAS MOSTLY</li>
            <li>IT WAS MUCH BETTER ,</li>
            <li>As a kid I used brylcreem and beleive it or not it is still one of the best I have found 20 year later.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>this one surprisingly more effectve.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using this for the last year and it is wonderful!</li>
            <li>I probably have to use more than most people</li>
            <li>Lo, through these many years armies of would be competitors have stepped into the fray and today are gone, unmourned and unremembered.  </li>
            <li>Love the stuff.</li>
            <li>If products died of old age this venerable great, great, great Granddaddy  of a product would be long gone.  </li>
            <li>It holds my hair in place, re-combs well, smells great, washes out easily, leaves my hair soft with a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>It does not contain lanolin, and does not condition your hair as the original did!</li>
            <li>In fact I had a rather large mohawk for a couple of years and it would stand my hair up a good six inches.    </li>
            <li>Thanks for a good product.</li>
            <li>If you just use a dime or quarter sized amount, rub it into your hands, then run it through your hair, you can style your hair easily.</li>
            <li>Found it easy to use.</li>
            <li>Sometimes they did that before, but this product makes it easy to arrive hair-and-makeup-ready when you arrive to set.  </li>
            <li>The best stuff is always from other eras, I must declare!</li>
            <li>Smells nice, goes on very smooth, holds hair in place, but the hair remains soft and malleable.</li>
            <li>the tube is huge.</li>
            <li>The cream is great for short and medium length hair.</li>
            <li>Just get some, and at this price it&#x27;s almost like buy 2 get one free.</li>
            <li>It is not the original brylcreem.</li>
            <li>Excited as I was to try the product, I tested it out immediately.</li>
            <li>I use Brylcreem Hair Groom, Original at age of 18.  </li>
            <li>Personally I am looking beyond the price as this is the best product I have used so far.</li>
            <li>It makes me hair feel very soft and gives it some shine which i think looks nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was a good buy, about 15% cheaper than I find it locally.  </li>
            <li>Not for everyone, I know; but good stuff all the same.</li>
            <li>The first one was fine.</li>
            <li>My husband uses just a little and it keeps his hair beautifully groomed and sweet-smelling.</li>
            <li>After reading such good reviews, I held very high expectations for this product.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a very light, clean smell that is not detectable about an hour later.</li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t the &#x27;original&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I think it a bit pricey--at that level of cost it should also do a good job on your other end and cure hemorrhoids.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I&#x27;ve used that holds my hair in place without making it crispy.</li>
            <li>and they use it consistently.  </li>
            <li>yeah- just like the jingle) into my hair after spreading it on my palms first.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast too!</li>
            <li>Have used it for more then ten years.</li>
            <li>A little dab will still do ya as it don&#x27;t take much to cover your hair and look good.  </li>
            <li>I thought the 3 pack was too much, but I went through my first tube in a month.  </li>
            <li>stuff, smells like you&#x27;d imagine old fashion hair product would smell (barbershop-y, not bad but</li>
            <li>The cream dries quickly and your hair feels soft, but manageable.</li>
            <li>as opposed to blow dry without it when it flies all over the place with static and the wind.</li>
            <li>so I will add that this product mot only does a fine job, but it does not leave your hair at all greasy.  </li>
            <li>Since its not available in Taiwan, I have to purchase it from Great Britain in earlier years then from USA.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I also thought it would be very greasy-feeling in my hair.</li>
            <li>It can be if you use way too much.</li>
            <li>I dont&#x27; know if I&#x27;ll ever use this much brylcream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I shampoo with regular cheap shampoo, and then work just a dab (</li>
            <li>Much quicker and easier too.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair nice and fluffy, yet controllable-</li>
            <li>Never mind the packaging - this is the original BrylCreem, with the same texture, scent, etc.  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to get this at the grocery store by my house, but apparently I was the only one who bought it</li>
            <li>Sometimes the oils separate in the tube, and a thinner, clear oil comes out with the higher viscosity stuff.</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;greasy kid stuff\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t &#x27;cool&#x27; anymore and went back to it after about three years</li>
            <li>/&gt;i use a lot less brylcreem for much better results.  </li>
            <li>Next time, I&#x27;ll be sure to open and check before the exchange/return period has expired.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it in wet hair out of the shower and my hair remains shiny, soft and healthy looking all day.</li>
            <li>A little more</li>
            <li>Brylcream&#x27;s \\&quot;A little dab&#x27;ll do ya\\&quot; actually does it and here it is, alive and in good health.  </li>
            <li>Buying this product being a set of three is completely worth it because i will definitely use them all.</li>
            <li>I will be looking for a new product.</li>
            <li>It just smells clean, almost like a hair solon smells, minus the hair spray.</li>
            <li>An added bonus is that I can even run a comb thru it in the middle of the day and it looks like I&#x27;ve just styled it the first time.  </li>
            <li>medium light hold, it brings down the volume on my husband&#x27;s puffy hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a thick head of fine, straight hair</li>
            <li>It keeps my medium length hair under control better than gel without the sticky, flaking hard hat</li>
            <li>Im a very low maintenance person but found my hair being very demanding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 years old</li>
            <li>Man, I&#x27;m old.</li>
            <li>wish i was younger or had a thicker head of hair to really get the benefits i used to get from it when i was 16 and not ......</li>
            <li>Not quite fragrance free, but a subtle barbar shop type aroma- hardly detectable, but nice.</li>
            <li>The only people that know about it are Baby Boomers and those who are older.  </li>
            <li>THANK GOD I have thick full hair and BRYLCREEM really works for me, I have been using it for years now</li>
            <li>Brylcreem did it right for this product to Still be hanging in there with all the hundreds of other hair products on todays market.  </li>
            <li>(The normal color is white.)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the rock hard hair thing that occurs with other products such as hair spray and gel and this is a good alternative.</li>
            <li>Both appear to be very old or, possibly, have been exposed to heat.</li>
            <li>and when you run a hand through my hair, you can&#x27;t tell I have anything in it, which is generally the way I like it.  </li>
            <li>you want an old school look or just basic hold this stuff works.</li>
            <li>I only use a little tiny dab, smaller than a dime, and I smooth it throughout</li>
            <li>I will definetly get more of this when I run out, but I probably won&#x27;t run out for a long time because of the very small amount of product that it takes to do my hair.  </li>
            <li>Now, a little secret for you:  When I&#x27;m going out in a suit with my lady, and my hair has to look nice and stay nice, I&#x27;ll mix a little bit of this with a little bit of Murray&#x27;s pomade in the palm of my hand and work that through my hair.  </li>
            <li>have wavy hair that no product yet discovered can get to lay completely flat and dry straight, but this assists with taming it.  </li>
            <li>I can barely detect it 15 mins later.</li>
            <li>A little dab has been doing him as long as I can recall, which is more than half a century.</li>
            <li>usually use a little more than a dab, but that&#x27;s because I have longer hair.  </li>
            <li>a little dab will really do ya</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair and have tried different hair products.  </li>

            <li> I dont&#x27; know if I&#x27;ll ever use this much brylcream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shampoo with regular cheap shampoo, and then work just a dab (</li>
            <li> Much quicker and easier too.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair nice and fluffy, yet controllable-</li>
            <li> Never mind the packaging - this is the original BrylCreem, with the same texture, scent, etc.  </li>
            <li> I used to be able to get this at the grocery store by my house, but apparently I was the only one who bought it</li>
            <li> Sometimes the oils separate in the tube, and a thinner, clear oil comes out with the higher viscosity stuff.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;greasy kid stuff\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t &#x27;cool&#x27; anymore and went back to it after about three years</li>
            <li> /&gt;i use a lot less brylcreem for much better results.  </li>
            <li> Next time, I&#x27;ll be sure to open and check before the exchange/return period has expired.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it in wet hair out of the shower and my hair remains shiny, soft and healthy looking all day.</li>
            <li> A little more</li>
            <li> Brylcream&#x27;s \\&quot;A little dab&#x27;ll do ya\\&quot; actually does it and here it is, alive and in good health.  </li>
            <li> Buying this product being a set of three is completely worth it because i will definitely use them all.</li>
            <li> I will be looking for a new product.</li>
            <li> It just smells clean, almost like a hair solon smells, minus the hair spray.</li>
            <li> An added bonus is that I can even run a comb thru it in the middle of the day and it looks like I&#x27;ve just styled it the first time.  </li>
            <li> medium light hold, it brings down the volume on my husband&#x27;s puffy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a thick head of fine, straight hair</li>
            <li> It keeps my medium length hair under control better than gel without the sticky, flaking hard hat</li>
            <li> Im a very low maintenance person but found my hair being very demanding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old</li>
            <li> Man, I&#x27;m old.</li>
            <li> wish i was younger or had a thicker head of hair to really get the benefits i used to get from it when i was 16 and not ......</li>
            <li> Not quite fragrance free, but a subtle barbar shop type aroma- hardly detectable, but nice.</li>
            <li> The only people that know about it are Baby Boomers and those who are older.  </li>
            <li> THANK GOD I have thick full hair and BRYLCREEM really works for me, I have been using it for years now</li>
            <li> Brylcreem did it right for this product to Still be hanging in there with all the hundreds of other hair products on todays market.  </li>
            <li> (The normal color is white.)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the rock hard hair thing that occurs with other products such as hair spray and gel and this is a good alternative.</li>
            <li> Both appear to be very old or, possibly, have been exposed to heat.</li>
            <li> and when you run a hand through my hair, you can&#x27;t tell I have anything in it, which is generally the way I like it.  </li>
            <li> you want an old school look or just basic hold this stuff works.</li>
            <li> I only use a little tiny dab, smaller than a dime, and I smooth it throughout</li>
            <li> I will definetly get more of this when I run out, but I probably won&#x27;t run out for a long time because of the very small amount of product that it takes to do my hair.  </li>
            <li> Now, a little secret for you:  When I&#x27;m going out in a suit with my lady, and my hair has to look nice and stay nice, I&#x27;ll mix a little bit of this with a little bit of Murray&#x27;s pomade in the palm of my hand and work that through my hair.  </li>
            <li> have wavy hair that no product yet discovered can get to lay completely flat and dry straight, but this assists with taming it.  </li>
            <li> I can barely detect it 15 mins later.</li>
            <li> A little dab has been doing him as long as I can recall, which is more than half a century.</li>
            <li> usually use a little more than a dab, but that&#x27;s because I have longer hair.  </li>
            <li> a little dab will really do ya</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair and have tried different hair products.  </li>
            <li> New formulation is watered down and does not work as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched from hair gel to brylcreem and man, I wonder why I took so long to try it.  </li>
            <li> is my new everyday grooming product.</li>
            <li> Looking for that Gas Monkey Garage Richard Rawlings look?  </li>
            <li> Within the last two weeks, I&#x27;ve opened the other two.</li>
            <li> and it allows my husband to do the sexy hair style on Mad Men.</li>
            <li> then blow dry.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry his hair out.</li>
            <li> I use a small, almond-sized amount and apply it directly to my damp hair after a shower.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt matter if I run my hands through it, It doesnt get flaky or loose its hold.  </li>
            <li> Instead of holding my hair in place, the hair product unfortunately left my hair flipping down.</li>
            <li> It used to be in all the drugstores and grocery stores 20 years ago, but now is hard to find, and more expensive, but a 3 pack will last me at probably 4+ years, so the cost is not really a factor.  </li>
            <li> PLUS, the pack of three was half of what it would have cost for one tube locally.</li>
            <li> and they only mess up my hair but BRYLCREEM</li>
            <li> It keeps it soft all day long and doesn&#x27;t make it stick or hard as other gels</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how such a small portion of this cream will allow me to sexify my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Now, it doesn&#x27;t let you sculpt your hair like palmade would or other similar products</li>
            <li> So a little dab will do you, use only if you dare,does not appliy</li>
            <li> I wanted a wet look for all day and thought that this would do it but regrettably this is not what it used to be.</li>
            <li> The slick gangster look requires you really lay it on thick-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had short hair for the past couple decades.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy and almost curly hair and use this to slick back my hair.</li>
            <li> Right now my hair is semi-slicked back with a little bit of volume (undercut), which would have been impossible for me to do before Brylcreem.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from dry scalp and also my hair is very  thick and coarse.</li>
            <li> CHANGED THE TUBE TO BLACK ,UGH</li>
            <li> I use a half a dab.</li>
            <li> But for some reason, they decided to mess with perfection.</li>
            <li> Not the dry, crispy feeling I had using hairspray, and with Brylcreem you don&#x27;t get hard hair.</li>
            <li> Brylcreem, a little dab will do you,  You&#x27;ll look so debonair.  </li>
            <li> I can also tend to get dandruff in colder weather and just the little bit of oil in Brylcreem seems to help my scalp from drying out.  </li>
            <li> If you want to go a little thicker on the Murray&#x27;s you can go all the way to full-greaser.  </li>
            <li> As the slogan goes, a little dab&#x27;ll do ya.</li>
            <li> A little dab has done it for me.</li>
            <li> I suspected it to be only for the slick-back, wet look, and found this to be wrong.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the only game in town.</li>
            <li> Just remember a little dab will do ya!</li>
            <li> I use a small amount of this which keeps my hair shiny throughout the day but not crunchy, then combine it with a pomade for styling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not leave yiur hair hard and stiff as some sprays do.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s now hard to find Vaseline hair tonic anywhere</li>
            <li> i got this for my uncle he said it was hard to find where he lives and he has been using it for over 50 years</li>
            <li> While it grows past that annoying stage when you can&#x27;t do anything with it, this product gives it the extra weight to lay down, and not look a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they all will go to waste.</li>
            <li> the items was outdated</li>
            <li> I think I remembered it wrong from when my Dad used to use it</li>
            <li> I hate that crispy feeling, but if I don&#x27;t use anything on my medium-short hair, it get&#x27;s all fluffy.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they did not meet my standards.</li>
            <li> It looked as though I had merely put grease in my hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fake at all</li>
            <li> Hate to say it, I&#x27;m a square.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is really a nice cream. I have been using this cream for more than 5 years and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since 1972 ----Love this stuff -</li>
            <li> Brylcreem works great if your hair gets messed up at the gym. I box at my local gym and after my routine my hair looks like i was in a fight. I comb my hair with my fingers can&#x27;t do that with hair spray or gel.</li>
            <li> When I heard about Brylcreem (I&#x27;m in my 30s) I suspected it to be only for the slick-back, wet look, and found this to be wrong. I also thought it would be very greasy-feeling in my hair. It can be if you use way too much. If you just use a dime or quarter sized amount, rub it into your hands, then run it through your hair, you can style your hair easily. The cream dries quickly and your hair feels soft, but manageable. The cream has no alcohol, and I can tell the difference. I used hairspray for a number of years, and after using Brylcreem for three days I can tell that my hair feels more moisturized and healthy even when I don&#x27;t have any product in it. Not the dry, crispy feeling I had using hairspray, and with Brylcreem you don&#x27;t get hard hair. The fragrance is a very light, clean smell that is not detectable about an hour later. I can barely detect it 15 mins later. The cream is great for short and medium length hair. I&#x27;ve tossed the hairspray and Brylcreem is my new everyday grooming product.</li>
            <li> Brylcreem, a little dab will do you,  You&#x27;ll look so debonair.  Brylcreem, the girls will all pursue you.  They&#x27;ll love to run their fingers through your hair!</li>
            <li> If you go for that new-fangled stuff, just stop. And come back to the best product in the men&#x27;s hair styling world ever.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I&#x27;ve used that holds my hair in place without making it crispy. An added bonus is that I can even run a comb thru it in the middle of the day and it looks like I&#x27;ve just styled it the first time.  I will definetly get more of this when I run out, but I probably won&#x27;t run out for a long time because of the very small amount of product that it takes to do my hair.  I think this stuff smells great.  Sometimes I run my hand over my hair and then smell it.  I hope nobody notices.  (Edit: Running out now. 5.5 oz tube lasted just over four months of daily use for me.)</li>
            <li> It is not the original brylcreem. It does not contain lanolin, and does not condition your hair as the original did!</li>
            <li> Dad uses it every day</li>
            <li> I dont&#x27; know if I&#x27;ll ever use this much brylcream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff, smells like you&#x27;d imagine old fashion hair product would smell (barbershop-y, not bad but sort of sterile)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy hair that no product yet discovered can get to lay completely flat and dry straight, but this assists with taming it.  I use a small amount of this which keeps my hair shiny throughout the day but not crunchy, then combine it with a pomade for styling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched from hair gel to brylcreem and man, I wonder why I took so long to try it.  I think I remembered it wrong from when my Dad used to use it but boy, what a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use a lot less brylcreem for much better results.  I use a small, almond-sized amount and apply it directly to my damp hair after a shower.  It keeps my medium length hair under control better than gel without the sticky, flaking hard hat that gel results in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a good buy, about 15% cheaper than I find it locally.  Packaged well, shipped on time.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> i love this product because it is not too greasy but it is just enough to hold your hair in place.  my father and brother likes it as well and they use it consistently.  we all love brylcreem.</li>
            <li> For many years i searched for something like this product without being successful. Im a very low maintenance person but found my hair being very demanding. I suffer from dry scalp and also my hair is very  thick and coarse. I put brylcreem in my hair after i take a shower and style it how i want and it will stay like that for two days sometimes. Buying this product being a set of three is completely worth it because i will definitely use them all. It makes me hair feel very soft and gives it some shine which i think looks nice. The scent of it smells good in my opinion, but may be \\&quot;too girly\\&quot; for some people. It just smells clean, almost like a hair solon smells, minus the hair spray.</li>
            <li> I being using for the last 20years and not going change to something I don&#x27;t want. I am used to this hair cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how such a small portion of this cream will allow me to sexify my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Now, it doesn&#x27;t let you sculpt your hair like palmade would or other similar products but it is a simple hair product to just throw in and get the job done.</li>
            <li> Never mind the packaging - this is the original BrylCreem, with the same texture, scent, etc.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy if you like Brylcreem!  My husband uses just a little and it keeps his hair beautifully groomed and sweet-smelling.</li>
            <li> Been using this for maybe 35 years or more. I shampoo with regular cheap shampoo, and then work just a dab (yeah- just like the jingle) into my hair after spreading it on my palms first. then blow dry. Leaves my hair nice and fluffy, yet controllable- as opposed to blow dry without it when it flies all over the place with static and the wind. It&#x27;s a great conditioner- not at all greasy, and better than any rinse I&#x27;ve tried. Much quicker and easier too. Not quite fragrance free, but a subtle barbar shop type aroma- hardly detectable, but nice. It used to be in all the drugstores and grocery stores 20 years ago, but now is hard to find, and more expensive, but a 3 pack will last me at probably 4+ years, so the cost is not really a factor.  The slick gangster look requires you really lay it on thick- and that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s it&#x27;s about.</li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t the &#x27;original&#x27;. Diluted with water.  So a little dab will do you, use only if you dare,does not appliy</li>
            <li> I used to love this stuff. But for some reason, they decided to mess with perfection. New formulation is watered down and does not work as well. I will be looking for a new product. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> perfect hair dressing cream which is light and non greasy .smells great as well .have been using brylcreem for years now and haven&#x27;t found a suitable substitute yet !</li>
            <li> Well I can see why this has been used for years, it works great. There are some things you just cannot improve on! Just remember a little dab will do ya!</li>
            <li> I have hair that poofs out, especially after the shower or during physical activities.  Brylcreem tames my hair so I can style it ANY way I want to.  It&#x27;s a great conditioner and allows me to finger comb my hair at any time since it doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;hard\\&quot; gel like feel.  Right now my hair is semi-slicked back with a little bit of volume (undercut), which would have been impossible for me to do before Brylcreem.  I usually top it off with some pomade and I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use a little more than a dab, but that&#x27;s because I have longer hair.  Just get some, and at this price it&#x27;s almost like buy 2 get one free.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS PROD. FOR 40 YRS. UNTILL THIS YR. THEY HAVE  THINNED IT OUT &amp; ADDED MORE WATER ,CHANGED THE TUBE TO BLACK ,UGH, THE ORIGANAL WAS MOSTLY LANINAL IT WAS MUCH BETTER ,BUT YOU KNOW MANUFATURERS MONEY IN THE BOTTOM LINE</li>
            <li> THANK GOD I have thick full hair and BRYLCREEM really works for me, I have been using it for years now and I am very satisfied with this product. Before BRYLCREEM I used Vaseline hair tonic by Suave but they stopped making it years ago and it&#x27;s now hard to find Vaseline hair tonic anywhere and then I discovered BRYLCREEM and never looked back! I have tried all kinds of gels and stuff and they only mess up my hair but BRYLCREEM makes my hair look great, manageable, nice and clean. I used to buy this at VONS store here at the Culver City branch in Los Angeles but that store does not carry it any more, I wonder why, maybe it&#x27;s expensive. Personally I am looking beyond the price as this is the best product I have used so far.</li>
            <li> As a kid I used brylcreem and beleive it or not it is still one of the best I have found 20 year later. I can buy this at the local drug  store, but why drive there if you can have it delivered, PLUS, the pack of three was half of what it would have cost for one tube locally. If you havent tried it, you should. Brylcreem did it right for this product to Still be hanging in there with all the hundreds of other hair products on todays market.  Delivery was fast too!</li>
            <li> I purchased a pack of three tubes in May 2013. The first one was fine. Within the last two weeks, I&#x27;ve opened the other two. Both appear to be very old or, possibly, have been exposed to heat. The symptoms are an oil has separated from the cream and both are yellow. (The normal color is white.) And, because more than a year has passed, I have no recourse! Next time, I&#x27;ll be sure to open and check before the exchange/return period has expired.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old and I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about eight years.  I hate that crispy feeling, but if I don&#x27;t use anything on my medium-short hair, it get&#x27;s all fluffy.  I&#x27;ve got a thick head of fine, straight hair and I need to put something in it.  This stuff is perfect.  I only use a little tiny dab, smaller than a dime, and I smooth it throughout and when you run a hand through my hair, you can&#x27;t tell I have anything in it, which is generally the way I like it.  I can also tend to get dandruff in colder weather and just the little bit of oil in Brylcreem seems to help my scalp from drying out.  I used to be able to get this at the grocery store by my house, but apparently I was the only one who bought it so they stopped carrying it.      Now, a little secret for you:  When I&#x27;m going out in a suit with my lady, and my hair has to look nice and stay nice, I&#x27;ll mix a little bit of this with a little bit of Murray&#x27;s pomade in the palm of my hand and work that through my hair.  If you want to go a little thicker on the Murray&#x27;s you can go all the way to full-greaser.  In fact I had a rather large mohawk for a couple of years and it would stand my hair up a good six inches.    The way I use it, this stuff lasts forever.  The three pack I just ordered will last me about a year, and I don&#x27;t go a day without it.</li>
            <li> Looking for that Gas Monkey Garage Richard Rawlings look?  This can do it for you!  I love this stuff.  Doesnt matter if I run my hands through it, It doesnt get flaky or loose its hold.  I thought the 3 pack was too much, but I went through my first tube in a month.  I wont ever go back to gel!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I am a younger male so I believe I am the only person I know who actually uses Brylcreem.  The only people that know about it are Baby Boomers and those who are older.  The lady loves the smell as well and I get asked what products I use for my hair.</li>
            <li> good, use it all the time</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty great. Smells nice, goes on very smooth, holds hair in place, but the hair remains soft and malleable. I don&#x27;t like the rock hard hair thing that occurs with other products such as hair spray and gel and this is a good alternative. As the slogan goes, a little dab&#x27;ll do ya. I&#x27;ve been using it in wet hair out of the shower and my hair remains shiny, soft and healthy looking all day. Not to mention.. the tube is huge. You get a lot of product for the price you pay. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> i got this for my uncle he said it was hard to find where he lives and he has been using it for over 50 years</li>
            <li> After reading such good reviews, I held very high expectations for this product. Unfortunately, they did not meet my standards. Excited as I was to try the product, I tested it out immediately. Instead of holding my hair in place, the hair product unfortunately left my hair flipping down. It looked as though I had merely put grease in my hair. I wish I had not chosen to buy a pack of three. Unfortunately they all will go to waste.</li>
            <li> Have used it for more then ten years. I think it is the best.&lt;br /&gt;It does not leave yiur hair hard and stiff as some sprays do.</li>
            <li> Found it easy to use. I was using a different product but found  this one surprisingly more effectve. A little dab has done it for me.</li>
            <li> I wanted a wet look for all day and thought that this would do it but regrettably this is not what it used to be.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for the last year and it is wonderful! It doesn&#x27;t fake at all and it allows my husband to do the sexy hair style on Mad Men. It smells wonderful (not overpowering at all!) and it doesn&#x27;t dry his hair out. medium light hold, it brings down the volume on my husband&#x27;s puffy hair. Great product. Ladies, get this for your man!</li>
            <li> the items was outdated</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had short hair for the past couple decades. I&#x27;ve been Brylcreem since I decided to let my inner hippie out. While it grows past that annoying stage when you can&#x27;t do anything with it, this product gives it the extra weight to lay down, and not look a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is wonderful stuff. Sometimes the oils separate in the tube, and a thinner, clear oil comes out with the higher viscosity stuff. Just rub it between your hands to mix it before applying it to your hair, if it concerns you.</li>
            <li> I use Brylcreem Hair Groom, Original at age of 18.  I&#x27;m 78 this year. Since its not available in Taiwan, I have to purchase it from Great Britain in earlier years then from USA. A great product!</li>
            <li> amzon send this item to quick,and it is the correct item just as I want, I use it every day, it make me look good.</li>
            <li> The title says almost everything there is to be said but I am required to use twenty words so I will add that this product mot only does a fine job, but it does not leave your hair at all greasy.  I think it a bit pricey--at that level of cost it should also do a good job on your other end and cure hemorrhoids.  But it doesn&#x27;t..</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair and have tried different hair products.  This one holds the hair without a greasy feel- I use a half a dab. The price is perfect</li>
            <li> Greed. .Added water to formula. Thank you very much but I have plenty of water here if I need it.</li>
            <li> A little dab has been doing him as long as I can recall, which is more than half a century. Man, I&#x27;m old. I remember the commercials during Mets baseball games. I can&#x27;t believe they still sell this stuff.</li>
            <li> a little dab will really do ya&lt;br /&gt;its an oldie but goodie when you want that kind of look. wish i was younger or had a thicker head of hair to really get the benefits i used to get from it when i was 16 and not ......</li>
            <li> I will probably never use another hair product again. I have thick, coarse, wavy and almost curly hair and use this to slick back my hair. Works like a charm. I probably have to use more than most people but hey it works and keeps my hair looking good</li>
            <li> If products died of old age this venerable great, great, great Granddaddy  of a product would be long gone.  Lo, through these many years armies of would be competitors have stepped into the fray and today are gone, unmourned and unremembered.  Brylcream&#x27;s \\&quot;A little dab&#x27;ll do ya\\&quot; actually does it and here it is, alive and in good health.  A bit overpriced I think, but it&#x27;s the only game in town.</li>
            <li> Brylcreem is a good product.  I work as an actor in NYC and noticed that the hair department uses this, especially with period piece movies.  I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t turn your head into a sticky shell.  I&#x27;ve been using and the hair department, when they look at me, says &amp;#34;You look great, you&#x27;re fine.&amp;#34;  Sometimes they did that before, but this product makes it easy to arrive hair-and-makeup-ready when you arrive to set.  Thanks for a good product.</li>
            <li> The order arrived in one week. It is a product which I am using for the last 60 [sixty] years!</li>
            <li> Hate to say it, I&#x27;m a square.  It works for me.</li>
            <li> Brylcreen Hair Groom started in 1927.  I was born in 1928 but did not start using it until 1944.  Have been using it ever since.  Try it!!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of hair cream and this is the only one that works well for my hair. It keeps it soft all day long and doesn&#x27;t make it stick or hard as other gels</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Upgrade from the Crew Pomade! The best stuff is always from other eras, I must declare! A Pack of 3 is definitely a bargain!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Brylcreem since 1966 except during the brief time the \\&quot;greasy kid stuff\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t &#x27;cool&#x27; anymore and went back to it after about three years and I&#x27;ll never change.  It holds my hair in place, re-combs well, smells great, washes out easily, leaves my hair soft with a nice shine.  Love the stuff. A little dab will still do ya as it don&#x27;t take much to cover your hair and look good.  A little more and it&#x27;s almost like pomade or brilliantine. Weather you want an old school look or just basic hold this stuff works. Not for everyone, I know; but good stuff all the same.</li>
