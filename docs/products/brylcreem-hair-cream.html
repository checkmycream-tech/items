            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li>Was good for styling my husband&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>still good as ever.</li>
            <li>Feel good.</li>
            <li>The scent is good, and it does just want I ask of it - takes fly-aways out and provides a sheen to the hair.</li>
            <li>That reason is that Brylcreem is, quite simply, the best of the best!</li>
            <li>Some things never go out o style, and this is one of those iconic products that people remember from the glory days of America, these products are the backbone of what makes America great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good and smell nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!        </li>
            <li>and this is my favorite hair product!</li>
            <li>For me, much better solution than hair gel!</li>
            <li>We figure that they&#x27;re still there because seniors, who grew up using products like these, tend to be incredibly brand loyal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, works like a charm, and has a great musky, powdery barbershop scent.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>but I kind of dig it</li>
            <li>and I can say with absolute confidence that it&#x27;s the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I used it years ago and liked it then.</li>
            <li>So I bought one to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: as good or better than Kiehl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Honestly, till searching I never even heard of Brylcreem and looked at the reviews and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>Nice to know they still make this stuff.</li>
            <li>An excellent classic product.</li>
            <li>The new packaging is also very attractive.</li>
            <li>Very strong old-man type of smell</li>
            <li>This is my son&#x27;s favorite styling cream ands we&#x27;ve tried many!</li>
            <li>And indeed, Brylcreem has the reputation of being a greasy, sticky product most suitable for the slicked-back looks of yesteryear.  </li>
            <li>Despite the advertising, it takes a bit more than just a dab to  get the style all set up, but it&#x27;s quick to use and it even smells good.</li>
            <li>Since then I have modified my amount to a level I love, and am very comfortable with.  </li>
            <li>so its okay.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hair cream.  </li>
            <li>If you want a hair product that allows you to comb/brush your hair into a style but still want your lady friend to be able to run her fingers through it, this is your product.</li>
            <li>Its greasy, so dont use more than a dime sized drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have let the top of my hair grow out some</li>
            <li>Being stuck at home I find I do more and more shopping on Amazon.</li>
            <li>:)       </li>
            <li>I have tested many of the men&#x27;s hair pomades, gels and waxes on the market</li>
            <li>This stuff smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>It leaves a healthy shine to my hair ...</li>
            <li>Love the brylcream.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>recommend flip top so we can just flip it to close it.  </li>
            <li>Finally found my perfect hair styling product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;m now 70.</li>
            <li>I love Brylcreem.</li>
            <li>I have never been so pleased.</li>
            <li>It conditions your hair and scalp, leaving your hair healthy and manageable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like most hair gels</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair nice smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Love the Brylcreem.</li>
            <li>but I used it for many of years.  </li>
            <li>stuff is old school good!</li>
            <li>Classic greaser styling cream,  great on  all types of men&#x27;s  hair ,</li>
            <li>He had a very healthy head of hair right up until he died (89 years old)and never used hair dye.  </li>
            <li>&quot; (most of which I&#x27;m allergic to), and is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Best of all after a rough night of bed wrestling with a gal</li>
            <li>Light on the hair, much more pleasent than pomade.</li>
            <li>I am glad this product is still available.</li>
            <li>Great old product that never goes out of style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just nice, soft and healthy looking with some form and nice waves.</li>
            <li>Simple ingredients, wonderfully effective, smells amazing, does that job, looks great in the medicine cabinet, and pretty cheap to boot -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply, and it holds my hair in  place all day.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair easily managable for easy touch ups.</li>
            <li>Im overall pleased and proud to use brylcreem.</li>
            <li>I could not find this on our local stores, so I was happy to be able to order on line.  </li>
            <li>It was an afro pretty much and with this stuff i would have had beautiful curly locks.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, price is right and the smell IS a classic manly scent!  </li>
            <li>My hair (although have lost much of it through the years) has always been quite stylish as to a kind of light surfer dew.  </li>
            <li>Plus, there&#x27;s the delightfully clean, masculine scent which you will literally never forget once you&#x27;ve experienced it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for trendy styles as it is for the more classic traditional styles.</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>Anyways, Brylcreem gives a light hold</li>
            <li>The scent is of cheap floral grandma perfume.  </li>
            <li>Brylcreem has been on American drug store shelves all these years - it&#x27;s a great product that has endured the test of time.</li>
            <li>Gives hair just enough weight to provide great control - but doesn&#x27;t make it look &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>anybody else experienced a similar problem?</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to wash it out every day either like many of the more modern products with silicone in them.</li>
            <li>I am 24 years old and this is a product my grandfather would have used, and for good reason.</li>
            <li>a stalwart of older, honest values in advertising and production of products.</li>
            <li>It adds body and a nice shine to your hair and keeps it soft and pliable for well-groomed yet natural-looking styles which you can re-comb or finger-style easily if the hair gets mussed.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>A dime size amount is more than enough and it leaves your hair feeling better once its in than before you put it in!</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B000052Y6H Brylcreem Hair Cream Original 4.5 oz.]]</li>
            <li>The scent is clean, out of Shower smell.</li>
            <li>Girls love the look and a certain girl loves the feel</li>
            <li>and you will be one cool cat.</li>
            <li>all you need is a comb and your back looking good with no flakes on your clothes.</li>
            <li>has a really nice natural glow that doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;fake and producty&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended, if you don&#x27;t pay the full price.</li>
            <li>buy a 4.5 oz one for like 10 dollars, and to say the least I was highly impressed</li>
            <li>True to tradition</li>
            <li>It was good enough for Dad and now I know why.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the tried and true never fall out of favor, it just needs to be rediscovered.</li>
            <li>My normal routine for my hair is to wash it every other shower or about twice a week (I would go no shampoo if I had the choice because it&#x27;s the best option, but I&#x27;m fighting dandruff).</li>
            <li>though it&#x27;s a bit strong; the first time I wore it, all I could smell was Brylcreem, but I got used to it quickly and don&#x27;t even notice it now.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal Brylcreem customer for over two years now</li>
            <li>The delivery was quick and satisfactory.</li>
            <li>This is a man that when his ball cap comes off, a come materializes quickly.</li>
            <li>First off, this stuff is super cheap.</li>
            <li>If you have dry hair this might be good</li>
            <li>Also, my sister who has a reliable opinion on such things, after seeing her for the first time with my new product thought my hair looked so good that she went and bought some for herself!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what my uncle was expecting and could find in his home town!</li>
            <li>I looked into different hair products for my dry frizzy hair and found that brylcreem is awesome.</li>
            <li>Great to add a little shine and hold to you hair.</li>
            <li>and I decided it was worth giving it a shot.     </li>
            <li>I was surprised that it did not feel sticky like most pomades and gels.</li>
            <li>I had to laugh</li>
            <li>I bought it just for fun after seeing it while browsing and using it as a kid.  </li>
            <li>Even though hair creams and pomades have taken a backseat in recent decades to trendier gels, sprays, and mousses, Brylcreem, one of the first hair-grooming products made just for men, still proudly sits atop drug store shelves and adorns the hair of an entirely new generation of hipsters, rockers, and retro revivalists.</li>
            <li>It has a very masculine, suave fragrance (it&#x27;s true, girls like it, and a whole lot better than Axe at that)</li>
            <li>You put a little dab in your hair, smooth it in, comb your hair and it keeps your hair shiny, manageable, perfectly in place and natural-looking all day long.  </li>
            <li>Brylcreem has a really nice smell that is masculine and classic, but not in an overtly obnoxious way.  </li>
            <li>Although most of the Brylcreem users have been wearing it for decades and they don&#x27;t get many new customers, I am a rare exception, especially for my demographic.</li>
            <li>, right?    </li>
            <li>Even though it was the Axe of the 1950&#x27;s, I think our grandfathers had the right idea.</li>
            <li>do you is right.  </li>
            <li>Conditions hair and provides just the right amount of hold.</li>
            <li>I figured why not, if he had that sort of track record and was still using it, it must have something going right for it.</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of hold.</li>
            <li>so I can enjoy that suave slick back look and Brylcreem has been excellent at giving me the exact look I am going for.</li>
            <li>I was complemented on the nice smell it gives, it must have originally been made for men who smoked back then... the ladies love it  :) or at least mine does,  </li>
            <li>The only drawback i can think of is it gets a little greasy, but who cares your hair looks great!</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product and highly recommended for any guy who wants to take on that classic, dapper look.</li>
            <li>other wise it is really amazin</li>
            <li>I switched from Vitalis, as this has the same non-gunky feel to it, but with a bit more hold.  </li>
            <li>I first heard of Brylcreem while reading through the Art of Manliness blog.</li>
            <li>;).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s more than just the legacy tied to it which keeps Brylcreem&#x27;s rabid fans coming back dab after dab.  </li>
            <li>Funny</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome, I finally get that 1950&#x27;s slick look that I&#x27;ve been searching for since I was a kid</li>
            <li>This is a really nice product, though it wasn&#x27;t what I initially expected.</li>
            <li>Actually, I lied, it&#x27;s probably more for the fellas -</li>
            <li>MY only improvement to the product is that I recommend a flip top (instead of the screw-on)</li>
            <li>Consistent performer.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>first started using Brylcreem about a year ago.</li>
            <li>Gives hair a nice wet shine but has no hold to it.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash your hair daily, or it might start to look really</li>
            <li>Amazingly, he had very little grey hair and always was full and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Hiding on the top shelf like a long forgotten time capsule.  </li>
            <li>My first experience was a learning one, I used too much and my hair looked and felt too greasy.  </li>
            <li>I sure wish i tried this stuff when i had my really long hair.</li>
            <li>also offers a cool scent to.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a slick vintage look, try a good pomade instead.</li>
            <li>My grandfather died with a full head of hair, and Brylcreem was the reason it always stayed in place and had a classy shine.  </li>
            <li>Once my hair started to air dry, that&#x27;s when the Brylcreem started working its magic.</li>
            <li>Not like gel - brylcreem keeps hair pliable, recombable, and best of all slick and wet looking all day.</li>
            <li>It provides a style-able hold that is easily combed through and if applied properly it leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>short, if you&#x27;ve never tried Brylcreem and you find yourself scoffing, perhaps saying to yourself \\&quot;why would I want to try such an old product when there are so many great new ones out there?\\&quot;, just take a moment to remember that Brylcreem has survived so long because of its unparalleled quality.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re like me where you can almost get by with nothing, especially if you&#x27;ve just showered, and you need just a little bit of conditioning, lay-it-down-a-little power, this is great.  </li>
            <li>The newer pomades can do this, and so can the modern waxes, fibers, and creams.....</li>
            <li>Brylcreem does tend to make your hair look a bit darker; I&#x27;ve noticed that when my hair goes to a darker brown from the natural golden medium-brown when I use it.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to 2015 ..</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; is closer to that of a mousse, but the shine is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it and have gotten compliments on the smell from, umm, girls that have been in close proximity to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too much and your hair</li>
            <li>Not so sure about the alleged nourishment, but it serves its purpose of holding your hair in place.</li>
            <li>Now if you have really unruly hair, it wouldn&#x27;t work for you probably.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I did not like the stiffness of my hair and didn&#x27;t care much for the look.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Brylcreem.</li>
            <li>(\\&quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\\&quot;)</li>
            <li>Really makes hair look darker,smells awesome,holds hair well.</li>
            <li>and if there were a more natural product that did the same thing I might use that in preference.</li>
            <li>I have short, curly thin hair and this holds well and smells great!  </li>
            <li>Has a pleasant subtle aroma.</li>
            <li>Brylcreem has a good manly scent that slowly fades over the course of the day.</li>
            <li>Old man stuff and the smell I thought at the time!?!?!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also Brylcreem&#x27;s phenomenal power to hold hair in place, while giving the wearer an almost endless flexibility to mold and sculpt the hair he wants anytime he wants.  </li>
            <li>No idea if this is related to the original formula(e),</li>
            <li>I stopped using most pomades due to them not being water soluble.</li>
            <li>I still hope to have when I&#x27;m old and grey :)</li>
            <li>I have tried Groom and Clean, Jack Blacks hair cream, American crew etc</li>
            <li>This item doesn&#x27;t really need a review, it&#x27;s a classic and has worked for men for ages.  </li>
            <li>I started usjng products like this, and along with Wildroot, Top Brass, Jeris, Alberto VO5, Stephan&#x27;s, and other \\&quot; older \\&quot; men&#x27;s hair and grooming brands it has stood the test of time and still comes through with flying colors.  </li>
            <li>There is a masculine &#x27;Dad&#x27;s barber shop&#x27; smell to it, and I&#x27;m impressed because, as the slogan says, \\&quot;A little dab&#x27;ll do ya\\&quot;:  a tiny bit really does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>myself discovered Brylcreem two years ago and, though I continue to experiment with different products on occasion, Brylcreem is still my absolute favorite, and I always end up coming back to it.</li>
            <li>me first say that I am 54 years old and this is the stuff that my Dad used to use in the &#x27;60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It also gives my hair a nice texture- sleek, without being an oil slick, and you don&#x27;t get product all built up in your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brylcreem is one of those little pieces of Americana that people think has been forgotten but somebody discoevers every day, and that shows show that good things are meant to last, and they will never die.</li>
            <li>Not a lot of hold, more shine with slight hold.</li>
            <li>It has a classic manly smell that reminded me of that fresh-from-the-barbershop smell.    </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use a lot, a decent dab on your fingertip is plenty.</li>
            <li>Classic styling cream.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing hair product since I was in high school.</li>
            <li>He swears he had a tube since he was in High School.</li>
            <li>This product can also be mixed with other pomades to give you a really nice shine.</li>
            <li>of course in the 60&#x27;s I used more than a little dab... but do now..</li>
            <li>bad thing is that the hold isnt the best for my curly hair</li>
            <li>A few years ago when I started to take more pride in my appearance</li>
            <li>The motto is correct, that a &amp;#34;little dab will do ya&amp;#34;, as any more than a bit will leave your hair feeling heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, smells mild, not oily and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair hard as a rock.</li>
            <li>I really like it; sometimes everything old really IS new again.</li>
            <li>Nice product and the price is much less than the same product at Rite-Aid Drug a store.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way and it&#x27;s more economical than the fancy salon-brand products.</li>
            <li>As for the feel it gives, it *can* give a greasy feel to your hair if you wear too much, but with a good amount, it&#x27;ll only make it feel wet, which goes hand in hand with the wet, shiny look.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this and as the old add used to say  &amp;#34;A Little Dab Will Do You&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>** is made in New York, and it untangles and makes rough, coarse, guy hair much more malleable and lustrous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One more thing, it takes a few washes to get out completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 17 years old and a junior in high school, I get compliments often</li>
            <li>Sort of like my high school boys discovering Old Spice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used pretty much my entire life.</li>
            <li>I have a more conservative cut these days, but still use brylcreem to keep it neat, in place, and slick looking.</li>
            <li>The other products I use are Groom &amp; Clean and Vitalis, but they don&#x27;t hold a candle to Brylcreem.</li>
            <li>only downside I would say is that when you first apply it, especially if you use a bit too much, it can be too shiny.  </li>
            <li>I am certain I will reorder again in the future.</li>
            <li>, I now keep a plastic comb in my pocket and a quick sweep with a few drops of water snaps any wind-ruffling right back into place.  </li>
            <li>but none the less this is worth the use!</li>
            <li>(get it from amazon its a lot cheaper), Con, You may sweat it out a little bit on a hot hot day.</li>
            <li>It works waaay better than the crappy \\&quot;hard hair\\</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my 86 year old father and he was tickled to death.</li>
            <li>Brylcreem also does wonders for today&#x27;s men who favor natural-looking hair that remains soft and pliable throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 33 years old ( born in &#x27;77 )</li>
            <li>and I use this \\&quot; old man&#x27;s \\&quot; hair cream</li>
            <li>I surprised him when i got it.</li>
            <li>At that time I put it in the back of my mind and didn&#x27;t think much of it.</li>
            <li>It was like my hair was a bunch of wild lions and the Brylcreem was the lion tamer.</li>
            <li>I had to buy it; and, WOW ...</li>
            <li>-so, I get a kick out of all of the young guns&#x27; reviews of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have been finding out lately that there are a lot of things that are \\&quot;old\\&quot; that are much better than \\&quot;new\\&quot; ..</li>
            <li>My old tube was so old it was like oil...</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just that the scent is fairly &#x27;masculine.</li>
            <li>Been through two tubes so far.</li>
            <li>Have used this product since I was 8 years old........</li>
            <li>this old works</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and washes out.</li>
            <li>my hair may be gray now and there is much less of it, but Dad had it right!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This will maintain a good hold once you have some build-up that the other thick pomades tend to leave you with.</li>
            <li>My overall impression of this product: If you are looking for a cheap hair-grooming product, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this tried and true classic.</li>
            <li>I wanted the older product which I related to the picture.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This has been around a long time but as there are many other products around that do the same thing and don&#x27;t STINK.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of my favorites, and if you can get it for less than 7 or 8 dollars they sell it for at some stores, it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair that dries out easily.</li>
            <li>As a very young boy -- he would always use it in my hair before church or big events.  </li>
            <li>I recommend you start using this stuff, get your hair cut with a taper on the sides and back but long (4&amp;#34;) on top, then grow a pencil thin moustache and carry a pocket comb</li>
            <li>Sometimes I can get great effect from it, other times it makes my hair look weirdly greasy.</li>
            <li>Tis true, a little dab will do ya!</li>
            <li>One day some time later I was out at the store looking for some hair product and saw the box sitting on the shelf near the razors and aftershaves; an isle away from all the fancy stuff.</li>
            <li>But again, the shine is second to none when it comes to a natural looking glow.</li>
            <li>He to me that he had used it since he was a teen in the early 1960&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I get compliments since using this product on how cool my hair looks and in the past, and once again people say, &amp;</li>
            <li>I found this and recognised their motto &amp;#34;a little dab will do ya&amp;#34; from Price is Right</li>
            <li>I use about the same, if not less, than I use toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Murray&#x27;s for a bit, but I&#x27;d like to find a product that has a little better glow and washes out a little easier.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling natural albeit a little greasy, If you wear it on a hot day 90 degrees or so, you will sweat Brycreem, But</li>
            <li>My Husband LOVES brylcreem to keep his naturally curly hair flat without it looking greasy or like there is any jell in it</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need much of it to get about a thick head of hair to cooperate with you.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel good and gives me control without any stiffness i hate so much.</li>
            <li>I can use this on damp hair or dry hair and my hair stays in place without becoming hard or sticky.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiney (wet look) not stiff like Gel.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>

            <li> still good as ever.</li>
            <li> Feel good.</li>
            <li> The scent is good, and it does just want I ask of it - takes fly-aways out and provides a sheen to the hair.</li>
            <li> That reason is that Brylcreem is, quite simply, the best of the best!</li>
            <li> Some things never go out o style, and this is one of those iconic products that people remember from the glory days of America, these products are the backbone of what makes America great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and smell nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did!        </li>
            <li> and this is my favorite hair product!</li>
            <li> For me, much better solution than hair gel!</li>
            <li> We figure that they&#x27;re still there because seniors, who grew up using products like these, tend to be incredibly brand loyal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, works like a charm, and has a great musky, powdery barbershop scent.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> but I kind of dig it</li>
            <li> and I can say with absolute confidence that it&#x27;s the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I used it years ago and liked it then.</li>
            <li> So I bought one to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: as good or better than Kiehl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Honestly, till searching I never even heard of Brylcreem and looked at the reviews and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell.</li>
            <li> Nice to know they still make this stuff.</li>
            <li> An excellent classic product.</li>
            <li> The new packaging is also very attractive.</li>
            <li> Very strong old-man type of smell</li>
            <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite styling cream ands we&#x27;ve tried many!</li>
            <li> And indeed, Brylcreem has the reputation of being a greasy, sticky product most suitable for the slicked-back looks of yesteryear.  </li>
            <li> Despite the advertising, it takes a bit more than just a dab to  get the style all set up, but it&#x27;s quick to use and it even smells good.</li>
            <li> Since then I have modified my amount to a level I love, and am very comfortable with.  </li>
            <li> so its okay.  </li>
            <li> My favorite hair cream.  </li>
            <li> If you want a hair product that allows you to comb/brush your hair into a style but still want your lady friend to be able to run her fingers through it, this is your product.</li>
            <li> Its greasy, so dont use more than a dime sized drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have let the top of my hair grow out some</li>
            <li> Being stuck at home I find I do more and more shopping on Amazon.</li>
            <li> :)       </li>
            <li> I have tested many of the men&#x27;s hair pomades, gels and waxes on the market</li>
            <li> This stuff smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> It leaves a healthy shine to my hair ...</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;m now 70.</li>
            <li> I love Brylcreem.</li>
            <li> I have never been so pleased.</li>
            <li> It conditions your hair and scalp, leaving your hair healthy and manageable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like most hair gels</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair nice smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Love the Brylcreem.</li>
            <li> but I used it for many of years.  </li>
            <li> stuff is old school good!</li>
            <li> Classic greaser styling cream,  great on  all types of men&#x27;s  hair ,</li>
            <li> He had a very healthy head of hair right up until he died (89 years old)and never used hair dye.  </li>
            <li> &quot; (most of which I&#x27;m allergic to), and is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Best of all after a rough night of bed wrestling with a gal</li>
            <li> Light on the hair, much more pleasent than pomade.</li>
            <li> I am glad this product is still available.</li>
            <li> Great old product that never goes out of style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just nice, soft and healthy looking with some form and nice waves.</li>
            <li> Simple ingredients, wonderfully effective, smells amazing, does that job, looks great in the medicine cabinet, and pretty cheap to boot -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to apply, and it holds my hair in  place all day.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair easily managable for easy touch ups.</li>
            <li> Im overall pleased and proud to use brylcreem.</li>
            <li> I could not find this on our local stores, so I was happy to be able to order on line.  </li>
            <li> It was an afro pretty much and with this stuff i would have had beautiful curly locks.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, price is right and the smell IS a classic manly scent!  </li>
            <li> My hair (although have lost much of it through the years) has always been quite stylish as to a kind of light surfer dew.  </li>
            <li> Plus, there&#x27;s the delightfully clean, masculine scent which you will literally never forget once you&#x27;ve experienced it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for trendy styles as it is for the more classic traditional styles.</li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> Anyways, Brylcreem gives a light hold</li>
            <li> The scent is of cheap floral grandma perfume.  </li>
            <li> Brylcreem has been on American drug store shelves all these years - it&#x27;s a great product that has endured the test of time.</li>
            <li> Gives hair just enough weight to provide great control - but doesn&#x27;t make it look &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> anybody else experienced a similar problem?</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to wash it out every day either like many of the more modern products with silicone in them.</li>
            <li> I am 24 years old and this is a product my grandfather would have used, and for good reason.</li>
            <li> a stalwart of older, honest values in advertising and production of products.</li>
            <li> It adds body and a nice shine to your hair and keeps it soft and pliable for well-groomed yet natural-looking styles which you can re-comb or finger-style easily if the hair gets mussed.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> A dime size amount is more than enough and it leaves your hair feeling better once its in than before you put it in!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000052Y6H Brylcreem Hair Cream Original 4.5 oz.]]</li>
            <li> The scent is clean, out of Shower smell.</li>
            <li> Girls love the look and a certain girl loves the feel</li>
            <li> and you will be one cool cat.</li>
            <li> all you need is a comb and your back looking good with no flakes on your clothes.</li>
            <li> has a really nice natural glow that doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;fake and producty&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended, if you don&#x27;t pay the full price.</li>
            <li> buy a 4.5 oz one for like 10 dollars, and to say the least I was highly impressed</li>
            <li> True to tradition</li>
            <li> It was good enough for Dad and now I know why.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the tried and true never fall out of favor, it just needs to be rediscovered.</li>
            <li> My normal routine for my hair is to wash it every other shower or about twice a week (I would go no shampoo if I had the choice because it&#x27;s the best option, but I&#x27;m fighting dandruff).</li>
            <li> though it&#x27;s a bit strong; the first time I wore it, all I could smell was Brylcreem, but I got used to it quickly and don&#x27;t even notice it now.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Brylcreem customer for over two years now</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick and satisfactory.</li>
            <li> This is a man that when his ball cap comes off, a come materializes quickly.</li>
            <li> First off, this stuff is super cheap.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair this might be good</li>
            <li> Also, my sister who has a reliable opinion on such things, after seeing her for the first time with my new product thought my hair looked so good that she went and bought some for herself!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what my uncle was expecting and could find in his home town!</li>
            <li> I looked into different hair products for my dry frizzy hair and found that brylcreem is awesome.</li>
            <li> Great to add a little shine and hold to you hair.</li>
            <li> and I decided it was worth giving it a shot.     </li>
            <li> I was surprised that it did not feel sticky like most pomades and gels.</li>
            <li> I had to laugh</li>
            <li> I bought it just for fun after seeing it while browsing and using it as a kid.  </li>
            <li> Even though hair creams and pomades have taken a backseat in recent decades to trendier gels, sprays, and mousses, Brylcreem, one of the first hair-grooming products made just for men, still proudly sits atop drug store shelves and adorns the hair of an entirely new generation of hipsters, rockers, and retro revivalists.</li>
            <li> It has a very masculine, suave fragrance (it&#x27;s true, girls like it, and a whole lot better than Axe at that)</li>
            <li> You put a little dab in your hair, smooth it in, comb your hair and it keeps your hair shiny, manageable, perfectly in place and natural-looking all day long.  </li>
            <li> Brylcreem has a really nice smell that is masculine and classic, but not in an overtly obnoxious way.  </li>
            <li> Although most of the Brylcreem users have been wearing it for decades and they don&#x27;t get many new customers, I am a rare exception, especially for my demographic.</li>
            <li> , right?    </li>
            <li> Even though it was the Axe of the 1950&#x27;s, I think our grandfathers had the right idea.</li>
            <li> do you is right.  </li>
            <li> Conditions hair and provides just the right amount of hold.</li>
            <li> I figured why not, if he had that sort of track record and was still using it, it must have something going right for it.</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of hold.</li>
            <li> so I can enjoy that suave slick back look and Brylcreem has been excellent at giving me the exact look I am going for.</li>
            <li> I was complemented on the nice smell it gives, it must have originally been made for men who smoked back then... the ladies love it  :) or at least mine does,  </li>
            <li> The only drawback i can think of is it gets a little greasy, but who cares your hair looks great!</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great product and highly recommended for any guy who wants to take on that classic, dapper look.</li>
            <li> other wise it is really amazin</li>
            <li> I switched from Vitalis, as this has the same non-gunky feel to it, but with a bit more hold.  </li>
            <li> I first heard of Brylcreem while reading through the Art of Manliness blog.</li>
            <li> ;).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s more than just the legacy tied to it which keeps Brylcreem&#x27;s rabid fans coming back dab after dab.  </li>
            <li> Funny</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, I finally get that 1950&#x27;s slick look that I&#x27;ve been searching for since I was a kid</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product, though it wasn&#x27;t what I initially expected.</li>
            <li> Actually, I lied, it&#x27;s probably more for the fellas -</li>
            <li> MY only improvement to the product is that I recommend a flip top (instead of the screw-on)</li>
            <li> Consistent performer.  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> first started using Brylcreem about a year ago.</li>
            <li> Gives hair a nice wet shine but has no hold to it.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash your hair daily, or it might start to look really</li>
            <li> Amazingly, he had very little grey hair and always was full and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Hiding on the top shelf like a long forgotten time capsule.  </li>
            <li> My first experience was a learning one, I used too much and my hair looked and felt too greasy.  </li>
            <li> I sure wish i tried this stuff when i had my really long hair.</li>
            <li> also offers a cool scent to.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a slick vintage look, try a good pomade instead.</li>
            <li> My grandfather died with a full head of hair, and Brylcreem was the reason it always stayed in place and had a classy shine.  </li>
            <li> Once my hair started to air dry, that&#x27;s when the Brylcreem started working its magic.</li>
            <li> Not like gel - brylcreem keeps hair pliable, recombable, and best of all slick and wet looking all day.</li>
            <li> It provides a style-able hold that is easily combed through and if applied properly it leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> short, if you&#x27;ve never tried Brylcreem and you find yourself scoffing, perhaps saying to yourself \\&quot;why would I want to try such an old product when there are so many great new ones out there?\\&quot;, just take a moment to remember that Brylcreem has survived so long because of its unparalleled quality.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re like me where you can almost get by with nothing, especially if you&#x27;ve just showered, and you need just a little bit of conditioning, lay-it-down-a-little power, this is great.  </li>
            <li> The newer pomades can do this, and so can the modern waxes, fibers, and creams.....</li>
            <li> Brylcreem does tend to make your hair look a bit darker; I&#x27;ve noticed that when my hair goes to a darker brown from the natural golden medium-brown when I use it.</li>
            <li> Fast forward to 2015 ..</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; is closer to that of a mousse, but the shine is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it and have gotten compliments on the smell from, umm, girls that have been in close proximity to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too much and your hair</li>
            <li> Not so sure about the alleged nourishment, but it serves its purpose of holding your hair in place.</li>
            <li> Now if you have really unruly hair, it wouldn&#x27;t work for you probably.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> I did not like the stiffness of my hair and didn&#x27;t care much for the look.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Brylcreem.</li>
            <li> (\\&quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> Really makes hair look darker,smells awesome,holds hair well.</li>
            <li> and if there were a more natural product that did the same thing I might use that in preference.</li>
            <li> I have short, curly thin hair and this holds well and smells great!  </li>
            <li> Has a pleasant subtle aroma.</li>
            <li> Brylcreem has a good manly scent that slowly fades over the course of the day.</li>
            <li> Old man stuff and the smell I thought at the time!?!?!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also Brylcreem&#x27;s phenomenal power to hold hair in place, while giving the wearer an almost endless flexibility to mold and sculpt the hair he wants anytime he wants.  </li>
            <li> No idea if this is related to the original formula(e),</li>
            <li> I stopped using most pomades due to them not being water soluble.</li>
            <li> I still hope to have when I&#x27;m old and grey :)</li>
            <li> I have tried Groom and Clean, Jack Blacks hair cream, American crew etc</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t really need a review, it&#x27;s a classic and has worked for men for ages.  </li>
            <li> I started usjng products like this, and along with Wildroot, Top Brass, Jeris, Alberto VO5, Stephan&#x27;s, and other \\&quot; older \\&quot; men&#x27;s hair and grooming brands it has stood the test of time and still comes through with flying colors.  </li>
            <li> There is a masculine &#x27;Dad&#x27;s barber shop&#x27; smell to it, and I&#x27;m impressed because, as the slogan says, \\&quot;A little dab&#x27;ll do ya\\&quot;:  a tiny bit really does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> myself discovered Brylcreem two years ago and, though I continue to experiment with different products on occasion, Brylcreem is still my absolute favorite, and I always end up coming back to it.</li>
            <li> me first say that I am 54 years old and this is the stuff that my Dad used to use in the &#x27;60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also gives my hair a nice texture- sleek, without being an oil slick, and you don&#x27;t get product all built up in your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brylcreem is one of those little pieces of Americana that people think has been forgotten but somebody discoevers every day, and that shows show that good things are meant to last, and they will never die.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of hold, more shine with slight hold.</li>
            <li> It has a classic manly smell that reminded me of that fresh-from-the-barbershop smell.    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use a lot, a decent dab on your fingertip is plenty.</li>
            <li> Classic styling cream.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing hair product since I was in high school.</li>
            <li> He swears he had a tube since he was in High School.</li>
            <li> This product can also be mixed with other pomades to give you a really nice shine.</li>
            <li> of course in the 60&#x27;s I used more than a little dab... but do now..</li>
            <li> bad thing is that the hold isnt the best for my curly hair</li>
            <li> A few years ago when I started to take more pride in my appearance</li>
            <li> The motto is correct, that a &amp;#34;little dab will do ya&amp;#34;, as any more than a bit will leave your hair feeling heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, smells mild, not oily and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> I really like it; sometimes everything old really IS new again.</li>
            <li> Nice product and the price is much less than the same product at Rite-Aid Drug a store.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and it&#x27;s more economical than the fancy salon-brand products.</li>
            <li> As for the feel it gives, it *can* give a greasy feel to your hair if you wear too much, but with a good amount, it&#x27;ll only make it feel wet, which goes hand in hand with the wet, shiny look.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this and as the old add used to say  &amp;#34;A Little Dab Will Do You&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> ** is made in New York, and it untangles and makes rough, coarse, guy hair much more malleable and lustrous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One more thing, it takes a few washes to get out completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 17 years old and a junior in high school, I get compliments often</li>
            <li> Sort of like my high school boys discovering Old Spice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pretty much my entire life.</li>
            <li> I have a more conservative cut these days, but still use brylcreem to keep it neat, in place, and slick looking.</li>
            <li> The other products I use are Groom &amp; Clean and Vitalis, but they don&#x27;t hold a candle to Brylcreem.</li>
            <li> only downside I would say is that when you first apply it, especially if you use a bit too much, it can be too shiny.  </li>
            <li> I am certain I will reorder again in the future.</li>
            <li> , I now keep a plastic comb in my pocket and a quick sweep with a few drops of water snaps any wind-ruffling right back into place.  </li>
            <li> but none the less this is worth the use!</li>
            <li> (get it from amazon its a lot cheaper), Con, You may sweat it out a little bit on a hot hot day.</li>
            <li> It works waaay better than the crappy \\&quot;hard hair\\</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 86 year old father and he was tickled to death.</li>
            <li> Brylcreem also does wonders for today&#x27;s men who favor natural-looking hair that remains soft and pliable throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 years old ( born in &#x27;77 )</li>
            <li> and I use this \\&quot; old man&#x27;s \\&quot; hair cream</li>
            <li> I surprised him when i got it.</li>
            <li> At that time I put it in the back of my mind and didn&#x27;t think much of it.</li>
            <li> It was like my hair was a bunch of wild lions and the Brylcreem was the lion tamer.</li>
            <li> I had to buy it; and, WOW ...</li>
            <li> -so, I get a kick out of all of the young guns&#x27; reviews of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have been finding out lately that there are a lot of things that are \\&quot;old\\&quot; that are much better than \\&quot;new\\&quot; ..</li>
            <li> My old tube was so old it was like oil...</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just that the scent is fairly &#x27;masculine.</li>
            <li> Been through two tubes so far.</li>
            <li> Have used this product since I was 8 years old........</li>
            <li> this old works</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and washes out.</li>
            <li> my hair may be gray now and there is much less of it, but Dad had it right!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This will maintain a good hold once you have some build-up that the other thick pomades tend to leave you with.</li>
            <li> My overall impression of this product: If you are looking for a cheap hair-grooming product, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this tried and true classic.</li>
            <li> I wanted the older product which I related to the picture.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This has been around a long time but as there are many other products around that do the same thing and don&#x27;t STINK.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of my favorites, and if you can get it for less than 7 or 8 dollars they sell it for at some stores, it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that dries out easily.</li>
            <li> As a very young boy -- he would always use it in my hair before church or big events.  </li>
            <li> I recommend you start using this stuff, get your hair cut with a taper on the sides and back but long (4&amp;#34;) on top, then grow a pencil thin moustache and carry a pocket comb</li>
            <li> Sometimes I can get great effect from it, other times it makes my hair look weirdly greasy.</li>
            <li> Tis true, a little dab will do ya!</li>
            <li> One day some time later I was out at the store looking for some hair product and saw the box sitting on the shelf near the razors and aftershaves; an isle away from all the fancy stuff.</li>
            <li> But again, the shine is second to none when it comes to a natural looking glow.</li>
            <li> He to me that he had used it since he was a teen in the early 1960&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I get compliments since using this product on how cool my hair looks and in the past, and once again people say, &amp;</li>
            <li> I found this and recognised their motto &amp;#34;a little dab will do ya&amp;#34; from Price is Right</li>
            <li> I use about the same, if not less, than I use toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Murray&#x27;s for a bit, but I&#x27;d like to find a product that has a little better glow and washes out a little easier.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling natural albeit a little greasy, If you wear it on a hot day 90 degrees or so, you will sweat Brycreem, But</li>
            <li> My Husband LOVES brylcreem to keep his naturally curly hair flat without it looking greasy or like there is any jell in it</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need much of it to get about a thick head of hair to cooperate with you.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel good and gives me control without any stiffness i hate so much.</li>
            <li> I can use this on damp hair or dry hair and my hair stays in place without becoming hard or sticky.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiney (wet look) not stiff like Gel.</li>
            <li> I am new to the world of hair cream and pommades, I previously in all my years used hair-gel and hairspray or moose.  </li>
            <li> I use just a little dab, about the size of a quarter of a dime&#x27;s worth along with a little water to work it in.  </li>
            <li> And while it&#x27;s certainly capable of giving you a \\&quot;wet look,\\&quot; using a little dab does NOT make your hair oily or greasy, contrary to its reputation.    </li>
            <li> , so to look like a 1960 office working man, Brylcreem has been just the thing--not only to slick my hair down in a severe part, but to be able to quickly slick it backwards for my costume</li>
            <li> However, I developed a serious scalp itch ever since they came out with the new &#x27;packaging&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job of getting hair under control though, for a lot less than other products.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft with a little shine all day long, you can restyle at will.</li>
            <li> Leave the hard shell gels, spray, and wax on the shelf this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> and I am convinced that I am a customer for life, or as long as i have hair to put it in.</li>
            <li> ; I find it strange that you are still in your pajamas after taken a shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 74 years-old  now with some grey hair.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s into archaic stuff, and this stuff&#x27;s been around a long time.  </li>
            <li> One minor downside is that it is not water soluble, so after applying you&#x27;ll need to wash your hands with soap,</li>
            <li> It has remained &amp;#34;the same&amp;#34; as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy it here as long as it is sold here.</li>
            <li> All my husband could talk about, was how long he had use a tube of Brylcreem.</li>
            <li> My dad used it for long time.</li>
            <li> I remember the product from the long ago:</li>
            <li> Gel would dry and flake out.</li>
            <li> even though it doesn&#x27;t have that heavy wet hair coming out of the pool or shower, it feels natural?</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to mess with some gross gel that makes my hair crispy.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit for a sleek manageable look that doesn&#x27;t leave flakes in your hair...</li>
            <li> last little story before I leave you</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea that this product is something that&#x27;s sold as a similar alternative to petroleum pomades is a little misleading.</li>
            <li> For short and medium-length hair, a \\&quot;little dab\\&quot; about the size of a dime (as the box says) massaged through wet hair provides almost-perfect control that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is classic, and hard to get as it keeps selling out!  </li>
            <li> I use about an almond size amount of this product after I shower and use my fingers to get it into my wet hair.</li>
            <li> On my \\&quot;sans douche\\&quot; days I just wet my hair and restyle it</li>
            <li> Even after my hair completely dried, it was still manageable with a simple swipe of the comb.    </li>
            <li> and/or like the wet hair look, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> I guess my hair did look wet?</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why I purchased this, since it only cost a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> The itch goes away a few days after I stop using it and comes back with force when I again resume its use.</li>
            <li> Brylcreem  make my hair looks darker and shiny with less grey hair.</li>
            <li> My father swore by this daily routine:  put a little dab of Brylrcreem along with slightly damp fingers and massage vigorously into your hair and scalp every morning.  </li>
            <li> I used it when I was a teenager to slick my hair back in the 60&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and she tried other stuff which she says &amp;#34;can&#x27;t compare&amp;#34; to Brylcreem.  </li>
            <li> I usually wear my hair when it is shorter slightly spiked and when its longer brushed to the side.</li>
            <li> Sometimes this stuff is hard to find in my local stores.</li>
            <li> Forget the fluff, the pomo and all the frilly stuff, get to the jeans, the pickup trucks, the cold beers on a hot summer night and BBQS every summer.  </li>
            <li> The product comes out of the tube with a somewhat greasy consistency and a viscosity similar to a thick lotion.</li>
            <li> but it helps to plaster down your hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it calms it down so I can achieve any style I desire.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair back and slick!</li>
            <li> but so can Brylcreem, for less coin.  </li>
            <li> Slightly scented.</li>
            <li> it gives your hair a slightly darker look.  </li>
            <li> It might take a half hour or some brushing to get it where you want it to be.  </li>
            <li> instead of that dull dry look.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need to sit the tube down to use the \\&quot;little dab,\\&quot; or have trouble keeping the \\&quot;little dab\\&quot; on one finger while trying to hold the tube and screw on the tap --</li>
            <li> Does the job, but leaves the hair looking a little oily.</li>
            <li> A little dab&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> so I searched for Brylcreem (a little dab will do ya) on Amazon</li>
            <li> A little dab&#x27;ll do ya.</li>
            <li> i remember the signs on Highway 55, little dab will do you.</li>
            <li> And a little dab will still do you.</li>
            <li> I have used a little bit of everything that there is.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> now I use it for a little shine and hold.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> He gets compliments on his 1920s gangster haircut everyday.</li>
            <li> by Dad passed a few years ago - well into his 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> after a few days of use, it could get greasey.</li>
            <li> *will* be heavy and greasy, however.</li>
            <li> Needless to say get this product, Pros, Leaves hair feeling natural and manageable</li>
            <li> I am a guy who has *very* thick, slightly wavy hair, and dry/frizzy hair is something I&#x27;ve lived with for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair in place without being greasy or stiff.</li>
            <li> Coming out of the tube it feels like a skin cream, but going onto your hair it has a stiff texture to it that reminds me of styling putty.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I can complain about is that the smell is a little weird, but you can&#x27;t notice it if you use as little as I do.</li>
            <li> Then, BAM!, lo and behold -- what did I stumble across while picking up some shave soap and double edge razors (another nostalgic practice) at Walmart but Brylcreem!  </li>
            <li> Play around with amounts until you find what you like, too much will leave the greaser look, however that&#x27;s not always a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> I was being a lazy loaf in my pajamas</li>
            <li> Not sure where the &amp;#34;smells great&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;manly scent&amp;#34; comments are coming from.  </li>
            <li> I small pea sized amount tames my unruly mop without feeling or looking greasy.  </li>
            <li> Still into the slick wet-look, so still use brylcreem.</li>
            <li> A small pea-sized dab of this stuff after towel-drying my hair and the dryness/frizzyness is gone, without being overly greasy.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ask me, my wife will use nothing else for past 45 years and she is 85 and for awhile we couldn&#x27;t&lt;</li>
            <li> I pretty much hate the smell of every hygiene product.  </li>
            <li> I encourage all men to at least try it.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been on my mind lately.  </li>
            <li> , that was mind blowing in itself, and the product, I 1st heard about this product in a yahoo interview for Madmen and how they got that  look for all the actors, I had seen pictures of my family that lived in NewYork form that era as well, and the hair was always well coiffed, And I could never understand how they got that look,fast forward to the 90&#x27;s, my cousin introduced me to hair gel , My hair is really thick and unmanageable, So i start using that, all thru the years I had been experimenting, I&#x27;ve been thru all types of hair products, Gels, Greases, Pastes, Oils</li>
            <li> I said what do you mean?</li>
            <li> For those guys who wear hats, I mean a Fedora or one of Stetson&#x27;s Gun Club hats like I have, this product doesn&#x27;t seem to do any harm to the band or liner and it doesn&#x27;t make the hat smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what variables are causing this!</li>
            <li> Creams by other company&#x27;s was expensive</li>
            <li> The newer product I received is not good.</li>
            <li> Its consistency is infamously oily and creamy, but once you get this stuff in your hair, you won&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of a greasy combed look from the 1950&#x27;s</li>
            <li> To be truthful,,,,if you can stand you hair smelling dirty the moment you use this than it will hold your hair, but at what price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has NONE of the unpleasant \\&quot;fragrances\\</li>
            <li> used it once. :(</li>
            <li> I hated it.  </li>
            <li> Hair products are the worst.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product for guys with longer hair.  Very strong old-man type of smell but I kind of dig it so its okay.  I recommend you start using this stuff, get your hair cut with a taper on the sides and back but long (4&amp;#34;) on top, then grow a pencil thin moustache and carry a pocket comb and you will be one cool cat.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 86 year old father and he was tickled to death. It works great with his hair and he loves the smell!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft with a little shine all day long, you can restyle at will. Play around with amounts until you find what you like, too much will leave the greaser look, however that&#x27;s not always a bad thing.  Overall great product.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair cream.  I switched from Vitalis, as this has the same non-gunky feel to it, but with a bit more hold.  This stuff is classic, and hard to get as it keeps selling out!  Whenever it is in stock, I buy a bunch.</li>
            <li> Finally I found a hair product that fits the style I was going for! If you want a hair product that allows you to comb/brush your hair into a style but still want your lady friend to be able to run her fingers through it, this is your product. Leave the hard shell gels, spray, and wax on the shelf this stuff really works. It&#x27;s perfect for the &amp;#34;dapper&amp;#34; look. Best of all after a rough night of bed wrestling with a gal all you need is a comb and your back looking good with no flakes on your clothes. This stuff is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Light on the hair, much more pleasent than pomade. Its greasy, so dont use more than a dime sized drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only bad thing is that the hold isnt the best for my curly hair</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve all been in drug or grocery stores and seen the boxes of Brylcreem, typically next to the bottles of Vitalis, sitting on the shelves almost as if collecting dust.  We figure that they&#x27;re still there because seniors, who grew up using products like these, tend to be incredibly brand loyal.  And indeed, Brylcreem has the reputation of being a greasy, sticky product most suitable for the slicked-back looks of yesteryear.  Definitely not the thing to use for today&#x27;s styles, right?    Well, not quite.  Brylcreem also does wonders for today&#x27;s men who favor natural-looking hair that remains soft and pliable throughout the day.  The newer pomades can do this, and so can the modern waxes, fibers, and creams.....but so can Brylcreem, for less coin.  For short and medium-length hair, a \\&quot;little dab\\&quot; about the size of a dime (as the box says) massaged through wet hair provides almost-perfect control that lasts all day.  It adds body and a nice shine to your hair and keeps it soft and pliable for well-groomed yet natural-looking styles which you can re-comb or finger-style easily if the hair gets mussed.  And while it&#x27;s certainly capable of giving you a \\&quot;wet look,\\&quot; using a little dab does NOT make your hair oily or greasy, contrary to its reputation.    I encourage all men to at least try it.  It&#x27;s cheap, works like a charm, and has a great musky, powdery barbershop scent.  Even though it was the Axe of the 1950&#x27;s, I think our grandfathers had the right idea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 years old ( born in &#x27;77 ) and I use this \\&quot; old man&#x27;s \\&quot; hair cream AND I&#x27;M DAMN PROUD OF IT!!!  You put a little dab in your hair, smooth it in, comb your hair and it keeps your hair shiny, manageable, perfectly in place and natural-looking all day long.  A few years ago when I started to take more pride in my appearance I started usjng products like this, and along with Wildroot, Top Brass, Jeris, Alberto VO5, Stephan&#x27;s, and other \\&quot; older \\&quot; men&#x27;s hair and grooming brands it has stood the test of time and still comes through with flying colors.  Some things never go out o style, and this is one of those iconic products that people remember from the glory days of America, these products are the backbone of what makes America great.  Forget the fluff, the pomo and all the frilly stuff, get to the jeans, the pickup trucks, the cold beers on a hot summer night and BBQS every summer.  Brylcreem is one of those little pieces of Americana that people think has been forgotten but somebody discoevers every day, and that shows show that good things are meant to last, and they will never die.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Brylcreem customer for over two years now and I can say with absolute confidence that it&#x27;s the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. The other products I use are Groom &amp; Clean and Vitalis, but they don&#x27;t hold a candle to Brylcreem. Although most of the Brylcreem users have been wearing it for decades and they don&#x27;t get many new customers, I am a rare exception, especially for my demographic. I&#x27;m 17 years old and a junior in high school, I get compliments often and I even started a bit of a trend in my school. Anyways, Brylcreem gives a light hold but it helps to plaster down your hair. Its consistency is infamously oily and creamy, but once you get this stuff in your hair, you won&#x27;t care. It has a very masculine, suave fragrance (it&#x27;s true, girls like it, and a whole lot better than Axe at that) though it&#x27;s a bit strong; the first time I wore it, all I could smell was Brylcreem, but I got used to it quickly and don&#x27;t even notice it now. As for the feel it gives, it *can* give a greasy feel to your hair if you wear too much, but with a good amount, it&#x27;ll only make it feel wet, which goes hand in hand with the wet, shiny look. It truly is the holy grail of shiny hair products. Brylcreem does tend to make your hair look a bit darker; I&#x27;ve noticed that when my hair goes to a darker brown from the natural golden medium-brown when I use it. One more thing, it takes a few washes to get out completely. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product and highly recommended for any guy who wants to take on that classic, dapper look.</li>
            <li> Does the job, but leaves the hair looking a little oily.</li>
            <li> stuff is old school good!</li>
            <li> I have let the top of my hair grow out some so I can enjoy that suave slick back look and Brylcreem has been excellent at giving me the exact look I am going for. You only need a little bit for a sleek manageable look that doesn&#x27;t leave flakes in your hair... also offers a cool scent to. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It works waaay better than the crappy \\&quot;hard hair\\&quot; gel I&#x27;ve used pretty much my entire life. You really don&#x27;t need much of it to get about a thick head of hair to cooperate with you. I use about the same, if not less, than I use toothpaste. It&#x27;s not sticky and you don&#x27;t get all the flakes that you do with LA Looks-esque products. The only thing I can complain about is that the smell is a little weird, but you can&#x27;t notice it if you use as little as I do.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this hair product and was verydisappointed when the store quit stocking it. You can find anything on Amazon. I surprised him when i got it. Being stuck at home I find I do more and more shopping on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I first heard of Brylcreem while reading through the Art of Manliness blog. At that time I put it in the back of my mind and didn&#x27;t think much of it. One day some time later I was out at the store looking for some hair product and saw the box sitting on the shelf near the razors and aftershaves; an isle away from all the fancy stuff. It was six bucks and I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot... I&#x27;m glad I did!        I was afraid of a greasy combed look from the 1950&#x27;s, however, I found that that is not how the product looks at all unless you put a lot in. I have medium length wavy hair. My normal routine for my hair is to wash it every other shower or about twice a week (I would go no shampoo if I had the choice because it&#x27;s the best option, but I&#x27;m fighting dandruff). I use about an almond size amount of this product after I shower and use my fingers to get it into my wet hair. When my hair dries it looks and feels great. Girls love the look and a certain girl loves the feel ;). Also, my sister who has a reliable opinion on such things, after seeing her for the first time with my new product thought my hair looked so good that she went and bought some for herself! This is really a great product that I&#x27;ve been using for about a year now and I am convinced that I am a customer for life, or as long as i have hair to put it in. :)       It&#x27;s not oily by the way. It&#x27;s just nice, soft and healthy looking with some form and nice waves. You don&#x27;t have to wash it out every day either like many of the more modern products with silicone in them. On my \\&quot;sans douche\\&quot; days I just wet my hair and restyle it and it looks good all over again. My only concern is that I don&#x27;t actually know what&#x27;s in it and if there were a more natural product that did the same thing I might use that in preference.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves his Bryllcream. Not a lot of hold, more shine with slight hold. Slightly scented. He uses it with a stronger hold wax. He gets compliments on his 1920s gangster haircut everyday.</li>
            <li> I have tested many of the men&#x27;s hair pomades, gels and waxes on the market and I stumbled upon this gem recently at my local drugstore. Curiosity got the best of me and I decided it was worth giving it a shot.     First off, this stuff is super cheap. The tube of Brylcreem I bought was 5.5oz for just under $6. You can imagine my skepticism since I have purchased pomades upwards of $35 for a 3oz jar.     The tube it comes in reminded me of toothpaste. The product comes out of the tube with a somewhat greasy consistency and a viscosity similar to a thick lotion. I was surprised that it did not feel sticky like most pomades and gels. **Please note** This stuff smells fantastic! It has a classic manly smell that reminded me of that fresh-from-the-barbershop smell.    Once my hair started to air dry, that&#x27;s when the Brylcreem started working its magic. It was like my hair was a bunch of wild lions and the Brylcreem was the lion tamer. Wherever I worked the comb, my hair went, and stayed. Even after my hair completely dried, it was still manageable with a simple swipe of the comb.    My overall impression of this product: If you are looking for a cheap hair-grooming product, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this tried and true classic. I am 24 years old and this is a product my grandfather would have used, and for good reason. If you want your hair to stay in place and/or like the wet hair look, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> Even though hair creams and pomades have taken a backseat in recent decades to trendier gels, sprays, and mousses, Brylcreem, one of the first hair-grooming products made just for men, still proudly sits atop drug store shelves and adorns the hair of an entirely new generation of hipsters, rockers, and retro revivalists. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I myself discovered Brylcreem two years ago and, though I continue to experiment with different products on occasion, Brylcreem is still my absolute favorite, and I always end up coming back to it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more than just the legacy tied to it which keeps Brylcreem&#x27;s rabid fans coming back dab after dab.  It&#x27;s also Brylcreem&#x27;s phenomenal power to hold hair in place, while giving the wearer an almost endless flexibility to mold and sculpt the hair he wants anytime he wants.  Plus, there&#x27;s the delightfully clean, masculine scent which you will literally never forget once you&#x27;ve experienced it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In short, if you&#x27;ve never tried Brylcreem and you find yourself scoffing, perhaps saying to yourself \\&quot;why would I want to try such an old product when there are so many great new ones out there?\\&quot;, just take a moment to remember that Brylcreem has survived so long because of its unparalleled quality.  It&#x27;s quite literally a household name, and it obtained this status for a reason.  That reason is that Brylcreem is, quite simply, the best of the best!</li>
            <li> Brylcreem Hair Cream - WOW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me first say that I am 54 years old and this is the stuff that my Dad used to use in the &#x27;60&#x27;s.  I hated it.  As a very young boy -- he would always use it in my hair before church or big events.  Old man stuff and the smell I thought at the time!?!?!  Fast forward to 2015 .. by Dad passed a few years ago - well into his 80&#x27;s.  He&#x27;s been on my mind lately.  (Fathers Day and my Birthday - same day - lots of memories.)  Then, BAM!, lo and behold -- what did I stumble across while picking up some shave soap and double edge razors (another nostalgic practice) at Walmart but Brylcreem!  Hiding on the top shelf like a long forgotten time capsule.  I had to buy it; and, WOW ... my hair may be gray now and there is much less of it, but Dad had it right!  This stuff is GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even-more-so, I get a kick out of all of the young guns&#x27; reviews of this stuff.  It&#x27;s like &amp;#34;Back to the Future&amp;#34; or something.  Sort of like my high school boys discovering Old Spice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom-line:  This stuff is great, price is right and the smell IS a classic manly scent!  Who knew?  Truly a great re-discovery.  Mom and Dad must be laughing at me about now.  Good stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Its the good stuff your grandfather always talked about! A dime size amount is more than enough and it leaves your hair feeling better once its in than before you put it in! I will be a repeat customer after I run out!</li>
            <li> who doesnt feel like don drapper once awhile , and yes it smells great&lt;br /&gt;  I was complemented on the nice smell it gives, it must have originally been made for men who smoked back then... the ladies love it  :) or at least mine does,  oh one last little story before I leave you I was being a lazy loaf in my pajamas and I told the wife I needed to take a shower, she said  &amp;#34; why are you taken a shower didnt you just do that?..I said what do you mean? And then she said,&amp;#34; I find it strange that you are still in your pajamas after taken a shower. Funny I guess my hair did look wet? even though it doesn&#x27;t have that heavy wet hair coming out of the pool or shower, it feels natural? I had to laugh I said no that was the brycreem from yesterday , needless to say I use more than a dime I got a mop of hair , knock on wood I still hope to have when I&#x27;m old and grey :)</li>
            <li> Sometimes this stuff is hard to find in my local stores. Retro hair care! I like it.</li>
            <li> Not sure where the &amp;#34;smells great&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;manly scent&amp;#34; comments are coming from.  The scent is of cheap floral grandma perfume.  It does a decent job of getting hair under control though, for a lot less than other products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and smell nice</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, I finally get that 1950&#x27;s slick look that I&#x27;ve been searching for since I was a kid and I don&#x27;t have to mess with some gross gel that makes my hair crispy. Despite the advertising, it takes a bit more than just a dab to  get the style all set up, but it&#x27;s quick to use and it even smells good. For those guys who wear hats, I mean a Fedora or one of Stetson&#x27;s Gun Club hats like I have, this product doesn&#x27;t seem to do any harm to the band or liner and it doesn&#x27;t make the hat smell. Make sure you wash your hair daily, or it might start to look really greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It smells and feels just like you remember it did!  A little dab&#x27;ll do you is right.  I small pea sized amount tames my unruly mop without feeling or looking greasy.  The great smell stays with you and it holds all day.</li>
            <li> I have tried Groom and Clean, Jack Blacks hair cream, American crew etc and this is my favorite hair product! I have short, curly thin hair and this holds well and smells great!  It leaves my hair shiney (wet look) not stiff like Gel. The scent is clean, out of Shower smell. The only part I dont like is......after a few days of use, it could get greasey. If you have dry hair this might be good but if you have an oily scalp maybe not so good but none the less this is worth the use! Hair looks good!! Try it and share your review!!</li>
            <li> My go to hair product, styles but leaves hair just feeling like hair. Can reset all day with a  touch of water, very nice.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:25096001]]Started using brylcreem a couple years ago when I was into Rockabilly and pomps. Still into the slick wet-look, so still use brylcreem. I have a more conservative cut these days, but still use brylcreem to keep it neat, in place, and slick looking. I use about a US Quarter (25 cent piece coin) size amount. Not like gel - brylcreem keeps hair pliable, recombable, and best of all slick and wet looking all day. It&#x27;s lighter than pomades and won&#x27;t leave your hair in a plastic flaky helmet like gel. It conditions your hair while keeping it well groomed. Has a pleasant subtle aroma. It&#x27;s no wonder Brylcreem has been on American drug store shelves all these years - it&#x27;s a great product that has endured the test of time. It&#x27;s great for trendy styles as it is for the more classic traditional styles. Whatever your style, consider trying brylcreem.</li>
            <li> I can pick up a tube of Brylcreem at any Walmart, Target or Walgreens. It&#x27;s so easy to apply, and it holds my hair in  place all day. It&#x27;s smells great, too. I also like the fact that it&#x27;s alcohol-free.</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t really need a review, it&#x27;s a classic and has worked for men for ages.  The delivery was quick and satisfactory.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product, though it wasn&#x27;t what I initially expected. I&#x27;ve been using Murray&#x27;s for a bit, but I&#x27;d like to find a product that has a little better glow and washes out a little easier. That&#x27;s why I decided to try this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brylcreem has a really nice natural glow that doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;fake and producty&amp;#34; like shine pomades. The scent isn&#x27;t offensive or overpowering, but it definitely has one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea that this product is something that&#x27;s sold as a similar alternative to petroleum pomades is a little misleading. The &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; is closer to that of a mousse, but the shine is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will maintain a good hold once you have some build-up that the other thick pomades tend to leave you with. This product can also be mixed with other pomades to give you a really nice shine. I don&#x27;t recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for an alternate product to perform like a pomade. But again, the shine is second to none when it comes to a natural looking glow.</li>
            <li> Good product and delivery on time.</li>
            <li> I use Brylcreem since 1952, freshman of pre-medical school.  I&#x27;m 74 years-old  now with some grey hair.  Brylcreem  make my hair looks darker and shiny with less grey hair. A great product.</li>
            <li> My father swore by this daily routine:  put a little dab of Brylrcreem along with slightly damp fingers and massage vigorously into your hair and scalp every morning.  He had a very healthy head of hair right up until he died (89 years old)and never used hair dye.  Amazingly, he had very little grey hair and always was full and healthy.  Brylcreem has a side benefit ... it gives your hair a slightly darker look.  It really is a great product.  I use just a little dab, about the size of a quarter of a dime&#x27;s worth along with a little water to work it in.  It leaves a healthy shine to my hair ... instead of that dull dry look.  I have been finding out lately that there are a lot of things that are \\&quot;old\\&quot; that are much better than \\&quot;new\\&quot; .. this is one of them.</li>
            <li> I pretty much hate the smell of every hygiene product.  I wear the plainest deodorant and use the plainest soaps I can find.  Hair products are the worst.  Brylcreem has a really nice smell that is masculine and classic, but not in an overtly obnoxious way.  I really like it and have gotten compliments on the smell from, umm, girls that have been in close proximity to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also gives my hair a nice texture- sleek, without being an oil slick, and you don&#x27;t get product all built up in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I would say is that when you first apply it, especially if you use a bit too much, it can be too shiny.  It might take a half hour or some brushing to get it where you want it to be.  Don&#x27;t use a lot, a decent dab on your fingertip is plenty.</li>
            <li> I am a guy who has *very* thick, slightly wavy hair, and dry/frizzy hair is something I&#x27;ve lived with for as long as I can remember. A small pea-sized dab of this stuff after towel-drying my hair and the dryness/frizzyness is gone, without being overly greasy. Too much and your hair *will* be heavy and greasy, however.</li>
            <li> Kiehl&#x27;s is the product I had been using, but it was a bit pricy so I searched for Brylcreem (a little dab will do ya) on Amazon and it came up. I used it years ago and liked it then. So I bought one to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: as good or better than Kiehl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Love the brylcream. Wonderful smelling product and no greasy feeling after application. Great price too. I am glad this product is still available. I am certain I will reorder again in the future.</li>
            <li> brylcreem being one of the oldest hair styling companies i&#x27;ve ever heard of, says alot on it&#x27;s own. But brylcreem is one of the best hair solutions i&#x27;ve ever used. It makes your hair easily managable for easy touch ups. Just a comb through and it&#x27;s good. Ever seen GREASE, yeah just like that. It&#x27;s good stuff. Im hooked on it. The only drawback i can think of is it gets a little greasy, but who cares your hair looks great! Gels and pomades don&#x27;t match up because they aren&#x27;t redoable, with brylcreem you can change your style in the middle of the day, without having to worry about your hair gel flaking off or dandruff. Im overall pleased and proud to use brylcreem. It keeps my hair back and slick! Brylcreem for the raddest hairdo ever.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s light, smells mild, not oily and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair hard as a rock. Not so sure about the alleged nourishment, but it serves its purpose of holding your hair in place.</li>
            <li> Great old product that never goes out of style.</li>
            <li> Was good for styling my husband&#x27;s hair. I was not a fan of the smell though.</li>
            <li> I heard about Brylcreem from &amp;#34;The Art of Manliness&amp;#34; podcast guy.  He&#x27;s into archaic stuff, and this stuff&#x27;s been around a long time.  The great thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy like pomade or crunchy like hair gel.  Now if you have really unruly hair, it wouldn&#x27;t work for you probably.  But if you&#x27;re like me where you can almost get by with nothing, especially if you&#x27;ve just showered, and you need just a little bit of conditioning, lay-it-down-a-little power, this is great.  It&#x27;s white and creamy.  It doesn&#x27;t smell.  No, it&#x27;s not like vaseline.  You won&#x27;t look like a classic-movie mobster when you put it in your hair.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> ...that&#x27;s why I purchased this, since it only cost a few bucks.  Was a kid in the 1960s, remember the commercials.  Just started using now and it actually works well.  Hair is not \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; like with the gel I had been using, but keeps its shape.  One minor downside is that it is not water soluble, so after applying you&#x27;ll need to wash your hands with soap, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> I had used this as a teen and couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.. My old tube was so old it was like oil... I love the smell of this and as the old add used to say  &amp;#34;A Little Dab Will Do You&amp;#34;  of course in the 60&#x27;s I used more than a little dab... but do now..</li>
            <li> A little dab&#x27;ll do ya.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites, and if you can get it for less than 7 or 8 dollars they sell it for at some stores, it&#x27;s worth the investment. No idea if this is related to the original formula(e), but it goes on like I remember and the scent is similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, if you don&#x27;t pay the full price.</li>
            <li> I bought it just for fun after seeing it while browsing and using it as a kid.  Just like I remembered it.  Keeps your hair in place without that dreaded &amp;#34;helmet head&amp;#34; feel.  The motto is correct, that a &amp;#34;little dab will do ya&amp;#34;, as any more than a bit will leave your hair feeling heavy and greasy. Brylcreem has a good manly scent that slowly fades over the course of the day. With a 4.5oz tube, I have no doubt I&#x27;ll have enough to last a year or so.</li>
            <li> The picture as displayed is not the one I received.  I wanted the older product which I related to the picture.  The newer product I received is not good.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Great packaging and product!  Fast shipping.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 40 years . .. i remember the signs on Highway 55, little dab will do you., . . . still good as ever. ......................  Bob</li>
            <li> This product has an offensive odor and does not hold as well as advertised. If you are looking for a slick vintage look, try a good pomade instead.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m growing my hair out, needed something like this to sweep it back from my face. it&#x27;s like putting honey in your hair. and i look unshowered with it in. used it once. :(</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing stuff! Simple ingredients, wonderfully effective, smells amazing, does that job, looks great in the medicine cabinet, and pretty cheap to boot - a stalwart of older, honest values in advertising and production of products.</li>
            <li> Actually, I lied, it&#x27;s probably more for the fellas - which ain&#x27;t to say a lady couldn&#x27;t use this s***, it&#x27;s just that the scent is fairly &#x27;masculine.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S*** is made in New York, and it untangles and makes rough, coarse, guy hair much more malleable and lustrous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use sparingly, and don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn you.</li>
            <li> Been through two tubes so far. Love this stuff. Conditions hair and provides just the right amount of hold. For me, much better solution than hair gel!</li>
            <li> I could not find this on our local stores, so I was happy to be able to order on line.  Allen</li>
            <li> s*** makes your hair awesome. you&#x27;ll smell like a distinguished person and you&#x27;ll have boss hair. get the smaller quantity because heat will make it watery</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it anymore.  My husband has lost all his hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that dries out easily. This product makes my hair soft and easy to manage. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years now and like what it does. The new packaging is also very attractive.</li>
            <li> Brylcreem is \\&quot;tried and true,\\&quot; but as 82-year-old WOMAN, why is this still marketed only to men, and where you can find it in stores, it&#x27;s (still) put in the Men&#x27;s hair section.  It has NONE of the unpleasant \\&quot;fragrances\\&quot; (most of which I&#x27;m allergic to), and is really easy to use.  MY only improvement to the product is that I recommend a flip top (instead of the screw-on) so you don&#x27;t need to sit the tube down to use the \\&quot;little dab,\\&quot; or have trouble keeping the \\&quot;little dab\\&quot; on one finger while trying to hold the tube and screw on the tap -- recommend flip top so we can just flip it to close it.

            <li> Works for David Lynch. Works for me.</li>
            <li> I am new to the world of hair cream and pommades, I previously in all my years used hair-gel and hairspray or moose.  I did not like the stiffness of my hair and didn&#x27;t care much for the look.  Honestly, till searching I never even heard of Brylcreem and looked at the reviews and decided to give it a try.  My first experience was a learning one, I used too much and my hair looked and felt too greasy.  Since then I have modified my amount to a level I love, and am very comfortable with.  My hair (although have lost much of it through the years) has always been quite stylish as to a kind of light surfer dew.  I get compliments since using this product on how cool my hair looks and in the past, and once again people say, &amp;#34;you look like that dude from 90210 Dillon&amp;#34;.  I will take that as a compliment.  Thanks Brylcreem.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what my uncle was expecting and could find in his home town!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s still around; a great product.</li>
            <li> Consistent performer.  I can use this on damp hair or dry hair and my hair stays in place without becoming hard or sticky.  A little bit goes a long way and it&#x27;s more economical than the fancy salon-brand products.</li>
            <li> Classic styling cream. Keeps my hair in place without being greasy or stiff. Finally found my perfect hair styling product. Pleasant fragrance, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite styling cream ands we&#x27;ve tried many!</li>
            <li> Product was close to &amp;#34;use by&amp;#34; date</li>
            <li> Nice smell.Feel good.A hair cream is a must for every man.I dont know whether it gives any nutritious benefit to my hair or not</li>
            <li> An excellent classic product. The scent is good, and it does just want I ask of it - takes fly-aways out and provides a sheen to the hair. I really like it; sometimes everything old really IS new again.</li>
            <li> I love it. I can rework my hair any time with this in it.</li>
            <li> Nice to know they still make this stuff. It&#x27;s really a pleasant product to put on. And a little dab will still do you. ;-)</li>
            <li> Well my order arrived in one day, that was mind blowing in itself, and the product, I 1st heard about this product in a yahoo interview for Madmen and how they got that  look for all the actors, I had seen pictures of my family that lived in NewYork form that era as well, and the hair was always well coiffed, And I could never understand how they got that look,fast forward to the 90&#x27;s, my cousin introduced me to hair gel , My hair is really thick and unmanageable, So i start using that, all thru the years I had been experimenting, I&#x27;ve been thru all types of hair products, Gels, Greases, Pastes, Oils, You name it, And so I heard of Brylcreem just about until 2 months ago from the MadMen article I go to Duane Reade buy a 4.5 oz one for like 10 dollars, and to say the least I was highly impressed (A lot of back story for a simple review, Believe me I know!) It left my hair feeling natural albeit a little greasy, If you wear it on a hot day 90 degrees or so, you will sweat Brycreem, But other wise it is really amazin, I can actually run my fingers thru my hair unlike  gel which tends to give me helmet hair. I was also talkin to my coworker who is from india, and she says everyone in india uses Brycreem, which makes sense cause they all have that well groomed look of hair, Needless to say get this product, Pros, Leaves hair feeling natural and manageable (get it from amazon its a lot cheaper), Con, You may sweat it out a little bit on a hot hot day. Thats my 2 cents folks, Have a great day!</li>
            <li> Can be hit-or-miss. Sometimes I can get great effect from it, other times it makes my hair look weirdly greasy. I&#x27;m not sure what variables are causing this!</li>
            <li> To be truthful,,,,if you can stand you hair smelling dirty the moment you use this than it will hold your hair, but at what price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been around a long time but as there are many other products around that do the same thing and don&#x27;t STINK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitalis, Clubman  etc....</li>
            <li> Have used this product since I was 8 years old........ OK, I&#x27;m now 70. It has remained &amp;#34;the same&amp;#34; as long as I can remember. Holds your well, it&#x27;s not greasy, and best of all it&#x27;s still a great price.</li>
            <li> My grandfather died with a full head of hair, and Brylcreem was the reason it always stayed in place and had a classy shine.  I have a part in a play that&#x27;s set in 1960 (\\&quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\\&quot;), so to look like a 1960 office working man, Brylcreem has been just the thing--not only to slick my hair down in a severe part, but to be able to quickly slick it backwards for my costume change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brylcreem is malleable and stays in all day--it has no alcohol and is also part \\&quot;leave-in conditioner\\&quot;.  Coming out of the tube it feels like a skin cream, but going onto your hair it has a stiff texture to it that reminds me of styling putty.  There is a masculine &#x27;Dad&#x27;s barber shop&#x27; smell to it, and I&#x27;m impressed because, as the slogan says, \\&quot;A little dab&#x27;ll do ya\\&quot;:  a tiny bit really does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have short to medium hair, this stuff will make it sculptable, shiny, and slick-looking.  It holds in place and yet give you the ability to play with it.  True to tradition, I now keep a plastic comb in my pocket and a quick sweep with a few drops of water snaps any wind-ruffling right back into place.  I&#x27;m fascinated something this old works this well even in today&#x27;s era of millions of styling agents.</li>
            <li> I love Brylcreem. It provides a style-able hold that is easily combed through and if applied properly it leaves no residue. It smells great and my hair shines when I use it. I will continue to buy it here as long as it is sold here.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing hair product since I was in high school. I have used a little bit of everything that there is. It seems like there is always one reason or another that I don&#x27;t use something anymore. I have used gel, pomade, paste, cream, etc. I stopped using most pomades due to them not being water soluble. After three washes, I&#x27;d still have residual product. If I used a water soluble pomade, it didn&#x27;t have any hold. Gel would dry and flake out. I&#x27;d look like I had psoriasis. Creams by other company&#x27;s was expensive and/or ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first started using Brylcreem about a year ago. I discovered it in my grandfathers hygiene bag while we were on a fishing trip one evening. I had always wondered what he used. This is a man that when his ball cap comes off, a come materializes quickly. He to me that he had used it since he was a teen in the early 1960&#x27;s. I figured why not, if he had that sort of track record and was still using it, it must have something going right for it. I have never been so pleased. It has just the right amount of hold. It conditions your hair and scalp, leaving your hair healthy and manageable. The best part to me though, I wash my hair once and it all comes out in the rinse. All in all, I won&#x27;t use anything else now.</li>
            <li> Classic greaser styling cream,  great on  all types of men&#x27;s  hair ,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like most hair gels so I was on the look out for something like a moose or hair cream. I found this and recognised their motto &amp;#34;a little dab will do ya&amp;#34; from Price is Right circa 1970s. I have been using it for a couple of weeks and I like it.</li>
            <li> All my husband could talk about, was how long he had use a tube of Brylcreem. He swears he had a tube since he was in High School. Well now he has a tube that will last until..........</li>
            <li> Gives hair a nice wet shine but has no hold to it.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do ya. Great to add a little shine and hold to you hair. This has been around for years and has not changed. I used it when I was a teenager to slick my hair back in the 60&#x27;s now I use it for a little shine and hold. Leaves hair soft and washes out.</li>
            <li> works great. Keeps my hair nice smooth and shiny. Brylcreem has been around for decades. My dad used it for long time. Now I&#x27;m using it</li>
            <li> Love the Brylcreem. I have curly hair and it calms it down so I can achieve any style I desire.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ask me, my wife will use nothing else for past 45 years and she is 85 and for awhile we couldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;find it and she tried other stuff which she says &amp;#34;can&#x27;t compare&amp;#34; to Brylcreem.  I even used it when I had&lt;br /&gt;hair don&#x27;t have none anymore but I used it for many of years.  Don&#x27;t stop making it...</li>
            <li> I looked into different hair products for my dry frizzy hair and found that brylcreem is awesome. It makes my hair feel good and gives me control without any stiffness i hate so much. I put it on after i take a shower and as my hair dries it does too and holds the shape. I usually wear my hair when it is shorter slightly spiked and when its longer brushed to the side. Perfect for both these options. I sure wish i tried this stuff when i had my really long hair. It was an afro pretty much and with this stuff i would have had beautiful curly locks.</li>
            <li> Want the Don Draper look? Brylcreem is the answer.  Incredible product that will never go out of style.</li>
            <li> Nice product and the price is much less than the same product at Rite-Aid Drug a store.</li>
            <li> Gives hair just enough weight to provide great control - but doesn&#x27;t make it look &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34;. It was good enough for Dad and now I know why.</li>
            <li> This product is very good, smells nice and provide a very good greaseless hold all day.  Sometimes the tried and true never fall out of favor, it just needs to be rediscovered.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> Really makes hair look darker,smells awesome,holds hair well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> I have been a longtime user of this product. However, I developed a serious scalp itch ever since they came out with the new &#x27;packaging&#x27;. The itch goes away a few days after I stop using it and comes back with force when I again resume its use. As of today I have once again stopped its usage.&lt;br /&gt;Has anybody else experienced a similar problem?</li>
            <li> My Husband LOVES brylcreem to keep his naturally curly hair flat without it looking greasy or like there is any jell in it</li>
            <li> I remember the product from the long ago: Tis true, a little dab will do ya! Maybe for some a BIG DAB will do ya!</li>
