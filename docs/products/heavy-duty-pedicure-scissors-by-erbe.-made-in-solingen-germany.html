            <li>Great quality!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>but they feel great in the hand.</li>
            <li>For most any woman they will be perfect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted with the control and feel these scissors.</li>
            <li>This tool is better than that one ever was although the Revlon was the best one I could find for many years.  </li>
            <li>Great pair, get it, these scissors are much better then pair that cost three times this price.</li>
            <li>Quality stuff, made by skilled workers who are paid a good wage.</li>
            <li>Nice quality.</li>
            <li>and I am sure it will be as good or better than what I&#x27;ve had for 20 years.  </li>
            <li>I never had these kind of scissors before, but I&#x27;m glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li>However these scissors are VERY precise and controllable.  </li>
            <li>I have not found these to be any better than the ones from Revlon.  </li>
            <li>This cost more but puts to shame the flimsy scissors in the corner drugstore</li>
            <li>I have purchased 5 different products that claim to be best.</li>
            <li>So much better than nail clippers.</li>
            <li>They cut nails easily and cleanly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They have a smooth glide when opening and closing.  </li>
            <li>These scissors feel comfortable in my hand.  </li>
            <li>I almost wonder if I got a knock off instead of the authentic product, since others gave these such good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Just purchased these scissors and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>My husband has large hands and his fingers fine.</li>
            <li>They are a bit pricy, but they are much better than my old drugstore nail scissors.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice pair of what I think are professional pedicure scissors, but I am not a professional manicurist.  </li>
            <li>Make bigger scissors and a greater range of people can use them.</li>
            <li>probably the only one I&#x27;ve ever used that is actually competent to cut toe nails.  </li>
            <li>Sharp, precise and easy to use.</li>
            <li>These are good strong scissors but based on the other reviews I expected them to be stronger than they really are.</li>
            <li>These scissors are made very well.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and cuts very well.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>Long handles make it easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know who these Heavy Duty Pedicure Scissors by Erbe were designed for, but to be fair to consumers they should have some sort of comparison picture to show the \\&quot;relative size\\&quot; of these scissors.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how much better they cut all the way through my big toenail with one hand applying moderate pressure.</li>
            <li>These are high quality cutters.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>Sturdy and functional, worth the extra money</li>
            <li>The holes in the fingers are too small to have them pivot to use on toenails... they could be more oval shaped.</li>
            <li>I am certain if they are not misused these scissors will last forever.</li>
            <li>Finally, I&#x27;ve found a tool for ladies toe nails that replaces my old large Revlon one from the 1980&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I think these scissors would work for most larger hands because in using them the ring won&#x27;t go much past the first knuckle on the thumb and the middle (3rd) finger.</li>
            <li>Big chunk of metal, it does not look like you can damage them with normal use.</li>
            <li>and I can evenly cut the nail down just as close as possible to the quick.  </li>
            <li>My fingers are not large, but too large for these.</li>

            <li> I expect them to last a long time.</li>
            <li> The Japanese made clippers type cuts but is no good where my toenails curve in very drastically as they do not open wide enough.</li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long to buy you?</li>
            <li> I would say they are heavy duty as they cut my mother&#x27;s nails that are thickened and harder than normal.</li>
            <li> When these arrived I did not try them for 2 months, as they looked dainty and  not up to the job of cutting my thick and hard toenails.</li>
            <li> She is 91 and her feet are very crippled, consequently her toe nails are quite deformed and some of them are very hard to cut.</li>
            <li> These scissors work really well for tough toenails.</li>
            <li> so if you get it, be careful.</li>
            <li> worked well, but I previously had another german made scissors which I preferred but somehow misplaced.</li>
            <li> Her toe nails left uncut had grown wildly around her toes and others</li>
            <li> They appear to be made of quality stainless steel; they look and feel expensive.</li>
            <li> Finally found a pair of  scissors  that could cut my thick toenails.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and no wholes between blades.</li>
            <li> It was expensive back then but the replacement isn&#x27;t the same tool.  </li>
            <li> the holes are too tight for me.</li>
            <li> Buy them you tight wads.</li>
            <li> They are indeed heavy duty and very sharp.</li>
            <li> Well-made and very sharp!</li>
            <li> I can cut slowly and evenly, with controlled preciseness in cutting exactly where the nail needs to be cut</li>
            <li> These scissors are very stiff and difficult to use and they also are not very sharp.</li>
            <li> I had tried a pair of pedicure scissors that I had purchased from Sally&#x27;s and found it useless as it was too hard safely to control what I was cutting (I returned them!).    </li>
            <li> If you have hard nails</li>
            <li> I still needed to also use a clippers along with these to get at some areas, but the clippers could not do what these can and the other scissors types just failed to cut.</li>
            <li> I found it impossible to cut them with a standard clipper of any size.  </li>

            <li> Wow!!! If you have hard nails they are PERFECT FOR YOU !!!.  Not only for pedicure, but you can use them even for children. Great quality!</li>
            <li> I have not found these to be any better than the ones from Revlon.  They are no sharper.  I almost wonder if I got a knock off instead of the authentic product, since others gave these such good reviews.  There is no mention of a lifetime warranty on the packaging.</li>
            <li> These scissors are very stiff and difficult to use and they also are not very sharp. I do not recommend them.</li>
            <li> Sharp, precise and easy to use. My husband has large hands and his fingers fine. I recommend these.</li>
            <li> I never had these kind of scissors before, but I&#x27;m glad I purchased them. My husband loves these as well.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and functional, worth the extra money</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who these Heavy Duty Pedicure Scissors by Erbe were designed for, but to be fair to consumers they should have some sort of comparison picture to show the \\&quot;relative size\\&quot; of these scissors. The holes in the fingers are too small to have them pivot to use on toenails... they could be more oval shaped. My fingers are not large, but too large for these. So, I can&#x27;t comment on the materials and sharpness.  Make bigger scissors and a greater range of people can use them.</li>
            <li> Finally, I&#x27;ve found a tool for ladies toe nails that replaces my old large Revlon one from the 1980&#x27;s.  It was expensive back then but the replacement isn&#x27;t the same tool.  This tool is better than that one ever was although the Revlon was the best one I could find for many years.  This tool&lt;br /&gt;is probably the only one I&#x27;ve ever used that is actually competent to cut toe nails.  Mine are fine-medium thickness.  For heavier nails, there is a bigger heavier cutter by Erbe.  I bought that for my husband and he loves it.  It is way sharper than this one so if you get it, be careful.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  They are a bit pricy, but they are much better than my old drugstore nail scissors.</li>
            <li> I had some like these and lost them, so this is a replacement and I am sure it will be as good or better than what I&#x27;ve had for 20 years.  I have not tried them out yet but they feel great in the hand.</li>
            <li> These are high quality cutters.  They cut nails easily and cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;However, the finger holes seem to be sized for women--- the holes are too tight for me.</li>
            <li> For centuries, the name Solingen has meant quality. It still does. This cost more but puts to shame the flimsy scissors in the corner drugstore</li>
            <li> When these arrived I did not try them for 2 months, as they looked dainty and  not up to the job of cutting my thick and hard toenails. I have purchased 5 different products that claim to be best. The Japanese made clippers type cuts but is no good where my toenails curve in very drastically as they do not open wide enough. The scissors type would be better for curving areas as they open wider, but they do not cut well and when the others failed to cut through this morning (one of them only put a crease in my toenail even though I used both hands to apply pressure)  I finally tried these. I could not believe how much better they cut all the way through my big toenail with one hand applying moderate pressure. I still needed to also use a clippers along with these to get at some areas, but the clippers could not do what these can and the other scissors types just failed to cut.</li>
            <li> Well-made and very sharp!</li>
            <li> Just purchased these scissors and so far so good.  They are indeed heavy duty and very sharp. I expect them to last a long time.</li>
            <li> WOW!! These scissors are made very well. Big chunk of metal, it does not look like you can damage them with normal use. Very sharp and no wholes between blades. You can adjust them too if it will be needed in the future. Great pair, get it, these scissors are much better then pair that cost three times this price.</li>
            <li> So much better than nail clippers. Why did I wait so long to buy you? (Made in Germany, not China. Quality stuff, made by skilled workers who are paid a good wage. The Germans figured out how to keep a hand in manufacturing, while we just outsourced everything to the Chinese.)</li>
            <li> Finally found a pair of  scissors  that could cut my thick toenails. Walmart only has junk, these scissors work like a dream. Buy them you tight wads.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and cuts very well.  Long handles make it easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> These scissors work really well for tough toenails. Nice quality.</li>
            <li> These are good strong scissors but based on the other reviews I expected them to be stronger than they really are.</li>
            <li> Great! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> worked well, but I previously had another german made scissors which I preferred but somehow misplaced.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice pair of what I think are professional pedicure scissors, but I am not a professional manicurist.  I regularly cut my mother&#x27;s nails which are problematic.  She is 91 and her feet are very crippled, consequently her toe nails are quite deformed and some of them are very hard to cut. Her toe nails left uncut had grown wildly around her toes and others were growing up and hitting the tops of her slippers. I found it impossible to cut them with a standard clipper of any size.  I had tried a pair of pedicure scissors that I had purchased from Sally&#x27;s and found it useless as it was too hard safely to control what I was cutting (I returned them!).    However these scissors are VERY precise and controllable.  I can cut slowly and evenly, with controlled preciseness in cutting exactly where the nail needs to be cut and I can evenly cut the nail down just as close as possible to the quick.  I&#x27;m delighted with the control and feel these scissors. They appear to be made of quality stainless steel; they look and feel expensive. They have a smooth glide when opening and closing.  I would say they are heavy duty as they cut my mother&#x27;s nails that are thickened and harder than normal. These scissors feel comfortable in my hand.  The inner aspect of the finger and thumb rings measures 0.8 x 0.7 inch (or 1.27 x 2.032 cm) at the widest aspect. Please see photos with a measuring tape in inches.  I think these scissors would work for most larger hands because in using them the ring won&#x27;t go much past the first knuckle on the thumb and the middle (3rd) finger. For most any woman they will be perfect.  I am certain if they are not misused these scissors will last forever.</li>
