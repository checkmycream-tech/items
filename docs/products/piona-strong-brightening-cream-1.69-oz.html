            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t see any difference, even with using the soap as well.</li>
            <li>Best product to clear up your skin.</li>
            <li>This cream has done a wonderful job in helping me clear up my PIH.  </li>
            <li>can only take their own chance on this product, as others have done and have had wonderful results.</li>
            <li>This cream is very light on the skin.</li>
            <li>However it did lighten the surrounding healthy skin quite a bit.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really been using this product, but it&#x27;s great .</li>
            <li>and I still can wear my makeup on top of it, I just make sure to wash my face as soon as I get home.</li>
            <li>Tried many brands.</li>
            <li>I have, not draw more attention to it.</li>
            <li>My homemade vitamin C serum works way better and</li>
            <li>I noticed more of a brightness and softer touch.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and GREAT service from this company.</li>
            <li>Good price &amp; Very fast delivery &amp;#34;GOOD SELLER&amp;#34; 5*+++++</li>
            <li>The smell wasn&#x27;t strong, like most bleaching creams.</li>
            <li>Not a stinky smell,just a strong smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im assuming the drying effect was because it is a strong bleaching cream.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s a huge difference  </li>
            <li>Im Happy that I have confidence to go outside without wearing makeup!</li>
            <li>perfect works within a few days</li>
            <li>I dab this on with Symba Skin Lite N Smooth Cream and by the morning, my scars are SIGNIFICANTLY reduced.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to see results so quick especially since the discolouration on my body and face have always made me feel self concious.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it made a significant difference in the discoloration in my face</li>
            <li>but surely, you have to be consistent with washing face 2x a day and applying cream</li>
            <li>In 3 weeks, I have noticed a significant lightening of my skin.</li>
            <li>but it did give me a couple of light patches on my neck but other than that its great</li>
            <li>Effective but doesn&#x27;t spread too easily and kind of heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good spot treated</li>
            <li>I love this product, it really works.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t work as strongly as I was hoping, but I did noticed my acne scars have faded a little, so I&#x27;m happy with that.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work as quickly as others have claimed, but it works.</li>
            <li>so I used this to get my skin back nice caramel light brown</li>
            <li>It absolutely works and the results happen very quickly.</li>
            <li>This is the first, affordable product that has ever worked!</li>
            <li>Love this product ..stay away from direct heat abd sunlight</li>
            <li>Im constantly complimented daily on how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li>Works very very well.</li>
            <li>Very fast.</li>
            <li>Very much recommended.</li>
            <li>I noticed my face get a couple of shades lighter within the first week.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s supposed to be runny then perhaps the manufacturer should put one of those protective films over the jar as to prevent spilling when opening the jar for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mom and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>Real talk right now..</li>
            <li>This product left my skin bright red and burned looking.</li>
            <li>I decided to apply it on certain parts that were affected by my first pregnancy, close to 16 years ago.</li>
            <li>This cream is amazing  my dark spots are lighter  and  my skin is glowing  </li>
            <li>I used this product exactly as recommended, and I do not expose my legs to the sun as I am very self-conscious of them.</li>
            <li>Again this worked for me thanks ;)</li>
            <li>This cream is amazing but the size is to small, of course and for the price its worth  </li>
            <li>It works really fast.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to use much to cover an area, but for me it did not work at all.</li>
            <li>It took about two weeks for me to notice the much darker areas like my elbows and knees.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li>Works better than I expected</li>
            <li>It works really fast. .</li>
            <li>This cream really works.  </li>
            <li>it really work and it works fast.</li>
            <li>I had to stop using for a bit because my skin was lightening fast.</li>
            <li>Just to specify, I applied the cream, generously, in these areas, for 3 weeks, straight.</li>
            <li>I guess some people really work for them.</li>
            <li>8 shades lighter thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited&lt;</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I see a 50% reduction in my uneven tone and brown spots.</li>
            <li>I do have a rich yellow undertone</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what kind of texture</li>
            <li>I didnt want to pay for the high price 7% HQ from the dr.</li>
            <li>After the first week of daily use, my hands, feet, and neck were much lighter.</li>
            <li>Outstanding for black old acne marks.</li>
            <li>but I do have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I saw a big differences the first time I use this cream..</li>
            <li>light-skinned black woman, light coffee complexion.</li>
            <li>Enough melanin to make every mark super dark, and light enough that they stand out like beacons.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad, like other lightening products.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for fast acting, don&#x27;t purchase.</li>
            <li>I used it for 3 times so far</li>
            <li>Used it all over but really targeted my face only</li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>As far as the acne scars I have yet to see a difference.</li>
            <li>I had to cease using this cream as it worked so rapidly that I developed a melasama looking discoloration on my face .</li>
            <li>If applying to face use very sparingly and or mix it with facial lotion to help ease the rapid bleaching and prevent hypersensitivity of the skin.</li>
            <li>Cleared my dark spots up quickly...</li>
            <li>I used it on my face ,hands, implant scars and my private parts now that I am getting older my skin  </li>
            <li>Since applying this, I have noticed a major change in color pigment on both areas.</li>
            <li>From dark it became redish which is a little bit better.</li>
            <li>I have hyper pigmentation left from acne, my skin is oily, sensitive, and acne prone.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a small difference after the very first  day.</li>
            <li>Other than that the cream really, really works.</li>
            <li>It is not thick and sticky like other skin lighteners.</li>
            <li>Works very well on Dark African American Skin.</li>

            <li> Works very well on Dark African American Skin.</li>
            <li> But I will say I am still waiting for my dark spots to be completely gone.</li>
            <li> but like the others said you have to be careful because if you need it just clear up spots then you need to be careful and apply just to the spots only</li>
            <li> My spots have faded significantly, to the point where I use a little tinted mineral powder for makeup, as opposed to the thick cover-up I was reaching for 2 months ago.</li>
            <li> Not other dark marks.</li>
            <li> I saw a minor improvement</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t take long</li>
            <li> the trick-- didn&#x27;t take long either.</li>
            <li> my grandma is Asian, native American and black.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to lighten dark spots but I was using it on my entire face, so I started to just to spot treatment which can be tedious because you&#x27;ll need to be precise.</li>
            <li> When I started using it it made my skin dry and flaky but after 3 days my discolouration seemed to be fading away.</li>
            <li> but my face has some dark spots that only concealer will cover up, but</li>
            <li> but it left dark areas in my face</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is when a get a mosquito bite or a blackhead, it will turn black on my face and not bleach out for two to four weeks.  </li>
            <li> I only notice a slight difference under my eyes.</li>
            <li> NOTHING BUT REGRETS FOR ME.</li>
            <li> Spent lots of money and nothing till I bought this product.</li>
            <li> Right now I use it twice per day, but I can see myself cutting back after two weeks to just once per day.</li>
            <li> , I use this in conjunction with Dark Angels from Lush and its working slowly</li>
            <li> This does not lighten your skin to the extreme extent.</li>
            <li> The only downside was the small breakouts.</li>
            <li> Just like the other 1 star reviews said.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but after reading reviews I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Once I reached the desired result I will probably go every other day.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what that other reviewer is talking about that it smells &amp;</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because I&#x27;ve tried it on other parts of my body and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m noticing that my dark circles around my eyes are beginning to fade.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m naturally dark skin</li>
            <li> I was dark skin</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Using it on dark, discolored elbows and see them lightening after 11 days.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream to fade a dark spot on my thigh that was caused from a scar.</li>
            <li> Difference seen within a week and a half</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine anyone giving it less than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve tried natural methods, spent money on expensive products and even considered harsh cosmetic treatments.</li>
            <li> Also has a little smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a little over a week.</li>
            <li> But im not giving up hope because it might take a little longer for those.</li>
            <li> i was very very dark skinned</li>
            <li> However if bought this for some dark scars I&#x27;ve had and it has helped very little.</li>
            <li> I have a few bloches on my skin which are now disappearing.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had years and years of sun damage, brown spots and an uneven tone.</li>
            <li> It brightens up the skin and takes away your uneven tone.</li>
            <li> Works no better than any other cream!</li>
            <li> and all I have left is worst hyperpigmentation than I started out with and a whole lot of regrets.</li>
            <li> not very effective, i dont see any results.</li>
            <li> Have to use small amount.</li>
            <li> Seems it&#x27;s hormonal, as it started as small islands that grew to continents on my forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to lighten my skin</li>
            <li> I honestly do not know what will.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s 2 weeks and still working slow</li>
            <li> i mean i noticed the difference in a week.</li>
            <li> This overpriced crap doesn&#x27;t work half as well as the extra strength Nadinola that I&#x27;ve been using for years on my knees, elbows and heels.</li>
            <li> A little expensive for the ounces sold</li>
            <li> I tried everything: all the expensive creams, some that worked a little (Obagi), some not at all (Clinique).</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get dramatic results, but it will silghtly fade discoloration.</li>
            <li> Not only did my hyperpigmentation got worst but it also changed the texture of  the areas I was trying to treat with a semi-gritty feel.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Way to expensive for the amount</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> discovered Piona in one of my desperate searches.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this cream is a miracle!</li>
            <li> I find it to be very expensive.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have any bad reaction whatsoever</li>
            <li> irritate my skin  soooo bad.</li>
            <li> Smells good.a lot of lightening cream smell really bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product, love it, you will notice results with just one week of use. I would recommend their soap as well.</li>
            <li> This does not lighten your skin to the extreme extent. I honestly do not know what will. However if bought this for some dark scars I&#x27;ve had and it has helped very little. From dark it became redish which is a little bit better. However it did lighten the surrounding healthy skin quite a bit. Overall it&#x27;s a good spot treated but if u want effective results go see a dermatologist. My friend who is African American did not achieve skin lightning. I wish I knew Rihanna or nicki ninja dermatologist because those kinds of effects will NOT be achieved with this cream.</li>
            <li> Took a chance and bought this and all I have left is worst hyperpigmentation than I started out with and a whole lot of regrets. I used this product exactly as recommended, and I do not expose my legs to the sun as I am very self-conscious of them. Not only did my hyperpigmentation got worst but it also changed the texture of  the areas I was trying to treat with a semi-gritty feel.&lt;br /&gt;One can only take their own chance on this product, as others have done and have had wonderful results. NOTHING BUT REGRETS FOR ME.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really been using this product, but it&#x27;s great . It does the job. If you&#x27;re looking for fast acting, don&#x27;t purchase. Will take time to notice difference. Also has a little smell. Not a stinky smell,just a strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to act faster,purchase the soap and serum from piona.</li>
            <li> Love this product ..stay away from direct heat abd sunlight</li>
            <li> Made a huge difference clearing up acne spots must use twice a day!! Difference seen within a week and a half</li>
            <li> It worked really good. My skin is lighter and even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving a 4 star because of the size and price. I find it to be very expensive. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a little over a week. I&#x27;m noticing that my dark circles around my eyes are beginning to fade. I have a few bloches on my skin which are now disappearing. I use the Pione soap along with the cream. Im Happy that I have confidence to go outside without wearing makeup! I will be purchasing this stuff in the future!</li>
            <li> It works really fast. I saw a noticeably difference in two weeks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to use much to cover an area, but for me it did not work at all. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it made a significant difference in the discoloration in my face but I have seen some difference, I use this in conjunction with Dark Angels from Lush and its working slowly but surely, you have to be consistent with washing face 2x a day and applying cream, I&#x27;m naturally dark skin but my face has some dark spots that only concealer will cover up, but I think if I keep using this eventually that won&#x27;t be the case. And it didn&#x27;t make me break out or anything, I apply this and I still can wear my makeup on top of it, I just make sure to wash my face as soon as I get home.</li>
            <li> with only 3 days of using this product i noticed a shade lighter on my skin.</li>
            <li> Can be used alone or with the soap.  I used both for the beginning.</li>
            <li> Love! Works very very well. Very fast. African American woman here.</li>
            <li> Effective but doesn&#x27;t spread too easily and kind of heavy on the skin. Have to use small amount. Didn&#x27;t have any bad reaction whatsoever and I use it multiple times a day on my face. Also it took a while to get used to the smell.</li>
            <li> I used it all over. The smell wasn&#x27;t strong, like most bleaching creams. I noticed my face get a couple of shades lighter within the first week. After the first week of daily use, my hands, feet, and neck were much lighter. It took about two weeks for me to notice the much darker areas like my elbows and knees. But by the time I noticed a difference, the 2oz was finished. I&#x27;ll definitely order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. The only downside was the small breakouts. Piona + Sunscreen &#x3D; Clogged Pores.</li>
            <li> This is a great product it lighten my skin so good. Best product to clear up your skin. I was dark skin now I am a lot lighter.</li>
            <li> Tried many brands. Spent lots of money and nothing till I bought this product. It works!</li>
            <li> Works no better than any other cream! Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This overpriced crap doesn&#x27;t work half as well as the extra strength Nadinola that I&#x27;ve been using for years on my knees, elbows and heels.</li>
            <li> not very effective, i dont see any results.</li>
            <li> I saw a minor improvement</li>
            <li> Terrible!! Just like the other 1 star reviews said. This product left my skin bright red and burned looking. The skin is thicker and leathery there now. Bad stuff! I wanted to reduce the melasma I have, not draw more attention to it. I should have and did know better! My homemade vitamin C serum works way better and thankfully my plantain healing salve calmed the redness that Piona left. Just skip it people! Not worth it.</li>
            <li> This product worked amazingly without drying my skin and the discoloration went away in a couple of weeks of using it as directed.</li>
            <li> Great product I love it for knees and elbows and hands</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  It really works.</li>
            <li> Good price &amp; Very fast delivery &amp;#34;GOOD SELLER&amp;#34; 5*+++++</li>
            <li> It was very good so I order the bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all makes your skin peel terrible</li>
            <li> Great cream. don&#x27;t really like the smell. I suggest wearing gloves when applying. I was skeptical at first but after reading reviews I gave it a try. glad I did because this worked very effectively. started to see results within a week! thank you!</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected</li>
            <li> I will not hesitate to purchase again, the seller is very prompt with delivery and the product is awesome!</li>
            <li> It works really fast. .</li>
            <li> Way to expensive for the amount and it&#x27;s 2 weeks and still working slow smh</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t see any difference, even with using the soap as well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say whether this product will work or not. I used it for 3 times so far and the odor is very strong and toxic!  I can feel it when I breath in the odor and it caused my eyes to water. I&#x27;m returning the product.  It doesn&#x27;t feel safe for me!</li>
            <li> Really love this product! but like the others said you have to be careful because if you need it just clear up spots then you need to be careful and apply just to the spots only, otherwise it will have you entire face lightened and the spots will take longer to disappear.</li>
            <li> This item was very disappointing&lt;br /&gt;I religiously used it with no change in complexion. Would definitely not recommend.</li>
            <li> Wow! does this stuff work!! I noticed a small difference after the very first  day. Now it is day 4 and I can honestly say I see a 50% reduction in my uneven tone and brown spots. I am thrilled! Right now I use it twice per day, but I can see myself cutting back after two weeks to just once per day. Once I reached the desired result I will probably go every other day. This product is amazing. It is not thick and sticky like other skin lighteners. The smell is not bad, like other lightening products. I have no idea what that other reviewer is talking about that it smells &amp;#34;toxic.&amp;#34;  Not my experience at all. I would definitely recommend. I had years and years of sun damage, brown spots and an uneven tone. This product works. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone giving it less than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Used it all over but really targeted my face only</li>
            <li> Lightens as described</li>
            <li> Real talk right now.. I saw a big differences the first time I use this cream..</li>
            <li> it did not work or me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product yet but to leave a review I have to give it stars, this review is for the packaging...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product literally just arrived at my door. I opened the package... Opened the jar... and a bunch of it spilled out! I&#x27;m not sure what kind of texture it&#x27;s supposed to have, but it&#x27;s quite runny and I wasn&#x27;t expecting that. I was expecting a cream. If it&#x27;s supposed to be runny then perhaps the manufacturer should put one of those protective films over the jar as to prevent spilling when opening the jar for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to start using it tonight, so we&#x27;ll see if the product actually works.</li>
            <li> This cream really works.  The only problem I have is when a get a mosquito bite or a blackhead, it will turn black on my face and not bleach out for two to four weeks.  Is there anything I can do about that as I still have acne.  Other than that the cream really, really works.</li>
            <li> Works awesome! Cleared my dark spots up quickly...within 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> this product is awesome. it really work and it works fast. I had to stop using for a bit because my skin was lightening fast. I purchased this product to lighten dark spots but I was using it on my entire face, so I started to just to spot treatment which can be tedious because you&#x27;ll need to be precise. you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> In 3 weeks, I have noticed a significant lightening of my skin. It didn&#x27;t work as quickly as others have claimed, but it works. I use Kojic Acid soap with it.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this product to reduce the appearance of my acne scars. I decided to apply it on certain parts that were affected by my first pregnancy, close to 16 years ago. Needless to say, this cream is a miracle! I have suffered from pigment discoloration, since then, around my stomach and arms. Since applying this, I have noticed a major change in color pigment on both areas. Just to specify, I applied the cream, generously, in these areas, for 3 weeks, straight. For years, I&#x27;ve tried natural methods, spent money on expensive products and even considered harsh cosmetic treatments. This is the first, affordable product that has ever worked! I will definitely be purchasing this product again and again!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work for me. I used it for 3days now and I get rashes/irritate my skin  soooo bad. I see spots  into my face after using for 3 days this product.  see my Derma this  Monday .  I guess some people really work for them. 1star for this product for me.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work as strongly as I was hoping, but I did noticed my acne scars have faded a little, so I&#x27;m happy with that. You won&#x27;t get dramatic results, but it will silghtly fade discoloration.</li>
            <li> Best cream on the market.  Works very well on Dark African American Skin. Im constantly complimented daily on how great my skin looks. A little expensive for the ounces sold but it is a wonderful product! I love it!</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from hyper pigmentation for a couple of years now. Seems it&#x27;s hormonal, as it started as small islands that grew to continents on my forehead and cheeks. I&#x27;m a mixed race, light-skinned black woman, light coffee complexion. The WORST for this type of condition. Enough melanin to make every mark super dark, and light enough that they stand out like beacons. I tried everything: all the expensive creams, some that worked a little (Obagi), some not at all (Clinique). I even had a laser treatment for darker skin, which helped a bit, but requires repeat visits. The spots remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered Piona in one of my desperate searches. Wish I found this sooner. It absolutely works and the results happen very quickly. I have been at it religiously for 2 months, and am out of my 1 ounce jar. My spots have faded significantly, to the point where I use a little tinted mineral powder for makeup, as opposed to the thick cover-up I was reaching for 2 months ago. For anyone suffering from this condition, I can&#x27;t recommend enough. I know your pain! This will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, with any lightening agent, you have to be diligent about sun protections and RE-APPLYING SPF. Even when I&#x27;m just hanging out in the house before taking my shower, I put SPF on my spots. Good luck!</li>
            <li> This cream is very light on the skin. I noticed more of a brightness and softer touch. Didn&#x27;t bleach skin which is what I like the best.</li>
            <li> perfect works within a few days</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to lighten my skin I do have a rich yellow undertone but my face gets darker than my body ugh!!! But this is working I just wanted to even out my skin tone my grandma is Asian, native American and black.I did a 30% tca peel but it left dark areas in my face so I used this to get my skin back nice caramel light brown I didnt want to pay for the high price 7% HQ from the dr. Again this worked for me thanks ;)</li>
            <li> Smells good.a lot of lightening cream smell really bad but this one smells good.</li>
            <li> 8 shades lighter thanks</li>
            <li> It seems to be working! Using it on dark, discolored elbows and see them lightening after 11 days. And, my face &amp; neck are beginning to match my chest color, which doesn&#x27;t get sun exposure.</li>
            <li> I started  using  the cream 1 week ago...and there&#x27;s a huge difference  in  my  skin...This cream is amazing  my dark spots are lighter  and  my skin is glowing  ...worth the money</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream to fade a dark spot on my thigh that was caused from a scar. Well it definitely lightened everything around it.. so it does work. I think its best for acne scars or pimple marks. Not other dark marks. But im not giving up hope because it might take a little longer for those.</li>
            <li> This bleaching cream is the holy grail of bleaching creams! When I started using it it made my skin dry and flaky but after 3 days my discolouration seemed to be fading away. Im assuming the drying effect was because it is a strong bleaching cream. I was so happy to see results so quick especially since the discolouration on my body and face have always made me feel self concious. I recommend this</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she absolutely loves it! It brightens up the skin and takes away your uneven tone. The packaging isn&#x27;t all that great (not because of the seller but because of the company) but it still works. Fast shipping and GREAT service from this company. Very much recommended. Will keep purchasing in the future.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing but the size is to small, of course and for the price its worth  the price but the size should  be bigger I used it on my face ,hands, implant scars and my private parts now that I am getting older my skin  pigmentation on my private lady parts are getting darker so I used piona and it actually worked on all my parts but it did give me a couple of light patches on my neck but other than that its great , I tried finding it  somewhere to buy in my city  but i could only find  it here  on amazon</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product does work. i was very very dark skinned and i have tried a lot of creams but nothing has ever worked for me  like this and it didn&#x27;t take long i mean i noticed the difference in a week. I would highly&lt;br /&gt;recommended it to anyone thats trying to lighten their face. My phone won&#x27;t let me take a picture sorry wow.  Mrs Z from  Chicago</li>
            <li> I love this product, it really works.</li>
            <li> My skin has gotten one shade lighter in 4 days. But I will say I am still waiting for my dark spots to be completely gone.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s some background: I&#x27;m African American.  I have hyper pigmentation left from acne, my skin is oily, sensitive, and acne prone.  This cream has done a wonderful job in helping me clear up my PIH.  I&#x27;ve been struggling with removing these spots for years and this did the trick-- didn&#x27;t take long either. I think the biggest thing in making this work for you is dabbing it on the spot (not rubbing it in) and leaving it on overnight.  I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because I&#x27;ve tried it on other parts of my body and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well. Also, I use a number of products so I can&#x27;t say all of my progress is from this alone.  I dab this on with Symba Skin Lite N Smooth Cream and by the morning, my scars are SIGNIFICANTLY reduced.  Just in one night.  I encourage you all to do this. You&#x27;ll be stunned at the outcome!</li>
            <li> The creami is good could be recommended</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t start using it. Yet so that is why I&#x27;m giving it a 3 I will update it in about 2 weeks. I&#x27;m really excited&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about a week and couple of days since I start using this product. I only notice a slight difference under my eyes. As far as the acne scars I have yet to see a difference. I still have another 2 weeks of using this cream.</li>
            <li> Works TOO well ! I had to cease using this cream as it worked so rapidly that I developed a melasama looking discoloration on my face . I only used it twice a day as directed. Outstanding for black old acne marks. If applying to face use very sparingly and or mix it with facial lotion to help ease the rapid bleaching and prevent hypersensitivity of the skin. I had a lot of itching and burning on my face but I do have very sensitive skin. Adjust usage accordingly.</li>
