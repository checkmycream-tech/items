            <li>My goal is to see better results in 90 days and that will determine whither I continue using the product.</li>
            <li>makes your hair grow rapidly probably 1.5 times the rate be warned hair will grow fast all over your body lol.</li>
            <li>but there are more affordable options.  </li>
            <li>However it did make me break out more.</li>
            <li>I just make sure to take them with something to mask the taste.</li>
            <li>Overall great product and would recommend to anyone looking to help thier hair grow faster and thicker!!</li>
            <li>While taking this vitamin I have noticed my hair texture is softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I am all for being healthy, and herbal vitamins.  </li>
            <li>and I already love it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use this product because my hair is thinning at the top</li>
            <li>Okay so I&#x27;m not going to sugar coat any of this.</li>
            <li>These pictures of people saying it grew so much in so many weeks</li>
            <li>Glad it worked for them..</li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re suppose to smell/taste minty not terrible.</li>
            <li>thank you for being so kind and genuine with me</li>
            <li>Go to this site ( http://freemanwraps.myitworks.com )  to see more</li>
            <li>Mostly because of the price.</li>
            <li>The amount of the ingredients is so over the top that it is wasteful.</li>
            <li>it makes all hair grow faster, so expect to shave more.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m SO glad I did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;·  Promotes healthy cell growth, strength, and shine</li>
            <li>Love this product,  I have received so many compliments from people when I&#x27;m out about how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li>Eating healthy and drinking water will work better than any pill</li>
            <li>make sure u eat before u take</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to help you purchase this</li>
            <li>Have to take it over a month to see results , nails are stronger and my hair seems to be growing better .</li>
            <li>and I love the hair skin and nail vitamins.</li>
            <li>my hair has grown more about 2 inches.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure you know somebody who is a distributor.</li>
            <li>After trying so many products claiming to help and all of them failing to do so</li>
            <li>I am on my 3rd bottle and im very happy.</li>
            <li>a buy another one to see if it will this time but for the most part its all the people who sell it uping it and making it seem like a miracle drug.</li>
            <li>i think i will need 2 more</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I love this product, my nails are stronger and my skin is clearer.</li>
            <li>but I made sure to take pics to document the change.</li>
            <li>You can contact me for details, questions or discounts anytime 714-497-3244 :)</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>its ok.</li>
            <li>My hair grew an inch in the first two weeks!!!</li>
            <li>so much she joined as a distributor :) They have amazing health benefits!</li>
            <li>A childhood friend claimed she used a wrap and dietary supplement made by this company to lose a large amount of weight and she looks amazing!  </li>
            <li>Now, I stopped taking them a couple of months ago and noticed that my hair growth slowed, my nails break more easily, and I see more hair in the shower drain.</li>
            <li>I will continue to keep using it as long as I am seeing these awesome results.</li>
            <li>It did make my hair grow about an inche after like 5-6 weeks which was pretty good for me, but it also makes my face break out</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t purchased for me, but she is extremely happy with the product and the performance so far.</li>
            <li>my sister and my mother loved them so much too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has experienced this, but the first time I took these pills was right before bedtime.</li>
            <li>the pills are easy to swallow and easy on the stomach.</li>
            <li>They still split but they don&#x27;t bend as easily.  </li>
            <li>Since taking the Hair, Skin and Nails product my nails have grown and are strong.  </li>
            <li>Plus, if you sign up as a loyal customer, you&#x27;ll get these for $33!  </li>
            <li>I can get this product for $33 as a loyal customer from an It Works distributor!  </li>
            <li>and honestly I can&#x27;t tell if my hair has grown more because of this product or if it&#x27;s the natural growth I would see without taking the supplement.</li>
            <li>Plus, when you purchase through a distributor you earn free product and free shipping (my dad just earned $100 in free product after being a customer for 7 months).</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy my hair looks and feels healthier.</li>
            <li>i just got mines today the pills are not crushed but they do smell like some kind of grass!</li>
            <li>She liked it so much that she is now a distributor and urged me to try this product for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also important to take it every day.</li>
            <li>Supports the body’s defenses against free radical damage&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>We have amazing products that really work.</li>
            <li>My face had fewer pimples and felt smooth.</li>
            <li>I saw so many good results and prayed I would get the same!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still beautiful and long, but I will be taking them again in order to get my hair to my desired length.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>when I was a senior in high school (5 years ago) I thought it would be awesome to have bleach blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product that I am ordering my a second one! :)</li>
            <li>Great product and opportunity to sign up as a loyal customer or distributor for big discounts at www.coachslaton.myitworks.com</li>
            <li>If you are interested in purchasing, be sure to purchase from an It Works distributor.  </li>
            <li>I was so so excited when I was researching this product.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>I bought them mostly for my skin and nails and within the first couple of weeks did see a noticeable improvement in my nails.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product im done with my first 60 pills</li>
            <li>I recommend buying this from an actual distributor to ensure that you are getting the real thing, but I think that Amazon is a great place to check out some honest reviews first.</li>
            <li>please contact a local distributor to guarantee good fresh products that will work!</li>
            <li>My mom loved both of those + the facial &amp; body applicators (used on chin/neck &amp; stomach)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve almost finished one bottle and so far I&#x27;d say the results are pretty good.</li>
            <li>If you enroll as loyal $33 each month for 3 months autoshipment, even retail is cheaper.</li>
            <li>Would be $55 for non loyal customers.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say my hair has grown tremendously after using It Works for over 6 months</li>
            <li>Sign up as a Loyal Customer and save.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re, looking for a cheaper price as a loyal customer go to my website:  </li>
            <li>If you have issues with hair re growth or just want longer hair quickly try this product.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is growing quickly.  </li>
            <li>loyal customer price $33</li>
            <li>Sign up as a Loyal Customer( no sign up fees) for 60 tablets of HAIR SKIN AMD NAILS retail $55.00</li>
            <li>BUT THE perks as a loyal customer</li>
            <li>my daughter wanted this because after her son was born her gorgeous long hair started falling out</li>
            <li>With essential vitamins, minerals, and plant-based nutrients, Hair Skin Nails enhances your own natural collagen and keratin production, supports healthy cell growth, and boosts your body’s free radical fighting defenses.  </li>
            <li>It really does work!!</li>
            <li>email me at jenni.light@hotmail.com and let me know what products you are interested in!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li>I will say that the overall health of my hair is amazing.</li>
            <li>She is always available to answer any questions and she is very knowledgeable about the products.  </li>
            <li>I did not see AMAZING hair growth like it was advertised (which is disappointing after so many good reviews)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: if you&#x27;re looking for amazing hair growth, your only solution is time.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s soft, shiny and extremely healthy looking and feeling.</li>
            <li>Over two months, my hair has grown considerably, my nails have grown, and my skin just feels so much better.  </li>
            <li>you can see good improving but not fast as they tell.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so worth it.</li>
            <li>Always eat before you take them because on an empty stomach you won&#x27;t feel good after.</li>
            <li>Even my friends tell me my hair is growing super fast!</li>
            <li>Right before I purchased it I took out my extensions after having them in for 6 months.</li>
            <li>I bought this right from the vendor.</li>
            <li>so strong and long and even super shiny!</li>
            <li>However, after my third shipment (that&#x27;s the problem with loyal customer; you have to sign up for 3 months to get the better price), I&#x27;ll be sure to cancel any future orders.</li>
            <li>, my liver is finally returning to good lab results, my skin which once was one of my best traits, is now thick and rough..</li>
            <li>Finished the first bottle had to order again..</li>
            <li>i will update with a before and after pic when I&#x27;m done my first bottle</li>
            <li>Please talk with your doctor first though.</li>
            <li>I have not taken them consistently</li>
            <li>but when I first started taking them, just one a day, I noticed I started breaking out.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>In my opinion, most skin problems can be cured with proper face washing techniques and using quality foundation products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so i will be ordering my second soon :)</li>
            <li>Really does make a difference!</li>
            <li>From the first day I started using it</li>
            <li>You have to be very faithful to these pills and take them as directed if you want to see a change in your hair, skin and nails; just saying!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty neat product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first month of using it i could see a noticeable difference in length.</li>
            <li>I recommend maybe trying the ItWorks Greens first to help detox &amp; alkalize your body &amp; then try the HSN again if you wanna grow your hair, nails, or even just want healthier skin &amp; to boost your immune system.</li>
            <li>You can get it a lot cheaper www.annandamanda.myitworks.com by becoming a loyal customer as well as earn cash back on every purchase (perk points) Check around before spending too much.</li>
            <li>You can get it a lot cheaper www.annandamanda.myitworks.com by becoming a loyal customer as well as earn cash back on every purchase (perk points) Check around before spending too much.</li>
            <li>You can get it a lot cheaper at www.yourwrapgirlamanda.myitworks.com by becoming a loyal customer as well as earn cash back on every purchase (perk points) Check around before spending too much.</li>
            <li>No more peeling just strong healthy nails.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t care how good a product is no more auto-shipment orders for me.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that the pills had a sweet coating on it and a completely different smell, whereas the ones I purchased from the company had more of an light herbal smell and no sweet taste.</li>
            <li>I would suggest buying a similar product at a MUCH more pocket friendly price at your local drug store.</li>
            <li>TO BE HONEST, my hair grew maybe a little, not even an inch.</li>
            <li>This product is gentle on my stomach.  </li>
            <li>But my nails got much stronger and grew a lot faster.</li>
            <li>it works, really works.</li>
            <li>I just hope this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>The whole point of me taking all these pills was for my HAIR to grow.</li>
            <li>It has really helped increase growth after hair loss</li>
            <li>This stuff really works no joke</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t see any difference in my skin, but I don&#x27;t really have problem skin either.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say whether people with problem skin would benefit.</li>
            <li>I saw no difference in how much my hair or nails grew during the month</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>My eye lashes are so much fuller looking</li>
            <li>Not as fast as they say, but definatley does sumthin...</li>
            <li>Its real</li>
            <li>It will come straight from</li>
            <li>and it was much pricier on another site.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Much cheaper that way.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>After week one my hair stopped shedding so much and it felt healthier to the touch.</li>
            <li>It really does work</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care so much about that.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t grow much faster</li>
            <li>It makes my skin much clearer than when I don&#x27;t take it.  </li>
            <li>This product has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>I really could see the difference in the growth and strength of my hair.</li>
            <li>It really works. ...</li>
            <li>i havent seen much results from it after 2 orders of this product.</li>
            <li>My hair has really grown since using these vitamins.  </li>
            <li>The loyal customer program is pretty simple.</li>
            <li>Only $33 when you sign up as a loyal customer which is what I did</li>
            <li>but so far, the results seem to be positive.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see more hair, but I will have to wait a little bit longer to see if any results.</li>
            <li>And my hair not only grew but felt super soft!</li>
            <li>Its amazing that i have seen at least an entier inch grow in 2 months</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely still worth it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal thickness.</li>
            <li>Normally my hair grows about 1/2&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>My before and after length of hair was the normal amount you&#x27;d grow in one month.</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s worth it and will be purchasing additional bottles in the future.</li>
            <li>Hair growth is normal.</li>
            <li>herbally, i plan now to rebuy this again, but NOT from that 3rd party seller, I plan to buy it from a promising Local hawaii seller, which im glad i found one thru word of mouth, i contacted her which she lives in my area, I PLAN to buy from her Locally here in  hawaii, at least i will have a promising secured supplements!!!!!</li>
            <li>I started taking 2 pills of HSN again last week and my skin is breaking out horribly right now.</li>
            <li>For new and sealed products email me I am an authorized it works</li>
            <li>This ensures you are receiving the highest quality product and it also gives you a live person to refer to for directions, expectations, concerns, and questions.</li>
            <li>After 14 days i noticed new growth and my hair was even visibly longer.</li>
            <li>Maybe for some people this works, but I wish someone would have warned me that a year of heavy dieting and weight loss would be destroyed by 2 weeks of a supplement that so many people give such positive reviews about.</li>
            <li>Overall, very very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Totally unexpected!</li>
            <li>but I also noticed that my hair was shedding a lot more than usual.</li>
            <li>I had to cut them more than usual.</li>
            <li>key is to stay consistent.</li>
            <li>Second time ordering, first from Amazon</li>
            <li>then while attending her mother&#x27;s birthday luncheon earlier this month, her mother starts to beam about how she herself signed up for gastric bypass since her daughter had such stellar results!</li>
            <li>I use to hardly break out on my face, now I break out more often.</li>
            <li>The second month the length of my hair was much longer.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair..</li>
            <li>Link to this sight and purchase direct.</li>
            <li>At that rate, I&#x27;ll be wearing wigs well into 2017 before I can go natural.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY and do not harm your health.  </li>
            <li>I do think my nails are considerably stronger.  </li>
            <li>So I am in my 3rd month of the real deal and</li>
            <li>Cleared my skin and gave it a natural glow.</li>
            <li>You may not get the results stated because they could be old products</li>
            <li>&gt;·  Boosts your natural collagen and keratin production</li>
            <li>I felt a complete difference in my hair ,skin and nails.</li>
            <li>Nearly all of my friends and coworkers have made comments about my hair.</li>
            <li>My stomach is not at all sensitive</li>
            <li>that was completely GONE.</li>
            <li>My doctors have ALL said this stuff is hype and digesting high volumes of the nutrients listed on the back of shampoo bottles will not help skin, hair, or nails.  </li>
            <li>so shedding is pretty normal, but this is was ridiculous how much of my hair was falling off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recently gotten a trim but not enough to Make me literally realize that I had lost that much hair.</li>
            <li>I took the whole bottle and all it did was make me break out, my nails were fragile, and my hair stayed the same it never grew.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky if a few strands come out.</li>
            <li>AMAZINGLY day 2 of taking these supplements, My hair FINALLY got manageable and nice again after a bad hair cut!!!</li>
            <li>I could barely run a brush through my hair</li>
            <li>I had been taking Viviscal for almost 18 months and it barely did anything to make my hair grow.  </li>
            <li>Very dissapointed...hair did not grow as much as I expected.</li>
            <li>Ive done this product only for a month so far</li>
            <li>They were long again (they used to grow long) and pretty.</li>
            <li>My hair grows so slow and this made it grow fast and made it look pretty.</li>
            <li>After looking further into it, this is a common side effect of biotin, especially in large doses.</li>
            <li>i love the scent and taste, it smells like chinese herbal supplements, and has a slight peppermint sorta flavor not sweet, but</li>
            <li>My nails that were pretty are now brittle damaged and a mess.  </li>
            <li>Even my liver&#x27;s lab work was a hot mess.  </li>
            <li>to say i saw a significant increase in length was not really, but it got thick thick and healthy.</li>
            <li>After a brutally cold and dry winter I finally succumbed to the urging of my distributor friends and signed up as a loyal customer to get the better price.</li>
            <li>To be perfectly honest, I&#x27;m not sure that my hair is growing faster than usual.</li>
            <li>My skin only fot worse with breakouts...and noticed a lot more pimples.</li>
            <li>Plus the items expire pretty quickly if not used properly.</li>
            <li>Overall, my hair had no real change, my skin ended up reverting to its high school form of acne covered, and my nails are still flakey and brittle.</li>

            <li> but there are more affordable options.  </li>

            <li> These pictures of people saying it grew so much in so many weeks</li>
            <li> Glad it worked for them..</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re suppose to smell/taste minty not terrible.</li>
            <li> thank you for being so kind and genuine with me</li>
            <li> Go to this site ( http://freemanwraps.myitworks.com )  to see more</li>
            <li> Mostly because of the price.</li>
            <li> The amount of the ingredients is so over the top that it is wasteful.</li>
            <li> it makes all hair grow faster, so expect to shave more.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m SO glad I did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;·  Promotes healthy cell growth, strength, and shine</li>
            <li> Love this product,  I have received so many compliments from people when I&#x27;m out about how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li> Eating healthy and drinking water will work better than any pill</li>
            <li> make sure u eat before u take</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to help you purchase this</li>

            <li> and I love the hair skin and nail vitamins.</li>
            <li> my hair has grown more about 2 inches.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure you know somebody who is a distributor.</li>
            <li> After trying so many products claiming to help and all of them failing to do so</li>
            <li> I am on my 3rd bottle and im very happy.</li>
            <li> a buy another one to see if it will this time but for the most part its all the people who sell it uping it and making it seem like a miracle drug.</li>
            <li> i think i will need 2 more</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my nails are stronger and my skin is clearer.</li>

            <li> You can contact me for details, questions or discounts anytime 714-497-3244 :)</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> its ok.</li>
            <li> My hair grew an inch in the first two weeks!!!</li>
            <li> so much she joined as a distributor :) They have amazing health benefits!</li>
            <li> A childhood friend claimed she used a wrap and dietary supplement made by this company to lose a large amount of weight and she looks amazing!  </li>
            <li> Now, I stopped taking them a couple of months ago and noticed that my hair growth slowed, my nails break more easily, and I see more hair in the shower drain.</li>
            <li> I will continue to keep using it as long as I am seeing these awesome results.</li>
            <li> It did make my hair grow about an inche after like 5-6 weeks which was pretty good for me, but it also makes my face break out</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t purchased for me, but she is extremely happy with the product and the performance so far.</li>
            <li> my sister and my mother loved them so much too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has experienced this, but the first time I took these pills was right before bedtime.</li>
            <li> the pills are easy to swallow and easy on the stomach.</li>
            <li> They still split but they don&#x27;t bend as easily.  </li>
            <li> Since taking the Hair, Skin and Nails product my nails have grown and are strong.  </li>
            <li> Plus, if you sign up as a loyal customer, you&#x27;ll get these for $33!  </li>
            <li> I can get this product for $33 as a loyal customer from an It Works distributor!  </li>
            <li> and honestly I can&#x27;t tell if my hair has grown more because of this product or if it&#x27;s the natural growth I would see without taking the supplement.</li>
            <li> Plus, when you purchase through a distributor you earn free product and free shipping (my dad just earned $100 in free product after being a customer for 7 months).</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy my hair looks and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> i just got mines today the pills are not crushed but they do smell like some kind of grass!</li>
            <li> She liked it so much that she is now a distributor and urged me to try this product for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also important to take it every day.</li>
            <li> Supports the body’s defenses against free radical damage&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> We have amazing products that really work.</li>
            <li> My face had fewer pimples and felt smooth.</li>
            <li> I saw so many good results and prayed I would get the same!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still beautiful and long, but I will be taking them again in order to get my hair to my desired length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> when I was a senior in high school (5 years ago) I thought it would be awesome to have bleach blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product that I am ordering my a second one! :)</li>
            <li> Great product and opportunity to sign up as a loyal customer or distributor for big discounts at www.coachslaton.myitworks.com</li>

            <li> I was so so excited when I was researching this product.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> I bought them mostly for my skin and nails and within the first couple of weeks did see a noticeable improvement in my nails.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product im done with my first 60 pills</li>
            <li> I recommend buying this from an actual distributor to ensure that you are getting the real thing, but I think that Amazon is a great place to check out some honest reviews first.</li>
            <li> please contact a local distributor to guarantee good fresh products that will work!</li>
            <li> My mom loved both of those + the facial &amp; body applicators (used on chin/neck &amp; stomach)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve almost finished one bottle and so far I&#x27;d say the results are pretty good.</li>
            <li> If you enroll as loyal $33 each month for 3 months autoshipment, even retail is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Would be $55 for non loyal customers.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say my hair has grown tremendously after using It Works for over 6 months</li>
            <li> Sign up as a Loyal Customer and save.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re, looking for a cheaper price as a loyal customer go to my website:  </li>

            <li> With essential vitamins, minerals, and plant-based nutrients, Hair Skin Nails enhances your own natural collagen and keratin production, supports healthy cell growth, and boosts your body’s free radical fighting defenses.  </li>
            <li> It really does work!!</li>
            <li> email me at jenni.light@hotmail.com and let me know what products you are interested in!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li> I will say that the overall health of my hair is amazing.</li>
            <li> She is always available to answer any questions and she is very knowledgeable about the products.  </li>
            <li> I did not see AMAZING hair growth like it was advertised (which is disappointing after so many good reviews)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: if you&#x27;re looking for amazing hair growth, your only solution is time.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s soft, shiny and extremely healthy looking and feeling.</li>
            <li> Over two months, my hair has grown considerably, my nails have grown, and my skin just feels so much better.  </li>
            <li> you can see good improving but not fast as they tell.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so worth it.</li>
            <li> Always eat before you take them because on an empty stomach you won&#x27;t feel good after.</li>
            <li> Even my friends tell me my hair is growing super fast!</li>
            <li> Right before I purchased it I took out my extensions after having them in for 6 months.</li>
            <li> I bought this right from the vendor.</li>
            <li> so strong and long and even super shiny!</li>
            <li> However, after my third shipment (that&#x27;s the problem with loyal customer; you have to sign up for 3 months to get the better price), I&#x27;ll be sure to cancel any future orders.</li>
            <li> , my liver is finally returning to good lab results, my skin which once was one of my best traits, is now thick and rough..</li>
            <li> Finished the first bottle had to order again..</li>
            <li> i will update with a before and after pic when I&#x27;m done my first bottle</li>
            <li> Please talk with your doctor first though.</li>
            <li> I have not taken them consistently</li>
            <li> but when I first started taking them, just one a day, I noticed I started breaking out.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, most skin problems can be cured with proper face washing techniques and using quality foundation products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so i will be ordering my second soon :)</li>
            <li> Really does make a difference!</li>
            <li> From the first day I started using it</li>
            <li> You have to be very faithful to these pills and take them as directed if you want to see a change in your hair, skin and nails; just saying!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty neat product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first month of using it i could see a noticeable difference in length.</li>
            <li> I recommend maybe trying the ItWorks Greens first to help detox &amp; alkalize your body &amp; then try the HSN again if you wanna grow your hair, nails, or even just want healthier skin &amp; to boost your immune system.</li>

            <li> No more peeling just strong healthy nails.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t care how good a product is no more auto-shipment orders for me.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that the pills had a sweet coating on it and a completely different smell, whereas the ones I purchased from the company had more of an light herbal smell and no sweet taste.</li>
            <li> I would suggest buying a similar product at a MUCH more pocket friendly price at your local drug store.</li>
            <li> TO BE HONEST, my hair grew maybe a little, not even an inch.</li>
            <li> This product is gentle on my stomach.  </li>
            <li> But my nails got much stronger and grew a lot faster.</li>
            <li> it works, really works.</li>
            <li> I just hope this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> The whole point of me taking all these pills was for my HAIR to grow.</li>
            <li> It has really helped increase growth after hair loss</li>
            <li> This stuff really works no joke</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t see any difference in my skin, but I don&#x27;t really have problem skin either.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say whether people with problem skin would benefit.</li>
            <li> I saw no difference in how much my hair or nails grew during the month</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes are so much fuller looking</li>
            <li> Not as fast as they say, but definatley does sumthin...</li>
            <li> Its real</li>
            <li> It will come straight from</li>
            <li> and it was much pricier on another site.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Much cheaper that way.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> After week one my hair stopped shedding so much and it felt healthier to the touch.</li>
            <li> It really does work</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care so much about that.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t grow much faster</li>
            <li> It makes my skin much clearer than when I don&#x27;t take it.  </li>
            <li> This product has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> I really could see the difference in the growth and strength of my hair.</li>
            <li> It really works. ...</li>
            <li> i havent seen much results from it after 2 orders of this product.</li>
            <li> My hair has really grown since using these vitamins.  </li>
            <li> The loyal customer program is pretty simple.</li>
            <li> Only $33 when you sign up as a loyal customer which is what I did</li>
            <li> but so far, the results seem to be positive.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see more hair, but I will have to wait a little bit longer to see if any results.</li>
            <li> And my hair not only grew but felt super soft!</li>
            <li> Its amazing that i have seen at least an entier inch grow in 2 months</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely still worth it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal thickness.</li>
            <li> Normally my hair grows about 1/2&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> My before and after length of hair was the normal amount you&#x27;d grow in one month.</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s worth it and will be purchasing additional bottles in the future.</li>
            <li> Hair growth is normal.</li>
            <li> herbally, i plan now to rebuy this again, but NOT from that 3rd party seller, I plan to buy it from a promising Local hawaii seller, which im glad i found one thru word of mouth, i contacted her which she lives in my area, I PLAN to buy from her Locally here in  hawaii, at least i will have a promising secured supplements!!!!!</li>
            <li> I started taking 2 pills of HSN again last week and my skin is breaking out horribly right now.</li>
            <li> For new and sealed products email me I am an authorized it works</li>
            <li> This ensures you are receiving the highest quality product and it also gives you a live person to refer to for directions, expectations, concerns, and questions.</li>
            <li> After 14 days i noticed new growth and my hair was even visibly longer.</li>
            <li> Maybe for some people this works, but I wish someone would have warned me that a year of heavy dieting and weight loss would be destroyed by 2 weeks of a supplement that so many people give such positive reviews about.</li>
            <li> Overall, very very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Totally unexpected!</li>
            <li> but I also noticed that my hair was shedding a lot more than usual.</li>
            <li> I had to cut them more than usual.</li>
            <li> key is to stay consistent.</li>
            <li> Second time ordering, first from Amazon</li>
            <li> then while attending her mother&#x27;s birthday luncheon earlier this month, her mother starts to beam about how she herself signed up for gastric bypass since her daughter had such stellar results!</li>
            <li> I use to hardly break out on my face, now I break out more often.</li>
            <li> The second month the length of my hair was much longer.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair..</li>
            <li> Link to this sight and purchase direct.</li>
            <li> At that rate, I&#x27;ll be wearing wigs well into 2017 before I can go natural.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY and do not harm your health.  </li>
            <li> I do think my nails are considerably stronger.  </li>
            <li> So I am in my 3rd month of the real deal and</li>
            <li> Cleared my skin and gave it a natural glow.</li>
            <li> You may not get the results stated because they could be old products</li>
            <li> &gt;·  Boosts your natural collagen and keratin production</li>
            <li> I felt a complete difference in my hair ,skin and nails.</li>
            <li> Nearly all of my friends and coworkers have made comments about my hair.</li>
            <li> My stomach is not at all sensitive</li>
            <li> that was completely GONE.</li>
            <li> My doctors have ALL said this stuff is hype and digesting high volumes of the nutrients listed on the back of shampoo bottles will not help skin, hair, or nails.  </li>
            <li> so shedding is pretty normal, but this is was ridiculous how much of my hair was falling off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recently gotten a trim but not enough to Make me literally realize that I had lost that much hair.</li>
            <li> I took the whole bottle and all it did was make me break out, my nails were fragile, and my hair stayed the same it never grew.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky if a few strands come out.</li>
            <li> AMAZINGLY day 2 of taking these supplements, My hair FINALLY got manageable and nice again after a bad hair cut!!!</li>
            <li> I could barely run a brush through my hair</li>
            <li> I had been taking Viviscal for almost 18 months and it barely did anything to make my hair grow.  </li>
            <li> Very dissapointed...hair did not grow as much as I expected.</li>
            <li> Ive done this product only for a month so far</li>
            <li> They were long again (they used to grow long) and pretty.</li>
            <li> My hair grows so slow and this made it grow fast and made it look pretty.</li>
            <li> After looking further into it, this is a common side effect of biotin, especially in large doses.</li>
            <li> i love the scent and taste, it smells like chinese herbal supplements, and has a slight peppermint sorta flavor not sweet, but</li>
            <li> My nails that were pretty are now brittle damaged and a mess.  </li>
            <li> Even my liver&#x27;s lab work was a hot mess.  </li>
            <li> to say i saw a significant increase in length was not really, but it got thick thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> After a brutally cold and dry winter I finally succumbed to the urging of my distributor friends and signed up as a loyal customer to get the better price.</li>
            <li> To be perfectly honest, I&#x27;m not sure that my hair is growing faster than usual.</li>
            <li> My skin only fot worse with breakouts...and noticed a lot more pimples.</li>
            <li> Plus the items expire pretty quickly if not used properly.</li>
            <li> Overall, my hair had no real change, my skin ended up reverting to its high school form of acne covered, and my nails are still flakey and brittle.</li>
            <li> It is growing slightly faster than normal and feels back to</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use excessive heat or non sulfate shampooh becase both damage my hair too much.</li>
            <li> The first month my hair just got thick.</li>
            <li> and we have both noticed a considerable improvement in the condition of her hair and it has dramatically slowed down or reduced the hair loss she was experiencing.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few times while I was with the company just because you have to buy so much to remain active.  </li>
            <li> I had eaten dinner earlier so it was not on an empty stomach.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, these pills are definitely worth approximately a dollar a day ($33 for a month supply) from</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this producted seeing all these reciews and results but sad to say it didnt work for me</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly fragile hair.</li>
            <li> it was so dry.</li>
            <li> Every single nail of mine was peeling and within two weeks</li>
            <li> But like everyone else is saying you need to support the small businesses and buy direct from a distributor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the reason, but I noticed the jar I ordered from Amazon was slightly different from those I had ordered from the actual company, It Works.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not necessarily stronger but a slight bit longer.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to buy all the product that is left over from previous vendors that didn&#x27;t sell.</li>
            <li> Super sad it didnt work.</li>
            <li> , the ONLY thing I noticed is my nails grew out a LITTLE.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown some but not as much as I expected however</li>
            <li> Extra vitamins don&#x27;t help anything, they just go to waste.</li>
            <li> If says it makes hair stronger, yet mine is now Harder than ever to Brush through at ends, and the ends break off atleast</li>
            <li> Such a shame and a waste of a lot of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s frail, thin, lifeless and falling out at a very rapid pace.</li>
            <li> My nails are harder and my hair grows faster as well.  </li>
            <li> Normally, my hair grows VERY slow, only a few inches a year.</li>
            <li> I started HSN 2 months ago, I noticed a dramatic increase in hair after 2 weeks probsbky 1 inch atleast, one day I woke up to my hair being very shorter than it was..</li>
            <li> I will not continue to take them and with the experience I have had I have to send a warning out to other consumers.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this product at first.</li>
            <li> and they have a hint of peppermint taste (due to the oil).  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything imaginable and spent lots of money on other supplements!  </li>
            <li> It might not sound like a lot but the average person only grows half an inch of hair if that.</li>
            <li> If you feel sick taking it make sure it&#x27;s after a meal (vit c in it &amp; that usually causes nausea when taken on an empty stomach).</li>
            <li> Other than that they seem to work quite well!</li>
            <li> MY HAIR GREW 2 INCHES IN LESS THAN A MONTH</li>
            <li> My hair feels thicker and has grown about an inch and a half in one month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had brittle nails, but this has made them stronger and peel less.</li>
            <li> Over an inch of growth in less than a month</li>
            <li> I believe that I lost less hair while taking these but no difference in hair growth rate.  </li>
            <li> an inch or half inch seems like it has stopped growing</li>
            <li> My skin had less blemishes.</li>
            <li> Way more expensive than biotin (that does actually work) &amp; the customer service is rude &amp; down right awful!</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by my hairstylist and amazingly, in less than one month, I saw less breakage of my hair, less hair going down the drain and my hair even feels thicker!  </li>
            <li> Pills are pretty large, smell and taste awful (just my opinion)  </li>
            <li> It works but if you don&#x27;t have a full stomach and you take the pill you will get so sick</li>
            <li> little opened, but out of desperation i had to take it to see what the hype is, WELLLLL</li>
            <li> I want to say your hair grows about an inch or a little over that.</li>
            <li> also noticed that my lashes are longer and a little</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a year.</li>
            <li> and  in 2 months nothing not even a little growth it does not work don&#x27;t waste your money......</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;vitamins&amp;#34; shut down my gut!</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of $50.  </li>
            <li> But I paid for them, and I wasn&#x27;t going to waste them, so I wrote my upset stomach off to adjustment and continued.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just been on the product for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money as well.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product it said it was missing 2.</li>
            <li> Whe I received it, there was 4 missing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for hair regrowth as I have been experiencing loss for a few years, now.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not a huge difference like some of the photos posted online, but there IS improvement.  </li>
            <li> , I had to stop taking the recommended 2 a day and bring it down to 1 a day because the breakouts were pretty bad</li>
            <li> But if I was to say anything else, take two before you go to bed and eat first even if it&#x27;s little because I got sickly feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get them down every morning just because of the taste.</li>
            <li> And no more &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Not sure why these tablets have this effect on me</li>
            <li> My hair has not grown any faster than it usually would.  </li>
            <li> 2 weeks after beginning taking these I had gained 10 POUNDS and had a constant feeling of bloated, was constantly uncomfortable, and yet always hungry.</li>
            <li> and I can already see a small difference.  </li>
            <li> nails have seen small changes.  </li>
            <li> Ill write another review as a non pyramid schemer to see if it actually does work or its all lies from the distributors trying to get you to believe.</li>
            <li> I woke up in the middle of the night feeling very nauseated and rushed to the bathroom and threw up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> I took these pills for about 6 months and my hair grew at least twice its usual rate.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience insane amounts of hair growth, but at least double the normal rate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to see the difference without doing so....</li>
            <li> and pils usually never make me sick.</li>
            <li> I just accepted I would be bald by my late 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> If you do not order for at least a year, and try to cancel the auto-shipments they will charge your card 75 dollars.</li>
            <li> my hair grows extremely slow and here is my before picture and 30 days after</li>
            <li> My hair grows slow, but it still grew faster when taking this supplement.</li>
            <li> Considering my hair grows so slow</li>
            <li> In the past when I&#x27;ve grown out my hair it has gotten stringy and thin.</li>
            <li> You can get it for HALF this price though!!!</li>
            <li> I would NOT have believed it until I saw results in less than 30days!!!  </li>
            <li> And yes I drunk at least 8 glasses of water everyday.</li>
            <li> This product is a little expensive</li>
            <li> but it definitely isn&#x27;t worth it if my skin breaks out horribly!</li>
            <li> My hair is the same length :(</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair</li>

            <li> What I kinda questioned is, why a lot of the pills had weird marks on them,</li>
            <li> Weird...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> To be perfectly honest, I&#x27;m not sure that my hair is growing faster than usual. I will say that the overall health of my hair is amazing. Especially compared to how it was before. I could barely run a brush through my hair it was so dry. Now it&#x27;s soft, shiny and extremely healthy looking and feeling. I have been losing a lot of hair since having kids and I can tell that it&#x27;s growing back. And no more &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34;. your hair won&#x27;t grow 7 inches in a month like some girls on Instagram says it does but it&#x27;s definitely still worth it.</li>
            <li> Wife has been using this now for over 4 months and we have both noticed a considerable improvement in the condition of her hair and it has dramatically slowed down or reduced the hair loss she was experiencing.</li>
            <li> My hair and nails did grow but the product caused my face to peel</li>
            <li> Good product as advertized</li>
            <li> This product is a little expensive but it&#x27;s made my hair grow almost 4 inches in 3 months! I&#x27;m in love with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the reason, but I noticed the jar I ordered from Amazon was slightly different from those I had ordered from the actual company, It Works. I had run out of pills and decided to order a jar here to hold me until my next shipment. The first thing I noticed was that the pills had a sweet coating on it and a completely different smell, whereas the ones I purchased from the company had more of an light herbal smell and no sweet taste. When I received my next shipment from the company, I noticed the jar was similar, but the writing was slightly different in appearance, though the same ingredients were listed. I don&#x27;t know what this means, but there was a definite difference. I stopped taking them and went back to ordering from the company.</li>
            <li> The product is Amazing.My hair grew 1 inch in 2 weeks, my scalp was loving it,and my dandruff reduced :) My results I bought here and then found a distributor. Yes product works but way overpriced DO NOT buy here I have a great distributor go to her site. If you enroll as loyal $33 each month for 3 months autoshipment, even retail is cheaper. here&amp;#62;&amp;#62; shinelikeadiamondwithmelissa.myitworks.com Oh and you&#x27;re welcome  ;) &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> THE BEST VITAMINS EVER! MY HAIR GREW 2 INCHES IN LESS THAN A MONTH</li>
            <li> It works but if you don&#x27;t have a full stomach and you take the pill you will get so sick I threw up and felt like I was dying because I didn&#x27;t have enough food in me</li>
            <li> Love these magic pills! They are amazing</li>
            <li> I had been taking Viviscal for almost 18 months and it barely did anything to make my hair grow.  I was recommended this product by my hairstylist and amazingly, in less than one month, I saw less breakage of my hair, less hair going down the drain and my hair even feels thicker!  I will definitely continue with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this twice  and  in 2 months nothing not even a little growth it does not work don&#x27;t waste your money......</li>
            <li> Over priced.  Not that impressed.</li>
            <li> Product works amazing! My hair feels thicker and has grown about an inch and a half in one month. I&#x27;ve always had brittle nails, but this has made them stronger and peel less. I order mine WAY cheaper through an it works distributor at www.wrapsbymbarawed.myitworks.com. Only $33 when you sign up as a loyal customer which is what I did (just means I agreed to buy one product a month for 3 months) Would be $55 for non loyal customers.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely amazing.  If you are interested in purchasing, be sure to purchase from an It Works distributor.  I buy mine from www.wrapitupsa.com.  She is always available to answer any questions and she is very knowledgeable about the products.  Plus, if you sign up as a loyal customer, you&#x27;ll get these for $33!  I LOVE the Hair Skin and Nails from It Works.  Over two months, my hair has grown considerably, my nails have grown, and my skin just feels so much better.  I can&#x27;t imagine not having these in my life!</li>
            <li> Finished the first bottle had to order again.. great product!</li>
            <li> wife takes it like the pill lol</li>
            <li> Love HSN, you can order it from tracyoh.myitworks.com to get a loyal price!!! It really does work!!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd order. My hair is growing longer, but its still thin. I&#x27;ll keep trying the product. My goal is to see better results in 90 days and that will determine whither I continue using the product.</li>
            <li> I am a distributor for It Works! and I can get you this product for WAY cheaper! email me at jenni.light@hotmail.com and let me know what products you are interested in! I can get you these at MY price, and a 10$ credit toward future purchases! Love to help you out!</li>
            <li> makes your hair grow rapidly probably 1.5 times the rate be warned hair will grow fast all over your body lol.</li>
            <li> Awaiting my hair and nails to grow like mad!</li>
            <li> Works just as described.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing, my hair didn&#x27;t grow at all.</li>
            <li> It works! Over an inch of growth in less than a month</li>
            <li> it didnt work...maybe u have to drink lots water which i didnt i dont know</li>
            <li> I do feel like my hair is a lot healthier and stronger compared to the thin, stringy hair I have had for years. I wouldn&#x27;t say my hair has grown tremendously after using It Works for over 6 months but it has grown some. Overall, I am happy my hair looks and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> The hair skin and nails is amazing! It&#x27;s great for women and men. This is extremely expensive though. You can get it a lot cheaper www.annandamanda.myitworks.com by becoming a loyal customer as well as earn cash back on every purchase (perk points) Check around before spending too much.</li>
            <li> I am a former distributor.  I bought this a few times while I was with the company just because you have to buy so much to remain active.  Hair Skin Nails works but there are more affordable options.  This product is gentle on my stomach.  I took it in the morning with breakfast just because it was easier to remember to take each day.  I did see my nails and hair grow.  I would have loved to see my eyelashes grow, but I cannot blame this product.  :)</li>
            <li> i just got mines today the pills are not crushed but they do smell like some kind of grass! i will update with a before and after pic when I&#x27;m done my first bottle</li>
            <li> This product works. I took it for three months going through the IT WORKS company. The first month my hair just got thick. The second month the length of my hair was much longer. However it did make me break out more. I use to hardly break out on my face, now I break out more often. But my nails got much stronger and grew a lot faster. Pills are pretty large, smell and taste awful (just my opinion)  but they do work great! I still take them I just make sure to take them with something to mask the taste. Overall great product and would recommend to anyone looking to help thier hair grow faster and thicker!!</li>
            <li> It has been great! Bj</li>
            <li> Still currently using, but I have already seen a noticeable difference in the shine in my hair and also the temples of my hair starting to grow in.</li>
            <li> GREAT product! However, ladies contact me for wholesale prices! http://tasharjames.myitworks.com miss.trjames@gmail.com</li>
            <li> The results from this are amazing! I never thought I&#x27;d get my hair back since nothing else helped. I recommend this to men and women!&lt;br /&gt;Rachaelg.myitworks.com</li>
            <li> Love it! I would definitely recommend it (:</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has experienced this, but the first time I took these pills was right before bedtime. I had eaten dinner earlier so it was not on an empty stomach. I woke up in the middle of the night feeling very nauseated and rushed to the bathroom and threw up. After that I didn&#x27;t take them for another week. Today I took two tablets in the afternoon, also after food, and it took about 10 minutes for the same reaction. Nauseated and throwing up. I will not continue to take them and with the experience I have had I have to send a warning out to other consumers. Not sure why these tablets have this effect on me but it is not something I want to experiment with.</li>
            <li> Only been using it for almost 2 weeks, wanted to wait longer before I wrote a review but what this stuff has done for my breast milk supply is amazing. Totally unexpected! Will definitely keep taking them. Please talk with your doctor first though. My results after 2 weeks in photo.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over two months. I have seen increased growth in my hair. I have naturally curly hair.. It&#x27;s course and frizzy.. While taking this vitamin I have noticed my hair texture is softer and more manageable. I highly recommend this. I have found it cheaper. Link to this sight and purchase direct. Http://wrapping forward.myitworks.com</li>
            <li> guy i have 4c hair. it works, really works. to say i saw a significant increase in length was not really, but it got thick thick and healthy. i tried only 2 months and i wish i could take this pill forever. the price tho....in my currency its over 300 and thats alot of money to pop pills. i fully endorse this product.</li>
            <li> It was delivered as promised.  My hair has grown some but not as much as I expected however, I plan to re-order them again.</li>
            <li> Hair skin and nail is one of my favorite products!!! You can get it for HALF this price though!!! For cheaper prices on ALL it works! products, visit www.betsybarfield.itworks.com</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve never been so satisfied with a growth supplement! The results are literally unreal! Try it(:</li>
            <li> Made my skin break out terribly</li>
            <li> I have been on this supplement for over 2 months.  My hair has not grown any faster than it usually would.  There is nothing different about my skin or nails either.  I am all for being healthy, and herbal vitamins.  However, for me it was not a miracle hair growth like the distributor said.  I will not be purchasing this item again.</li>
            <li> Been taking it for about 3 1/2 weeks and I already love it. Right before I purchased it I took out my extensions after having them in for 6 months. My hair felt a lot thinner and short. Within about two weeks I definitely noticed a difference in my hair. It is growing slightly faster than normal and feels back to it&#x27;s normal thickness. I&#x27;ve been getting told that my hair looks longer and thicker from others as well. Definitely recommend this product.</li>

            <li> I love this!! Need to order more!</li>
            <li> You can get these @ premowrapper.com from an actual distributor. Buying it works products on Amazon is not compliant &amp; these could be expired!</li>
            <li> I ordered my it works HSN from a friend who is a distributor. I have not taken them consistently but when I first started taking them, just one a day, I noticed I started breaking out. I took a break from them for a couple of weeks and my skin started improving and clearing up. I started taking 2 pills of HSN again last week and my skin is breaking out horribly right now. I wanted to use this product because my hair is thinning at the top but it definitely isn&#x27;t worth it if my skin breaks out horribly!</li>
            <li> Does anybody else have headaches while on this?</li>
            <li> This product does work!  I can get this product for $33 as a loyal customer from an It Works distributor!  My mother uses it and only takes one pill a day and raves about it!  My name is Stacy D&#x27;Amato, I&#x27;m from North Carolina and I stand by this product!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for my hair</li>
            <li> i must say that i was a little afraid of trying this product but i have been using this for almost 3 weeks and i have seen some growth. i have dread locks and didnt think i would see a difference but i have.. the pills are easy to swallow and easy on the stomach.</li>
            <li> I too looked for reviews before ordering this product.  No way did my hair grow like the product advertised it to..my hair grows extremely slow and here is my before picture and 30 days after</li>
            <li> I just hope this stuff really works. My hair is growing back after loosing all of it during chemo therapy for breast cancer. Normally, my hair grows VERY slow, only a few inches a year. At that rate, I&#x27;ll be wearing wigs well into 2017 before I can go natural.</li>
            <li> my hair kept growing everywhere! And my nails become stronger and longer I recommend 😊</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;m not going to sugar coat any of this. TO BE HONEST, my hair grew maybe a little, not even an inch. I drank water like 15+ a day, the ONLY thing I noticed is my nails grew out a LITTLE. Which my nails never grow. They&#x27;re not necessarily stronger but a slight bit longer. The whole point of me taking all these pills was for my HAIR to grow. These pictures of people saying it grew so much in so many weeks it&#x27;s skeptical. Glad it worked for them.. But if I was to say anything else, take two before you go to bed and eat first even if it&#x27;s little because I got sickly feeling. and pils usually never make me sick. But here is my review. And they&#x27;re suppose to smell/taste minty not terrible. It&#x27;s best to get them from a distributor!</li>
            <li> I am a it works consultant, go to my website to get it cheaper dlclark.myitworks.com</li>
            <li> If you what this for a CHEAPER price go to anahouston.com and you can have all it works products for a lot cheaper!</li>
            <li> I received the package today I&#x27;m so happy loved the gifts too my sister and my mother loved them so much too. Im so happy to deal with you thank you for being so kind and genuine with me wish you all the best</li>
            <li> great dating on the one I got..... This stuff really works!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it... I will continue to keep using it as long as I am seeing these awesome results.</li>
            <li> do not know yet , l am  taking l a day, will start 2 a day .</li>
            <li> My hair NEVER grows so I finally tried this. It did make my hair grow about an inche after like 5-6 weeks which was pretty good for me, but it also makes my face break out</li>
            <li> well i got my supplements that was from what i seen box damaged and seal on jar little opened, but out of desperation i had to take it to see what the hype is, WELLLLL AMAZINGLY day 2 of taking these supplements, My hair FINALLY got manageable and nice again after a bad hair cut!!! im very pleased with taking these supplements, Plus i love the scent and taste, it smells like chinese herbal supplements, and has a slight peppermint sorta flavor not sweet, but herbally, i plan now to rebuy this again, but NOT from that 3rd party seller, I plan to buy it from a promising Local hawaii seller, which im glad i found one thru word of mouth, i contacted her which she lives in my area, I PLAN to buy from her Locally here in  hawaii, at least i will have a promising secured supplements!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is awsome!!! My girlfriend got great result 2 weeks after she started this product and she is looking forwad to get it again!!</li>
            <li> Caused my hair to start falling out!  My nails that were pretty are now brittle damaged and a mess.  These &amp;#34;vitamins&amp;#34; shut down my gut! Even my liver&#x27;s lab work was a hot mess.  I took them about six months ago, and I have permanent damage to my gut, my liver is finally returning to good lab results, my skin which once was one of my best traits, is now thick and rough.. This stuff is POISON!!!  My doctors have ALL said this stuff is hype and digesting high volumes of the nutrients listed on the back of shampoo bottles will not help skin, hair, or nails.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY and do not harm your health.  Oh yeah.. Find a good Product Liability Attorney!!  You&#x27;ll need it to deal with these scam artists.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for three weeks now and I don&#x27;t see more hair, but I will have to wait a little bit longer to see if any results.</li>
            <li> The hair skin and nails is amazing! It&#x27;s great for women and men. This is extremely expensive though. You can get it a lot cheaper www.annandamanda.myitworks.com by becoming a loyal customer as well as earn cash back on every purchase (perk points) Check around before spending too much.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Did nothing. No hair growth no nail growth and my skin looks the same. Super sad it didnt work.</li>
            <li> I do think my nails are considerably stronger.  I believe that I lost less hair while taking these but no difference in hair growth rate.  No change in skin.</li>
            <li> Horrible product that does not work. Way more expensive than biotin (that does actually work) &amp; the customer service is rude &amp; down right awful!</li>
            <li> When I saw all the great results of people growing their hair I wanted to try it. I am on the last week of my 1st month. And only results I see is that my nails are stronger and skin is smoother but my hair is still the same. (Which is the reason why I bought the vitamins) I&#x27;m going to try my second month maybe I might have done  something wrong</li>
            <li> Hair seems to be growing quite well. Cost is a bit steep.</li>
            <li> Good product and you can see good improving but not fast as they tell.</li>
            <li> I see minimum results</li>
            <li> It has really helped increase growth after hair loss</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing results!</li>
            <li> It is illegal to resell or sell products without being a distributor. Plus the items expire pretty quickly if not used properly. For new and sealed products email me I am an authorized it works distributor Kristenbrosierkc@gmail.com  Www.healthylivingwithkc.com</li>
            <li> So I did see hair growth but I also noticed that my hair was shedding a lot more than usual. I have very thick, curly hair so shedding is pretty normal, but this is was ridiculous how much of my hair was falling off. I did research and keratin is actually terrible for you and your hair and that&#x27;s what causes hair loss. I had 6 pills left and just threw them out. Waste of $50.  SO DONT BY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this product at first. Mostly because of the price. But after seeing rave review from a friend (also a distributor) on facebook, I decided to give it a try. After using for a couple days I decided to look up the ingredients because I was starting to feel...gross, and it was the only change I could think of. The amount of the ingredients is so over the top that it is wasteful. Extra vitamins don&#x27;t help anything, they just go to waste. So I was shocked to see that there was 1667% DV of Biotin in these. But I paid for them, and I wasn&#x27;t going to waste them, so I wrote my upset stomach off to adjustment and continued. 2 weeks after beginning taking these I had gained 10 POUNDS and had a constant feeling of bloated, was constantly uncomfortable, and yet always hungry. After looking further into it, this is a common side effect of biotin, especially in large doses. Overall, my hair had no real change, my skin ended up reverting to its high school form of acne covered, and my nails are still flakey and brittle. Maybe for some people this works, but I wish someone would have warned me that a year of heavy dieting and weight loss would be destroyed by 2 weeks of a supplement that so many people give such positive reviews about.</li>
            <li> Great product and opportunity to sign up as a loyal customer or distributor for big discounts at www.coachslaton.myitworks.com</li>

            <li> This product is over priced, it has all the same vitamins &amp; percentage like the one they sell in stores.</li>
            <li> Does this make anyone else literally sick to your stomach?  I wonder if it&#x27;s a vitamin overdose.  I can&#x27;t imagine why it would make me feel so nauseous,  I eat with it and drink plenty of water.  I can&#x27;t take them to find out the results,  help!</li>
            <li> It really works! I&#x27;ve taken about 3/4 of the bottle now and my hair has grown about an inch! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great seller will use again</li>
            <li> I am so angry and disappointed with this product. A childhood friend claimed she used a wrap and dietary supplement made by this company to lose a large amount of weight and she looks amazing!  She liked it so much that she is now a distributor and urged me to try this product for my hair and skin. I didn&#x27;t want to sign up for a 3 month supply so my kids got me a one month supply from Amazon for mother&#x27;s day. After a month, no change at all. No growth of hair or nails. My skin was the same. When my friend found out I didn&#x27;t purchase from her, she was upset. She said it was not their policy to sell on Amazon so most likely my supply was expired or a fake, hence why it didn&#x27;t work. Shamefaced, I signed up for the loyalty 3 month program. So I am in my 3rd month of the real deal and still nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then while attending her mother&#x27;s birthday luncheon earlier this month, her mother starts to beam about how she herself signed up for gastric bypass since her daughter had such stellar results! She lied and I trusted her and this product and guess what? No refunds!</li>
            <li> I started HSN 2 months ago, I noticed a dramatic increase in hair after 2 weeks probsbky 1 inch atleast, one day I woke up to my hair being very shorter than it was.. I&#x27;d recently gotten a trim but not enough to Make me literally realize that I had lost that much hair. If says it makes hair stronger, yet mine is now Harder than ever to Brush through at ends, and the ends break off atleast an inch or half inch seems like it has stopped growing I&#x27;m very dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> This stuff really works no joke my hair grew 3 inches in a month. I&#x27;m happy ;)</li>
            <li> My nails feel like acrylics- so strong and long and even super shiny! I&#x27;m still waiting for that hair growth however. I&#x27;ve almost finished one bottle and so far I&#x27;d say the results are pretty good.</li>
            <li> I took this for about 4 months and it worked well. My hair grows slow, but it still grew faster when taking this supplement. Normally my hair grows about 1/2&#x27;&#x27; a month but while taking this it grew about 1 1/4&amp;#34;. My nails grew the fastest and they were nice and strong. My skin had less blemishes. FYI it makes all hair grow faster, so expect to shave more. It&#x27;s also important to take it every day.</li>
            <li> My hair grows so slow and this made it grow fast and made it look pretty. Been on for four months. Take about three weeks.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this producted seeing all these reciews and results but sad to say it didnt work for me</li>
            <li> I am the BIGGEST skeptic  and do not think most of IT WORKS, works! That said, this stuff is INCREDIBLE!! I would NOT have believed it until I saw results in less than 30days!!!  I have the skimpiest frail nails for WELL OVER 20plus years!! suddenly they have turned into nails of steal !!  I DO NOT work for&amp;#34; IT WORKS&amp;#34;  and do not think he wraps work but something in this sure works!!  I got suckered into buying this from a friend or would have never tried it! trust me I will not go without this supplement!! I have tried everything imaginable and spent lots of money on other supplements!  so far not much has changed on my hair or skin yet but will give it time close to going on my second bottle</li>
            <li> The hair skin and nails is amazing! It&#x27;s great for women and men. This is extremely expensive though. You can get it a lot cheaper at www.yourwrapgirlamanda.myitworks.com by becoming a loyal customer as well as earn cash back on every purchase (perk points) Check around before spending too much.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! Created healthier hair with a beautiful shine. Cleared my skin and gave it a natural glow. Thickened and lengthened my nails. Well worth the money with great benefits!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just been on the product for a few weeks.  I was told it takes one to two months to see a difference.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Good product and required a lot</li>
            <li> I have thyroid disease so nails don&#x27;t grow or they are brittle and they split.  Since taking the Hair, Skin and Nails product my nails have grown and are strong.  Prior to this, I tried everything...biotin drops, Knox Gelatin mix, all type of vitamins, nail hardeners, soaks, creams oils, cuticle solutions, manicures, etc. etc. but none of that stuff worked.  This does and I am happy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to buy this product, buy it on Amazon. I bought it through a sells rep and got the &amp;#34;member&amp;#34; price, which is $36. After using this product and not being amazed, I tried to cancel my auto-ship thinking I would just pay the difference of the member price and the non-member price. Nope, not only can I not cancel the auto-ship, but they wanted to charge me a $50 membership fee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, it&#x27;s alright. I did not see AMAZING hair growth like it was advertised (which is disappointing after so many good reviews) and honestly I can&#x27;t tell if my hair has grown more because of this product or if it&#x27;s the natural growth I would see without taking the supplement. My hair does feel thicker, but I think that&#x27;s a result of the thinned out section of my hair growing out. I haven&#x27;t see any difference in my skin, but I don&#x27;t really have problem skin either. In my opinion, most skin problems can be cured with proper face washing techniques and using quality foundation products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: if you&#x27;re looking for amazing hair growth, your only solution is time. This product does an amazing job at strengthening nails, so if you have nails that split (like mine did) you could benefit. I can&#x27;t really say whether people with problem skin would benefit. I would suggest buying a similar product at a MUCH more pocket friendly price at your local drug store. I&#x27;ve used Nature Valley&#x27;s Hair, Skin, and Nails and gotten the same results for only $8-10 a bottle.</li>
            <li> Have only been using these for a week but they taste horrible...let&#x27;s hope they actually work..</li>
            <li> Great service! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Do not trust the age of these products! You may not get the results stated because they could be old products please contact a local distributor to guarantee good fresh products that will work!</li>
            <li> I was so so excited when I was researching this product. I saw so many good results and prayed I would get the same! I took them daily and never missed one day. My before and after length of hair was the normal amount you&#x27;d grow in one month. Such a shame and a waste of a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I saw no difference in how much my hair or nails grew during the month I used the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work. I&#x27;m trying to grow out my pixie. I&#x27;ve been tracking progress and I noticed a difference in just a week. Even my friends tell me my hair is growing super fast! I want to say your hair grows about an inch or a little over that. It might not sound like a lot but the average person only grows half an inch of hair if that. They&#x27;re so worth it.</li>
            <li> I did not see any result.... I did not like the taste of the pill but may it will work for some one else.</li>
            <li> After taking for 2 month notice hair growth and body.</li>
            <li> These are AMAZING, I&#x27;ve been taking them for about 2 weeks and my hair has grown about an inch. My eye lashes are so much fuller looking it&#x27;s incredible.. Make sure to take pictures to track your progress! It&#x27;s hard to see the difference without doing so.... I bought mine from an it works distributer, I&#x27;m SO glad I did. My hair fell out every time I showered in HANDFULLS now I&#x27;m lucky if a few strands come out. Absolutely the best thing I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> I started seeing results after 3 weeks of use so i will be ordering my second soon :)</li>
            <li> Really does make a difference! Totally worth the price!</li>

            <li> It Worked On Making My Hair thicker</li>
            <li> When its work i&#x27;ll writ another review. 5 stars for the price and delivary.</li>
            <li> luv it will buy again</li>
            <li> Love this product,  I have received so many compliments from people when I&#x27;m out about how healthy my hair looks. It Works!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Saw results in a week.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed...hair did not grow as much as I expected. Did not notice a change in my nails. My skin only fot worse with breakouts...and noticed a lot more pimples. Overall, very very dissapointed. Not buying again.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t purchased for me, but she is extremely happy with the product and the performance so far.</li>
            <li> Eating healthy and drinking water will work better than any pill</li>
            <li> Ive done this product only for a month so far and yes for sure it works! Not as fast as they say, but definatley does sumthin...i was highly skeptical too...make sure u eat before u take cuz it will upset ur stomach if u dont....get it and see for urself! Its real</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money they don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> You can get this product cheaper from a distributor! Please see www.body2soulwraps.myitworks.com! We have amazing products that really work. It will come straight from It Works so you will know that you are actually getting this product!</li>
            <li> Love the product. Not the price. Have bought three times but have now found cheaper</li>
            <li> It is against compliance for It Works products to be sold anywhere but through a distributor. This ensures you are receiving the highest quality product and it also gives you a live person to refer to for directions, expectations, concerns, and questions. Plus, when you purchase through a distributor you earn free product and free shipping (my dad just earned $100 in free product after being a customer for 7 months). Check out my website...I&#x27;d love to help you purchase this It Works product and many more! www.stlwrap.com 618-744-9993</li>
            <li> Have to take it over a month to see results , nails are stronger and my hair seems to be growing better . Yes! Im on my third bottle and I am seeing results its not going to happen overnight it takes time, good stuff.</li>
            <li> my daughter wanted this because after her son was born her gorgeous long hair started falling out and she said she knew women that tried this and it was much pricier on another site. She loved it and her hair started coming in stronger and more healthy and stopped falling out. so this definitely works. thanks</li>
            <li> My hair has grown a lot and I love the hair skin and nail vitamins. If you&#x27;re, looking for a cheaper price as a loyal customer go to my website:  http://209cawrap318la.myitworks.com</li>
            <li> After a brutally cold and dry winter I finally succumbed to the urging of my distributor friends and signed up as a loyal customer to get the better price. I bought them mostly for my skin and nails and within the first couple of weeks did see a noticeable improvement in my nails. They were long again (they used to grow long) and pretty. After another week that was done and they started breaking, just like before. My skin I never noticed anything different and my hair isn&#x27;t growing any faster than it ever had. I&#x27;ve been on them a month now and will start my next month. However, after my third shipment (that&#x27;s the problem with loyal customer; you have to sign up for 3 months to get the better price), I&#x27;ll be sure to cancel any future orders. I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money but sometimes you have to give in and try something to know to pass it by the next time temptation comes your way. Don&#x27;t waste your money as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product im done with my first 60 pills my hair has grown more about 2 inches. From the first day I started using it I felt a complete difference in my hair ,skin and nails. My face had fewer pimples and felt smooth. My nails grew like crazy I had to cut them more than usual. And my hair not only grew but felt super soft! You have to be very faithful to these pills and take them as directed if you want to see a change in your hair, skin and nails; just saying! I am very satisfied with this product that I am ordering my a second one! :)</li>
            <li> It works for men just as well as women! This is a pretty neat product. But like everyone else is saying you need to support the small businesses and buy direct from a distributor. The loyal customer program is pretty simple. Basically, how it works is you sign up and get a great price but you have to sign up for an auto ship of product for 3 months, after the 3 months you can stop the auto ship and still be a customer and order when ever you want for the discount price. Much cheaper that way.&lt;br /&gt;Try this site.&lt;br /&gt;brittcanwrap.myitworks.com</li>
            <li> I recommend buying this from an actual distributor to ensure that you are getting the real thing, but I think that Amazon is a great place to check out some honest reviews first. I took these pills for about 6 months and my hair grew at least twice its usual rate. But what was really impressive was the thickness. In the past when I&#x27;ve grown out my hair it has gotten stringy and thin. While taking hair skin and nails, my hair became longer but maintained its thickness. Nearly all of my friends and coworkers have made comments about my hair. Now, I stopped taking them a couple of months ago and noticed that my hair growth slowed, my nails break more easily, and I see more hair in the shower drain. It&#x27;s still beautiful and long, but I will be taking them again in order to get my hair to my desired length.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, these pills are definitely worth approximately a dollar a day ($33 for a month supply) from the It works website and I&#x27;m sure you know somebody who is a distributor. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product but I feel like you need to take them for 60-90 days before you see growth! Also they taste AWFUL. It&#x27;s hard to get them down every morning just because of the taste. Always eat before you take them because on an empty stomach you won&#x27;t feel good after. Other than that they seem to work quite well! Espically for someone like me who hair never seems to be griwing.</li>
            <li> when I was a senior in high school (5 years ago) I thought it would be awesome to have bleach blonde hair. To this day my hair has never recovered from it. It&#x27;s frail, thin, lifeless and falling out at a very rapid pace. My friend sells the it works products and tried to get me to try it. After trying so many products claiming to help and all of them failing to do so I just accepted I would be bald by my late 20&#x27;s. Finally out of desperation I tried the it works hair skin and nails. After week one my hair stopped shedding so much and it felt healthier to the touch. After 14 days i noticed new growth and my hair was even visibly longer. If you have issues with hair re growth or just want longer hair quickly try this product. It really does work</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is growing quickly.  This is our third order.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product it said it was missing 2. Whe I received it, there was 4 missing. I don&#x27;t care so much about that. What I kinda questioned is, why a lot of the pills had weird marks on them, marks that looked like something was spilled onto them?? Weird...</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  We have only been taking it for just over a week but so far, the results seem to be positive.  Hopefully, it continues to help my daughter&#x27;s hair growth!</li>
            <li> I am on my 3rd bottle and im very happy. I have extremely curly fragile hair. I can&#x27;t use excessive heat or non sulfate shampooh becase both damage my hair too much. Along with it being fragile my hair grows at the slowest rate ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first month of using it i could see a noticeable difference in length. Considering my hair grows so slow Its amazing that i have seen at least an entier inch grow in 2 months yay. This is a lot of growth for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is to stay consistent. Don&#x27;t skip days of taking them and always take them with a meal. My stomach is not at all sensitive but when i take this without eatting my stomach is not happy.</li>
            <li> This is very good for the enhancement of the hair and skin.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel thinker but it didn&#x27;t grow much faster</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It makes my skin much clearer than when I don&#x27;t take it.  My nails are harder and my hair grows faster as well.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive but it does do what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> I bought HSN from a family distributor and I am on my second week and I can already see a small difference.  Not a huge difference like some of the photos posted online, but there IS improvement.  I bought this product for hair regrowth as I have been experiencing loss for a few years, now.  I do see regrowth and I&#x27;m looking forward to future results.  I&#x27;m not concerned about length so I didn&#x27;t take any B&amp;F photos of my length.&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that my lashes are longer and a little fuller.&lt;br /&gt;My nails have seen small changes.  They still split but they don&#x27;t bend as easily.  I&#x27;m hopeful that splitting will no longer be a problem in the future.&lt;br /&gt;No skin changes that I can see.&lt;br /&gt;The pills don&#x27;t smell that great and they have a hint of peppermint taste (due to the oil).  I believe it&#x27;s worth it and will be purchasing additional bottles in the future.</li>
            <li> I break out.. So I&#x27;m switching back to hair infinity</li>
            <li> I HAVEN&#x27;T SEEN ANY RESULTS</li>
            <li> Great product with great results.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Lies it didnt work! Ima buy another one to see if it will this time but for the most part its all the people who sell it uping it and making it seem like a miracle drug. Ill write another review as a non pyramid schemer to see if it actually does work or its all lies from the distributors trying to get you to believe. We will see</li>
            <li> I can personally attest to this product as it works for me and I take it religiously and have for the last 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;However, I would recommend ordering here instead  http://jennilemons.myitworks.com&lt;br /&gt;To insure best pricing and best Expiration Date! You don&#x27;t want to buy all the product that is left over from previous vendors that didn&#x27;t sell.</li>
            <li> I try one bottel and it dont work i think i will need 2 more</li>
            <li> I love this product its AMAZING!!! My hair grew an inch in the first two weeks!!! If your looking for a cheaper price go to my website www.wrapmekaessee.com loyal customer price $33</li>
            <li> Love them. Second time ordering, first from Amazon but I love them either way!</li>
            <li> This product has worked very well for me. I didn&#x27;t experience insane amounts of hair growth, but at least double the normal rate. About 1 inch-1.5 inches a month. My nail heath is what impressed me the most! Every single nail of mine was peeling and within two weeks that was completely GONE. No more peeling just strong healthy nails. LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product, my nails are stronger and my skin is clearer. Sign up as a Loyal Customer( no sign up fees) for 60 tablets of HAIR SKIN AMD NAILS retail $55.00 BUT THE perks as a loyal customer ITS $33 visit  thatcrazywrapthingitworkz.myitworks.com</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t purchase product from here but I tried HSN &amp; loved it! Saw results within the 1st week but I made sure to take pics to document the change. Only took it for 3 weeks since I gave my mom a week sample to try too &amp; I can&#x27;t wait until my 2nd bottle arrives. If you feel sick taking it make sure it&#x27;s after a meal (vit c in it &amp; that usually causes nausea when taken on an empty stomach). For those who say it didn&#x27;t work for them I recommend maybe trying the ItWorks Greens first to help detox &amp; alkalize your body &amp; then try the HSN again if you wanna grow your hair, nails, or even just want healthier skin &amp; to boost your immune system. My mom loved both of those + the facial &amp; body applicators (used on chin/neck &amp; stomach) so much she joined as a distributor :) They have amazing health benefits! You can contact me for details, questions or discounts anytime 714-497-3244 :)</li>
            <li> Great product!!! I really could see the difference in the growth and strength of my hair.</li>
            <li> It really works. ... It takes time though</li>
            <li> No changes, nothing good happened to y hair or nail! Hair growth is normal. No Miraculous things happening here as the Advertisers are trying to convince us! Sorry did nothing.</li>
            <li> No. My hair is the same length :(</li>
            <li> I bought this right from the vendor. I have been using this product for a little over a year. I am very disappointed with the so called results. My nails did not grow longer, neither did my hair. Do not make the mistake of setting these pills up on auto-shipment order like I did. If you do not order for at least a year, and try to cancel the auto-shipments they will charge your card 75 dollars. For all of the hype surrounding this product I was really disappointed. And yes I drunk at least 8 glasses of water everyday. (even before taking pills). Latetly I have been seeing a lot of advertising for the manechoice hair products. So I may give that a chance. And believe you me, I don&#x27;t care how good a product is no more auto-shipment orders for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with hopes that it would help me in any way possible.. I took the whole bottle and all it did was make me break out, my nails were fragile, and my hair stayed the same it never grew. It also made me gain water weight.. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Iv been using HSN by it works for about a month now my hair has grown about 2 inches however my face is breaking out a lot, I had to stop taking the recommended 2 a day and bring it down to 1 a day because the breakouts were pretty bad but I also wasn&#x27;t drinking a lot of water so that might of been the cause. Iv tried store bought vitamins which don&#x27;t work, hairfinity &amp; Manechoice and these have worked the fastest offside of the acne problem I love them</li>
            <li> its ok. i havent seen much results from it after 2 orders of this product.</li>
            <li> My hair has really grown since using these vitamins.  I have now been using them for 5 months and I am so happy.</li>
    </ol>
