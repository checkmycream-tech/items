            <li>This was a gift for my daughter and she was very pleased.</li>
            <li>I love these!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more to stock up!</li>
            <li>and I love them!  </li>
            <li>Cant wait to get more!  </li>
            <li>Easy to look good with these clips.</li>
            <li>any more so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Nice, secure option for styling your hair in a up-do.  </li>
            <li>They hold my hair up off of my neck better than anything I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Love how it doesn&#x27;t interfere like alligator clips -</li>
            <li>I love the style of these clips...have been using them for 5+ years.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 sets, one for me n one for my sister, we both love them.</li>
            <li>They could stand to be a bit more durable and</li>
            <li>most clips, they either do not stay in my hair or they give me a headache</li>
            <li>Love these clips.</li>
            <li>I love these clips.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the claws that have teeth on both sides -</li>
            <li>, teeth broke more often, and the clip did not hold up as well.</li>
            <li>I have both sizes to accommodate my hair changes and I can&#x27;t wait to get more.  </li>
            <li>These do a good job of holding up the right amount of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I will pass these on to my 7 year old great granddaughter.</li>
            <li>I like that these are flatter than most others, which lets the hair more gently &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; out of the top of the clip, still hiding the rolled hair snug against my head.</li>
            <li>I do have a lot of fine hair</li>
            <li>That might sound like hyeprbole, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li>Attractive looking, but they need to go back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li>It worked really well because I have very fine hair and these flatter clips hole it well.  </li>
            <li>Great for most hair types, I have really thick hair and these clips</li>
            <li>Great quick way to throw up your hair in a messy updo</li>
            <li>What I am pleased about is they are very comfortable when you lean back, they don&#x27;t dig into your scalp or create a large bump as some butterfly like clips do.</li>
            <li>The flat bottom piece is perfect for holding long hair in place.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making it available.  </li>
            <li>Nice design on a standard claw.  </li>
            <li>I have had numerous people ask me where I got them since they really liked them also.</li>
            <li>I have longer hair than I used to, but it&#x27;s very fine, and I assumed that these would work, but they don&#x27;t actually hold all my hair.</li>
            <li>The teeth started breaking, but I put them to some pretty rugged use.  </li>
            <li>Broke the first time I wore it</li>
            <li>but overall I love them and would buy them again if anything happened to the ones I have.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>so I want to make sure I have back ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They hold any type of hair, without pinching or poking, and they look far more elegant that the typical plastic hair clip.</li>
            <li>Updated review -- the last couple of times I ordered these, the spring did not seem as strong</li>
            <li>The description says they are large.</li>
            <li>They seemingly &amp;#34;measure&amp;#34; up fine, but when you actually put them into your hair to hold your bun up there is no room.</li>
            <li>I really needed them.</li>
            <li>I really like these hair clips...</li>
            <li>After a while, some of the teeth will break which is not unusual with most combs like this</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t fit all my hair as I was hoping, so only part updos with these, although they do hold well.</li>
            <li>I think it really depends on your hair.</li>
            <li>I had a similar clip that I finally broke most of the teeth off of and could not find anything like it.  </li>
            <li>The Goody hair claws that I previously purchased (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ACK7FW4/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) work far better than these.</li>
            <li>I was hoping they would be smaller than the large updo claws but not half the size.</li>
            <li>Nice and flat, hard to find.</li>
            <li>One pair had black and tortoise and one had black and kind of bronze tone one.</li>
            <li>These are much smaller than I was expecting and they can&#x27;t hold all my fine long hair up and lay flat.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair past my shoulders and this clip holds all of my hair all day.</li>
            <li>I found them three days ago at Dollar General Store for $3 per pair.</li>
            <li>They have become hard to find where I live for some odd reason, so I found these here on Amazon :)  </li>
            <li>Order the large ones if you have long thick hair, small if you have shorter fine hair.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I thought these would be large clips but are actually are small to medium size.  </li>
            <li> Now that the donation&#x27;s done, I still have pretty long hair, well past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull or catch on things, since it lies flat against the head.</li>
            <li> I got these after I saw the good reviews but was SO disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought the small clip and they are very sturdy and last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> The web was not very clear on the size.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long hair, and it doesn&#x27;t stay up well in those clips.  </li>
            <li> These updo claws are smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> But these were way smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> They were not large enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> The picture makes it seem like these hair claws are quite large, but they are very small.  </li>
            <li> Really like these specific clips, they are very hard to find and it took me a while to even find them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Not strong enough to hold a French roll.</li>
            <li> you can rest your head against the car&#x27;s headrest without a problem, and even lie down with total comfort.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair and often have a hard time finding clips that will work for me.  </li>
            <li> but there is absolutely no grip to hold the wait.</li>
            <li> I have a larger version of this type clip that is breaking after a few years use.</li>
            <li> have no problem holding my hair up even when wet.</li>
            <li> Not nearly strong enough.</li>
            <li> The tips had broken off my old ones after some time and abuse on my part.</li>
            <li> Therefore, the hair slides down.</li>
            <li> They wouldn&#x27;t hold even half of my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have thick hair but its medium to long length.</li>
            <li> a few times I have wished that the spring was slightly tighter</li>
            <li> To little to bother trying to return.</li>
            <li> Too small, not useful for my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought several a couple of years ago, and they&#x27;ve eventually broken (and I use them just about every day).  </li>
            <li> I use one almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY thick and curly long hair.</li>
            <li> I had purchased them initially at a local store and then was unable to find them, so I had to order online,  </li>
            <li> Too small to be of any use to me</li>
            <li> Some reviewers said they are too small -</li>
            <li> Smalerl than expected and doesn&#x27;t say in my thin hair well</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> It works nicely in my thick 4c hair, holds it in place and doesn&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
            <li> One of the combs teeth had broken off when it arrived, making it non usable</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry with these clips.  </li>
            <li> Grrr</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Nice, secure option for styling your hair in a up-do.  My hair hangs a couple of inches below my shoulders and is a medium thickness.  These claws hold my hair without pulling.</li>
            <li> I had a similar clip that I finally broke most of the teeth off of and could not find anything like it.  It worked really well because I have very fine hair and these flatter clips hole it well.  I saw these online and thought about ordering them.  I found them three days ago at Dollar General Store for $3 per pair. One pair had black and tortoise and one had black and kind of bronze tone one.</li>
            <li> I got a set of these in my Christmas stocking 2 years ago.  I love these!  They hold my hair up off of my neck better than anything I have ever used.  They have become hard to find where I live for some odd reason, so I found these here on Amazon :)  The teeth started breaking, but I put them to some pretty rugged use.  I have VERY thick and curly long hair.</li>
            <li> Horrible! I got these after I saw the good reviews but was SO disappointed. They do not grip the hair at all. I do have a lot of fine hair but there is absolutely no grip to hold the wait. Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> These work well for me.  I had purchased them initially at a local store and then was unable to find them, so I had to order online,  The tips had broken off my old ones after some time and abuse on my part. Good product.</li>
            <li> I use these clips all the time to contain my hair and keep it neat.</li>
            <li> Too small, not useful for my hair. I will pass these on to my 7 year old great granddaughter. Quality appears good.</li>
            <li> Broke the first time I wore it</li>
            <li> Great medium size clip.  Love how it doesn&#x27;t interfere like alligator clips - you can rest your head against the car&#x27;s headrest without a problem, and even lie down with total comfort.</li>
            <li> The web was not very clear on the size.  They were not large enough for my hair. I have long hair.</li>

            <li> The flat bottom piece is perfect for holding long hair in place.  Thanks for making it available.  I really needed them.</li>
            <li> I love the style of these clips...have been using them for 5+ years. Used to buy them at WalMart for just a couple of bucks.</li>
            <li> I have a larger version of this type clip that is breaking after a few years use. These were about 1/3 smaller than I anticipated but they do hold my hair back in a French twist type style. I have shoulder length, medium texture, curly hair. What I am pleased about is they are very comfortable when you lean back, they don&#x27;t dig into your scalp or create a large bump as some butterfly like clips do.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 sets, one for me n one for my sister, we both love them. Great for most hair types, I have really thick hair and these clips have no problem holding my hair up even when wet.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair and often have a hard time finding clips that will work for me.  I use these to just twist my hair and pin it up.  They could stand to be a bit more durable and a few times I have wished that the spring was slightly tighter but overall I love them and would buy them again if anything happened to the ones I have.</li>
            <li> That might sound like hyeprbole, but it&#x27;s not.  They are terrific.  They hold any type of hair, without pinching or poking, and they look far more elegant that the typical plastic hair clip.</li>
            <li> The description says they are large. No they are not. They are medium at best. To little to bother trying to return. Grrr</li>
            <li> Nice design on a standard claw.  It works nicely in my thick 4c hair, holds it in place and doesn&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
            <li> At one time was almost to my waist when I was growing it to donate. Now that the donation&#x27;s done, I still have pretty long hair, well past my shoulders. I like that these are flatter than most others, which lets the hair more gently &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; out of the top of the clip, still hiding the rolled hair snug against my head. It just look nicer,to me. Lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> They are best if sleep with hair up, can not find in NJ. Very good product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> I really like these hair clips...</li>
            <li> Really like these specific clips, they are very hard to find and it took me a while to even find them on Amazon.  Since I have had such a problem finding them, I bought multiple packages.  After a while, some of the teeth will break which is not unusual with most combs like this so I want to make sure I have back ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With most clips, they either do not stay in my hair or they give me a headache and I have to take them out after a while.  I have had numerous people ask me where I got them since they really liked them also.</li>
            <li> Love these clips. Lay flatter on head than others. Holds lots of hair.  Easy to look good with these clips.</li>
            <li> I love these clips.  I bought several a couple of years ago, and they&#x27;ve eventually broken (and I use them just about every day).  I can&#x27;t find them in my local stores any more so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.  I don&#x27;t love the claws that have teeth on both sides - I have fairly long hair, and it doesn&#x27;t stay up well in those clips.  These, however, work beautifully.  I&#x27;ll be buying more to stock up!</li>
            <li> Not strong enough to hold a French roll. It sort of holds it but feels lose and I don&#x27;t have thick hair but its medium to long length.</li>
            <li> Too small to be of any use to me</li>
            <li> These are much smaller than I was expecting and they can&#x27;t hold all my fine long hair up and lay flat.  I was hoping they would be smaller than the large updo claws but not half the size.</li>
            <li> These updo claws are smaller than I expected. I have longer hair than I used to, but it&#x27;s very fine, and I assumed that these would work, but they don&#x27;t actually hold all my hair. The Goody hair claws that I previously purchased (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ACK7FW4/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) work far better than these.</li>
            <li> they looked bigger in the photo.  they don&#x27;t fit all my hair as I was hoping, so only part updos with these, although they do hold well.</li>
            <li> These do not hold my hair at all. Not nearly strong enough. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Updated review -- the last couple of times I ordered these, the spring did not seem as strong, teeth broke more often, and the clip did not hold up as well. Therefore, the hair slides down. It&#x27;s a shame because they used tonbe perfect for me. ---------- I have fine hair past my shoulders and this clip holds all of my hair all day. It doesn&#x27;t pull or catch on things, since it lies flat against the head. I would buy these in every color if they made them.  Some reviewers said they are too small - I think it really depends on your hair. For me, if it were any larger it wouldn&#x27;t stay put.</li>
            <li> These do a good job of holding up the right amount of my hair.  It stays in place very nicely.</li>
            <li> I have 2 pairs of these claws and I love them!  I bought the small clip and they are very sturdy and last a very long time.  Cant wait to get more!  You won&#x27;t be sorry with these clips.  Order the large ones if you have long thick hair, small if you have shorter fine hair.  I have both sizes to accommodate my hair changes and I can&#x27;t wait to get more.  They even stay put during my strenuous workouts!!</li>
            <li> These hair devices work great. I use one almost everyday.  I recommend them to any one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I wish they had some lighter colors . Like Tan or beige.</li>
            <li> The picture makes it seem like these hair claws are quite large, but they are very small.  They wouldn&#x27;t hold even half of my hair.  Don&#x27;t be fooled; these are not the size of the Goody updo claw which used to be sold at Walmart.  They are much smaller.  I am going to return them and continue to look for a larger size.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t send back - too costly. But these were way smaller than I expected. They seemingly &amp;#34;measure&amp;#34; up fine, but when you actually put them into your hair to hold your bun up there is no room. Attractive looking, but they need to go back to the drawing board. Don&#x27;t like - off to Goodwill.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be large clips but are actually are small to medium size.  They will not hold all my hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for keeping my hair up during my gym workouts.</li>
            <li> Nice and flat, hard to find. Doesn&#x27;t jab into your head</li>
            <li> Great quick way to throw up your hair in a messy updo</li>
            <li> Smalerl than expected and doesn&#x27;t say in my thin hair well</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I wanted</li>
    </ol>
