            <li>Time will tell, but so far, so good!</li>

            <li>Haha, don&#x27;t lie, you know you love popping your pimples :P)...</li>
            <li>Very clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>Even though the reviews were pretty good, I still gave it a shot</li>
            <li>I loved it at first.</li>
            <li>What a unique soap!</li>
            <li>I also use it on my face and my skin feels marvelous as well (his skin is oily, mine dry)</li>
            <li>The smell is very sweet and it lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li>My first impressions were that I loved how smooth and moisturizing it felt.</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments on how smooth my skin looks.</li>
            <li>and i have three grown kids and a six year old , and proud</li>
            <li>My mother has gotten rid of dark spots with this soap, it is excellent for every skin problem, and this brand smells lovely.</li>
            <li>It was good, however seems to go fast when water hits it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to use in the shower and it suds up very well.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel squeaky clean and it has a nice, unique fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The oat also gives it a nice super light exfoliating texture.  </li>
            <li>The reviews are true!</li>
            <li>Product was delivered very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I can easily obtain this soap for $2.49-$2.99.  </li>
            <li>However, I think this soap was too strong for my face.</li>
            <li>For the face, if you don&#x27;t have any major acne issues, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Very gentle but effective at cleaning.</li>
            <li>For the body, it lathers great, (it lathers grey, interesting to see).</li>
            <li>You are really lucky if this worked for you, but it didnt work for me!</li>
            <li>Itll probably take 2 more days to completely clear but it looked like 80 percent better already!</li>
            <li>that light ashy-skin thing.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel really smooth</li>
            <li>My legs feel so smooth and there is a light fragrance on my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it as shaving cream too, and my skin has never felt so smooth after a shave.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and its the best cleanser I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>Enjoy and stock up.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the skin your in .</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and is really soothing.</li>
            <li>It is a great daily cleanser for your body &amp; face to help keep the break outs away.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your body feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s already started balancing my skin and actually works great for my combination/breakout-prone face, as well as the rest of me.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve started using the tea tree oil face wash by the body shop which I really enjoy.</li>
            <li>so I need something more powerful.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So I guess it is a good natural soap.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful bar of soap..very thick and rich ...smells lovely..</li>
            <li>After experiencing the hell of teenage acne years ago I&#x27;m fortunate now to have very nice skin.</li>
            <li>gives a great deep clean to your skin.</li>
            <li>Cleans all that dirt off your skin, leave body feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>This soap has a straightforward ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s rich and creamy</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this product, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am excited to try this.</li>
            <li>Will try to find the original</li>
            <li>First, the smell -- If strong scents easily overwhelm you, this bar is one to try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky with scents, so maybe most people would enjoy it.</li>
            <li>This gets you squeaky clean</li>
            <li>Love that it is natural without the chemicals in many of the cleansers out there.</li>
            <li>i like the smell and the clean feeling</li>
            <li>This soap is great for acne, blemishes, and dry skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel and look clean</li>
            <li>Superior quality, authentic African soap (I&#x27;m West African) super gentle and kind of drying in an OMG-my-skin-feels-really-clean kind of way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it thus far !</li>
            <li>Nothing Special.</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s a bit dry and you need to use a mild toner with this, I can proudly say that my skin is getting so nice and clear.  </li>
            <li>I see results with a natural soap, and for him, it is a just as effective as OTC hydrocortisone cream.</li>
            <li>good soap overall, def recommend trying.</li>
            <li>We both notice a significant difference in our skin after the first week of use!</li>
            <li>It is also great if you are breastfeeding a baby with super sensitive skin as perfumes in adult soaps can irritate a baby&#x27;s skin, but this does not.</li>
            <li>(mildly severe)and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer if it had more of a scent, but I have a feeling that adding scent would only lead to clogging my pores and reverse all of the effects that I love.</li>
            <li>I have mild acne.</li>
            <li>I like how this soap is 100% natural and organic, so it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li>That being said, it also makes them fade quickly and heal.</li>
            <li>As an aside, the scent is a mild fruity coconut.</li>
            <li>Non-drying and mildly exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>Now my acne is gone to mild.  </li>
            <li>Compared to other acne fighting cleansers, this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This soap smells like liquorish candy, which is pleasant, it&#x27;s not sickly sweet, just a light scent.</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s usually pretty good.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this product!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product and will  be ordering more!</li>
            <li>skin is smooth, moisturized, and, most importantly, it is completely clear for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>and I have extremely sensitive skin) and left a light, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this will work in the long run but so far, so good!</li>
            <li>It was great at clearing up my acne in these areas as well, and I did not experience dryness, tightness and uneven skin tone in these areas.</li>
            <li>so far this combo has worked for me and my skin has become soooo much better.</li>
            <li>GOOD, A BIT ROUGH FOR MY SKIN</li>
            <li>Nothing exciting about this soap.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>One thing, he is 10 years old, and his eczema is not as challenging as it was when he was 2 yrs.</li>
            <li>fresh scent....</li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t like right away was the scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying another bar right after I finish writing this review.</li>
            <li>I use a cotton ball with toner right afterwards and there is literally no dirt on it when I use it with the face brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have been looking for the right and affective soap for my combination</li>
            <li>, I really feel clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>I had tried the raw soap originally and really loved it though I found it a bit drying.</li>
            <li>I ordered this black soap with the expectations of it really being great for my skin</li>
            <li>.. i do have very oily skin black soap and aztec clay works so great and also</li>
            <li>When my pimple time came around, my pimples were larger (sort of like mosquito-bite type ones vs. the ones you can pop easily!</li>
            <li>bar is LARGE!</li>
            <li>I was slightly hesitant to try it, but did and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>I love how this soap makes my skin feel so soft and the scent is absolutely divine.</li>
            <li>Cruelty free and all natural and organic ingredients!</li>
            <li>This soap does break down kind of quickly, so I suggest you don&#x27;t leave it laying around in the shower.</li>
            <li>As for my face... it does make your face feel really smooth and clean at the same time!</li>
            <li>The look, smell, feel of it, and packaging is different and appealing.</li>
            <li>my skin feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft, smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This is much more of a commercial soap like Dove or something.</li>
            <li>and its freakin 4 dollars at whole foods!</li>
            <li>I wanted to act like it was all in my head because it at first was working.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>also, after the first time using it, we saw improvements.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I really like this soap!</li>
            <li>: MAKE SURE TO KEEP AWAY FROM WATER AFTER YOU ARE FINISHED USING THE PRODUCT because the water will make it smaller faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying this soap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments on how clean and clear my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I had been using a variety of Clean and Clear cleansers to manage my oily skin and control breakouts.</li>
            <li>I wash my face with the african black soap each morning and loved the way it makes my face so smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>really good soup - I use it everyday which is probably too much</li>
            <li>but it was nice to just try a different soap plus its natural.</li>
            <li>At first we really like the soap..</li>
            <li>As with most clarifying treatments skin goes through the  &amp;#34;worse before it gets better.&amp;#34;I highly recomend this product I will be stocking up on my next shop.</li>
            <li>It works quite well and leaves my skin super soft.  </li>
            <li>This soap also has large exfoliating piece which is a plus.</li>
            <li>Next I am going to try black soap from coastal scents website as i have heard great reviews about that too.</li>
            <li>And, after using this bar for the first time, I&#x27;ve moved on to experimenting with other Nubian Heritage soaps. :3</li>
            <li>I bought this soap because like many others, I wanted a natural product that was cheap and would help me with my black scaring and acne.</li>
            <li>Recently i came across many good reviews about african black soap and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>so I am not so sure it is really the authentic African Black Soap--</li>
            <li>My smooth hands now deliver a delicate and pillowy caress - one with which I love the world.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>it is working very well.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t like it much at all.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the moisture was too much?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with acne and used all kinds of OTC and Rx medications and none ever really worked.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was from something else the whole time.</li>
            <li>I really, really like this soap.  </li>
            <li>This soap foams up a lot and you can really feel it cleaning.</li>
            <li>I bought this soap at Whole Foods and just now reordered it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>soap lathers real well</li>
            <li>It gets all my makeup off, and really helped with my acne.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t really clearing my acne</li>
            <li>I just bought this from Whole Foods yesterday</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>This product is highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this soap to EVERYONE!</li>
            <li>Im very jealous to see how the soap works for the MAJORITY of you but</li>
            <li>Also, I really dislike the scrubby chunks in the soap..</li>
            <li>This time it has pieces of something to help exfoliate but it is very scratchy.</li>
            <li>purchased this product because I received a free sample of a similar product - http://www.amazon.com/Shea-Moisture-African-Black-Soap-8/dp/B005C2N8IC - from a sample website.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really heal my skin</li>
            <li>thanks to the school floor too)</li>
            <li>Lathers nicely, but the effect--itchy, inflamed eczema--was the same as using regular soap.</li>
            <li>It seemed like It was well roundly working effectively on my face.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, leaves your skin feeling tight and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had fear it would leave a different kind of &#x27;soap scum&#x27; on my shower, but have just made a point to clean the shower more often than I normally did to avoid this happening (captain obvious here?).</li>
            <li>I tried getting my skin back to it&#x27;s original self for weeks, but nothing I  tried worked.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair with it today and it left my hair so clean.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that any pimples I had would dry out very quickly, and the size of the pimple would be reduced.</li>
            <li>They work great as a regular soap, but they are nowhere near the black soaps made in Africa.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth, soft, and clean; not tight or dry.</li>
            <li>I have been using this soap between 1-2 weeks, and it has worked very well for clearing up my mild facial acne.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, most products I use have no effect or limited effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get as many break outs or dark spots.  </li>
            <li>I honestly never though a soap would have such a great effect on my skin, I suffer from really oily skin, I&#x27;m a contemporary dancer wich means dance with my face touchig</li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry like the other, but I also didn&#x27;t feel it cleaned as best as the other.</li>
            <li>Nothing more nothing less.</li>
            <li>I also use it to shower, and I notice that my feet which were dry are now so smooth.  </li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t get more or less acne.</li>
            <li>Using this soap has cleared my existing breakouts and is controlling my oily skin decently.</li>
            <li>I did not want to throw the soap away, so I decided to use it on my back and chest, where I also had mild acne.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth it for clear, soft skin.</li>
            <li>I had mild redness on my face after switching coasts several years ago.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out the body as much as the lemongrass soap does, but is also not as squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>It smells great and gets the job done without a bunch of unnecessary chemicals that I don&#x27;t want near our bodies...</li>
            <li>alredy, they said it looks cleaner, even and vibrant.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to most cleansing products; my face becomes a dry, itching mess quite easily.  </li>
            <li>The acne around my jawline, my forehead, heck my whole face was clear!</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The Nubian Heritage African Black Bar Soap is the most healing soap that one can use!</li>
            <li>It does leave your skin feeling squeaky clean, but hey, you can add lotion afterwards if your skin is dry like mine.  </li>
            <li>and I am seriously thinking about getting more!  </li>
            <li>took like 2 weeks to get here, dries my skin too much and any other soap soo, nothing special here  </li>
            <li>This seemed more like the standard soaps which lather a lot and make my skin taut, dry and stretchy!</li>
            <li>My face would literally make a squeaking sound when I would rub it, and I don&#x27;t remember experiencing this with other products.  </li>
            <li>However, I see that it was made in New York</li>
            <li>NEW UPDATE:  </li>
            <li>I can say that it last much longer &amp; holds its shape compared to real ABS.</li>
            <li>Smells good and last a month at least.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have acne and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very natural.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smells, but this does not bother me at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin very softly and brihteing&lt;</li>
            <li>:(  By the way- the tea tree soap smells the best!</li>
            <li>We also notice that our skin is soft and I have not had to use lotion!  </li>
            <li>This is actually the first review I&#x27;ve EVER done..</li>
            <li>It feels soooo soft!</li>
            <li>Anyway, I stopped using this black soap because of that and also because it started making my skin lightly itchy, as well as have</li>
            <li>If your hair becomes dry during particular periods of the year, try washing your hair with this bar rather than using hot oils or protein</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis and this soap really does seem to help calm down the flare ups.  </li>
            <li>I used it for my face for about 2 months before getting authentic African black soap to try out.  </li>
            <li>This soap also smells much better than traditional black soap.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased a couple of varieties of this soap but, the African Black Soap is my favorite.</li>
            <li>The soap was always black, and I recall thinking that was interesting, and perhaps it was something specific for her skin type.</li>
            <li>I suffer from dry skin and this gives the right balance without making it anything oily.</li>
            <li>African Black soap made my skin feel so smooth and gentle.</li>
            <li>Also I live in CA, and our winter is pretty dry here, but still... never happened before with a soap.  </li>
            <li>often so Its hard to keep my skin healthy</li>
            <li>Great for people with dirty or oil skin.</li>
            <li>I use it as a cleanser in the  hope of reducing acne outbreaks and to clear up blemishes.</li>
            <li>I also feel like it&#x27;s been helping to keep my face clear of acne.</li>
            <li>I almost forgot to put foundation on because my face was so clear and even.</li>
            <li>and it makes it so clear</li>
            <li>So 2 stars for not being complete liars.</li>
            <li>Your skin was soft once and will be again --</li>
            <li>I just rub it between my hands and apply the lather instead of applying the soap directly to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li>my skin is fairly sensitive it didn&#x27;t burn or cause discomfort.</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients did not irritate my skin( I even used it on my face</li>
            <li>My skin feel soft, I did not have to use a body lotion...</li>
            <li>It makes it so soft and clears acne without drying.</li>
            <li>This was the simple solution sitting under my nose the whole time</li>
            <li>AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;----I have sensitive skin/</li>
            <li>My skin is so clear and soft.</li>
            <li>old.</li>
            <li>It really makes my sweaty areas feel deep cleaned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently started to develop bacne too, I&#x27;ve used this bar to smooth my back back out.</li>
            <li>Hydrates skin leaving it soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned &amp; acne and dark blemishes stand out HARSH!</li>
            <li>It clears away makeup and dirt, and leaves it feeling clean, and not too tight.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, it did make my skin feel dry</li>
            <li>Granted this isn&#x27;t exactly &#x27;black soap&#x27;, i still wanted to try and see if the American made black soaps were any good.</li>
            <li>Sometime later I arrived upon this particular product and my skin has never been clearer or softer since.</li>
            <li>No black residue....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and it will be the only product I use for my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>After trying all the highly advertised acne products that don&#x27;t work as they claim, we have finally found the solution.</li>
            <li>Not only have the pimples vanished, but it is very, very soft AND the redness is completely gone.</li>
            <li>Daily use has eliminated the breakouts, and made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and acne-prone skin, and this soap is the ONLY thing that has ever worked for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week now and notice how soft and moisturized my body and face feel!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never go back to my old skincare routine after using this!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this is my first black soap.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, that particular product is close to $9 a bar on Amazon -- so I went looking for an alternative and found this soap, which is even better than the Shea Moisture bar that I received for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just be aware that the little bits of oat are quite scratchy and could irritate sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Maybe other african black soaps are better?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always skeptical about something that&#x27;s been featured on Dr. Oz, but this soap is amazing.</li>
            <li>The areas that were already slightly dark became darker, which made my uneven skin tone even more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I showered all over with the soap last night and basically woke up to clear skin.</li>
            <li>When he was 2 yrs old, his eczema covered his legs, above underwear line, elbows, and forearms.</li>
            <li>The scent is barely there.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see my skin get any better or worse</li>
            <li>My teenage son started using it twice a day on his face and during his shower and his face and back are now clear of acne.</li>
            <li>This has been the only soap thus far that naturally heals my husband&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li>My husband has &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; skin, he gets terrible breakouts on his back and occasionally on his chest, but since he started using this stuff I have never seen his skin so clear and soft, and he&#x27;s so much more confident about walking around with his shirt off in the house.  </li>
            <li>Tried it for two days straight, and I literally had cystic acne all over my face as a result, which now has turned into dark scars.</li>
            <li>Using this has cleared up the dry and made my skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone that has sensitive skin or dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nubian Heritage-African Black Soap for almost 6 months straight.</li>
            <li>It caused my face to become quite dry and tight, and my skin tone became more uneven.</li>
            <li>Be careful if your skin is sensitive!</li>
            <li>I suffered from red/dry/itchy areas that would arise on the soft spots of my body (inside of my arms/legs, around my hip area where my pants rub, and worstly~horribly red, dry, flakey areas around my eyes.)  </li>
            <li>It has a subtle sweet smell.</li>
            <li>But then again, not everyone&#x27;s face is the same, but for someone like me who has oily, sensitive, and dry skin DO NOT USE THIS!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Haha, don&#x27;t lie, you know you love popping your pimples :P)...</li>
            <li> Very clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> Even though the reviews were pretty good, I still gave it a shot</li>
            <li> I loved it at first.</li>
            <li> What a unique soap!</li>
            <li> I also use it on my face and my skin feels marvelous as well (his skin is oily, mine dry)</li>
            <li> The smell is very sweet and it lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> My first impressions were that I loved how smooth and moisturizing it felt.</li>
            <li> and I get so many compliments on how smooth my skin looks.</li>
            <li> and i have three grown kids and a six year old , and proud</li>
            <li> My mother has gotten rid of dark spots with this soap, it is excellent for every skin problem, and this brand smells lovely.</li>
            <li> It was good, however seems to go fast when water hits it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to use in the shower and it suds up very well.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel squeaky clean and it has a nice, unique fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The oat also gives it a nice super light exfoliating texture.  </li>
            <li> The reviews are true!</li>
            <li> Product was delivered very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I can easily obtain this soap for $2.49-$2.99.  </li>
            <li> However, I think this soap was too strong for my face.</li>
            <li> For the face, if you don&#x27;t have any major acne issues, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Very gentle but effective at cleaning.</li>
            <li> For the body, it lathers great, (it lathers grey, interesting to see).</li>
            <li> You are really lucky if this worked for you, but it didnt work for me!</li>
            <li> Itll probably take 2 more days to completely clear but it looked like 80 percent better already!</li>
            <li> that light ashy-skin thing.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel really smooth</li>
            <li> My legs feel so smooth and there is a light fragrance on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it as shaving cream too, and my skin has never felt so smooth after a shave.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and its the best cleanser I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> Enjoy and stock up.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the skin your in .</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, and is really soothing.</li>
            <li> It is a great daily cleanser for your body &amp; face to help keep the break outs away.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your body feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s already started balancing my skin and actually works great for my combination/breakout-prone face, as well as the rest of me.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve started using the tea tree oil face wash by the body shop which I really enjoy.</li>
            <li> so I need something more powerful.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So I guess it is a good natural soap.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful bar of soap..very thick and rich ...smells lovely..</li>
            <li> After experiencing the hell of teenage acne years ago I&#x27;m fortunate now to have very nice skin.</li>
            <li> gives a great deep clean to your skin.</li>
            <li> Cleans all that dirt off your skin, leave body feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> This soap has a straightforward ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s rich and creamy</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this product, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am excited to try this.</li>
            <li> Will try to find the original</li>
            <li> First, the smell -- If strong scents easily overwhelm you, this bar is one to try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky with scents, so maybe most people would enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This gets you squeaky clean</li>
            <li> Love that it is natural without the chemicals in many of the cleansers out there.</li>
            <li> i like the smell and the clean feeling</li>
            <li> This soap is great for acne, blemishes, and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel and look clean</li>
            <li> Superior quality, authentic African soap (I&#x27;m West African) super gentle and kind of drying in an OMG-my-skin-feels-really-clean kind of way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it thus far !</li>
            <li> Nothing Special.</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s a bit dry and you need to use a mild toner with this, I can proudly say that my skin is getting so nice and clear.  </li>
            <li> I see results with a natural soap, and for him, it is a just as effective as OTC hydrocortisone cream.</li>
            <li> good soap overall, def recommend trying.</li>
            <li> We both notice a significant difference in our skin after the first week of use!</li>
            <li> It is also great if you are breastfeeding a baby with super sensitive skin as perfumes in adult soaps can irritate a baby&#x27;s skin, but this does not.</li>
            <li> (mildly severe)and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer if it had more of a scent, but I have a feeling that adding scent would only lead to clogging my pores and reverse all of the effects that I love.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne.</li>
            <li> I like how this soap is 100% natural and organic, so it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li> That being said, it also makes them fade quickly and heal.</li>
            <li> As an aside, the scent is a mild fruity coconut.</li>
            <li> Non-drying and mildly exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> Now my acne is gone to mild.  </li>
            <li> Compared to other acne fighting cleansers, this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This soap smells like liquorish candy, which is pleasant, it&#x27;s not sickly sweet, just a light scent.</li>
            <li> but overall it&#x27;s usually pretty good.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this product!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product and will  be ordering more!</li>
            <li> skin is smooth, moisturized, and, most importantly, it is completely clear for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> and I have extremely sensitive skin) and left a light, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this will work in the long run but so far, so good!</li>
            <li> It was great at clearing up my acne in these areas as well, and I did not experience dryness, tightness and uneven skin tone in these areas.</li>
            <li> so far this combo has worked for me and my skin has become soooo much better.</li>
            <li> GOOD, A BIT ROUGH FOR MY SKIN</li>
            <li> Nothing exciting about this soap.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> One thing, he is 10 years old, and his eczema is not as challenging as it was when he was 2 yrs.</li>
            <li> fresh scent....</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t like right away was the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying another bar right after I finish writing this review.</li>
            <li> I use a cotton ball with toner right afterwards and there is literally no dirt on it when I use it with the face brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have been looking for the right and affective soap for my combination</li>
            <li> , I really feel clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> I had tried the raw soap originally and really loved it though I found it a bit drying.</li>
            <li> I ordered this black soap with the expectations of it really being great for my skin</li>
            <li> .. i do have very oily skin black soap and aztec clay works so great and also</li>
            <li> When my pimple time came around, my pimples were larger (sort of like mosquito-bite type ones vs. the ones you can pop easily!</li>
            <li> bar is LARGE!</li>
            <li> I was slightly hesitant to try it, but did and LOVED it.</li>
            <li> I love how this soap makes my skin feel so soft and the scent is absolutely divine.</li>
            <li> Cruelty free and all natural and organic ingredients!</li>
            <li> This soap does break down kind of quickly, so I suggest you don&#x27;t leave it laying around in the shower.</li>
            <li> As for my face... it does make your face feel really smooth and clean at the same time!</li>
            <li> The look, smell, feel of it, and packaging is different and appealing.</li>
            <li> my skin feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft, smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is much more of a commercial soap like Dove or something.</li>
            <li> and its freakin 4 dollars at whole foods!</li>
            <li> I wanted to act like it was all in my head because it at first was working.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> also, after the first time using it, we saw improvements.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I really like this soap!</li>
            <li> : MAKE SURE TO KEEP AWAY FROM WATER AFTER YOU ARE FINISHED USING THE PRODUCT because the water will make it smaller faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying this soap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments on how clean and clear my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I had been using a variety of Clean and Clear cleansers to manage my oily skin and control breakouts.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with the african black soap each morning and loved the way it makes my face so smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li> really good soup - I use it everyday which is probably too much</li>
            <li> but it was nice to just try a different soap plus its natural.</li>
            <li> At first we really like the soap..</li>
            <li> As with most clarifying treatments skin goes through the  &amp;#34;worse before it gets better.&amp;#34;I highly recomend this product I will be stocking up on my next shop.</li>
            <li> It works quite well and leaves my skin super soft.  </li>
            <li> This soap also has large exfoliating piece which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Next I am going to try black soap from coastal scents website as i have heard great reviews about that too.</li>
            <li> And, after using this bar for the first time, I&#x27;ve moved on to experimenting with other Nubian Heritage soaps. :3</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because like many others, I wanted a natural product that was cheap and would help me with my black scaring and acne.</li>
            <li> Recently i came across many good reviews about african black soap and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> so I am not so sure it is really the authentic African Black Soap--</li>
            <li> My smooth hands now deliver a delicate and pillowy caress - one with which I love the world.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> it is working very well.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t like it much at all.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the moisture was too much?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne and used all kinds of OTC and Rx medications and none ever really worked.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was from something else the whole time.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this soap.  </li>
            <li> This soap foams up a lot and you can really feel it cleaning.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap at Whole Foods and just now reordered it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> soap lathers real well</li>
            <li> It gets all my makeup off, and really helped with my acne.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t really clearing my acne</li>
            <li> I just bought this from Whole Foods yesterday</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this soap to EVERYONE!</li>
            <li> Im very jealous to see how the soap works for the MAJORITY of you but</li>
            <li> Also, I really dislike the scrubby chunks in the soap..</li>
            <li> This time it has pieces of something to help exfoliate but it is very scratchy.</li>
            <li> purchased this product because I received a free sample of a similar product - http://www.amazon.com/Shea-Moisture-African-Black-Soap-8/dp/B005C2N8IC - from a sample website.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really heal my skin</li>
            <li> thanks to the school floor too)</li>
            <li> Lathers nicely, but the effect--itchy, inflamed eczema--was the same as using regular soap.</li>
            <li> It seemed like It was well roundly working effectively on my face.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, leaves your skin feeling tight and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had fear it would leave a different kind of &#x27;soap scum&#x27; on my shower, but have just made a point to clean the shower more often than I normally did to avoid this happening (captain obvious here?).</li>
            <li> I tried getting my skin back to it&#x27;s original self for weeks, but nothing I  tried worked.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair with it today and it left my hair so clean.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that any pimples I had would dry out very quickly, and the size of the pimple would be reduced.</li>
            <li> They work great as a regular soap, but they are nowhere near the black soaps made in Africa.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth, soft, and clean; not tight or dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap between 1-2 weeks, and it has worked very well for clearing up my mild facial acne.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, most products I use have no effect or limited effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get as many break outs or dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I honestly never though a soap would have such a great effect on my skin, I suffer from really oily skin, I&#x27;m a contemporary dancer wich means dance with my face touchig</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry like the other, but I also didn&#x27;t feel it cleaned as best as the other.</li>
            <li> Nothing more nothing less.</li>
            <li> I also use it to shower, and I notice that my feet which were dry are now so smooth.  </li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t get more or less acne.</li>
            <li> Using this soap has cleared my existing breakouts and is controlling my oily skin decently.</li>
            <li> I did not want to throw the soap away, so I decided to use it on my back and chest, where I also had mild acne.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth it for clear, soft skin.</li>
            <li> I had mild redness on my face after switching coasts several years ago.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out the body as much as the lemongrass soap does, but is also not as squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> It smells great and gets the job done without a bunch of unnecessary chemicals that I don&#x27;t want near our bodies...</li>
            <li> alredy, they said it looks cleaner, even and vibrant.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to most cleansing products; my face becomes a dry, itching mess quite easily.  </li>
            <li> The acne around my jawline, my forehead, heck my whole face was clear!</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The Nubian Heritage African Black Bar Soap is the most healing soap that one can use!</li>
            <li> It does leave your skin feeling squeaky clean, but hey, you can add lotion afterwards if your skin is dry like mine.  </li>
            <li> and I am seriously thinking about getting more!  </li>
            <li> took like 2 weeks to get here, dries my skin too much and any other soap soo, nothing special here  </li>
            <li> This seemed more like the standard soaps which lather a lot and make my skin taut, dry and stretchy!</li>
            <li> My face would literally make a squeaking sound when I would rub it, and I don&#x27;t remember experiencing this with other products.  </li>
            <li> However, I see that it was made in New York</li>
            <li> NEW UPDATE:  </li>
            <li> I can say that it last much longer &amp; holds its shape compared to real ABS.</li>
            <li> Smells good and last a month at least.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have acne and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very natural.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smells, but this does not bother me at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin very softly and brihteing&lt;</li>
            <li> :(  By the way- the tea tree soap smells the best!</li>
            <li> We also notice that our skin is soft and I have not had to use lotion!  </li>
            <li> This is actually the first review I&#x27;ve EVER done..</li>
            <li> It feels soooo soft!</li>
            <li> Anyway, I stopped using this black soap because of that and also because it started making my skin lightly itchy, as well as have</li>
            <li> If your hair becomes dry during particular periods of the year, try washing your hair with this bar rather than using hot oils or protein</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and this soap really does seem to help calm down the flare ups.  </li>
            <li> I used it for my face for about 2 months before getting authentic African black soap to try out.  </li>
            <li> This soap also smells much better than traditional black soap.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased a couple of varieties of this soap but, the African Black Soap is my favorite.</li>
            <li> The soap was always black, and I recall thinking that was interesting, and perhaps it was something specific for her skin type.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin and this gives the right balance without making it anything oily.</li>
            <li> African Black soap made my skin feel so smooth and gentle.</li>
            <li> Also I live in CA, and our winter is pretty dry here, but still... never happened before with a soap.  </li>
            <li> often so Its hard to keep my skin healthy</li>
            <li> Great for people with dirty or oil skin.</li>
            <li> I use it as a cleanser in the  hope of reducing acne outbreaks and to clear up blemishes.</li>
            <li> I also feel like it&#x27;s been helping to keep my face clear of acne.</li>
            <li> I almost forgot to put foundation on because my face was so clear and even.</li>
            <li> and it makes it so clear</li>
            <li> So 2 stars for not being complete liars.</li>
            <li> Your skin was soft once and will be again --</li>
            <li> I just rub it between my hands and apply the lather instead of applying the soap directly to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li> my skin is fairly sensitive it didn&#x27;t burn or cause discomfort.</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients did not irritate my skin( I even used it on my face</li>
            <li> My skin feel soft, I did not have to use a body lotion...</li>
            <li> It makes it so soft and clears acne without drying.</li>
            <li> This was the simple solution sitting under my nose the whole time</li>
            <li> AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;----I have sensitive skin/</li>
            <li> My skin is so clear and soft.</li>
            <li> old.</li>
            <li> It really makes my sweaty areas feel deep cleaned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started to develop bacne too, I&#x27;ve used this bar to smooth my back back out.</li>
            <li> Hydrates skin leaving it soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned &amp; acne and dark blemishes stand out HARSH!</li>
            <li> It clears away makeup and dirt, and leaves it feeling clean, and not too tight.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, it did make my skin feel dry</li>
            <li> Granted this isn&#x27;t exactly &#x27;black soap&#x27;, i still wanted to try and see if the American made black soaps were any good.</li>
            <li> Sometime later I arrived upon this particular product and my skin has never been clearer or softer since.</li>
            <li> No black residue....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and it will be the only product I use for my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> After trying all the highly advertised acne products that don&#x27;t work as they claim, we have finally found the solution.</li>
            <li> Not only have the pimples vanished, but it is very, very soft AND the redness is completely gone.</li>
            <li> Daily use has eliminated the breakouts, and made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and acne-prone skin, and this soap is the ONLY thing that has ever worked for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week now and notice how soft and moisturized my body and face feel!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to my old skincare routine after using this!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this is my first black soap.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that particular product is close to $9 a bar on Amazon -- so I went looking for an alternative and found this soap, which is even better than the Shea Moisture bar that I received for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be aware that the little bits of oat are quite scratchy and could irritate sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Maybe other african black soaps are better?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about something that&#x27;s been featured on Dr. Oz, but this soap is amazing.</li>
            <li> The areas that were already slightly dark became darker, which made my uneven skin tone even more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I showered all over with the soap last night and basically woke up to clear skin.</li>
            <li> When he was 2 yrs old, his eczema covered his legs, above underwear line, elbows, and forearms.</li>
            <li> The scent is barely there.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see my skin get any better or worse</li>
            <li> My teenage son started using it twice a day on his face and during his shower and his face and back are now clear of acne.</li>
            <li> This has been the only soap thus far that naturally heals my husband&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li> My husband has &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; skin, he gets terrible breakouts on his back and occasionally on his chest, but since he started using this stuff I have never seen his skin so clear and soft, and he&#x27;s so much more confident about walking around with his shirt off in the house.  </li>
            <li> Tried it for two days straight, and I literally had cystic acne all over my face as a result, which now has turned into dark scars.</li>
            <li> Using this has cleared up the dry and made my skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone that has sensitive skin or dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nubian Heritage-African Black Soap for almost 6 months straight.</li>
            <li> It caused my face to become quite dry and tight, and my skin tone became more uneven.</li>
            <li> Be careful if your skin is sensitive!</li>
            <li> I suffered from red/dry/itchy areas that would arise on the soft spots of my body (inside of my arms/legs, around my hip area where my pants rub, and worstly~horribly red, dry, flakey areas around my eyes.)  </li>
            <li> It has a subtle sweet smell.</li>
            <li> But then again, not everyone&#x27;s face is the same, but for someone like me who has oily, sensitive, and dry skin DO NOT USE THIS!</li>
            <li> You will have a  better time getting the real raw African black soap instead of the bar soap.</li>
            <li> This soap didn&#x27;t dry out my face at all, removed my make up and is generally improving my skin.</li>
            <li> i also shower  with this black soap and it doesnt dry my skin that much.</li>
            <li> ..feels like it will last a long time ..</li>
            <li> Long lasting bar.</li>
            <li> This soap helps control my acne without turning my face into a dry, red mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My facial skin is dry.</li>
            <li> This soap does wonders, especially for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now been 2-3 weeks of use with this soap and the only thing left are light, faint red areas down inside of my arms.  </li>
            <li> This soap helped to heal up some very dry patches on my skin and is overall healing for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have alot of areas that are very dry and flaky looking and breaking out with very tiny  bumps.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but this soap dried mine out.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Hard&amp;#34; bar ... lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> or if i only washed my face once the day before due to falling asleep before i could wash my face at night.  </li>
            <li> Also the ash clogged my skin, i got  bunch of breakouts on my face not to mention my face felt like glass after cleaning it with windex, extremely dry.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry or damage anything.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and the soap made my skin dryer.</li>
            <li> and it no longer feels dry after I use this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that moisturizing either, but I do have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> We use hydrocortisone only on occasional flares, but before soap we used it with cetaphil nearly everyday.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s NOT CLOSE to being as powerful as real raw black soap.</li>
            <li> It has helped to clear up the small dry bumps on the backs of my arms.</li>
            <li> The actual bar itself is large and thick, and it&#x27;s lasting me quite a long time, I would say at least 3 weeks by now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for the past 4 days and it has completely transformed my skin.</li>
            <li> If that doesnt work out for me too, then i am planning to give up on the idea of using black soap to get rid of my current skin issues.</li>
            <li> my skin is less red and not as peeling.</li>
            <li> Then arrived the African Black Soap hero.</li>
            <li> Bought this often for my boyfriend who uses black soap daily on his face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this soap for about two to two and a half</li>
            <li> I wanted to try different brands of black soap.</li>
            <li> This African Black Soap recipe Contains palm ash, plantain peel extract, tamarind extract and papaya</li>
            <li> , I already see a difference; less breakouts, smaller pores, healthier looking skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The African black soap&lt;br</li>
            <li> The breakouts that I do have (thanks to those stupid pms hormones [&gt;:(]are smaller and go away pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin was getting really dry - and when I added moisturizer it would just cause acne due to sensitivity.</li>
            <li> but I perhaps won&#x27;t buy again since I have similar experiences with other soaps for less.</li>
            <li> -- I don&#x27;t want dyes or heavy chemicals in anything I use but especially on my face.  </li>
            <li> I used it only a few times and decided not to use it.   </li>
            <li> I will also submit an individual review about the Coconut &amp; Papaya Soap after a few weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on soaps and creams to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry honey and spf worth every penny.</li>
            <li> And to put it bluntly my skin looks like ive aged up close.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like the other products I&#x27;ve used, but you should still put a moisturizer on!</li>
            <li> There are still a few pimples now and then, but no major breakouts.</li>
            <li> Last week (before I got this soap in the mail) my face was red, splotchy, and broken out on my forehead and chin for what seemed like no appearant reason because my skin is NOT normally like that.</li>
            <li> I have used black soap for the last few years.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;bits and pieces\\&quot; in the bar actually act as small exfoliaters.</li>
            <li> Other then that it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a raw African black soap user.</li>
            <li> I usually have blemishes, scars from previous blemishes on my face which keep coming back.</li>
            <li> My dark acne scars are fading and her acne has been clearing up.</li>
            <li> I think ill stick to the real stuff from now on.</li>
            <li> My boo has dark spots on his face that are already fading.</li>
            <li> I needed a soap that would nourish my skin and fade my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I need a soap the nourishes/moisturize my skin and fade dark spots and if you guys recommend a Nubian heritage soap that does just that please comment.</li>
            <li> I would actually recommend keeping it outside the shower OR cutting the bar into thirds and just keeping one third in the shower at a time.</li>
            <li> I still like to use this soap about once a week instead of everyday to have that deep clean.this is usually on days that i&#x27;m about to use a face mask</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll be trying Nubian Heritage&#x27;s other soaps!</li>
            <li> ((I&#x27;ve been trying out Olay 7 in 1 moisturizer, a little expensive, but used with african black soap I haven&#x27;t had any major breakouts.))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have any pimples I just have dark spots and scars from previous breakouts.</li>
            <li> The soap is black, rinses off black, and leaves black residue when setting it down.  </li>
            <li> But it is black.</li>
            <li> It feels cleaner and less moisturizing than this one, but that&#x27;s the one I&#x27;ll try...</li>
            <li> I saw reviews and ordered this soap and it has been less than two weeks</li>
            <li> And got ride of my black heads.</li>
            <li> And maybe try another brand of black soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;African black soap does what it says, cleanses, heals, evens out skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have seen a  with the intensity of his patches and he is less itchy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It does have a slight scent to it.</li>
            <li> This has helped fade my acne scars and my skin is also less oily.</li>
            <li> skin is less oily...</li>
            <li> whole forehead was covered in tiny pimples, my problem areas (jaw and cheeks) were so bad that even my makeup couldn&#x27;t cover the mess.</li>
            <li> I loooove the smell and the soap is not as drying or harsh as conventional soap.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t enjoy that. :(</li>
            <li> I only used the soap on my face and it did no good.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to fade some dark spots and have seen no visible changes after a few weeks use.</li>
            <li> My skin feels tight every time that I wash.</li>
            <li> my face was a mess alot of little spots and marks and reddness.</li>
            <li> My rating is based on the way my skin reacted: on my face, it caused my pimples to be deeper/bigger (clogged my pores), and the skin on my body ended up being a little ashy after almost a week.  </li>
            <li> So, while it is a little pricey (Amazon charges too much--go to Walmart)</li>
            <li> It can be a little drying, so</li>
            <li> Thank you African black soap for making my complexion worse.</li>
            <li> but it is a little harsh when i used it on my face.</li>
            <li> It helped exfoliate my skin and didn&#x27;t feel harsh to my skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> (I cannot stand heavily perfumed products).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing whatever I had been using was harsh against my skin</li>
            <li> I would use coconut oil afterwards to moisturize my face, but I still had the uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> (I also use a yogurt and turmeric mask everyday)</li>
            <li> have dried and marks have lightened..</li>
            <li> , I use it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I also struggle with heavy oil in t-zone area...</li>
            <li> After a few months of use, I had to change my review from 5 stars to 2 stars..</li>
            <li> The soap was really messy</li>
            <li> few notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very little black residue.</li>
            <li> However a recent move from the West Coast to the East freaked out my skin pretty badly!</li>
            <li> I wished for plain complexion and decided to order this product.</li>
            <li> I had just switched from a body wash containing SLS to this bar, so I&#x27;m not sure if my sensitive skin is just reacting weird.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite hard and lasts a long time, but try to let it dry out each time because it is a little expensive for a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> This is so fake, not real black soap.</li>
            <li> I will admit that my skin tone was slightly uneven before I used the soap, but I think it was made worse from using the soap, probably because my skin was too dry.</li>
            <li> The smell of the soap is certainly different compared to anything I&#x27;ve used before, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it BAD, just different.  </li>
            <li> I see some people complained of the black lather temporarily staining the counter or shower walls</li>
            <li> due to some hormonal imbalance or something i started breaking out like crazy last couple of month ,</li>
            <li> No real issues, not drying and does not make the acne worse.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was my skin drying out/soap residue/dead skin/or what??</li>
            <li> Not sure,</li>
            <li> In the past 3 days we&#x27;ve noticed that our skin looks almost like its glowing.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t purchase this any longer not sure what its suppose to do???</li>
            <li> but I still get small breakouts.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my face, wipe some witch hazel over, wait 5-10 minutes before applying my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> With the soap, there are small patches on foot, and knees that are not as itchy.</li>
            <li> Usually I have medium to severe acne.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t real raw black soap.</li>
            <li> I have had these weird deep pimples which are hard to see until they form on the skin as a whitehead</li>
            <li> The area around my eyes are not near as bad as it used to be, and the other areas on my body have improved as well.  </li>
            <li> When other soaps fail to treat your skin issues, Nubian Heritage does not -- Most people try this soap because of skin issues, including skin sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li> I like the soap because it does have a woodsy scent and is in a hard bar soap shape.  </li>
            <li> This soap helped clear up a bad back-ne breakout.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been dealing with a lot of peeling on my face</li>
            <li> I think i&#x27;ve had it one year, at least, and use it every day.  </li>
            <li> But I get tired of cutting it into bars, and its so soft it breaks.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this to individuals of all races that want a quality organic face cleanser without the crazy price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that my post acne marks are diminishing--painfully slow, but still diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is thick and oily and I have acne to some extent for 20+ years.</li>
            <li> After numerous expensive facewashes, moisterizers, etc, nothing has helped areas around my eyes the way this soap has!</li>
            <li> I look ridiculous smelling my bar of soap</li>
            <li> soap seriously works.  </li>
            <li> Not like this though, it was so bad my face actually hurt to move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too severe, but it was annoying, and I realized I need to just go back to a non-oil and non-comedogenic one for my face at least.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out quite as bad but still takes care of the acne all together</li>
            <li> no more spending hundreds on stupid proactiv or other products that just dont work.</li>
            <li> It was too irritating to use twice a day</li>
            <li> This soap was irritating and made my skin burn.</li>
            <li> but this  brand was irritating to me.</li>
            <li> Im addicted to this soap, problem with amazon is the outrageus price variations from time to time for this product.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The frequency with which I use this product has decreased because my skin started to get too oily.</li>
            <li> the black residue wasn&#x27;t bad at all either.</li>
            <li> However after a week of use my skin had broken out in a manner I had not experienced for decades!</li>
            <li> This bar sucks up all the moisture out of my body ...which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing.</li>
            <li> this ashy soap is completely useless</li>
            <li> it helped with the random eczema scaring I had on my face from another soap that caused irritation.</li>
            <li> Then applying lots of moisturizer to keep my skin hydrated to the point the acne comes back, it&#x27;s an awful cycle.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m loving it thus far !</li>
            <li> Well its just a bad smelling soap. Nothing more nothing less. And god forbid you use a white wash cloth to apply the soap. I will never buy again. But it is black. So 2 stars for not being complete liars. LOL</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing.  I give it five stars for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) First, the smell -- If strong scents easily overwhelm you, this bar is one to try. It has a subtle sweet smell. I look ridiculous smelling my bar of soap but it just smells delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) When other soaps fail to treat your skin issues, Nubian Heritage does not -- Most people try this soap because of skin issues, including skin sensitivity issues.  I am very sensitive to most cleansing products; my face becomes a dry, itching mess quite easily.  I also still contend with pimples.  This soap helps control my acne without turning my face into a dry, red mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Your skin was soft once and will be again -- This soap has phenomenal moisturizing properties.  It feels great on your skin.  I don&#x27;t have to apply baby oil or moisturizing body lotion because this soap does it all.  If your hair becomes dry during particular periods of the year, try washing your hair with this bar rather than using hot oils or protein soaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Ingredients you can pronounce -- I don&#x27;t want dyes or heavy chemicals in anything I use but especially on my face.  This soap has a straightforward ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is vegan in nature with no animal based products.  It is not tested on animals and is made in the United States.</li>
            <li> Product beautiful and good and useful like this kind of soap because he is very healthy and natural  I advise everyone to use and purchase only from the Amazon</li>
            <li> After having a touch of eczema problems over the years, I searched for this soap after hearing about it from a friend. I suffered from red/dry/itchy areas that would arise on the soft spots of my body (inside of my arms/legs, around my hip area where my pants rub, and worstly~horribly red, dry, flakey areas around my eyes.)  Not even a week after using this soap I saw noticable improvements.  The area around my eyes are not near as bad as it used to be, and the other areas on my body have improved as well.  It&#x27;s now been 2-3 weeks of use with this soap and the only thing left are light, faint red areas down inside of my arms.  After numerous expensive facewashes, moisterizers, etc, nothing has helped areas around my eyes the way this soap has! It has also seemed to help with acne/complexion as well.  The soap is black, rinses off black, and leaves black residue when setting it down.  I&#x27;ve had fear it would leave a different kind of &#x27;soap scum&#x27; on my shower, but have just made a point to clean the shower more often than I normally did to avoid this happening (captain obvious here?). The smell of the soap is certainly different compared to anything I&#x27;ve used before, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it BAD, just different.  After using it I&#x27;ve actually become used to the smell and kind of like it now.  Overall, I love this product!</li>
            <li> I have used black soap for the last few years.  I&#x27;m 52 and this soap is wonderful for aging skin.  We all know that skin at that middle age becomes somewhat \\&quot;weird\\&quot;.  This soap is great for the dryness, acne....whatever.</li>
            <li> I ordered this black soap with the expectations of it really being great for my skin and it didn&#x27;t disappoint me. It helped exfoliate my skin and didn&#x27;t feel harsh to my skin afterwards. The soap&#x27;s scent is also very refreshing it has a sorta fruity aroma. Beware though that the soap does leave stains when it dries on surfaces like when it&#x27;s drying after using it but don&#x27;t worry it will wash away with just some water. I just store mine is a soap container. Great product though.</li>
            <li> Soap came smashed. thanks.</li>
            <li> Recently i came across many good reviews about african black soap and decided to give it a try. I usually have blemishes, scars from previous blemishes on my face which keep coming back. My facial skin is dry. I wished for plain complexion and decided to order this product. This seemed more like the standard soaps which lather a lot and make my skin taut, dry and stretchy! I used it only a few times and decided not to use it.   You are really lucky if this worked for you, but it didnt work for me! Next I am going to try black soap from coastal scents website as i have heard great reviews about that too. If that doesnt work out for me too, then i am planning to give up on the idea of using black soap to get rid of my current skin issues.</li>
            <li> This soap helped to heal up some very dry patches on my skin and is overall healing for my skin. It has very light, pleasant scent. (I cannot stand heavily perfumed products). I&#x27;m really glad I discovered this soap and was persuaded by the good reviews to buy it. The look, smell, feel of it, and packaging is different and appealing. It would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li> After experiencing the hell of teenage acne years ago I&#x27;m fortunate now to have very nice skin. I do get an occasional zit but overall it&#x27;s usually pretty good. However a recent move from the West Coast to the East freaked out my skin pretty badly! This soap has been awesome to help fix that. My skin was getting really dry - and when I added moisturizer it would just cause acne due to sensitivity. Using this has cleared up the dry and made my skin incredibly soft. The smell is divine - I bought extra bars for my shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black soap is wonderful and this version of it top notch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update April 2012: I wanted to say that my teen daughter is using this as a face soap. She has acne (mildly severe)and it is working very well. No real issues, not drying and does not make the acne worse. In fact the opposite - seems to be helping!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this is my first black soap. My rating is based on the way my skin reacted: on my face, it caused my pimples to be deeper/bigger (clogged my pores), and the skin on my body ended up being a little ashy after almost a week.  My first impressions were that I loved how smooth and moisturizing it felt. The oat also gives it a nice super light exfoliating texture.  What I didn&#x27;t like right away was the scent. I&#x27;m very picky with scents, so maybe most people would enjoy it. But I didn&#x27;t like it much at all.  Halfway through my test run for a week, I started realizing that my skin sort of had a white ashy look to it... on my hands and spots on my legs/arms, etc. Not sure if it was my skin drying out/soap residue/dead skin/or what?? But my sodium-laureth-sulfate body liquid soaps or even Dove/Oil of Olay never did this to me. I had just switched from a body wash containing SLS to this bar, so I&#x27;m not sure if my sensitive skin is just reacting weird. Also I live in CA, and our winter is pretty dry here, but still... never happened before with a soap.  As for my face... it does make your face feel really smooth and clean at the same time! However, this may be the case with any oil-based cleanser... it blocks your pores!! When my pimple time came around, my pimples were larger (sort of like mosquito-bite type ones vs. the ones you can pop easily! Haha, don&#x27;t lie, you know you love popping your pimples :P)... they were just these sorta reddish painful bumps. Didn&#x27;t enjoy that. :( It wasn&#x27;t too severe, but it was annoying, and I realized I need to just go back to a non-oil and non-comedogenic one for my face at least.  Anyway, I stopped using this black soap because of that and also because it started making my skin lightly itchy, as well as have that light ashy-skin thing. Maybe the moisture was too much? Not sure, but I&#x27;ll be trying Nubian Heritage&#x27;s other soaps! Sadly, as much as I loved the feel and texture while washing... my skin and nose say no.:(  By the way- the tea tree soap smells the best! It feels cleaner and less moisturizing than this one, but that&#x27;s the one I&#x27;ll try... after the coconut one!</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful bar of soap..very thick and rich ...smells lovely..I like the extra oils that this bar of soap has added..feels like it will last a long time ..very fine milled...</li>
            <li> Smells perfect! Good for face and body! Be careful if your skin is sensitive!</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for me and my sister to combat our skin issues. She breaks out in acne and I have acne scars that I want to get rid off.  We both notice a significant difference in our skin after the first week of use! My dark acne scars are fading and her acne has been clearing up. I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments on how clean and clear my skin looks. It goes on very smooth and feels moisturizing. It does leave your skin feeling squeaky clean, but hey, you can add lotion afterwards if your skin is dry like mine.  I also use it to shower, and I notice that my feet which were dry are now so smooth.  The more you use it, it does become grainy from the ingredients that are in it, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt you at all.  I washed my hair with it today and it left my hair so clean.  I highly recommend this product and it will be the only product I use for my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Will buy more. Very gentle but effective at cleaning. Even use it to wash face.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to people with any skin type.  This gets you squeaky clean but it&#x27;s not drying like regular soaps.  I&#x27;ve struggled with acne and used all kinds of OTC and Rx medications and none ever really worked.  This is truly clearing my skin up and I&#x27;m so happy about it.</li>
            <li> Believe or not, this soap did no wonder on me. Even though the reviews were pretty good, I still gave it a shot and oh my god, I WAS WRONG!I started to get MORE acne on places on my face that I never got before and it was painful. I thought it was from something else the whole time. So i stopped using the soap for a bit, and noticed my face was getting A LOT better. Eventually found out that it was the soap that did this to me. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AT ALL. But then again, not everyone&#x27;s face is the same, but for someone like me who has oily, sensitive, and dry skin DO NOT USE THIS!</li>
            <li> I Love this soap! I use it as a cleanser in the  hope of reducing acne outbreaks and to clear up blemishes. So far so good. I haven&#x27;t had a break out since (knock on wood) and my sister says that my skin looks clearer.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered very quickly.  My skin has has no adverse reactions from this soap.  Time will tell, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li> I had been using a variety of Clean and Clear cleansers to manage my oily skin and control breakouts. These were drying out my skin even though i reduced washing my face to only once daily and i still had breakouts. Using this soap has cleared my existing breakouts and is controlling my oily skin decently. Love that it is natural without the chemicals in many of the cleansers out there. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> really good soup - I use it everyday which is probably too much but I still love it and it&#x27;s cleared up my face</li>
            <li> This is the best soap for keeping acne and breakouts away!  And one bar lasts months!</li>
            <li> I like the soap because it does have a woodsy scent and is in a hard bar soap shape.  However, I see that it was made in New York so I am not so sure it is really the authentic African Black Soap--next time I will try the 1 lb. brick of soap made in Ghana.    NEW UPDATE:  I had to amend my review from three stars to five because after using it up--both my husband and I love it and I am buying more!  I have never had soap that takes makeup off sooo well--even waterproof mascara.  It does not sting!  We also notice that our skin is soft and I have not had to use lotion!  I really, really like this soap.  I notice that the name is different now, so I hope the soap has not changed in anyway.</li>
            <li> I use this soap on my face every day and night.  It makes my face feel really smooth and I get so many compliments on how smooth my skin looks.</li>
            <li> LOOOOOVE this soap!  I used it for my face for about 2 months before getting authentic African black soap to try out.  It works quite well and leaves my skin super soft.  It was too irritating to use twice a day and I did have to apply a good bit of moisturizer afterwards.  I am using the rest of it on my body now and I am seriously thinking about getting more!  Just be aware that the little bits of oat are quite scratchy and could irritate sensitive skin.  I just rub it between my hands and apply the lather instead of applying the soap directly to my skin.  This solves that issue perfectly :)  This soap also smells much better than traditional black soap.  Again, great product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 3 weeks now. It has helped to clear up the small dry bumps on the backs of my arms. I also feel like it&#x27;s been helping to keep my face clear of acne. I&#x27;d prefer if it had more of a scent, but I have a feeling that adding scent would only lead to clogging my pores and reverse all of the effects that I love.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this soap by a friend. I have sensitive combination skin. Lately I&#x27;ve been dealing with a lot of peeling on my face and I had no idea why. Talking about frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally, overnight (with just one use) my skin is less red and not as peeling. I&#x27;m guessing whatever I had been using was harsh against my skin but yeah... never again will I use any products with chemicals like that on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing and awesome and I recommend it if you&#x27;ve had problem skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is so awesome. I just used it my skin feels so soft and smooth. I notoriously forget to apply lotion after I shower because once I shower oh its bed time! My legs feel so smooth and there is a light fragrance on my skin. I did use it on my face my face my skin is fairly sensitive it didn&#x27;t burn or cause discomfort. I&#x27;m not expecting it to get rid of my acne but it was nice to just try a different soap plus its natural. I did receive my soap promptly and in good condition. The price is probably about $2 cheaper and the size is bigger than I can get locally in store. It&#x27;s like 4.98 for a bar that looks like hotel soap lol.</li>
            <li> took like 2 weeks to get here, dries my skin too much and any other soap soo, nothing special here  P.S this thing is made out of an ash that is quite frankly, filthy. it turns your hands and sponge completely black very disgusting. Also the ash clogged my skin, i got  bunch of breakouts on my face not to mention my face felt like glass after cleaning it with windex, extremely dry. this ashy soap is completely useless</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap between 1-2 weeks, and it has worked very well for clearing up my mild facial acne. It also helped with my facial oiliness. This soap did an excellent job with cleaning my face.  My face would literally make a squeaking sound when I would rub it, and I don&#x27;t remember experiencing this with other products.  I noticed that any pimples I had would dry out very quickly, and the size of the pimple would be reduced. This happened within a day or two. However, I think this soap was too strong for my face. It caused my face to become quite dry and tight, and my skin tone became more uneven. I will admit that my skin tone was slightly uneven before I used the soap, but I think it was made worse from using the soap, probably because my skin was too dry. The areas that were already slightly dark became darker, which made my uneven skin tone even more noticeable. I would use coconut oil afterwards to moisturize my face, but I still had the uneven skin tone. I did not want to throw the soap away, so I decided to use it on my back and chest, where I also had mild acne. It was great at clearing up my acne in these areas as well, and I did not experience dryness, tightness and uneven skin tone in these areas. I decided to keep the soap to use just for my back and chest. The soap also smells nice, and it does not have an overwhelming smell.ut &amp; Papaya Soap on my face if it clears my acne as well. I will also submit an individual review about the Coconut &amp; Papaya Soap after a few weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap three days ago and I already feel a difference in my skin. My skin feels soft, smooth and moisturized. The natural ingredients did not irritate my skin( I even used it on my face and I have extremely sensitive skin) and left a light, pleasant smell. I don&#x27;t know how this will work in the long run but so far, so good!</li>
            <li> Last week (before I got this soap in the mail) my face was red, splotchy, and broken out on my forehead and chin for what seemed like no appearant reason because my skin is NOT normally like that. I tried getting my skin back to it&#x27;s original self for weeks, but nothing I  tried worked. Then arrived the African Black Soap hero. I&#x27;ve used this soap for the past 4 days and it has completely transformed my skin. Not only have the pimples vanished, but it is very, very soft AND the redness is completely gone. I almost forgot to put foundation on because my face was so clear and even. I&#x27;m buying another bar right after I finish writing this review. Heck, I might buy two. I NEVER want to be without this stuff.</li>
            <li> I found this through an article on XOJane and decided to get some for my husband because of the low price.  My husband has &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; skin, he gets terrible breakouts on his back and occasionally on his chest, but since he started using this stuff I have never seen his skin so clear and soft, and he&#x27;s so much more confident about walking around with his shirt off in the house.  I also use it on my face and my skin feels marvelous as well (his skin is oily, mine dry) I don&#x27;t know what magic they put in here, but whatever it is, it works wonders.</li>
            <li> Best soap I have ever used.  I have psoriasis and this soap really does seem to help calm down the flare ups.  In addition, it&#x27;s creamy, lathers really good and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. However, when I placed my order, I was supposed to be getting 2 bars of soap for $4.80, not just one.  I can easily obtain this soap for $2.49-$2.99.  So now I&#x27;m stuck having paid $2 more per bar.  I don&#x27;t like bait and switches!</li>
            <li> My face is smooth, soft, and clean; not tight or dry. I use coconut oil afterward and these two are doing a great job!</li>
            <li> Works very good for my granddaughters skin.</li>
            <li> i like the smell and the clean feeling but it is a little harsh when i used it on my face. i wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this is a daily face wash. i&#x27;ll stick with aveeno for that. the black residue wasn&#x27;t bad at all either.</li>
            <li> This soap foams up a lot and you can really feel it cleaning. The smell is very sweet and it lasts throughout the day. My skin feel soft, I did not have to use a body lotion...</li>
            <li> I bought this soap at Whole Foods and just now reordered it here on Amazon.  This bar lasts forever!  I think i&#x27;ve had it one year, at least, and use it every day.  It is kind of scrawny now, though, and the smell has gone, but it&#x27;s almost done.  It makes my skin feel squeaky clean and it has a nice, unique fragrance.  What a unique soap!</li>
            <li> This soap is great for acne, blemishes, and dry skin. My problem areas are my back, and chest(frequent breakouts. Daily use has eliminated the breakouts, and made my skin very soft. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my post acne marks are diminishing--painfully slow, but still diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the lather, it&#x27;s rich and creamy and I would almost swear I&#x27;m using a body wash. I see some people complained of the black lather temporarily staining the counter or shower walls but I didn&#x27;t have that issue. The \\&quot;bits and pieces\\&quot; in the bar actually act as small exfoliaters. The actual bar itself is large and thick, and it&#x27;s lasting me quite a long time, I would say at least 3 weeks by now. So, while it is a little pricey (Amazon charges too much--go to Walmart), it&#x27;s worth it for clear, soft skin.</li>
            <li> Love it, smells great, smooth, &amp; just everything good. He-he (^_^) Definitely helps with acne, plus it&#x27;s the best ever.....well to me it is.</li>
            <li> Bought this often for my boyfriend who uses black soap daily on his face. He seems to like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Awesome soap! The reviews are true! It has made a huge difference in the complexion on my daughter&#x27;s face! It helps acne to go away faster and keeps it from scaring. Excellent!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and acne-prone skin, and this soap is the ONLY thing that has ever worked for me.  I have spent hundreds of dollars on soaps and creams to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap seriously works.  It is also great if you are breastfeeding a baby with super sensitive skin as perfumes in adult soaps can irritate a baby&#x27;s skin, but this does not.</li>
            <li> This soap has been amazing for my 3 year olds eczema and my 13 year olds skin.</li>
            <li> soap lathers real well and I like the smell</li>
            <li> This is actually the first review I&#x27;ve EVER done.. But I had to! This soap is amazing. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week now and notice how soft and moisturized my body and face feel! I notice acne scars on my face are lightning up as well (I also use a yogurt and turmeric mask everyday) so that is contributing to it too. This soap lathers so nicely and it&#x27;s so creamy!!!! I use it as shaving cream too, and my skin has never felt so smooth after a shave. I definitely recommend this product and will  be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and its the best cleanser I&#x27;ve used! It gets all my makeup off, and really helped with my acne. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave it red for the rest of the day. Plus, it lasts FOREVER. Ive had it for almost 6 months, and I&#x27;ve only used a third of the bar.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I  have even used this on my face. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this product, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I been using this soap for about 6 weeks now. It isn&#x27;t really clearing my acne but I still like it though. I have oily skin and it helps with the oiliness so that good for me.</li>
            <li> it is the best thing ive come across this year. due to some hormonal imbalance or something i started breaking out like crazy last couple of month , and i have thois habit of squeezing my pimples( i know its very wrong but i just cant help it) so in addition to existing pimples i had marks  left behing and scratches from squeezng pimples in short my face was a mess alot of little spots and marks and reddness. I saw reviews and ordered this soap and it has been less than two weeks and my skin has cleared alot and pimples have dried and marks have lightened.. i used it in conjunction with blackseed facial cream which i also ordered from amazon. so far this combo has worked for me and my skin has become soooo much better. i also shower  with this black soap and it doesnt dry my skin that much.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this product. I love how it smells and he loves how it makes his skin  feels and look. It&#x27;s great for people with problem skin. It cleans out all the impurities. Love it!</li>
            <li> This soap helped clear up a bad back-ne breakout. For that alone it should get five stars. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but this soap dried mine out. I don&#x27;t think you can use it every day, I use it a few times a week. It smells nice, and leaves skin feeling great when used in moderation.</li>
            <li> Jury is still out on this. I&#x27;m a raw African black soap user. But I get tired of cutting it into bars, and its so soft it breaks. I thought id give this a try. I can say that it last much longer &amp; holds its shape compared to real ABS. With that said, I don&#x27;t think this stuff is actually &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; or raw/organic.  It doesn&#x27;t exfoliate like ABS, or work well on acne/bumps. I think ill stick to the real stuff from now on. This is much more of a commercial soap like Dove or something.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My skin has never looked better. It makes it so soft and clears acne without drying.</li>
            <li> ive tried so many things including aztec clay masks, proactive, washes, rinses, and prescription drugs under the care of a dermatologist. my skin does not look perfect right now but it is much clearer than it has been in months. definitely will reorder when it is time.</li>
            <li> Loved this soap cleared my face up.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I both use this. We are both brown skinned. In the past 3 days we&#x27;ve noticed that our skin looks almost like its glowing. My boo has dark spots on his face that are already fading. This soap does break down kind of quickly, so I suggest you don&#x27;t leave it laying around in the shower. Enjoy and stock up. Buying three more after I write this review.</li>
            <li> Nothing Special. Not for severe acne anyway. If your acne is hormonal I recommend trying something else! Rated 3 stars because price is great, and I didn&#x27;t have any irritation while using this product. Just didn&#x27;t do the job for me.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this soap! I&#x27;ll never go back to my old skincare routine after using this! I wish I would have known about this product years ago. It would&#x27;ve saved me hundreds.</li>
            <li> The Nubian Heritage African Black Bar Soap is the most healing soap that one can use! I use it as a facial soap, but have been known to use it on areas where I have had bug bites, scrapes, scratches, etc. The soap seems to accelerate the healing process!</li>
            <li> A lot of people said they didn&#x27;t like the smell but this soap smells amazing, I haven&#x27;t actually used it yet but I&#x27;ve heard really great things about it. Cruelty free and all natural and organic ingredients! Equivalent to a regular bar of like dial or dove soap.</li>
            <li> This product I brought and did not see any changes with my face I won&#x27;t purchase this any longer not sure what its suppose to do???</li>
            <li> Took away acne but didn&#x27;t  take away acne scars</li>
            <li> This soap is great for acne. My teenage son started using it twice a day on his face and during his shower and his face and back are now clear of acne. After trying all the highly advertised acne products that don&#x27;t work as they claim, we have finally found the solution. Thanks for a great product!!!</li>
            <li> I just bought this from Whole Foods yesterday but I just had to leave a comment because of how much I love this soap. I am 20 and have struggled with acne since I was 13. I took accutane which cleared most of it but I still get small breakouts. I have had these weird deep pimples which are hard to see until they form on the skin as a whitehead but they leave scarring because of how deep they are. I showered all over with the soap last night and basically woke up to clear skin. Itll probably take 2 more days to completely clear but it looked like 80 percent better already! I could cry I am so so thankful for finding this soap! and its freakin 4 dollars at whole foods! no more spending hundreds on stupid proactiv or other products that just dont work. This was the simple solution sitting under my nose the whole time</li>
            <li> Nubian Heritage makes some great body soaps. I have yet to find one that didn&#x27;t smell great and leave my skin feeling great. The variety pack was the best!</li>
            <li> I really love this soap, this glow i get from this soap is great... i have ligth skin an as a african women with ageing skin that get acne scar from time to time i need help . This mom is 39 this year and i look 34 and i have three grown kids and a six year old , and proud.. i do have very oily skin black soap and aztec clay works so great and also st. Ives . You will not be sorry honey and spf worth every penny. Enjoy the skin your in .</li>
            <li> I have acne and very sensitive skin. This soap did nothing but made my skin itch. I only used the soap on my face and it did no good. You will have a  better time getting the real raw African black soap instead of the bar soap.</li>
            <li> Great scent. &amp;#34;Hard&amp;#34; bar ... lasts a long time. Very little black residue.</li>
            <li> Superior quality, authentic African soap (I&#x27;m West African) super gentle and kind of drying in an OMG-my-skin-feels-really-clean kind of way. I like this soap, I really feel clean after I use it. I also use Dudu Osun (fantastic quality, use both brands interchangeably), the consistency of the soaps are awesome from both brands. Impressed with another quality product by Nubian Heritage.</li>
            <li> GOOD, A BIT ROUGH FOR MY SKIN</li>
            <li> The package arrived damaged, and the soap was out of the box, but it didn&#x27;t affect the quality of the product.  I love the soap!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this at the recommendation of a friend for my son&#x27;s eczema which had flared up badly this winter.  This soap is gentle, smells great and has brought relief to his eczema.</li>
            <li> I had mild redness on my face after switching coasts several years ago. After trying various soaps without results, I had given up. Sometime later I arrived upon this particular product and my skin has never been clearer or softer since. My smooth hands now deliver a delicate and pillowy caress - one with which I love the world. I&#x27;d imagine the same results aren&#x27;t uniform across the board, but at 5 dollars a pop it&#x27;s at least worth a try. To anyone that has skin issues, I&#x27;d say give it a shot. I&#x27;ll never use another soap.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this bar! It smells amazing, and is really soothing. When using this bar, my skin problems are virtually non-existent... I can&#x27;t get enough of this bar! And, after using this bar for the first time, I&#x27;ve moved on to experimenting with other Nubian Heritage soaps. :3</li>
            <li> Bought this at a local health food store after sales woman put it in my hand and said that it worked. Lathers nicely, but the effect--itchy, inflamed eczema--was the same as using regular soap.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to fade some dark spots and have seen no visible changes after a few weeks use.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with the african black soap each morning and loved the way it makes my face so smooth afterwards.  I literally stroke my face to feel the softness.  Ladies remember moisterize moisterize!</li>
            <li> Nothing exciting about this soap. No scent, no noticeable benefit, just another soap.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because like many others, I wanted a natural product that was cheap and would help me with my black scaring and acne. I have mild acne. When I started using this soap it was awesome. LOVE the smell. It&#x27;s like perfume type of smell.  My face seemed more radiant and  even toned. it helped with the random eczema scaring I had on my face from another soap that caused irritation. And got ride of my black heads. It seemed like It was well roundly working effectively on my face. I&#x27;ve only used this soap for about two to two and a half weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I started to notice within the second week that every time I washed my face it would burn and itch .  I wanted to act like it was all in my head because it at first was working.  I dont understand how it once worked so well but now is turning against me!now my pores are worse.up close my skin looks terrible. I have alot of areas that are very dry and flaky looking and breaking out with very tiny  bumps. My skin feels tight every time that I wash. And to put it bluntly my skin looks like ive aged up close. Mind you I don&#x27;t have terrible skin. I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone that has sensitive skin or dry skin. If it burns DON&#x27;T USE IT ANYMORE. I will probably just use this on my body and see how it works. And maybe try another brand of black soap.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t finish mine. I am excited to try this.</li>
            <li> Didnt help my skin. Seemed to irritate it.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome.  It is a great daily cleanser for your body &amp; face to help keep the break outs away.  It can be a little drying, so once a day is plenty.  Plus it smells like bubble gum :)</li>
            <li> This works wonders for my skin and it makes it so clear I&#x27;m definitely repurchasing</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel and look clean</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly. Smelled great and delicious. Feels moisturizing and cleansing on my skin. Gives a nice rich lather on my washcloth. I smell great and I&#x27;m hoping this product will help with my body acne too! Will def be buying again.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for me. It didn&#x27;t dry or damage anything. So I guess it is a good natural soap.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try different brands of black soap. Granted this isn&#x27;t exactly &#x27;black soap&#x27;, i still wanted to try and see if the American made black soaps were any good. Well, they&#x27;re okay. They work great as a regular soap, but they are nowhere near the black soaps made in Africa. I didn&#x27;t see my skin get any better or worse, I didn&#x27;t get more or less acne. I have tried this on my face, body, and hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for hair, it strips away moisture and makes it frizzy. For the face, if you don&#x27;t have any major acne issues, it&#x27;s great. It clears away makeup and dirt, and leaves it feeling clean, and not too tight. For the body, it lathers great, (it lathers grey, interesting to see). This soap also has large exfoliating piece which is a plus. It doesn&#x27;t dry out the body as much as the lemongrass soap does, but is also not as squeaky clean. This soap smells like liquorish candy, which is pleasant, it&#x27;s not sickly sweet, just a light scent. I like how this soap is 100% natural and organic, so it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li> this is actually better than the version I used to buy at walmart hats more expensive- it has the same stuff just a liiiiittle bit different- doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out quite as bad but still takes care of the acne all together</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin is very happy with this product.  I use it to wash my face every day.</li>
            <li> This soap is the TRUTH! Cleans skin, smooths skin, has a nice nice fragrance. Very natural. Long lasting bar. Cleans all that dirt off your skin, leave body feeling clean and smooth. Great for people with dirty or oil skin.</li>
            <li> This soap was irritating and made my skin burn. Do not know if it is the manufacturer or the soap itself. Maybe other african black soaps are better? but this  brand was irritating to me.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and makes my skin feel baby smooth! It also works well for blemishes. This product is highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Smell nice and fresh.it work into a lather to cleanse skin.This African Black Soap recipe Contains palm ash, plantain peel extract, tamarind extract and papaya enzymes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap about six months ago. I have purchased a couple of varieties of this soap but, the African Black Soap is my favorite. I use it on my face and it has cleared the blackheads that have been there for years. Leaves your body feeling silky smooth. I suffer from dry skin and this gives the right balance without making it anything oily. Would highly recommend this soap to EVERYONE! Worth the money.</li>
            <li> This soap does wonders, especially for people with dry skin. This has been the only soap thus far that naturally heals my husband&#x27;s dry skin. I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Compared to other acne fighting cleansers, this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used. Even for a soap bar, it&#x27;s AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;----I have sensitive skin/acne----&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything (I know everyone says that, but I&#x27;ve finally found the one that works for me!) from salicylic acid to benzoyl peroxide cleansers/creams, sulfur masks or prescribed medications. Some products getting rid of acne and some doing nothing at all, but they ALL end up drying out my skin to the point it hurts. Then applying lots of moisturizer to keep my skin hydrated to the point the acne comes back, it&#x27;s an awful cycle.&lt;br /&gt;African black soap does what it says, cleanses, heals, evens out skin tone. I bought this soap 1.5 weeks ago, I already see a difference; less breakouts, smaller pores, healthier looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like the other products I&#x27;ve used, but you should still put a moisturizer on! I usually wash my face, wipe some witch hazel over, wait 5-10 minutes before applying my moisturizer. ((I&#x27;ve been trying out Olay 7 in 1 moisturizer, a little expensive, but used with african black soap I haven&#x27;t had any major breakouts.))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every product isn&#x27;t for you, sometimes it takes awhile before you find something that works. It&#x27;s taken me over a year to find this, so don&#x27;t give up!</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for 4 days and it has pulled all the gunk out of my pores. This soap didn&#x27;t dry out my face at all, removed my make up and is generally improving my skin. Just know, there are blemishes that you can not always see and it does pull them to the surface. That being said, it also makes them fade quickly and heal.As with most clarifying treatments skin goes through the  &amp;#34;worse before it gets better.&amp;#34;I highly recomend this product I will be stocking up on my next shop.</li>
            <li> Clears my acne. There are still a few pimples now and then, but no major breakouts. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having bad breakouts lately! Being a mommy, wife  college student...my face looked so bad! I&#x27;m fair skinned &amp; acne and dark blemishes stand out HARSH! I bought this soap at my local beauty supply and today is day 2 and my face is so bright! The acne around my jawline, my forehead, heck my whole face was clear! It feels soooo soft! I also struggle with heavy oil in t-zone area...let me tell ya, after last nights outing with makeup..i HAD NO OIL ANYWHERE! I finally have hope again! I will never use another soap again! Its cheap, it smells wonderful and its made with natural ingredients! I highly recommend</li>
            <li> African Black soap made my skin feel so smooth and gentle. The African black soap&lt;br /&gt;really moisturized my skin and cleared up my acne. I would recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;to anyone suffering from acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about something that&#x27;s been featured on Dr. Oz, but this soap is amazing. It&#x27;s already started balancing my skin and actually works great for my combination/breakout-prone face, as well as the rest of me. Scent isn&#x27;t anything amazing but it&#x27;s nice and light.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I&#x27;ve found so far. No gross chemicals (or gross chemical smells). Feels nice on your skin, smells very nice. It&#x27;s quite hard and lasts a long time, but try to let it dry out each time because it is a little expensive for a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Good deal for a great product.  This soap works wonders!  You need to try this soap as soon as possible!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It does just what it says. My skin is so clear and soft. I don&#x27;t get as many break outs or dark spots.  I get compliments all the time. My family has start to use it. I just love this soap!</li>
            <li> Great, seems to be clearing my skin.</li>
            <li> Im addicted to this soap, problem with amazon is the outrageus price variations from time to time for this product.</li>
            <li> Im very sad to say that the soap didn&#x27;t work for me , I don&#x27;t have any pimples I just have dark spots and scars from previous breakouts. I have dry skin and the soap made my skin dryer. I needed a soap that would nourish my skin and fade my dark spots. Im very jealous to see how the soap works for the MAJORITY of you but not me ):. I need a soap the nourishes/moisturize my skin and fade dark spots and if you guys recommend a Nubian heritage soap that does just that please comment. Other then that it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> This product is a wonderful addition to my son&#x27;s routine for eczema. I have seen a  with the intensity of his patches and he is less itchy. I like that I see results with a natural soap, and for him, it is a just as effective as OTC hydrocortisone cream. One thing, he is 10 years old, and his eczema is not as challenging as it was when he was 2 yrs. old. In fact, his eczema went from slightly below severe to slightly below moderate before soap, and now with the soap it is mild. When he was 2 yrs old, his eczema covered his legs, above underwear line, elbows, and forearms. With the soap, there are small patches on foot, and knees that are not as itchy. We use hydrocortisone only on occasional flares, but before soap we used it with cetaphil nearly everyday.  also, after the first time using it, we saw improvements. As an aside, the scent is a mild fruity coconut.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I really like this soap! It smells great and gets the job done without a bunch of unnecessary chemicals that I don&#x27;t want near our bodies... I will continue to order this. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update---&gt; After a few months of use, I had to change my review from 5 stars to 2 stars.. At first we really like the soap.. BUT after repeated use, my daughter and I BOTH realized that out skin was feeling dryer and dryer.. Also, I really dislike the scrubby chunks in the soap.. for these reasons, we have decided not to continue to use this brand.</li>
            <li> I had tried the raw soap originally and really loved it though I found it a bit drying. This one didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry like the other, but I also didn&#x27;t feel it cleaned as best as the other. Good though.</li>
            <li> Zwoop! This bar sucks up all the moisture out of my body ...which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing. I don&#x27;t use it all over though; just the sweatiest places. My EO body wash restores the moisture and they work well together. The granules of whatever that is in the bar don&#x27;t hurt me, the feel like the would scar you up but maybe it&#x27;s because I use it on thicker areas. The scent is barely there. I like it. It really makes my sweaty areas feel deep cleaned. I&#x27;ve recently started to develop bacne too, I&#x27;ve used this bar to smooth my back back out.</li>
            <li> Evens and tones skin tone within 3 weeks. Smells good and last a month at least. Hydrates skin leaving it soft.</li>
            <li> Awful. Goes on smooth, leaves your skin feeling tight and clean. I loved it at first. However after a week of use my skin had broken out in a manner I had not experienced for decades! I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, most products I use have no effect or limited effectiveness. My skin is thick and oily and I have acne to some extent for 20+ years. Not like this though, it was so bad my face actually hurt to move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My whole forehead was covered in tiny pimples, my problem areas (jaw and cheeks) were so bad that even my makeup couldn&#x27;t cover the mess. I had 2 actual cystic acne pimples which still aren&#x27;t fully healed. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this soap that cloggs pores so badly but it should be avoided at all costs. I have 2 scars forming where the cysts were.</li>
            <li> We used this in the shower for a couple months and didn&#x27;t notice any benefit with exfoliation or improved skin texture. The soap was really messy so I ended up just tossing it. Back to traditional shower gel!</li>
            <li> Have bought this before and loved it. This time it has pieces of something to help exfoliate but it is very scratchy. Will try to find the original</li>
            <li> Growing up, my best friend was African-American, and I recall always seeing &amp;#34;African&amp;#34; soap in her bathroom. The soap was always black, and I recall thinking that was interesting, and perhaps it was something specific for her skin type. I wish I had asked her about it at the time -- I would have saved thousands of dollars and many years of fighting skin break outs had I discovered this before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product because I received a free sample of a similar product - http://www.amazon.com/Shea-Moisture-African-Black-Soap-8/dp/B005C2N8IC - from a sample website. I was slightly hesitant to try it, but did and LOVED it. My skin had never looked better. Unfortunately, that particular product is close to $9 a bar on Amazon -- so I went looking for an alternative and found this soap, which is even better than the Shea Moisture bar that I received for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is smooth, moisturized, and, most importantly, it is completely clear for the first time in years. I have used nothing else on my face since I&#x27;ve used this soap -- not even moisturizer -- and it&#x27;s never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It does have a slight scent to it. I am very sensitive to smells, but this does not bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;-This bar is LARGE! I would actually recommend keeping it outside the shower OR cutting the bar into thirds and just keeping one third in the shower at a time. That way it will last longer.</li>
            <li> Tried it for two days straight, and I literally had cystic acne all over my face as a result, which now has turned into dark scars. Thank you African black soap for making my complexion worse.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  Very clean feeling.  Pleasant smell too.</li>
            <li> hello&lt;br /&gt;really this is a best soap in world loooool&lt;br /&gt;my skin very softly and brihteing&lt;br /&gt;i want to buy another&lt;br /&gt;thank you seller</li>
            <li> It was good, however seems to go fast when water hits it. I did like it though!</li>
            <li> This is so fake, not real black soap. This isn&#x27;t real raw black soap. Didn&#x27;t really heal my skin but it did prevent acne. It&#x27;s NOT CLOSE to being as powerful as real raw black soap.</li>
            <li> I honestly never though a soap would have such a great effect on my skin, I suffer from really oily skin, I&#x27;m a contemporary dancer wich means dance with my face touchig the floor often so Its hard to keep my skin healthy, I had blackheads and had tried many things, none worked. but this soap is a miracle, i&#x27;ve used it for 3 days only and the blackheads are almost gone, my skin looks and feels softer and healthier, I&#x27;ve had people compliment on the change of my skin alredy, they said it looks cleaner, even and vibrant. I plan on buying more and using it on my body (i have back and chest acne thanks to the school floor too)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nubian Heritage-African Black Soap for almost 6 months straight.I have acne-prone skin. When I first started using it, it did make my skin feel dry but soon afterwards, my skin got used to it and it no longer feels dry after I use this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives a great deep clean to your skin. This works particularly great with an electric cleanser brush. I use a cotton ball with toner right afterwards and there is literally no dirt on it when I use it with the face brush. It has a nice pleasant smell. It&#x27;s good to use in the shower and it suds up very well. This has helped fade my acne scars and my skin is also less oily. The breakouts that I do have (thanks to those stupid pms hormones [&gt;:(]are smaller and go away pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: MAKE SURE TO KEEP AWAY FROM WATER AFTER YOU ARE FINISHED USING THE PRODUCT because the water will make it smaller faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to individuals of all races that want a quality organic face cleanser without the crazy price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 11/1/13&lt;br /&gt;The frequency with which I use this product has decreased because my skin started to get too oily. it started to strip my skin so I&#x27;ve started using the tea tree oil face wash by the body shop which I really enjoy. I have also started to moisturize my skin with grapeseed oil and my skin isn&#x27;t oily anymore. I still like to use this soap about once a week instead of everyday to have that deep clean.this is usually on days that i&#x27;m about to use a face mask or if i only washed my face once the day before due to falling asleep before i could wash my face at night.  I also like to use it as a body wash to help prevent body breakouts.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! This is my first time buying this soap and Ive fallen n love! No black residue....skin is less oily...fresh scent....try this soap!</li>
            <li> I used this on my face and it broke me out - I got the hugest pimple I ever got! I do not recommend for the face but for the body I like it. I loooove the smell and the soap is not as drying or harsh as conventional soap. It&#x27;s not that moisturizing either, but I do have extremely dry skin so I need something more powerful.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for years.  It is terrific on the face.  Non-drying and mildly exfoliating.  Terrific line of soaps and the scents are out of this world!  So good for the skin.  It is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> My mother has gotten rid of dark spots with this soap, it is excellent for every skin problem, and this brand smells lovely.</li>
            <li> This bar of soap was heaven sent. I have had really bad acne for about 4 years now, until I started using these. It ridded my face of bumps in a week! my acne has gotten more under control. i am working on fading blemishes now with bio oil. good soap overall, def recommend trying.</li>
            <li> This is an ok soap. It smells pleasant but I perhaps won&#x27;t buy again since I have similar experiences with other soaps for less.</li>
            <li> i love this soap!&lt;br /&gt;i have been looking for the right and affective soap for my combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;it gets rid of my oil on my skin and feels great every time i use it.&lt;br /&gt;i also love the scent of this soap!&lt;br /&gt;will purchase again!!</li>
            <li> I love love love this soap. It will take care of any problem areas you have on your face. Get it</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s a bit dry and you need to use a mild toner with this, I can proudly say that my skin is getting so nice and clear.  Usually I have medium to severe acne.  Now my acne is gone to mild.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I love how this soap makes my skin feel so soft and the scent is absolutely divine. I highly recommend.</li>
