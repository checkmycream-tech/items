    <ol>
            <li>Especially good for contact wearers.  </li>
            <li>ITEM OF EXCEPTIONALLY EXCELLENT QUALITY, GREAT ITEM, GOOD PRICE PRODUCT, DETAILED, WORKS</li>
            <li>Lancome Mascara is truely the very best !!!  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li>the mascara was fine and service was great...</li>
            <li>It gives me nice length and coverage.  </li>
            <li>The price here was reasonable and was the best I could find on the internet.  </li>
            <li>It looks nice, not spikey.  </li>
            <li>This mascara makes your lashes longer and seperates them nicely.</li>
            <li>While this is an older brand, this is still one of the very best.  </li>
            <li>Try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li>What more do you want?</li>
            <li>I do in fact think my lashes are in better shape.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what most of us want.</li>
            <li>The search for the better mascara goes on....</li>
            <li>love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I have been denying myself of the best mascara for too long.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying LASH stiletto by Maybelline, in black which works beautifully on my lashes!!!</li>
            <li>goes on smoothly, and stays put all day, but comes off easily with makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>Use the 5 pallet shadow too for super duper dreamy eyes!</li>
            <li>VERY WELL, LOVE THE ITEM, RECOMMEND IT !</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly with no clumping and stays put.  </li>
            <li>Really a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>But it goes on very smoothly, gives great length, and does not clump, unlike other waterproof mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>First time using this product and found it smooth and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>However, the only good thing about the mascara is the water-resistance.  </li>
            <li>I have a drawer full that I have bought, tried once and ended up looking like a raccoon!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Comes off quickly with baby oil.</li>
            <li>Lancome Definicils is the best mascara on the market (and I&#x27;ve tried them all) but the product I received did not live up to my previous experience.</li>
            <li>I read the claims on this brand and saw it on a couple of top ten</li>
            <li>I still miss the old Clinique Gentle Waterproof Mascara (which WAS  bombproof and went on smoothly).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and black.  </li>
            <li>And at last, itis comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>so I needed something that really works</li>
            <li>Thanks so much Lancome.</li>
            <li>This mascara does not lengthen lashes like other mascaras I have tried(projectionist is my favorite)...</li>
            <li>I have been using Lancome Definicils for at least 12 years, there is just none better!  </li>
            <li>It is still a little water-resistant even over the top of another volumizing mascara.</li>
            <li>I bought two new tubes.  </li>
            <li>Use this High Def mascara, then smooth out a little with an old brush.  </li>
            <li>but if you keep an old mascara brush around, you can use that to smooth it out a little.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The feel of the mascara is soft and flexible.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely waterproof but is very clumpy and makes my lashes stick together when I use it.  </li>
            <li>But since it is more expensive, I have been applying it over the top of my other mascara.  </li>
            <li>but this one is my new standard.</li>
            <li>You add the first coat and let it dry, then add the second coat.  </li>
            <li>So after experimenting with several different new mascaras, this is the one I&#x27;m sticking with.</li>
            <li>The tube was slightly open when it arrived so maybe mine dried out but definitely wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>The only other ones that I would recommend are the Chanel Waterproof mascara and the Clinque High Definitions mascara with comb.</li>

            <li> I thought the mascara was extremely dry and didn&#x27;t last long at all before I had to buy more, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> But within a very short time, the product was clumpy and dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried other more expensive brands but this one passed the test.</li>
            <li> No wow factor.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who likes their lashes long and fuller!</li>
            <li> This is not absolutely bombproof -- it can smudge a little if, like, you go swimming.  </li>
            <li> I love Lancome mascara and hate to purchase in a department store because of the price.  </li>
            <li> I always cry at weddings and leave with black eyes</li>
            <li> If you want a very subtle natural look, this is the mascara for you.</li>
            <li> For the past six months I have been trying other brands and this one is supreme.</li>
            <li> Start your base coat with a light coat of Lacome CILS Booster XL.  </li>
            <li> Wait a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> It does come on a little thick</li>
            <li> no more.</li>
            <li> Tough to remove.</li>
            <li> It was sticky and difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> the mascara doesn&#x27;t lengthen or thicken lashes, and it is on the expensive side.  </li>
            <li> It stays on all day, through sad movies, does not need to be reapplied, and does not flake.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> My problem is that I hate that feeling of having bristles growing out of my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> i mistakenly ordered the lancome definicils in waterproof once, and it was terrible!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> the mascara was fine and service was great...I have no problems with it and would recommend it  to anyone who needs it.</li>
            <li> Maybe 4 1/2 stars, actually.  It gives me nice length and coverage.  It&#x27;s nice and black.  It does come on a little thick but if you keep an old mascara brush around, you can use that to smooth it out a little.  Start your base coat with a light coat of Lacome CILS Booster XL.  Wait a few minutes.  Use this High Def mascara, then smooth out a little with an old brush.  Use the 5 pallet shadow too for super duper dreamy eyes!</li>
            <li> I love Lancome mascara and hate to purchase in a department store because of the price.  The price here was reasonable and was the best I could find on the internet.  The waterproof mascara stays on all day and does not smudge at all.  Comes off quickly with baby oil.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing like the mascara I buy at the department store. It was sticky and difficult to remove. It was brittle on my eyelashes. Lancome Definicils is the best mascara on the market (and I&#x27;ve tried them all) but the product I received did not live up to my previous experience. I&#x27;ve gone back to Nordstrom on this one.</li>
            <li> This product does nothing for my lashes alone.  I ended up buying LASH stiletto by Maybelline, in black which works beautifully on my lashes!!! Try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this product. This mascara does not lengthen lashes like other mascaras I have tried(projectionist is my favorite)... smells like glue and looks that way when applying it. Tough to remove. If you want a very subtle natural look, this is the mascara for you. No wow factor.</li>
            <li> I have been using Lancome Definicils for at least 12 years, there is just none better!  Even at competing cosmetic counters, they agree with me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of mascaras.  They always smear.  This one doesn&#x27;t.  It glides on smoothly with no clumping and stays put.  What more do you want?</li>
            <li> This is not absolutely bombproof -- it can smudge a little if, like, you go swimming.  But it goes on very smoothly, gives great length, and does not clump, unlike other waterproof mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.  I still miss the old Clinique Gentle Waterproof Mascara (which WAS  bombproof and went on smoothly).  But it doesn&#x27;t look like they&#x27;re going to bring that back.  So after experimenting with several different new mascaras, this is the one I&#x27;m sticking with.</li>
            <li> While this is an older brand, this is still one of the very best.  You add the first coat and let it dry, then add the second coat.  Voila, you have longer well spread lashes. The brush makes a big difference. Really a fantastic product.  The only other ones that I would recommend are the Chanel Waterproof mascara and the Clinque High Definitions mascara with comb.</li>
            <li> I thought the mascara was extremely dry and didn&#x27;t last long at all before I had to buy more, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Finally, a truly waterproof mascara. I have tried other more expensive brands but this one passed the test. No raccoon eyes here.</li>
            <li> Mascara is definitely water-resistant!  If I don&#x27;t actually try scrub my eyes, the mascara lasts through showers.  However, the only good thing about the mascara is the water-resistance.  Cons:  the mascara doesn&#x27;t lengthen or thicken lashes, and it is on the expensive side.  I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.  But since it is more expensive, I have been applying it over the top of my other mascara.  It is still a little water-resistant even over the top of another volumizing mascara.</li>
            <li> I have tried my share of mascara, promiscuously switching from brand to brand.  My problem is that I hate that feeling of having bristles growing out of my eyelids.  I read the claims on this brand and saw it on a couple of top ten lists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel of the mascara is soft and flexible.  I do in fact think my lashes are in better shape.  It looks nice, not spikey.  And at last, itis comfortable to wear.  Proof?  I bought two new tubes.  I am sticking to this mascara.  Slut no more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely waterproof but is very clumpy and makes my lashes stick together when I use it.  The tube was slightly open when it arrived so maybe mine dried out but definitely wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> First time using this product and found it smooth and easy to apply.  Very satisfied and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Lift and separate. That&#x27;s what most of us want. But within a very short time, the product was clumpy and dry. It&#x27;s not inexpensive either....bummer. The search for the better mascara goes on....</li>
            <li> love this mascara.  goes on smoothly, and stays put all day, but comes off easily with makeup remover.  i mistakenly ordered the lancome definicils in waterproof once, and it was terrible!  but this one is my new standard.</li>
            <li> ITEM OF EXCEPTIONALLY EXCELLENT QUALITY, GREAT ITEM, GOOD PRICE PRODUCT, DETAILED, WORKS VERY WELL, LOVE THE ITEM, RECOMMEND IT ! A++++++++</li>
            <li> I have been denying myself of the best mascara for too long.  For the past six months I have been trying other brands and this one is supreme. Especially good for contact wearers.  No flaking!  This was simple - order and have it shipped in two days!</li>
            <li> This mascara makes your lashes longer and seperates them nicely. I would recommend this product to anyone who likes their lashes long and fuller!</li>
            <li> I have searched and searched for a mascara that does not smudge.  I have a drawer full that I have bought, tried once and ended up looking like a raccoon!&lt;br /&gt;But this is IT! It stays on all day, through sad movies, does not need to be reapplied, and does not flake.  I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Lancome Mascara is truely the very best !!!  I always cry at weddings and leave with black eyes so I needed something that really works and here it is. Thanks so much Lancome.</li>
