            <li>LOVE the color.  </li>
            <li>I received many compliments on the color.  </li>
            <li>this color goes with many outfits and looks so much better than the picture.</li>
            <li>Love the color, really love the name.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I love this color.  </li>
            <li>for lack of a better way of putting it</li>
            <li>I am enjoying mixing with clothes to bring out either color.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite OPI colors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shimmery but not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li>~ what more do you need to know?</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>Love the color.  </li>
            <li>Great product fast shipper</li>
            <li>I love this color.  </li>
            <li>Very unique and not something you can find in another brand.</li>
            <li>Nice funky color for fun</li>
            <li>Product is awesome, like all the other OPI colors.</li>
            <li>and I have a beautiful shimmering gray blue color.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it paints on well and dries just fine.</li>
            <li>Has a little bit of a pearl tint to it and it looks perfect on my toes.  </li>
            <li>And the light sparkle brightens up the blue-gray color just a touch</li>
            <li>I had this color used during a manicure in Boston and liked it so much I would have bought a bottle</li>
            <li>It actually is kind of grey, which I personally love!</li>
            <li>My new favorite shade of the season!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a nice blue.  </li>
            <li>i thought this would be a more sparkly color but its a kind of a muddy blue, i think it&#x27;s alright from the Holland collection</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too over the top for a blue either, which is really nice.</li>
            <li>The color is actually more of a blue and quite honestly I think this and \\&quot;I dont give a Rotterdam\\</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color, almost chalk blue when applied.</li>
            <li>Cool color.</li>
            <li>It looks much lighter and more glittery in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Also, 3 coats are required to give full coverage.</li>
            <li>but this color is just extraordinary</li>
            <li>The only draw back being that I feel the best coverage is at 3 coats as opposed to 2.</li>
            <li>Very unique color and can appear as many different shades depending on the lighting.</li>
            <li>very tiny specks of sparkle really looks nice on and I used two coats and a top coat</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cool and looks just as pretty on deeper brown skin as on lighter skin.</li>
            <li>Great color with a little shimmer.</li>
            <li>This is a nice medium blue with a shimmer of gold</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more visible in direct sun.  </li>
            <li>This is a color I have never seen or used before but its a nice color seems to remind me of faded blue jeans has a grayish color to it and</li>
            <li>Nail polish took a bit of time to arrive (few weeks), but it was in great condition and exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fine, giving only a light shimmer in a way that sort of mimics the coloring of that old denim jacket....</li>
            <li>The color is just as pretty now as it was the first time I saw it.  </li>
            <li>While the color may be lighter at 2 coats than 3, the coverage isn&#x27;t as full or complete as I like it.</li>
            <li>I like OPI but not didn&#x27;t really like this color.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a light shimmery grayish blue color, this is the nail polish for you.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I have still worn it and it gets compliments because it is very glittery</li>
            <li>I used to wear blue nail polish all the time (20 years ago) but feel, somehow, that the brighter blues I used to wear so often are just too trendy and too young for a 40 year old (even though I wear them on my toes sometimes, still).  </li>
            <li>OPI always has such unique shades.</li>
            <li>Builds nicely on the second coat and long wearing.</li>
            <li>blue(ish) -- like a favorite faded pair of jeans -- and with a little glittery sparkle.  </li>
            <li>always apply two coats when I wear this one, but the extra time is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Not to dark not to light.</li>
            <li>&quot; are exactly the same shade.</li>
            <li>I love the subtle shimmer to it.</li>
            <li>Professional yet different.</li>
            <li>It has a little bit of sparkle but not too much to be obnoxious.</li>

            <li> This color is a mix between blue and grey with hints of shimmer.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer said, the sparkle isn&#x27;t too much, just enough for a little fanciness.  </li>
            <li> when you read reviews it is GREY</li>
            <li> It also is a frequent base of Polka.com (a purple/blue sparkly mix), but I love it by itself, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a mix of a dark gray and blue color..  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty color, however, it goes on thin.  </li>
            <li> It goes with gray, blue and even black.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the shade on my nails and hate it even more against my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Even with shipping I paid less than I would have in a store.  </li>
            <li> If you have tried I Don&#x27;t Give A Rotterdam, this color is grayer and slightly darker.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with my bottle being a little thick and it taking awhile to dry.</li>
            <li> The little glittery flecks aid in the denim-like appearance of the color.</li>
            <li> The consistency is a little thin, especially in my experiences with OPI polish.</li>
            <li> Wish I can return as after 3 tries, it still sucks</li>
            <li> and I wanted some at home for the small chips.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product held up over time, I do not get that with the ordinary drug store brands.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t look too dull.  </li>
            <li> This is my fav color lately.</li>
            <li> I hurried and ordered this color because the pictures online showed a greener color, but when I recieved it I was not happy at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little obsessed with the Opi Holland collection, and this shade is no exception!</li>
            <li> Hated the color.</li>

            <li> I just got this at my hair salon and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the color.  I used to wear blue nail polish all the time (20 years ago) but feel, somehow, that the brighter blues I used to wear so often are just too trendy and too young for a 40 year old (even though I wear them on my toes sometimes, still).  Anyway, this color is wonderful.  Still blue(ish) -- like a favorite faded pair of jeans -- and with a little glittery sparkle.  Like the other reviewer said, the sparkle isn&#x27;t too much, just enough for a little fanciness.  And the light sparkle brightens up the blue-gray color just a touch so it doesn&#x27;t look too dull.  I love this color!</li>
            <li> This is a nice medium blue with a shimmer of gold that&#x27;s more visible in direct sun.  In shade or indoors it&#x27;s more of a nice blue.  The formula is great (as is most OPI polishes) two coats gives a nice finish.</li>

            <li> Beautiful color! I received many compliments on the color.  The quality of the product held up over time, I do not get that with the ordinary drug store brands.  I would buy this brand and this color again.</li>
            <li> i thought this would be a more sparkly color but its a kind of a muddy blue, i think it&#x27;s alright from the Holland collection</li>
            <li> I had this color used during a manicure in Boston and liked it so much I would have bought a bottle but they didn&#x27;t have anymore.  When I got back home to Michigan I looked at the stores around me that sell OPI and the color was not to be found.  Then I thought of Amazon.com.  Of course they had it and it was for a discounted price.  Even with shipping I paid less than I would have in a store.  The color is just as pretty now as it was the first time I saw it.  I&#x27;ve always been impressed with OPI but this color is just extraordinary and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>

            <li> My new favorite shade of the season! Product is awesome, like all the other OPI colors. Very unique color and can appear as many different shades depending on the lighting.</li>
            <li> This color is so versatile.  It goes with gray, blue and even black.  I get complements on it every time I wear it!!</li>
            <li> I like this color a lot! I love the subtle shimmer to it. It isn&#x27;t too over the top for a blue either, which is really nice. I had an issue with my bottle being a little thick and it taking awhile to dry.</li>
            <li> color is deceiving&lt;br /&gt;esp on pinterest&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but when you read reviews it is GREY&lt;br /&gt;not the blue I wanted&lt;br /&gt;but still nice</li>
            <li> This is a pretty color, however, it goes on thin.  I had to do 3 or 4 coats to make it so it&#x27;s not streaky.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color, almost chalk blue when applied. OPI always has such unique shades.</li>
            <li> Love the color, really love the name. Builds nicely on the second coat and long wearing.</li>

            <li> Cool color. It&#x27;s grayish blue with just a hint of sparkle.</li>
            <li> I love this color!  Has a little bit of a pearl tint to it and it looks perfect on my toes.  Not to dark not to light.</li>
            <li> Nice funky color for fun</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very nice color! i love it.</li>
            <li> I love this color.  It has a little bit of sparkle but not too much to be obnoxious. And it&#x27;s OPI so you know it&#x27;s a great quality.  I get compliments on this color ALL the time.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It looks quite a bit lighter in the bottle, and dries at what I&#x27;ll call a medium blue. The little glittery flecks aid in the denim-like appearance of the color. It&#x27;s super cool and looks just as pretty on deeper brown skin as on lighter skin. The only draw back being that I feel the best coverage is at 3 coats as opposed to 2. While the color may be lighter at 2 coats than 3, the coverage isn&#x27;t as full or complete as I like it. The consistency is a little thin, especially in my experiences with OPI polish. Know also that the glitter in this polish isn&#x27;t very larger or sparkly. It&#x27;s very fine, giving only a light shimmer in a way that sort of mimics the coloring of that old denim jacket.... for lack of a better way of putting it lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars from me because this color wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. It looks much lighter and more glittery in the bottle. Also, 3 coats are required to give full coverage. Otherwise, it paints on well and dries just fine.</li>
            <li> This color is a lot prettier then the picture..  perfect for summer or winter.. It is a mix of a dark gray and blue color..  I am enjoying mixing with clothes to bring out either color.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite OPI colors. I just received it and put it on yesterday.  Used 2 coats and I have a beautiful shimmering gray blue color. If you have tried I Don&#x27;t Give A Rotterdam, this color is grayer and slightly darker. A great color for Fall and Winter.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this color if you&#x27;re banking on a brighter blue. It actually is kind of grey, which I personally love! It&#x27;s shimmery but not at all overwhelming. I wear this color all the time and my friends are constantly asking me to do their nails like this! I actually just painted my friends nails this color yesterday.</li>
            <li> I hurried and ordered this color because the pictures online showed a greener color, but when I recieved it I was not happy at all. The color is actually more of a blue and quite honestly I think this and \\&quot;I dont give a Rotterdam\\&quot; are exactly the same shade. I have still worn it and it gets compliments because it is very glittery but I wish the color was advertised to look the way it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Dutch ~ what more do you need to know? LOL</li>
            <li> The pain is oily, the 2nd coat runs.... Steer away from this shade. Wish I can return as after 3 tries, it still sucks</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish. Great color with a little shimmer.</li>
            <li> This color is a mix between blue and grey with hints of shimmer. I always get a lot of compliments when I wear it and hope it stays  a permanent color in OPI&#x27;s line of colors. Very unique and not something you can find in another brand.</li>
            <li> Love the color.  Perfect for Seahawk fans.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipper</li>
            <li> Thank you for adding to my nail polish addiction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little obsessed with the Opi Holland collection, and this shade is no exception! It&#x27;s got the perfect amount of sparkle, and the color is a gorgeous stormy blue/gray color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always apply two coats when I wear this one, but the extra time is well worth it. It also is a frequent base of Polka.com (a purple/blue sparkly mix), but I love it by itself, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this color.  I wear this all and time and get plenty of compliments.  Will purchase again to have a backup.</li>
