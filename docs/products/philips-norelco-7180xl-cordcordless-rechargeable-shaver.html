    <ol>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he is very happy with it</li>
            <li>I must say, I am thoroughly impressed.</li>
            <li>It was a great price for a quality product.</li>
            <li>then I will be a happy camper for quite some time.</li>
            <li>Great shavers.    </li>
            <li>Up until now, I have had nothing but great experiences with Norelco.  </li>
            <li>good shaves out of a Gilette fusion blade, which makes them about a 10 dollar a month ivestment.</li>
            <li>She purchased the Norelco7180XL at Sears for about $85.00 thinking it was a good quality razor, which it is.</li>
            <li>This shaver was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>, I was very pleased with the value in this upgrade.</li>
            <li>This is the best razor I&#x27;ve had to date &amp; recommend it--makes shaving fun</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the feel of the shaver and the results.</li>
            <li>I had about abandoned hope that I would ever find a suitable replacement for my beloved Norelco Quadra</li>
            <li>nice about having a Norelco from the land that created them.  </li>
            <li>This shaver was recommended to me by a friend and on the first day it shaves beautifully.</li>
            <li>Does a great job very quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Shave is very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Very light electric razor.  </li>
            <li>It looked great, and I was excited about the water clean up feature.</li>
            <li>I have owned many cordless Norelco rotory shavers in my life (I&#x27;m over 50 now).</li>
            <li>I have always been pleased and with them</li>
            <li>I have never gotten razer burn before but this one has giving me one oh too many times.</li>
            <li>I have put up with this one for over a year now and it has not gotten any better.</li>
            <li>He has been enjoying the features offered by this device.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you should have to pay more than 100 dollars for any razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>is so much better.</li>
            <li>However, that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>The 7180 is so much better, I can&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this shaver; it&#x27;s better than most at the price.</li>
            <li>It does not hold a charge for more than 3 shaves.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need anything more.</li>
            <li>It is stylish and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>The exclusion of a storage case is certainly an unwelcome \\&quot;feature\\&quot; of an otherwise good product at a premium price.</li>
            <li>So a charge for 30 minutes of shaving time easily lasts a week.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let this new science ficticious design fool you its good for nothing.</li>
            <li>the shaver works fine</li>
            <li>The 7180XL is a perfectly good razor for men who are satisfied with a socially acceptable shave and whose face can tolerate the rotary shaving system.  </li>
            <li>I look acceptably smooth and would feel comfortable at a work setting with this closeness level.</li>
            <li>The razor itself is well made, fits great in my hand, is very quiet, and glides over the skin.</li>
            <li>if it works for you, great, if not, then go back to a blade.</li>
            <li>I get a smooth shave that I didn&#x27;t get with my Braun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that you won&#x27;t get as close a shave as you would with the standard cream and razor method, but the time you save (takes me around 3 minutes to get a GOOD shave) and irritation that will become nearly nilled makes this a great buy.</li>
            <li>I do know I am actually excited to use it again tomorrow.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it can be rinsed  clean</li>
            <li>- you can&#x27;t do a close multi-pass shave for special occasions like you can with a blade  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you looking for a good electric, without paying too much.</li>
            <li>It was a good discount on a mid range priced electric razor, so I took the plunge.  </li>
            <li>As the recipient of this product (a gift), and as a retiree who only shaved every 3 or so days, I am delighted.  </li>
            <li>is the only good thing I can say about it.  </li>
            <li>Call me a pansy, but I had to return the razor, and am now in search of a new Braun model with better ergonomics, and a smooth, painless shave.</li>
            <li>I am generally happy with my new Norelco 7180XL, it is nice to have a new shaver, it is amazingly quiet, and gives a close and quick shave.    </li>
            <li>The problem is the basic design of this shaver which always leave some shave in between the gaps and you have to go over it again and agian inviting more razor burn and irritation and spending more time.</li>
            <li>After three weeks of using it, this is by far the most comfortable one yet.</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t particularly care for that feature, but it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>7180XL is not as easy to clean as my older shaver and there is an indication it needs to be cleaned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this new shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good mid-level razor at a reasonable price, balancing quietness, speed, ergonomics, and the necessary features.  </li>
            <li>My progression went from normal Gilette Trac II razors, to Schick FX, to Gilette Sensor, to Gilette Mach III (still in my mind the most innovative razor ever), to the Gilette fusion, to my current razor of choice, the Gilette Fusion Power.</li>
            <li>I give this shaver a 3 because I&#x27;m not sure if the shaver&#x27;s the problem or my skin because it works great for my friend.</li>
            <li>I find that I get 5 days of shaves on one full charge and a full charge takes about 50 minutes to complete.</li>
            <li>previous shaver model 5887XL is superior shaver in quantity of shaves and the workmanship and materials.my shaver model</li>
            <li>This shaver is very light as well as quiet.  </li>
            <li>My first shaver was a Norelco.</li>
            <li>Truthfully, they both seem to work equally well, but there is &lt;br /&gt;something</li>
            <li>This was the first electric razor I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Plus it rinses clean with hot tap water - a decided advantage on a busy work morning.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even sure it was working until I looked at how much stubble it actually removed.</li>
            <li>I was also pleased with how long it holds a charge, as when vacationing two or three weeks overseas, I do not have to worry about running out of power.</li>
            <li>Well, I have done that, and it remains to be seen if my new Norelco will eventually sort itself out and work right.    </li>
            <li>But in my mind, 50 bucks for this was a steal, you don&#x27;t need to spend 169 or whatever the cost is on a fancy bells and whistles razor, this one works fine - and I plan on using it as my daily shaver.</li>
            <li>It provides a very close shave and has the trimmer feature for side burns, ect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a wet shaver (safety razor, soap, and brush) for many years, but decided to try an electric to save time in the morning.  </li>
            <li>and I am much happier.</li>
            <li>better than expected.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to really abrade my face, which was quite irritated afterwards.  </li>
            <li>7180XL is much lighter and smoother shave.</li>
            <li>It has given me the same close &amp; comfortable shave that I used to get with the Quadra.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really complain considering I was cautioned.</li>
            <li>Well, on my initial charge, the light started blinking after 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I tried using a light touch, but the results were the same.</li>
            <li>the shaver only gives me 4 shaves before recharging,secondly it does not have an indication when to clean the shaver it just shows a red light showing the battery is</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco Shavers in the past but the 7180XL is definitely the best.  </li>
            <li>I have previously used Norelco shavers because they were the only ones I could find that gave me a good shave without much irritation.</li>
            <li>This new shaver is not as quiet as it was when new, and it takes a bit longer to get a good complete shave, but the shave is decent overall.      </li>
            <li>I tried both the SmartTouch and Arcitec models and they just didn&#x27;t deliver a decent shave for me.  </li>
            <li>The shaver provides a decent close shave.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this shaver (which again, originally caused such a smooth shave) would mess up my face so much more than other shavers.    </li>
            <li>It is highly convenient to wash the shaver under the tap and not have to worry about meticulous cleaning.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the 7180XL.</li>
            <li>It was remarkably light and very quiet, it almost seemed to be running too slow to actually work, but it did a good job of removing my stubble.</li>
            <li>The shaver is also easy to clean using either wet or dry methods.</li>
            <li>The slow speed does make it very quiet and the new cleaning method is very handy.  </li>
            <li>Pairing that with gel, shaving with a normal blade cost me about 15 dollars a month.</li>
            <li>The most frustrating part about researching Norelco shavers is that there are just so many different models.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you keep your old case holder from your previously owned shaver(s).</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the loose fitting head.  </li>
            <li>Regarding the last point above, you really can&#x27;t address that by using a blade on just special occasions.  </li>
            <li>They sent a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>They sent a new one.  </li>
            <li>They sent a new one.  </li>
            <li>The new one has worked 6+ months.  </li>
            <li>if I asked for a new razor, they&#x27;d give me one.  </li>
            <li>Of course it&#x27;s sharper because it&#x27;s brand new</li>
            <li>it seems that you went downhill on the new model</li>
            <li>I needed a new one and decided to try the 7180XL.</li>
            <li>Its suppose to have a better battery and more cutting surface for a closer shave.</li>
            <li>my battery low light only comes on about the 9th shave.  </li>
            <li>I did continue the charge for 12 hours anyway, the green light blinking the whole time.    </li>
            <li>Then I started using the shaver, and after just 2 shaves, the red low battery light came on.  </li>
            <li>This new shaver has been good so far but definately not the build quality, or the solid feel of the previous 5825XL, which I have had for the last 8 years.  </li>
            <li>Without a doubt spend a little more and get the 8240XL model instead or at least a better one than the 8140 series.</li>
            <li>I was willing to look a little more scruffy as long as I wasnt in pain all day.</li>
            <li>As expected, the new 7180XL razor delivers a close and comfortable electric shave, even though it runs much slower than earlier models.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are many guys out there who have followed a similar progression, and for my money, Gilette blades still over the closest shave, albeit incredibly expensive razors.</li>
            <li>Very quiet, close and fast shave with no discomfort at all; and this model cleans in running water, which is much faster than the old technology.</li>
            <li>I had NO irritation, and very minor feeling of burn that was quelled by some old spice rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Neither of these were in tune with my first experience with the 7180XL, as far as initial charging, and what the green charging light and red low battery light were doing.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to donate this one and try to find new heads for my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>My skin no longer looks razor burned, I get a close shave (no need to \\&quot;touch-up\\&quot; before we go out in the evening) and the razor is very quiet, no loud buzzing sound.</li>
            <li>I have a well defined jaw line and a sensitive neck that can put me in misery for the day after shaving it.</li>
            <li>No \\&quot;sensitive skin aloe</li>
            <li>Just wanted to submit this review as a heads up to anyone else who is contemplating this razor, and has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this in early 2007.  </li>
            <li>Holding the shaver vs my old was has been an adjustment</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also faster and lighter than my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t used an electric razor since college, an old Sunbeam, now a collector&#x27;s item, but I am now clean-shaven every day.</li>
            <li>When fully charged, the green light is supposed to blink.  </li>
            <li>- it missed a lot of hairs, requiring several passes for a clean shave  - although I used a light touch, pushing the shaver through the stubble was still irritating  </li>
            <li>This shaver is extremely light weight, quiet and gives an extremely close/smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this razor for about two years now and while it does give me a relatively close and comfortable shave the battery life is starting to show its limited use.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt very smooth; but, after the next few days my hair growing back caused bumps.</li>
            <li>They omit the obvious next step of charging it in these instructions, but say you will have no problem with the red light coming on too soon after following their directions.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing that the battery should last longer than two years, but maybe that is normal, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li>but, it&#x27;s a new and different razor.  </li>
            <li>I try to keep them very short now but am still very nervous when shaving my upper lip - just don&#x27;t know when it will catch one.</li>
            <li>The battery charge does not last as long as the old shaver, but I really do like cleaning the shaver under the water faucet.  </li>
            <li>I am 75 years old &amp; shave daily.</li>
            <li>Then I discovered the 7180XL, which uses the same shaving heads as the old Spectra series.  </li>
            <li>When running it is as quiet as an old fashioned blade.  </li>
            <li>They all did a decent job but all left long hairs.</li>
            <li>I have found it does not hold a charge as long as my old unit.  </li>
            <li>I must say I have my doubts after this initial experience, that it will last as long as my 7 year old model 5841XL did.  </li>
            <li>I was due for a new razor and asked my wife for one as a Christmas gift.</li>

            <li> He didn&#x27;t particularly care for that feature, but it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> 7180XL is not as easy to clean as my older shaver and there is an indication it needs to be cleaned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this new shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good mid-level razor at a reasonable price, balancing quietness, speed, ergonomics, and the necessary features.  </li>
            <li> My progression went from normal Gilette Trac II razors, to Schick FX, to Gilette Sensor, to Gilette Mach III (still in my mind the most innovative razor ever), to the Gilette fusion, to my current razor of choice, the Gilette Fusion Power.</li>
            <li> I give this shaver a 3 because I&#x27;m not sure if the shaver&#x27;s the problem or my skin because it works great for my friend.</li>
            <li> I find that I get 5 days of shaves on one full charge and a full charge takes about 50 minutes to complete.</li>
            <li> previous shaver model 5887XL is superior shaver in quantity of shaves and the workmanship and materials.my shaver model</li>
            <li> This shaver is very light as well as quiet.  </li>
            <li> My first shaver was a Norelco.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, they both seem to work equally well, but there is &lt;br /&gt;something</li>
            <li> This was the first electric razor I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Plus it rinses clean with hot tap water - a decided advantage on a busy work morning.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even sure it was working until I looked at how much stubble it actually removed.</li>
            <li> I was also pleased with how long it holds a charge, as when vacationing two or three weeks overseas, I do not have to worry about running out of power.</li>
            <li> Well, I have done that, and it remains to be seen if my new Norelco will eventually sort itself out and work right.    </li>
            <li> But in my mind, 50 bucks for this was a steal, you don&#x27;t need to spend 169 or whatever the cost is on a fancy bells and whistles razor, this one works fine - and I plan on using it as my daily shaver.</li>
            <li> It provides a very close shave and has the trimmer feature for side burns, ect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a wet shaver (safety razor, soap, and brush) for many years, but decided to try an electric to save time in the morning.  </li>
            <li> and I am much happier.</li>
            <li> better than expected.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to really abrade my face, which was quite irritated afterwards.  </li>
            <li> 7180XL is much lighter and smoother shave.</li>
            <li> It has given me the same close &amp; comfortable shave that I used to get with the Quadra.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really complain considering I was cautioned.</li>
            <li> Well, on my initial charge, the light started blinking after 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I tried using a light touch, but the results were the same.</li>
            <li> the shaver only gives me 4 shaves before recharging,secondly it does not have an indication when to clean the shaver it just shows a red light showing the battery is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco Shavers in the past but the 7180XL is definitely the best.  </li>
            <li> I have previously used Norelco shavers because they were the only ones I could find that gave me a good shave without much irritation.</li>
            <li> This new shaver is not as quiet as it was when new, and it takes a bit longer to get a good complete shave, but the shave is decent overall.      </li>
            <li> I tried both the SmartTouch and Arcitec models and they just didn&#x27;t deliver a decent shave for me.  </li>
            <li> The shaver provides a decent close shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this shaver (which again, originally caused such a smooth shave) would mess up my face so much more than other shavers.    </li>
            <li> It is highly convenient to wash the shaver under the tap and not have to worry about meticulous cleaning.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the 7180XL.</li>
            <li> It was remarkably light and very quiet, it almost seemed to be running too slow to actually work, but it did a good job of removing my stubble.</li>
            <li> The shaver is also easy to clean using either wet or dry methods.</li>
            <li> The slow speed does make it very quiet and the new cleaning method is very handy.  </li>
            <li> Pairing that with gel, shaving with a normal blade cost me about 15 dollars a month.</li>
            <li> The most frustrating part about researching Norelco shavers is that there are just so many different models.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you keep your old case holder from your previously owned shaver(s).</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the loose fitting head.  </li>
            <li> Regarding the last point above, you really can&#x27;t address that by using a blade on just special occasions.  </li>
            <li> They sent a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> They sent a new one.  </li>
            <li> They sent a new one.  </li>
            <li> The new one has worked 6+ months.  </li>
            <li> if I asked for a new razor, they&#x27;d give me one.  </li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s sharper because it&#x27;s brand new</li>
            <li> it seems that you went downhill on the new model</li>
            <li> I needed a new one and decided to try the 7180XL.</li>
            <li> Its suppose to have a better battery and more cutting surface for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> my battery low light only comes on about the 9th shave.  </li>
            <li> I did continue the charge for 12 hours anyway, the green light blinking the whole time.    </li>
            <li> Then I started using the shaver, and after just 2 shaves, the red low battery light came on.  </li>
            <li> This new shaver has been good so far but definately not the build quality, or the solid feel of the previous 5825XL, which I have had for the last 8 years.  </li>
            <li> Without a doubt spend a little more and get the 8240XL model instead or at least a better one than the 8140 series.</li>
            <li> I was willing to look a little more scruffy as long as I wasnt in pain all day.</li>
            <li> As expected, the new 7180XL razor delivers a close and comfortable electric shave, even though it runs much slower than earlier models.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are many guys out there who have followed a similar progression, and for my money, Gilette blades still over the closest shave, albeit incredibly expensive razors.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, close and fast shave with no discomfort at all; and this model cleans in running water, which is much faster than the old technology.</li>
            <li> I had NO irritation, and very minor feeling of burn that was quelled by some old spice rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Neither of these were in tune with my first experience with the 7180XL, as far as initial charging, and what the green charging light and red low battery light were doing.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to donate this one and try to find new heads for my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> My skin no longer looks razor burned, I get a close shave (no need to \\&quot;touch-up\\&quot; before we go out in the evening) and the razor is very quiet, no loud buzzing sound.</li>
            <li> I have a well defined jaw line and a sensitive neck that can put me in misery for the day after shaving it.</li>
            <li> No \\&quot;sensitive skin aloe</li>
            <li> Just wanted to submit this review as a heads up to anyone else who is contemplating this razor, and has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this in early 2007.  </li>
            <li> Holding the shaver vs my old was has been an adjustment</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also faster and lighter than my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used an electric razor since college, an old Sunbeam, now a collector&#x27;s item, but I am now clean-shaven every day.</li>
            <li> When fully charged, the green light is supposed to blink.  </li>
            <li> - it missed a lot of hairs, requiring several passes for a clean shave  - although I used a light touch, pushing the shaver through the stubble was still irritating  </li>
            <li> This shaver is extremely light weight, quiet and gives an extremely close/smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this razor for about two years now and while it does give me a relatively close and comfortable shave the battery life is starting to show its limited use.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt very smooth; but, after the next few days my hair growing back caused bumps.</li>
            <li> They omit the obvious next step of charging it in these instructions, but say you will have no problem with the red light coming on too soon after following their directions.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that the battery should last longer than two years, but maybe that is normal, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li> but, it&#x27;s a new and different razor.  </li>
            <li> I try to keep them very short now but am still very nervous when shaving my upper lip - just don&#x27;t know when it will catch one.</li>
            <li> The battery charge does not last as long as the old shaver, but I really do like cleaning the shaver under the water faucet.  </li>
            <li> I am 75 years old &amp; shave daily.</li>
            <li> Then I discovered the 7180XL, which uses the same shaving heads as the old Spectra series.  </li>
            <li> When running it is as quiet as an old fashioned blade.  </li>
            <li> They all did a decent job but all left long hairs.</li>
            <li> I have found it does not hold a charge as long as my old unit.  </li>
            <li> I must say I have my doubts after this initial experience, that it will last as long as my 7 year old model 5841XL did.  </li>
            <li> I was due for a new razor and asked my wife for one as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Of course my new purchase was an upgrade from my previous Philips razor</li>
            <li> but it has a few drawbacks from my older model.first</li>
            <li> Old Norelco broke down after 10 ten years.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin, which is why I don&#x27;t use a standard razor, but I never had this problem with the Braun, or the Remington razors I owned previously.</li>
            <li> The 7180 shaves clean-no long hairs left.</li>
            <li> Try putting it back together, and plan on doing nothing else for a LONG TIME!</li>
            <li> - the shave was socially acceptable in appearance, but rough to the touch  </li>
            <li> Battery life is plenty for a long weekend on the road without bringing the charger.  </li>
            <li> It takes forever to shave and not very close even after I shave for 15 minutes going over the same spot over and over again - still can feel the stuble.</li>
            <li> After having Norelco shavers for so long, I know what I need and like.  </li>
            <li> It handled my thick stubble and even my neckline very well.</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave and has a quick charge feature that allows you to charge it for a few minutes and gives at least two shaves.  </li>
            <li> OK, so I went into this a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> It did leave a few random hairs, but I figure I will press my luck with more repetitions of coverage once my face acclimated to the blades.</li>
            <li> After trying it a few times I found that it gives me a major case of skin irritation every time.</li>
            <li> I get 10 shaves on a single charge and</li>
            <li> The shave takes about half the time and is much closer - no more stuble.</li>
            <li> The 7180XL shaves closer &#x27;wet&#x27; than dry.  </li>
            <li> I will admit that the blades have stayed sharp, but as I&#x27;ve mentioned, I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard which would entail more wear on the cutting blades.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was too much of a step down from a proper wet shave.  </li>
            <li> Oh by the way if you happen to have a little long nose hairs this baby will catch them and pull them (not cut them).</li>
            <li> I have never owned a brand other than a Norelco.</li>
            <li> No more going over and over the same spot.</li>
            <li> but if this is the norm for Philips/Norelco razors then I will have to consider other brands.</li>
            <li> I had this problem with other shavers, but never to the extent that occurred using this shaver.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare this product to other brands or  models, but this one is a pleasure.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give the razor a 0 due to the fact I have been shaving with the plug in for the past several  months.</li>
            <li> I now wet shave at night and still have less of a shadow by 5 o&#x27;clock than I would using an electric shaver in the morning.</li>
            <li> The rechargeable battery is just now (April, 2012) beginning to fail as it only holds a charge long enough for four to five shaves.  </li>
            <li> I have owned two previous Norelco shavers and a couple of other brand electric shavers.</li>
            <li> only complaint</li>
            <li> Cuts shaving time from 10 minutes down to 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I had heard they irritate less, but don&#x27;t shave as close, as foil electrics.</li>
            <li> My 4 previous Norelcos have averaged around 5-6 years each.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad that I rarely can shave two days in a row.</li>
            <li> Somewhere in that progression a few years ago I tried a Panasonic Wet/Dry foil razor I bought for about 100 bucks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have that heavy a beard, and a shaving session lasts for about three-four minutes.  </li>
            <li> states in the users manual that it may take a few weeks to get used to Norelco&#x27;s patented lift &amp; cut system,</li>
            <li> After three months of poor shaves and tender, red skin (razor burn)</li>
            <li> If this is the worst of it (they are supposed to cut closer and better after your face adjusts to it)</li>
            <li> I would charge it for about eight hours and the charge usually lasts for about one shave.   </li>
            <li> but as the other people mentioned in their reviews, the only problem is that it desn&#x27;t have any battery charge meter!!! :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to immagain an improvement.</li>
            <li> Get one with the double row of cutting surfaces.</li>
            <li> In fact, the actual cutting of my whiskers is louder than the motor.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Philips-Norelco 7180XL to replace a 7 year old Norelco with an on/off switch that was slowly going bad.  </li>
            <li> I hope that this is just a single bad product that they made</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just tired of having them break.  </li>
            <li> total piece of crap!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this razor did the job in about 2 minutes, and no shaving cream required.</li>
            <li> - the lack of precision (three cutting disks on a planar surface the size of my cheek)  </li>
            <li> After being disappointed by a foil, I settled on the 7180XL.  </li>
            <li> Bad, bad, bad mistake!  </li>
            <li> This is the worst electric shaver i&#x27;ve ever exprience.</li>
            <li> This one has made me think maybe I should switch - couldn&#x27;t be worst than this one.</li>
            <li> I used it for a week or so and realized it was awful.</li>
            <li> This is the worst model I have had.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This shaver is very light as well as quiet.  Battery life is plenty for a long weekend on the road without bringing the charger.  It provides a very close shave and has the trimmer feature for side burns, ect.  Highly recommended if you looking for a good electric, without paying too much.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he is very happy with it but as the other people mentioned in their reviews, the only problem is that it desn&#x27;t have any battery charge meter!!! :(</li>
            <li> This is the worst electric shaver i&#x27;ve ever exprience. Don&#x27;t know how to return it or dont&#x27; have enough patience to go through all that soon i will gonna through it in the garbage. The problem is the basic design of this shaver which always leave some shave in between the gaps and you have to go over it again and agian inviting more razor burn and irritation and spending more time. Don&#x27;t let this new science ficticious design fool you its good for nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a wet shaver (safety razor, soap, and brush) for many years, but decided to try an electric to save time in the morning.  I bought some Williams Lectric Shave and researched electric shaving technique online.  After being disappointed by a foil, I settled on the 7180XL.  It&#x27;s a good mid-level razor at a reasonable price, balancing quietness, speed, ergonomics, and the necessary features.  Unfortunately, it was too much of a step down from a proper wet shave.  I didn&#x27;t like:    - the lack of precision (three cutting disks on a planar surface the size of my cheek)  - it missed a lot of hairs, requiring several passes for a clean shave  - although I used a light touch, pushing the shaver through the stubble was still irritating  - the shave was socially acceptable in appearance, but rough to the touch  - I had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by 2 o&#x27;clock  - you can&#x27;t do a close multi-pass shave for special occasions like you can with a blade  - I started getting ingrown hairs on my neck    Regarding the last point above, you really can&#x27;t address that by using a blade on just special occasions.  The face needs time to adjust to a change in shaving method, so if you switch between methods neither will be optimal.    The 7180XL is a perfectly good razor for men who are satisfied with a socially acceptable shave and whose face can tolerate the rotary shaving system.  It just wasn&#x27;t my cup of tea.  I now wet shave at night and still have less of a shadow by 5 o&#x27;clock than I would using an electric shaver in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have owned many cordless Norelco rotory shavers in my life (I&#x27;m over 50 now). My first shaver was a Norelco. I have always been pleased and with them and when they finally died I always bought another. I have never owned a brand other than a Norelco. This one has made me think maybe I should switch - couldn&#x27;t be worst than this one. Battery dies before my 3rd shave finishes. It takes forever to shave and not very close even after I shave for 15 minutes going over the same spot over and over again - still can feel the stuble. I have never gotten razer burn before but this one has giving me one oh too many times. I know were the phrase \\&quot;red neck\\&quot; comes from now. Oh by the way if you happen to have a little long nose hairs this baby will catch them and pull them (not cut them). And because it wasn&#x27;t cut that same nose hair could be pulled several times during a shave bringing tears to your eyes. I try to keep them very short now but am still very nervous when shaving my upper lip - just don&#x27;t know when it will catch one. I have put up with this one for over a year now and it has not gotten any better. Time to trash it. I hope that this is just a single bad product that they made so I think I might try another Norelco shaver - looking at the 8240XL model. Its suppose to have a better battery and more cutting surface for a closer shave. Update - I have now bought the 8240XL model and I am much happier. The battery last me 8 days. The shave takes about half the time and is much closer - no more stuble. No more going over and over the same spot. Without a doubt spend a little more and get the 8240XL model instead or at least a better one than the 8140 series. Get one with the double row of cutting surfaces.</li>
            <li> I bought this rechargeable shaving system for my husband for Christmas.  It was a replacement of a corded shaver he had been using.  He has been enjoying the features offered by this device.  He especially likes the ability to rinse it out after each use.  It gives a close shave and has a quick charge feature that allows you to charge it for a few minutes and gives at least two shaves.  He has used the razor for about two weeks now with no complaints.  It was a great price for a quality product.</li>
            <li> As expected, the new 7180XL razor delivers a close and comfortable electric shave, even though it runs much slower than earlier models.  The slow speed does make it very quiet and the new cleaning method is very handy.  Just 2 noticable disappointments: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1.  The external power supply is a rather combersome change from former Norelco products. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2.  The exclusion of a storage case is certainly an unwelcome \\&quot;feature\\&quot; of an otherwise good product at a premium price.</li>
            <li> better than expected.  Battery life has been over a week.  Shave is very smooth.  Very quiet.  I&#x27;d strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 0 starts if that was an option!  &lt;br /&gt;A total piece of crap! Try cleaning it, and the head falls apart! Try putting it back together, and plan on doing nothing else for a LONG TIME! DO NOT buy this razor!</li>
            <li> OK, so I went into this a little skeptical. I am Italian and to give you an idea of what the means, I have been shaving since age 12.  My progression went from normal Gilette Trac II razors, to Schick FX, to Gilette Sensor, to Gilette Mach III (still in my mind the most innovative razor ever), to the Gilette fusion, to my current razor of choice, the Gilette Fusion Power. Somewhere in that progression a few years ago I tried a Panasonic Wet/Dry foil razor I bought for about 100 bucks. I used it for a week or so and realized it was awful. Back to the store it went. That was my only experience with an electric razor. I&#x27;m sure there are many guys out there who have followed a similar progression, and for my money, Gilette blades still over the closest shave, albeit incredibly expensive razors. I was getting MAYBE 5-7 good shaves out of a Gilette fusion blade, which makes them about a 10 dollar a month ivestment. Pairing that with gel, shaving with a normal blade cost me about 15 dollars a month. That&#x27;s strike one against the blade.  Strike two comes in the fact that EVERY razor I&#x27;ve ever used irritated my neck. I have a well defined jaw line and a sensitive neck that can put me in misery for the day after shaving it. It&#x27;s so bad that I rarely can shave two days in a row. No \\&quot;sensitive skin aloe gel\\&quot;, \\&quot;lubricating strip\\&quot; etc. ever helped, and to me is all just a gimmick anyway. So I began shopping for a norelco with rotary heads. I had heard they irritate less, but don&#x27;t shave as close, as foil electrics. I was willing to look a little more scruffy as long as I wasnt in pain all day. I decided that I would purchase a MADE IN HOLLAND norelco (which the 7180XL is), but stay under 100 dollars. I don&#x27;t think you should have to pay more than 100 dollars for any razor. I ended up getting this one for 49 bucks at target.  It was a good discount on a mid range priced electric razor, so I took the plunge.  That was yesterday. I charged the razor overnight and went to town with it this morning. I must say, I am thoroughly impressed. It handled my thick stubble and even my neckline very well. It did leave a few random hairs, but I figure I will press my luck with more repetitions of coverage once my face acclimated to the blades. I had NO irritation, and very minor feeling of burn that was quelled by some old spice rather quickly. I look acceptably smooth and would feel comfortable at a work setting with this closeness level. I was skeptical, but this razor did the job in about 2 minutes, and no shaving cream required. I did splash some \\&quot;lectric shave\\&quot; on before hand, and maybe that helped, but who knows. I do know I am actually excited to use it again tomorrow. When was the last time YOU felt that way about shaving. The razor itself is well made, fits great in my hand, is very quiet, and glides over the skin. I wasn&#x27;t even sure it was working until I looked at how much stubble it actually removed. If this is the worst of it (they are supposed to cut closer and better after your face adjusts to it) then I will be a happy camper for quite some time. Norelco makes a QUALITY product.  Bottom line if you are thinking about trying one, just do it - if it works for you, great, if not, then go back to a blade. But in my mind, 50 bucks for this was a steal, you don&#x27;t need to spend 169 or whatever the cost is on a fancy bells and whistles razor, this one works fine - and I plan on using it as my daily shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to immagain an improvement. Of course my new purchase was an upgrade from my previous Philips razor, I was very pleased with the value in this upgrade. Very quiet, close and fast shave with no discomfort at all; and this model cleans in running water, which is much faster than the old technology. I was also pleased with how long it holds a charge, as when vacationing two or three weeks overseas, I do not have to worry about running out of power. Recently while in Norway I had to find a straight razor during my second week when the cheaper model went dead without the proper plug adapter in my kit.

            <li> I have used nothing but Norelco for 15-20 years.  Great shavers.    I bought the 7180 last November.  The battery gave out 2-3 months later (no, I did not overcharge).  They sent a new shaver.  About 1 month later, I was tapping the razor on the sink to shake out the shavings and the battery (I assume) was knocked out of position.  The shaver stopped working.  They sent a new one.  About 1 month later, the shaver just stopped working for no known reason.  They sent a new one.  The new one has worked 6+ months.  This week, it just stopped working.    Up until now, I have had nothing but great experiences with Norelco.  I&#x27;m sure if I asked for a new razor, they&#x27;d give me one.  I&#x27;m just tired of having them break.  I don&#x27;t think I was abusive to these shavers.</li>
            <li> Norelco seems to be moving a lot of its production of electric razors to China.  I have one made there, &lt;br /&gt;and also this one which is still made in Holland.  Truthfully, they both seem to work equally well, but there is &lt;br /&gt;something nice about having a Norelco from the land that created them.  No matter where they&#x27;re from, &lt;br /&gt;they are a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> I had a $150.00 Braun and this Norelco 7180XL is so much better. I get a smooth shave that I didn&#x27;t get with my Braun. The Braun is well made but can&#x27;t compare to the Norelco 7180XL. John In South Carolina</li>
            <li> I have had schick--braun &amp; panasonic foil razors.They all did a decent job but all left long hairs.The 7180 shaves clean-no long hairs left.It is very quiet &amp; a close shave--holds charge for 7 shaves.I am 75 years old &amp; shave daily.This is the best razor I&#x27;ve had to date &amp; recommend it--makes shaving fun</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this razor for about two years now and while it does give me a relatively close and comfortable shave the battery life is starting to show its limited use.  I would charge it for about eight hours and the charge usually lasts for about one shave.   I don&#x27;t even have that heavy a beard, and a shaving session lasts for about three-four minutes.  I&#x27;m guessing that the battery should last longer than two years, but maybe that is normal, I don&#x27;t know.  I will admit that the blades have stayed sharp, but as I&#x27;ve mentioned, I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard which would entail more wear on the cutting blades.  I would like to replace the battery but do not know if replacement batteries are even possible.  It would be a shame to replace the entire razor after two or three years but if this is the norm for Philips/Norelco razors then I will have to consider other brands.</li>
            <li> I was due for a new razor and asked my wife for one as a Christmas gift. She purchased the Norelco7180XL at Sears for about $85.00 thinking it was a good quality razor, which it is. (Still made in Holland as another reviewer wrote). It looked great, and I was excited about the water clean up feature. After an overnight charge, I gave it a test run. It was remarkably light and very quiet, it almost seemed to be running too slow to actually work, but it did a good job of removing my stubble. Just one problem -  It seemed to really abrade my face, which was quite irritated afterwards.  I do have sensitive skin, which is why I don&#x27;t use a standard razor, but I never had this problem with the Braun, or the Remington razors I owned previously. &lt;br /&gt;It states in the users manual that it may take a few weeks to get used to Norelco&#x27;s patented lift &amp; cut system, but I don&#x27;t think I would ever get used to the irritation this razor caused. Call me a pansy, but I had to return the razor, and am now in search of a new Braun model with better ergonomics, and a smooth, painless shave. Just wanted to submit this review as a heads up to anyone else who is contemplating this razor, and has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco Shavers in the past but the 7180XL is definitely the best.  This shaver is extremely light weight, quiet and gives an extremely close/smooth shave. I find that I get 5 days of shaves on one full charge and a full charge takes about 50 minutes to complete. The shaver is also easy to clean using either wet or dry methods. &lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have about the shaver is that no traveling case/pouch holder comes with it to hold the cord,shaver and cleaning brush. Just make sure you keep your old case holder from your previously owned shaver(s). Only time will tell on how this model will hold up. My 4 previous Norelcos have averaged around 5-6 years each.</li>
            <li> Old Norelco broke down after 10 ten years. 7180XL is much lighter and smoother shave. It is stylish and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I had about abandoned hope that I would ever find a suitable replacement for my beloved Norelco Quadra 6886XL that bit the dust.  I tried both the SmartTouch and Arcitec models and they just didn&#x27;t deliver a decent shave for me.  Then I discovered the 7180XL, which uses the same shaving heads as the old Spectra series.  It has given me the same close &amp; comfortable shave that I used to get with the Quadra.  I get 10 shaves on a single charge and my battery low light only comes on about the 9th shave.  Plus it rinses clean with hot tap water - a decided advantage on a busy work morning.  I highly recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li> I bought this in early 2007.  As the reviews said, it is very quiet.  In fact, the actual cutting of my whiskers is louder than the motor.  I can tell if I am done, when I do longer hear my whiskers getting cut.     I have found it does not hold a charge as long as my old unit.  However, that&#x27;s okay, it lasts about a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this new shaver. Holding the shaver vs my old was has been an adjustment but, it&#x27;s a new and different razor.  I like the quietness and speed of the shave.  I wish it had a caring case.[[ASIN:B000FEGUJ6 Philips Norelco 7180XL Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver]]</li>
            <li> This shaver was recommended to me by a friend and on the first day it shaves beautifully. My skin felt very smooth; but, after the next few days my hair growing back caused bumps. I had this problem with other shavers, but never to the extent that occurred using this shaver. I don&#x27;t know why this shaver (which again, originally caused such a smooth shave) would mess up my face so much more than other shavers.    I give this shaver a 3 because I&#x27;m not sure if the shaver&#x27;s the problem or my skin because it works great for my friend. In the end, it might just be me.</li>
            <li> This shaver was a good purchase. It is highly convenient to wash the shaver under the tap and not have to worry about meticulous cleaning. The shaver provides a decent close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought the Philips-Norelco 7180XL to replace a 7 year old Norelco with an on/off switch that was slowly going bad.  The 7180 is so much better, I can&#x27;t believe it.  Of course it&#x27;s sharper because it&#x27;s brand new but it&#x27;s also faster and lighter than my old Norelco.  I highly recommend the 7180XL.</li>
            <li> This was the first electric razor I have ever purchased. I&#x27;ve been using this razor for around 3 months and I don&#x27;t see why I&#x27;d ever need to buy a different model--or switch back to the primitive way of shaving with cream and a razor.     The only downside I faced with this razor is that it took about 3 weeks for my skin to become accustomed to (which they warn you about) so I can&#x27;t really complain considering I was cautioned. It&#x27;s true that you won&#x27;t get as close a shave as you would with the standard cream and razor method, but the time you save (takes me around 3 minutes to get a GOOD shave) and irritation that will become nearly nilled makes this a great buy. Your face will thank you.</li>
            <li> the shaver works fine but it has a few drawbacks from my older model.first the shaver only gives me 4 shaves before recharging,secondly it does not have an indication when to clean the shaver it just shows a red light showing the battery is low.there is no model number on the shaver and I cannot read the serial number when I sent in my warrenty.my previous shaver model 5887XL is superior shaver in quantity of shaves and the workmanship and materials.my shaver model 7180XL is not as easy to clean as my older shaver and there is an indication it needs to be cleaned. it seems that you went downhill on the new model</li>
            <li> I spent several weeks researching to replace my 8 year old Norelco shaver.  I have had norelco shavers for the last 30+ years.  The most frustrating part about researching Norelco shavers is that there are just so many different models.  I finally decided on the 7180XL and I have had it now for a year.  After having Norelco shavers for so long, I know what I need and like.  This new shaver has been good so far but definately not the build quality, or the solid feel of the previous 5825XL, which I have had for the last 8 years.  This new shaver is not as quiet as it was when new, and it takes a bit longer to get a good complete shave, but the shave is decent overall.      The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the loose fitting head.  The battery charge does not last as long as the old shaver, but I really do like cleaning the shaver under the water faucet.  I purchased the shaver from Amazon, no problems.  I would recommend this shaver; it&#x27;s better than most at the price.</li>
            <li> As the recipient of this product (a gift), and as a retiree who only shaved every 3 or so days, I am delighted.  I hadn&#x27;t used an electric razor since college, an old Sunbeam, now a collector&#x27;s item, but I am now clean-shaven every day. I can&#x27;t compare this product to other brands or  models, but this one is a pleasure.</li>
            <li> I have owned two previous Norelco shavers and a couple of other brand electric shavers. After three weeks of using it, this is by far the most comfortable one yet. I am very pleased with the feel of the shaver and the results.</li>
            <li> I am generally happy with my new Norelco 7180XL, it is nice to have a new shaver, it is amazingly quiet, and gives a close and quick shave.    But I feel that Norelco needs to improve both their instruction manual, and their customer support.  Neither of these were in tune with my first experience with the 7180XL, as far as initial charging, and what the green charging light and red low battery light were doing.    The manual calls for a 12 hour initial charge before using the shaver.  When fully charged, the green light is supposed to blink.  Well, on my initial charge, the light started blinking after 30 minutes.  I did continue the charge for 12 hours anyway, the green light blinking the whole time.    I called Norelco support, and was informed the manual was not correct, and that I had not damaged my shaver by completing the 12 hour charge.  But no further explanation.    Then I started using the shaver, and after just 2 shaves, the red low battery light came on.  I went back to the Norelco website, and found a page on charging that said if the shaver did that, you should use it until the motor stops.  They omit the obvious next step of charging it in these instructions, but say you will have no problem with the red light coming on too soon after following their directions.    Well, I have done that, and it remains to be seen if my new Norelco will eventually sort itself out and work right.    I must say I have my doubts after this initial experience, that it will last as long as my 7 year old model 5841XL did.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for about 40 years, and never had any problems like this.</li>
            <li> For years I had a Norelco razor and when it broke (beyond repair) I decided to try a Remmington.  Bad, bad, bad mistake!  After three months of poor shaves and tender, red skin (razor burn) I bought a Norelco 7180. My skin no longer looks razor burned, I get a close shave (no need to \\&quot;touch-up\\&quot; before we go out in the evening) and the razor is very quiet, no loud buzzing sound.</li>
            <li> I purchased my 7180XL in October, 2007.  The rechargeable battery is just now (April, 2012) beginning to fail as it only holds a charge long enough for four to five shaves.  The 7180XL shaves closer &#x27;wet&#x27; than dry.  I will buy another 7180XL.</li>
            <li> I have previously used Norelco shavers because they were the only ones I could find that gave me a good shave without much irritation. I needed a new one and decided to try the 7180XL. But it is nothing like the earlier models I have used. After trying it a few times I found that it gives me a major case of skin irritation every time. I tried using a light touch, but the results were the same. I&#x27;ll have to donate this one and try to find new heads for my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this razor but he didn&#x27;t realize it was water rinsable He didn&#x27;t particularly care for that feature, but it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco electric shavers since 1960.  This is the worst model I have had.  It does not hold a charge for more than 3 shaves.  I like the fact that it can be rinsed  clean is the only good thing I can say about it.  I have had it about 2 yrs. as compared to the others I have owned and all of the others have lasted longer. I went to buy replacement heads and it was over $31 dollars.  I decided to replace the shaver instead.  I just bought the norelco 7810xl and will try it within the next day or two..  I wish I could give the razor a 0 due to the fact I have been shaving with the plug in for the past several  months.</li>
            <li> Very light electric razor.  Cuts shaving time from 10 minutes down to 3 minutes.  So a charge for 30 minutes of shaving time easily lasts a week.  When running it is as quiet as an old fashioned blade.  Does a great job very quickly and smoothly.  You don&#x27;t need anything more.</li>
