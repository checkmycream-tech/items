            <li>: A wonderful skin moisturizer!</li>
            <li>The best way to ensure even coverage is to apply a dime sized amount to hands and dot in five places on your face: forehead, nose, each cheek, and chin, then spread evenly over each area of the skin one by one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful to find a product that works and doesn&#x27;t break the bank and 100% guarantee.</li>

            <li>&#x27;Retinol Serum&#x27; by Body Merry was introduced to me, through an exclusive extereme discount, to try and review honestly.</li>
            <li>Im thrilled to have tried it.</li>
            <li>Not only does it feel GREAT on my face but it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>My opinion is 100% my own.</li>
            <li>It has been keeping my face looking hydrated and rejuvenated and I am loving it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So for a retinol abuser, me, this has been the safest yet still effective retinol</li>
            <li>This is a very good product and you feel the results right away.  </li>
            <li>it smooth&#x27;s fine lines and give your skin a lovely glow!!!</li>
            <li>I saw a remarkable difference in the fine lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who is in need of a great serum that won&#x27;t irritate your face!</li>
            <li>I find that retinol serums are among the handful of products that make a difference for my skin (along with vitamin C serum, Hyaluronic Acid, a good mild exfoliant and a good sunscreen).</li>
            <li>Merry 2.5% Retinol Serum is great for helping reduce fine lines and I really love it for evening out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>It goes on nice with a very light pleasant scent it easily coats your skin</li>
            <li>It is priced very fair, &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; free, and a natural/organic product, which has become increasingly important for my skin.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This product has a watery yet gel consistency that glides on very easily.</li>
            <li>This serum is awesome so far!</li>
            <li>I look forward to more products from Body Merry, the more the merrier!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light weight, and feels nice on.</li>
            <li>This serum helps to  reduce fine lines and wrinkles and provide superior hydration leaving your face baby</li>
            <li>Retinols can also increase sun sensitivity so it is important to wear a good sunscreen during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice but need more time to see if it works</li>
            <li>I did benefit this product for free in exchange of my fair review.</li>
            <li>This is a 2.5% Retinol Serum, nice and potent.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, and you get good results.</li>
            <li>I would like to continue using it to see what kind of results I get with more time and not doubling it up with the cream.</li>
            <li>Even an old gent needs to look his best you know!</li>
            <li>Love this serum makes my skin feel amazing</li>
            <li>I will say that I have quite good skin, but at 70, I was noticing the wrinkles around my mouth and chin were becoming much more noticeable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to apply morning or night as you can layer your moisturizer and makeup right over</li>
            <li>but at a much better price point and with much more effective ingredients.</li>
            <li>Using this product has been amazing and I am so grateful I was offered to try this free and review this for my HONEST opinion.</li>
            <li>Very nice serum , they ask you to leave a review right after you receive the product</li>
            <li>Love this product very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant refreshing cool feel.</li>
            <li>I did appreciate the seller contacting me prior to beginning using it to insure the best results, that was really nice to have more information</li>
            <li>At first, I wondered if there was any retinol at all in the serum because I experienced no redness or dryness.</li>
            <li>It works great, you can see the difference from the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>I had large pores in my face but after two times of using it my pores SHRUNK!!!!</li>
            <li>The Pro A Serum is a retinol serum which means something very important.</li>
            <li>Very cheap too but works for my skin.</li>
            <li>If there is one, it&#x27;s very light and not unpleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>like this serum as it seems mild (meaning it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin) and seems to have good quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>The texture is nice and it absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>The serum has a nice consistency and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the very quick delivery - one day! - and the considerate concern and personal follow-up of the store owner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>To my happy surprise my skin has responded positively to it.  </li>
            <li>That is completely normal and a good sign that it is working!</li>
            <li>So when I was given the opportunity to try their Hyaluronic Acid free in return for an honest product review I jumped at the opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty happy to try the Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li>This Pro- A Serum is said to be highly effective in diminishing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I put it on with another oil (argan) so that it covers more of my face.  </li>
            <li>Love the feel of my skin when I put this on.</li>
            <li>What I love about this is that it contains more than just retinol.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll notice your skin retains moisture better and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Retinol: Also known as Vitamin A, Retinol is an amazing antioxidant, so it helps fight free radical damage which increases collagen production and makes the skin look more youthful.</li>

            <li>your favorite moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Apply sunscreen</li>
            <li>I received this product free to try, but ALL opinions are my own*</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my skin and</li>
            <li>I found that most people would recommend for my age group - sunscreen (more than spf 15), retinol cream, and a serum.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Which is ok</li>
            <li>(Which is ok, I am not worried about them, more worried about the acne).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>am also doing this while changing my eating habits to eat more veg/fruit/less meat..</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Most people say that I look about 50.</li>
            <li>I love that it addresses acne as well as aging signs.</li>
            <li>I love these products</li>
            <li>They provide excellent service and I will definitely keep using their products.</li>
            <li>My makeup even seemed to stay on better throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Would have been better off using mashed banana on face every day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok though.</li>
            <li>only used for a couple weeks now - but of all the serums i have tried i think this is the best.</li>
            <li>Love the serum.  </li>
            <li>So so glad I found this product.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to write a review to give it more time.</li>
            <li>So glad to have to spend an arm and leg for my body regime.</li>
            <li>and I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a guy, I&#x27;m in a distinct minority but in my work having a good complexion and aging</li>
            <li>I love the texture of this product, non-greasy and non-allergenic.</li>
            <li>great product (already seeing results) and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have been so pleased with Body Merry&#x27;s Pro-A Serum.  </li>
            <li>What I absolutely love is that this comes in a generous sized bottle and is dispensed using an eye-dropper.  </li>
            <li>Love how it has moisturizer my skin.</li>
            <li>His results would be more drastic than mine</li>
            <li>and I love his one and so does my husband. :</li>

            <li>I bought this as I wasn&#x27;t sure the Body</li>
            <li>Love this serum.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok because I use an eye gel afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m told I would get better benefits of I used a derma roller.</li>
            <li>I love my routine and have had many compliments since using these products.</li>
            <li>:) My skin is acne prone and combination dry/oily.</li>
            <li>After one night, my skin looked and felt suppler and more radiant.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I do put a moisturizer on top after it</li>
            <li>I really love the way my skin feels now, and can&#x27;t wait to see the results in time.  </li>
            <li>I Love this serum....</li>
            <li>I use it at night mostly, but anytime I wash my face (night time or before makeup application)</li>
            <li>I bought this about 2 weeks ago &amp; love it.  </li>
            <li>but I see now why people love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I am 68 and this is a helpful and safe product.  </li>
            <li>but my skin looks a bit more radiant.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this serum.  </li>
            <li>Body Merry is like a magic potion on my skin.  </li>
            <li>And I love that it is more gel-like than a runny liquid</li>
            <li>I purchased the product I have received 2 emails from the owner making sure I was satisfied and offering to answer any questions I may have...who does that</li>
            <li>I always confirm she has zero wrinkles :)</li>
            <li>My wife has been using this serum and she loves it we purchased 2 more because she swears by this product.</li>
            <li>Love Body</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of their Products</li>
            <li>I figure if the serum works for tightening that area of skin it must be helping elsewhere! :)</li>
            <li>(Why do so many of these serums feel sticky?)</li>
            <li>She is pleased too - and will buy it again.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and I intend to reorder.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Has noticed some effects on mostly the softness of skin.</li>
            <li>I lOVE the way it makes my skin look and</li>
            <li>Retinal serums are one of the most evidence based ways to reduce fines lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Will buy again ehen I need more.</li>

            <li>It leaves your skin more radiant.</li>
            <li>I am a Grandma who is never mistaken for one:)</li>
            <li>I really think this is a great way to preserve my skin from aging.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best facial products with retinol out there.</li>
            <li>This formula has 2.5% which is what is suggested by most studies-</li>
            <li>any more it burns, more it maybe doesn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>I love using the Body Merry Pro-A Serum at night.</li>
            <li>My makeup even stays on better.</li>
            <li>so I could get the most benefit from the serum.</li>
            <li>It dries immediately which I love since I like to layer my skincare.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this serum.</li>
            <li>and this is just one more that I have reviewed to share with you by the company Body Merry.</li>
            <li>The reason I bought this product was that I am highly satisfied whit</li>
            <li>I love this product and wil be ordering bottle number two in a month or so.  </li>
            <li>I love this serum.</li>
            <li>Feels silky smooth, not greasy!</li>
            <li>but I feel so much more confident without make up now.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I swear I have been getting sooooo many compliments on the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was really impressed that the founder of the company took such an interest in how my skin was responding to the serum.  </li>
            <li>I have seen some fading for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this serum</li>
            <li>I also thought my skin seemed to have a more healthy appearance.  </li>
            <li>Nice chemical free serum.</li>
            <li>I was given a free sample in order to review this item but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>Love this company&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>received for free, but my opinion is my own.</li>
            <li>My skin is brighter, tighter and skin tone more even.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really pleased  </li>
            <li>The tone of my skin is brighter and more even.  </li>
            <li>and i love Body Merry products.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this for my 50+ face.</li>
            <li>After a week of use, I noticed my skin is a lot softer, and my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li>This product was free but soley my own opinion.</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks, it does appear that my skin looks healthier and more refined with a mor blended look.</li>
            <li>Do not try it for more than a month with no results since you can&#x27;t get a refund after 30 days.</li>
            <li>This is the second product I have purchased from Body Merry and must say that I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
            <li>I reviewed this product for I love to review.</li>
            <li>My face feels &amp; looks better</li>
            <li>Does it get any better than that?  </li>
            <li>I love BodyMerry’s Retinol Serum because unlike some anti aging products, it never dries my face.</li>
            <li>but glad I did.</li>
            <li>I apply this at night too, and in the morning my skin looks even better than when I went to bed.</li>
            <li>I am able to go without makeup once again.  </li>
            <li>In love</li>
            <li>And not an overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li>I just want people to know how great this stuff is so far!!!</li>
            <li>It applies easily ,has a great smooth texture and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>The two of us have decided that we have found our &amp;#34;potion.&amp;#34;  This serum is gentle but very effective.  </li>
            <li>Loving this very easy and worth while product.  </li>
            <li>, so I was very excited to try a Retinol product.</li>
            <li>, so I was very excited to try a Retinol product.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I got a special deal on it and am very happy so far update used a week</li>
            <li>First day of application I experienced light burning for about 5 minutes, but not anymore.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin and is perfect for anyone that has sensitive skin since it&#x27;s formulated with organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>It smells great, goes on easily and is absolute perfection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The great American adage of &amp;#34;The more, the better!&amp;#34;, does not apply here!</li>
            <li>Retinol is awesome, but it can irritate your skin and take a long time to see results.</li>
            <li>It is considered one of the best antioxidants, which means it finds and destroys free radicals, which are basically the &amp;#34;aging cells&amp;#34; in our body that scavenge and multiply, taking over healthy cells and accelerating the aging process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to get it to spread evenly and when used with the Derma Roller it works even better, allowing it to seep under the skin where it will do the most good.</li>
            <li>this is my honest review of this product, if you are hesitating or have any kind of doubt please be assure that this Retinol Serum is everything, I can&#x27;t say or put enough words in here to describe to good in this product ...</li>
            <li>Not much of a scent to this serum, very light at best.</li>
            <li>I have noticed significant changes with my skin’s appearance – which explains why I am hooked on this product!</li>
            <li>It feels nice on my skin and all around a great product I definitely recommend this product to everyone!!</li>
            <li>I had very fine laugh wrinkles growing around my eyes which I started to notice more and more.</li>
            <li>I have a new favorite face product!!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have any fine lines or wrinkles but even so my skin looked amazingly better using this product.</li>
            <li>It works best on a clean face and  use with consistancy on a daily regimen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil most closely resembles your skin’s natural sebum, so it works very well at hydrating, and best of all it won’t clog your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face feels great, so far.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use, but so far, quite happy with this.</li>

            <li>The solution is a perfect gel that has a slight tint and is easily portioned out by the dropper.</li>
            <li>have not seen a drastic reduction in fine lines or wrinkles, but retinol isn&#x27;t something that works immediately.</li>
            <li>This is why it is best to leave your skin slightly damp after thoroughly cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in the fine lines at the corner of my eyes.</li>
            <li>I also started seeing fine wrinkles under my eyes - again something I never had before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the product about a week and have noticed some changes in the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s progress on fine lines, too.</li>
            <li>My fine lines are diminished and my skin glows.  </li>
            <li>I noticed it reduced fine lines within the week.</li>
            <li>This retinol serum reduced my wrinkles, fine lines and spots, and improved the softness my skin.</li>
            <li>Made my skin softer and improved the look of fine lines</li>
            <li>This is a 2.5% Retinol pro-A serum used to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>After a couple week, my skin appeared lighter and some of my fine lines were not as noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I see the fine lines have minimized.</li>
            <li>This stuff helps reduce the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>The smell is nearly non-existent but pleasant what there is of it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a considerable difference in the size of my pores (which I was hoping would be a pleasant side effect)</li>
            <li>I am truly amazed at how quickly it has worked!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and outstanding customer service!  </li>
            <li>After a couple of days, I noticed my laugh lines were fading and the fine lines by my eyes were diminishing as well!</li>
            <li>Its a light serum, I hope it works fine on my face</li>
            <li>Fine lines have diminished and it makes my skin feel smooth and silky without a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>I hope to see an improvement in fine lines but for now I am comfortable in using it every night.</li>
            <li>Love this whole product line!!  </li>
            <li>I honestly think it doesn&#x27;t do much for the fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>So I cannot see a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That is a huge huge thing for me.</li>
            <li>Great product that works well with my current moisturizer and fantastic service.</li>
            <li>After just a week I noticed a huge difference in the firmness of my skin and diminished lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference.</li>

            <li>This serum by Body Merry has 3 very powerful components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This serum is very powerful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased that I have not had any reactions to the serum because my skin is normally very sensitive.</li>
            <li>it look more vibrant for sure and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been following it with a normal moisturizer, and have seen my one super-terrible wrinkle become somewhat less-pronounced, and I can feel it working in my lips if I apply it there, but it&#x27;s not going to un-puff your eyes and make your skin flawless and smooth.</li>
            <li>so it is generally believed to be more effective to use before bedtime.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, dries quickly and is not &#x27;sticky&#x27;.</li>
            <li>First off I have to say that I LOVE that Body Mary doesn&#x27;t test of animals.</li>

            <li>I know they try hard to please their customers by making the best product they can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>/&gt;You can read my full review at hopesbeautybar.com</li>
            <li>Overall, for the money a good product if care is taken with use.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week</li>
            <li>Chose a collagen peptide for the am and a sweet potato moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>, it leaves my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>No bad smell and no side effects.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product.</li>
            <li>#34;I can not wait until I see the full results in a month.&amp;#34; I am happy to see she has been happy with the product since it is going to be difficult to find the right product.</li>
            <li>This serum goes on smoothly, soaking right into my skin.  </li>
            <li>Its light, not sticky and absorbs right into the skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good product and I feel good using it as it does not have artificial ingredients</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in this product for wrinkles or fine lines, I&#x27;d recommend using it for 10-12 weeks before deciding whether it works for you or not.</li>
            <li>With Body Merry Pro-A Serum, you see results quickly.</li>
            <li>your skin tone starts evening out quickly.</li>
            <li>product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it</li>
            <li>I will keep up using this product and only expect results to be better n better.</li>
            <li>Although serums can often be oily this one absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving oil or a sticky residue - so ladies</li>
            <li>but because I knew Joey would get much better results than I would, being he is 13 years older than me.  </li>
            <li>With the 2.5% retinol, Hyaluronic acid, and green tea, while the Serum is absorbing to get this awesome feeling of freshness.</li>
            <li>Retinol Serum to anyone looking to great real and lasting results from their products.</li>
            <li>Dries rather quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely mildly hydrating.</li>
            <li>it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have only used the product for two weeks, so have not noticed any permanent changes yet, but will continue to use it as the skin feels nice and smooth after use.</li>
            <li>and I have to get like super close to the mirror…</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>and it absorbs quickly and is non-sticky,</li>
            <li>and it dries quick.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly</li>
            <li>I got the package quickly too.</li>
            <li>The serum is not sticky and absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I apply this at night and it absorbs rather quickly and does not feel oily or sticky which I had feared.</li>
            <li>for what it&#x27;s worth I highly recommend this product and can honestly say it did what I was hoping it would, just short of miraculously making fine lines go away :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleanse your skin as your normally would &amp; pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;Apply your favorite toner&lt;br /&gt;apply</li>
            <li>This is great for evening your  skin tone and reducing dark spots and acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in a dark bottle which is great for any retinol product.</li>
            <li>First use leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big anti aging aficionado because I believe that it’s never too early to take really good care of your skin using anti aging products!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing serum all by itself but to add body merry&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum takes it to a whole new level!  </li>
            <li>Less wrinkles and firmer jawline skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>Their wasn&#x27;t really a smell to it and my skin soaked up the Serum very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have now tried 4 different products in the Body Merry line but this is definitely my favorite!</li>
            <li>What more could a 56 year old ask for?!?</li>
            <li>I love Love every single drop of it</li>
            <li>I have been using a little over a month and have for sure noticed that the fine lines around my eyes have softened, and my skin looks brighter and more youthful.  </li>
            <li>I have for sure noticed a reduction in fine lines, especially on my forehead.</li>
            <li>At 57 my skin was looking really dull, did some research and most sources recommended a good retinol.</li>
            <li>I read other reviews before purchasing and am happy that the positive review turned out to be correct.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid is an amazing moisturizing ingredient that will absorb the water around it, pulling that moisture deep into the pores.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my skin and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>It absorbs really fast and I feel my skin is tighter and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give an update in a few weeks and let you know if I&#x27;m still happy with this product.</li>
            <li>A truly fantastic product I&#x27;d highly recommend to everyone who cares about their skin!</li>
            <li>Having my face fully hydrated all day is such an amazing feeling.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review.</li>
            <li>Make sure to avoid the sensitive eye area, as well as the nostrils, ears, and mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not sure where this holy stuff in a bottle come from but it iz #BEAUTIFUL.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer I put on top of it also absorbed and my face felt so soft.  </li>
            <li>have only been using this serum for four days, but I am so happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it</li>
            <li>I was offered this product for testing and evaluation purposes; the feedback provided is solely based on my own personal use and opinions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seller actually reached out to inquire about efficacy of product which to me was more important than anything else.</li>
            <li>love how soft it makes my face.</li>
            <li>Most moisturizers make me break out - even at 70 years old.  </li>
            <li>I just resently got this product, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the retinol serum but the retinol moisturizer did not really do much</li>
            <li>Worth trying..</li>
            <li>skin.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was given the Body Merry Pro-A Serum complimentary for review purposes.</li>
            <li>So far I love this product.</li>
            <li>This serum is quickly absorbed and adds to the softness of my skin.</li>
            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;</li>
            <li>All I can say is I love the fact that its all natural  </li>
            <li>Simple and effective.  </li>
            <li>Love the results so far; I started using this just under a month ago</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with this serum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product twice/day and have been pleased so far.</li>
            <li>love the result so far.</li>
            <li>I love the results so far and can&#x27;t wait to see what is to come.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin though, but I can&#x27;t imagine many people would have a problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just dab plenty of this on my face and it becomes kind of stiff, which is what I think people with more wrinkles are looking for.</li>
            <li>Serum is light and easily absorbed and has not irritated my super sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>I have tried other Vitamin A products and none of them have felt as good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Just havent really noticed a significant improvement as of yet</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and was concerned I potentially could have a negative reaction to the strength; I&#x27;m happy to report nothing to report but great results.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs right away</li>
            <li>right now  </li>
            <li>Recommended to my friend, and she has positive feedback also!</li>
            <li>Immediately upon the first use my skin was noticeably softer, and after using this product for a couple weeks my skin is incredibly soft and smooth, it is also quite a bit brighter!</li>
            <li>Immediately upon the first use my skin was noticeably softer, and after using this product for a couple weeks my skin is incredibly soft and smooth, it is also quite a bit brighter!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this isn&#x27;t a recommended action.  </li>
            <li>Retinol is a very strong topical derivative of Vitamin A.</li>
            <li>Within just a few days the fine lines are disappearing, and I love the fact that its made in the USA quality and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>like the natural scent, and the smooth feel of the skin after the product absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>With the positive changes I&#x27;ve been having so far, I can&#x27;t wait to continue using this combo together to see even better looking skin.</li>
            <li>Still, other serums I&#x27;ve tried have caused splotchiness and breakouts, and this one only makes things better, so this is definitely the best choice.</li>
            <li>so I will see how great my skin will look in a few weeks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure, but it makes my wife&#x27;s face look great.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this item to help smooth some of the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>works even better and does not dry out my skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m typically suspicious of serums, but this feels good.</li>
            <li>Wife thinks it really works to smooth away wrinkles - asked me to try it, and it really does seem to help.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also very allergic and sensitive to many products, this one didn&#x27;t give any allergies.  </li>
            <li>That kind of personal touch is really valuable when ordering skin products online, instead of buying at a skin boutique.  </li>
            <li>if the price were always this reasonable, I&lt;br /&gt;would be a faithful and loyal customer.</li>
            <li>Its nice to find a product that is reasonably priced and will actually give you results.  </li>
            <li>my previous experience with this company-very good customer treatment.</li>
            <li>I wanted a product to improve the flaws on my face giving me a more youthful look and reduce those laugh lines around my mouth and especially  around and under my eyes.</li>
            <li>and these all are such wonderful non harsh skin products.</li>
            <li>It did not make my skin feel oily, but rather, very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I used the serum the first night, and I immediately noticed that it absorbed completely, and my face felt so smooth.  </li>
            <li>This serum is smooth, not heavy, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and WORKS!</li>
            <li>Both products are made in the USA, cruelty free, natural and organic!</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
            <li>Very gentle to use.</li>
            <li>I like the product very much.</li>
            <li>Left my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>Items arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>my face got all cahapped and this repaired it in 5 days and the price is very reasonable</li>
            <li>However, after a month of using this (directly followed by a moisturizer) I can tell my skin is tighter and my fine lines are reduced.</li>
            <li>You work hard to make us happy</li>
            <li>you must use SPF 30 or higher at day.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>and I complimented her on how pretty her face was.</li>
            <li>We are now both big fans of body merry products and will continue with more of their products in the future!&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>Also be sure to wear sunscreen daily regardless of the weather, this will prevent any sunburns and sunspots!vorite</li>
            <li>Also be sure to wear sunscreen daily regardless of the weather, this will prevent any sunburns and sunspots!</li>
            <li>use my toner first, then I put on this retinol serum and then apply my Aveeno night</li>
            <li>Does exactly  what it says it makes my skin glow</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>After the first day, I had friends comment</li>
            <li>and I know how it important it is to start early on your anti-aging skin regime.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received so many compliments after using this product it works and it makes my skin extra smooth and soft</li>
            <li>FIRST OFF</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a while now, and can confidently say that not only are the wrinkles being kept at bay</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this Retinol Serum to anyone looking to great real and lasting results from their products.</li>
            <li>The first ingredient is water.  </li>
            <li>I just love the feel of my face since starting the serum.</li>
            <li>I have started the C first, and have added this now, for 3 days.  </li>
            <li>I put it on first, let it soak into my skin, then I also use Body Merry&#x27;s eye cream (</li>
            <li>I use it daily &amp; love the results it has given me.</li>
            <li>but most people guess my age to be 10+ years younger.  </li>
            <li>Its my first bottle but</li>
            <li>I have not had a problem with this, and saw a visible difference within the first week of use.  </li>
            <li>This is my first bottle</li>
            <li>Product exactly as advertised and on time...</li>
            <li>, my fine lines are less noticeable and my complexion is more even toned.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend This light weight product that does not clog pores!</li>
            <li>but this bottle looks like it will last 6 months, maybe more.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for myself,  the first time..</li>
            <li>I really like this Retinol Serum!</li>
            <li>Thats why I like about this serum it absorbed fast.</li>
            <li>It could only get better with use.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin evenly toned, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a short trial, I was able to see results of improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>I  am now in my 2nd week of using this product and have so far been very pleased with how my skin feels after I apply.</li>
            <li>Still on the first bottle..........so I can not say whether it&#x27;s doing anything or not.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a product junkie and have used pretty much everything out there from prescription, to the highest end to basic coconut oil on my face and this serum is a seriously great product and a steal for what it actually does.</li>
            <li>At first my skin was getting used to this product</li>
            <li>, my skin overall looks better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really lightweight and is easily absorbed and can be worn under make-up.  </li>
            <li>However,  I am PLEASED to say that this product has definitely  made me a believer again.</li>
            <li>I did take before and after pictures  that I will post after I finish my first bottle.</li>
            <li>First I tone with rosewater</li>
            <li>I had noticible results after the first 5 days of using it.</li>
            <li>and I love that they do different things.</li>
            <li>I bought two bottles on my first purchase, to save on the shipping,  I gave one to my daughter.  </li>
            <li>The first thing that struck me was the pretty bottle that the serum came in.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I did was read the directions.  </li>
            <li>I find better results by applying the serum before bedtime under my regular night cream (ROC Multi-Correction cream).</li>
            <li>I have not noticed a decease in wrinkles yet (I am 34 and don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles, more of surface wrinkles that appear when I smile/laugh).</li>
            <li>I found this serum by searching on Amazon for similar products and I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I noticed results after using it for over 2 weeks consistently.</li>
            <li>Love this product, I am 48 and starting to see the sagging and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It is my first time using a retinal serum and &#x27;Retinal Serum&#x27; by Body Merry has worked well for me and for my fresher,brighter complection.</li>
            <li>Thanks Body Merry!</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I cannot speak to the anti-wrinkle properties of this product as I bought it primarily to address my adult acne and dullness of complexion.  </li>
            <li>I am so used to retinol products that I know the signs, the creases of the nose and the corner of my mouth are the first to get hit.  </li>
            <li>After reading the positive reviews and finding the price very reasonable I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>I dont have that tight feeling as I did when I used just the retinol, so using my light moisturizer afterwards is much better than feeling like I have to apply a heavier moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, if the quality is decent or if it really works if half of the reviews were for people making a review because they were ask for it, because they got it for free.</li>
            <li>I could quickly and easily put a few drops around on my face and it absorbed quickly leaving no trace or residue</li>
            <li>didnt see any significant difference at all...may be its too early</li>
            <li>, after a month, I can really say that my skin looks better the next day after using it, I really like it !</li>
            <li>I have been using this product on my face and neck twice a day for a few weeks and it has absolutely made my skin bright</li>
            <li>/&gt;The serum itself is a thick gel consistency which I personally love because it doesn’t run all over the place and spill, but it is still absorbed very quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>I think this is better than Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair at half the price; I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>have not used it regularly for a whole month yet, more on and off for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>In just 2 week my complexion is so much brighter, more even skin tone and pore look much smaller.  </li>
            <li>This serum absorbs quickly and my skin always feels very soft and well hydrated after I put this on.</li>
            <li>Cost $150 for high quality organic ingredients but will give me 20 bottles worth of product.</li>
            <li>no more dry skin + very happy skin</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a long time user of Roc and decided to try a more organic solution...</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much difference in the first day or two, of using it once a day, at night.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>In less then a month I have my skin in a condition where I don&#x27;t have to wear makeup as it looks flawless, radiant from inside and generally 10 years younger.</li>
            <li>The consistency is gel-like so it is easy to apply and you only need to use 2-3 drops.</li>
            <li>She said most her coworkers are using it with moisturizer after so they don&#x27;t have dry skin while flying.</li>
            <li>This serum made my skin feel super soft &amp; youthful looking.</li>
            <li>I have mild rosacea and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised at the quick improvement in the texture and tone of my face.</li>
            <li>The first one was halfway filled,  and the second one was filed all the way,  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super gentle since my skin can be a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li>It did eliminate some fine lines and reduce the size of larger wrinkles.</li>
            <li>First the fact that you are getting 2.5% retinol Professional grade retinol!!  </li>
            <li>Been using under my moisturizers and oils day and night for about a month now and can see a huge difference in my overall skin tone, texture, firmness and moisture level!</li>
            <li>smooth skin + acne scars gone much smaller +</li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking of the gel-like consistency, this serum really melts into your skin.</li>
            <li>All you need is a pea-sized bead on your finger to apply to your whole face.</li>
            <li>This has eyedropper lids so you never need to worry about pouring out too much product.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, every [body merry] product I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try has simply been fantastic and I recommend this brand to everyone looking for a quality skincare</li>
            <li>Retinol can also help diminish the look of wrinkles, sun spots, and acne scars by gently exfoliating the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that is the high point for me!</li>
            <li>my make-up goes on soooo much smoother now.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>My face feels much smoother as result.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave much of a residue.</li>

            <li>Save your money with the 100 dollar Serums this is all natural and it works!!!</li>
            <li>and it was like WOW!!!</li>
            <li>This is such a pretty bottle too I must say!!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>It stood out from other products I have used by doing a superior job of moisturizing and softening my skin, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I love the thick, rich serum.</li>
            <li>My usage has been more consistent because it&#x27;s gentle enough for daily use.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other products by Body Merry and am usually pleased with this brand.</li>
            <li>It feels great on the skin and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and pretty much anything with too much of anything</li>
            <li>This brand blends it with some other skin healthy items.</li>
            <li>It works better than the other serums I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I did notice a bit of drying which was more than the other serum.</li>
            <li>I use it daily after toning my clean skin and then applying moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>But when you put it on your clean face, you actually feel some tightning.</li>
            <li>I have recently had the pleasure of enjoying sampling many new face products this past week</li>
            <li>on my chest right below my neck and as I would smooth the serum down my neck I would also use it on that area.  </li>
            <li>The serum is very soft and thick so it feels good</li>
            <li>Used it for a few days so far and my skin feels more toned, tighter, and looks healthier already!</li>
            <li>The serum is a watery gel texture and will feel much like water or tears on your face when to apply it, this is completely normal.  </li>
            <li>The Hyaluronic Serum is one product that I can’t live without!</li>
            <li>Fabulous, long lasting, powerful Retinol Serum that really gives results.</li>
            <li>I think I need to use less to really love it.</li>
            <li>Green tea is just as good for you on the outside as it is on the inside.</li>
            <li>Retinol is proven to continue working well after 12 weeks, so this will definitely be a main</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m mainly using it for preventative purposes and to help with my congested skin.</li>
            <li>It does a better job of moisturizing than more expensive products.</li>
            <li>I started using this serum about a month ago without any particular skin concerns in mind, just hoping to enhance my complexion before my wedding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an older woman (66)</li>
            <li>My acne scars I had on my face have lightened and lightened and finally are super unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>My friends can&#x27;t figure out what&#x27;s different, and they keep telling me I look the same &amp;#34;but different&amp;#34;. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Personally, I use 6 total drops for my face, neck &amp; d&amp;eacute;colletage/cleavage followed by another natural/organic product containing argan stem cell &amp; 2% chlorella growth factor (I attribute both products to my much better skin.)  </li>
            <li>Since they are organic and made without being used and tested on animals that is a super big bonus as well!  </li>
            <li>Ok so I decided to try this for 2 months (actually 50 days close enough) before explaining how I feel about it.</li>
            <li>The ingredient which gives the skin a plump and vibrant look is the hylauronic acid.</li>
            <li>Afraid that I might jinx it, but really impressed with this product so far.  </li>
            <li>Not overly thin, absorbs quickly, and very easy to spread.</li>
            <li>My skin positively glows and it feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>I noticed considerable positive changes in my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this a 4 even though it is an early review because (1) I am seeing some positive changes in my skin, (2)</li>
            <li>normally do not write reviews unless whatever im reviewing is justified to do so...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Retinol Serum.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Body Merry as a vendor and I highly recommend Body Merry&#x27;s Retinol Serum.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li>I believe I notice a difference in the plumpness and softness of my skin, although it is not as intense and immediately noticeable as with the Hyaluronic Acid and Green Tea morning Dew from Body Merry which is my new favorite face product in my regimen.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product because it has green tea, which is a powerful antioxidant.</li>
            <li>Will have to use a little longer to see how well it changes firmness but love the way it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li>My niece, without any prodding from me, mentioned that my skin looked a little better.</li>
            <li>However, I noticed a few months ago that I started having some lines coming from the corner of my mouth toward the sides of my chin - something that I have see in many women my age and older.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this serum for that long, but so far seems to help the fine lines go away.</li>
            <li>apply it in the evening to clean, dry skin.</li>
            <li>Plus, I like that it is natural, doesn&#x27;t sting, and is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I am really surprised at the reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely dissatisfied with this product...doesn&#x27;t seem to have made any difference, and I&#x27;ve officially used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>so the treatment shouldn&#x27;t clear it up too much overnite either!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin is very refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li>Got this as a promotion, really like it so far - been using it just before bedtime.</li>
            <li>The acne areas are just not getting angry anymore, so the Body Merry Pro-A Serum is sort of like a happy pill for my face.</li>
            <li>I will update as time goes on for a long-term report on the results obtained, but so far, I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would almost call it a gel-serum because it doesn&#x27;t have the normal consistency of a serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>received one the products mentioned above complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>Green tea will help build collagen which will result in more plump youthful looking</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling fresh and renewed.</li>
            <li>I also like that it comes in a dark colored bottle (important for retinols and really any serum).</li>
            <li>Saw no changes and bottle was not filled to top.</li>
            <li>After trying several products and pretty much giving up hope of finding one that would help</li>
            <li>She said she can definitely see an improvement in her skin tone, her face feels fresh</li>
            <li>Then I do my normal makeup routine.</li>
            <li>The skin appears to be more firm around my cheekbones and eyes as well as my complexion being clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Switched to this serum from the normal serum I had been using.</li>
            <li>and i love green tea.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is infused with Green Tea, not tested on animals and is made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>I love how this makes my skin feel,,have been using it for a few days and</li>
            <li>After putting more on that spot I think my skin doesn&#x27;t flake off the pigment anymore, instead it stays a pale brownish color.</li>
            <li>One drop for left side of face/neck and one drop for the right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for one month, and I can see an improvement in my skin, it does seem to tighten up the lines, &amp; the tightest of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;However I really haven&#x27;t seem too much improvement on my sun spots which is my main concern.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Retinoids are actually parts of Vitamin A that unclog pores and boost collagen making wrinkles and fine line visibly smaller.</li>
            <li>But I primarily use this one in the morning in a combo with other creams.</li>
            <li>I was able to notice the difference in few days where the fine lines were diminish and pores where less visible.</li>
            <li>I am a licensed Esthetician, so I do facials etc all day, and I get compliments on my skin every day which is something new for me.</li>
            <li>I am a licensed Esthetician, so I do facials etc all day, and I get compliments on my skin every day which is something new for me.</li>
            <li>noticed that after I have put this serum on my new acne, after a day or two the acne would disappear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to this serum.  </li>
            <li>(I have a new baby, so I basically look like the crypt keeper).</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>product treats wrinkles, fine lines, discolorations or dark spots, as well as acne blemishes.</li>
            <li>Its not as thick as it looks, its actually more of a gel and sticks to the bottle really well.</li>
            <li>using a Retinol Product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol is an exfoliating ingredient, meaning it will constantly reveal soft, fresh skin.</li>
            <li>using a Retinol Product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol is an exfoliating ingredient, meaning it will constantly reveal soft, fresh skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many serums and spent big dollars with no visible results.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to find any kind of  &#x27;miracle&#x27; product, but I have noticed subtle improvement around my eyes and on my hands.</li>
            <li>Of course any product that offers wrinkle and line diminishing takes more than just a few weeks of use to fully notice those results.  </li>
            <li>My reason for purchasing this product was two fold - i wanted to see if using a product that had the added Hyaluronic Acid would tame down the retinol that I have found dries my skin and also I was impressed with the other reviews who gave this a high review.</li>
            <li>Good product if you have skin issues and your skin is not sensitive ...harsher than other such serums I have used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bumped it down a star because I was hoping to lose a couple of fine lines around my eyes disappear and they haven&#x27;t yet.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and I use ROC with retinol, so</li>
            <li>Face feels very soft, reddened areas have lightened.</li>
            <li>I Have very sensitive  skin and was worried that I would break out to this product or it would be itchy.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum, and have recommended it to several friends because it absorbs quickly, has a great smell, and does a good job of moisturizing/plumping skin, but I don&#x27;t see any insanely miraculous changes like other reviewers.</li>
            <li>My nightly routine is to wash with facial cleanser first, then use toner (witch hazel), once the toner has soaked in I apply 3 drops of this serum, let that soak in then follow-up with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin is in EXACTLY the same condition as it was before I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>I first had Joe apply the serum to his entire face and neck.</li>
            <li>it makes my face feel really soft and it doesn&#x27;t make it greasy feeling!</li>
            <li>and I see a marked improvement!</li>
            <li>My skin has become clearer and the fine lines are less visible.</li>
            <li>I cannot say it&#x27;s only due to Pro-A as I used it in combination, but I recommend it and already bought 2 more for my friend and my mom.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft and glowy!</li>
            <li>but after testing I can definitely tell you that it works and works pretty</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>The other product is not living up to it&#x27;s claims, so I will go back to the Retinol Serum and see if there is more improvement.</li>
            <li>Although I have been using this product for a short time, I have seen results that I haven&#x27;t been able to get with other products.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to get this result with other pricey products with no avail, so I&#x27;m excited that I can purchase a inexpensive product that has worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li>Received it and directions via email have not used long enough to see change but have used it and smell fine</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, goes on &amp; absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>Of course, price is important and other similar products can cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to apply, just takes a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I have a few blemishes and wrinkles and this product improved my skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>I expected the serum to go a long way, but it absorbs so quickly into my skin that I have to use more if it than expected in order to get coverage all over my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You only need a small amount in order for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>Its not too strong, so you can use it everyday.</li>
            <li>Already starting to see positive results.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this serum for a little less than 2 weeks and am happy  to have seen results already.  </li>
            <li>and it got to the point where I was able to find similar products for less money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update on my fine lines in a few weeks after I&#x27;ve given the retinol a chance to work its magic.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It contains 2.5% retinol which encourages skin to rid itself of dead cells and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I am shocked by how quickly I&#x27;ve seen results with this product, within two weeks fine lines and acne have cleared up significantly.</li>
            <li>For the price and the potency, it is hard to find a better product.</li>
            <li>Even though 2.5% is a very high amount, I tap whatever is left over on my fingers, around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It also contains Organic Aloe which I am a huge fan of for skin products along with green tea and vitamin E.</li>
            <li>and I have to combine a clear skin, with some topic antibiotics and</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not cause dryness, redness or peeling or any irritation like old Retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Pro-A Serum has no scent, so if you are sensitive to smells, this is a product for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The serum is made in an FDA registered and GMP compliant facility in the USA, developed with Cruelty-free testing- never on animals.</li>
            <li>It does not contain Parabens, Sulphates, Phthalates, Fragrances or Alcohol.made in an FDA registered and GMP compliant facility in the USA, developed with Cruelty-free testing- never on animals.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy at all.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my 60 year old mother.</li>
            <li>I had a couple of complete strangers comment on my skin.</li>
            <li>makes my face so soft</li>
            <li>Leaves my face soft</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I noticed my skin felt smoother and looked clearer or brighter.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>Also, I was worried about applying a serum on my oily skin during the day but the serum actually helps control some of the oil and my face is so much smoother.  </li>
            <li>It really is a natural product.</li>
            <li>I maybe thirty-three years old, but I work in the cosmetology business</li>
            <li>I think I have been applying too much because its suppose to last a couple months.  </li>
            <li>When it completely absorb you should follow with your choice of moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin tone has been very even since starting.</li>
            <li>My face looks considerably smoother and well hydrated and also it control the in-grown hairs.</li>
            <li>My profile picture was taken this year and I&#x27;ll confess that I&#x27;m 57 years old</li>
            <li>After using product for about 4 weeks, I&#x27;m beginning to notice brown spots fading, wrinkle reduction, &amp; diminished appearance of old acne scars.</li>
            <li>This definitely made my skin feel much softer.</li>
            <li>Truly, I think this will help even my 68 year old wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how my skin reacted to this serum.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural and NOT tested on animals.</li>
            <li>so far I like the feel of serum on my face.</li>
            <li>but so far its making my face feel softer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mid 30&#x27;s guy, and don&#x27;t really care about my skin.</li>
            <li>I am 67 years old with a lot of Sun damage.</li>
            <li>I am 69 years old and using this morning and at night.</li>
            <li>no adverse reaction to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I can put it directly on my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Still early to tell.</li>
            <li>I received my product and so far I like it a lot..</li>
            <li>my skin is clearer and radiant soft feel and diferenciacada day goes on</li>
            <li>I did not get the chance to try the product yet since it is sun sensitive and,</li>
            <li>I bought this based off a recommendation of my sister and based on the fact that we have completely different skin types, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve cut my cost considerably.</li>
            <li>I can say it this product works as retinol should and has not dried it out or caused my face to break out.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was very pleased!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The letter from the founder of the company is very helpful and explanatory on how to use the serum properly.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Using this at night as my skin is sensitive to retinol when exposed to sunlight.  </li>
            <li>, I have sensitive skin, roschae, not a problem</li>
            <li>So far my skin feels smoother.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but it didn&#x27;t cause me any problems at all.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t caused any dryness or irritation.</li>
            <li>It is natural and organic and is plant based.</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old and people have been telling me that I look like I am in my 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I like the retinol serum so far</li>
            <li>Its natural and organic</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and leaves it feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about everything and this product by far exceeds them all.  </li>
            <li>So far I like this product</li>
            <li>The serum leaves my face soft but I have not seen any of my blemishes or wrinkles fade.</li>
            <li>I am getting ready to order my second bottle.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I have seen a reduction in my adult acne but my pores still remain a problem.</li>
            <li>and I have fairly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so far it seems to make my skin feel smoother.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I like it so far</li>
            <li>If my skin improves over the next few months, I will update my review. :)</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30s, very concerned about aging skin, but still dealing with breakouts (which are now hormonal and more cystic in nature.)&lt;br /&gt;My deciding factor on purchasing this serum was that it is one of the few that contains both 2.5% retinol (the highest available in any product) and hyaluronic acid, plus green tea, vitamin E, and other organic oils.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it is natural and part of a small business!</li>
            <li>It seems to be a gentle product, very faint pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>so it sinks right into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or stickiness.</li>
            <li>As a 50 year young African American woman , I wanted to be able to maintain my skin elasticity and be proactive about keeping the wrinkles away for as long as possible.</li>
            <li>instantly i saw my skin become less red and more supple</li>
            <li>you can apply your makeup pretty much immediately without it getting cakey or uneven.  </li>
            <li>so these products are definitely fun to try and see what will help to maintain my youthful appearance for as long as possible.</li>
            <li>I have used other Body Merry products and I am just as pleased with this serum as I was with their other products.</li>
            <li>A little goes along way, so the bottle will last me over 2 months easy.</li>
            <li>I do have very sensitive skin, but I regularly use retinol products, so I was quite surprised by this reaction.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li>If it burns or itches too harshly, immediately remove with cool water and discontinue use.</li>
            <li>first appreciated that this product had not only retinol but other antioxidants within one bottle!</li>
            <li>Only been using it for a week but already seeing the typical minor peeling of the top layer of skin.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed upon receiving this serum was that it looked super thick in the bottle!</li>
            <li>Then I apply a gentle moisturizer (sometimes retinols can dry the skin, I haven&#x27;t noticed whether this serum does as I always follow with a moisturizer).</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am cautious using any retinol products as they make my skin red for hours.</li>
            <li>I definitely have noticed some of fine lines disappearing and my between the eyebrow furrow lines are noticeably less deep.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this a few days, but my first impression is Really Like.</li>
            <li>I definitely like this product so far!</li>
            <li>Not sure if I see a significant difference but will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>I started using every OTHER day for exactly a week.</li>
            <li>The dark circles under my eyes are less prominent.  </li>
            <li>I think my skin has become smoother and some fine wrinkle lines are slowly diminishing.</li>
            <li>this bottle or others are it really will go and last a long time</li>
            <li>Since the birth of my son 10 years ago I had been having trouble with adult acne and this serum has really made that clear up.  </li>
            <li>It also set itself above competitive products that were nearly twice the cost.</li>
            <li>Although this did not remove all my wrinkles - I am 56 years old and there are simply consequences to aging -</li>
            <li>but I feel like my wrinkles and not as apparent.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my wrinkles are fling in and are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, especially around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>This Serum left my skin feeling soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this for about three weeks, so I can&#x27;t speak to what the long-term effects will be as far as wrinkle reduction.</li>
            <li>It also has a yellowish tint and is thick and the smell is light and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>It did not make my skin feel dirty or oily either which is also good.</li>
            <li>It is easy to discern the two because the night product is in a dark brown bottle with grey label and the day product is in a blue bottle with blue label (hint:</li>
            <li>and I know that my continual use will only help my smile wrinkles become less noticeable.</li>
            <li>My laugh lines around my lips are less noticeable after only about a month of applying, day and night!</li>
            <li>a few drops of the Body Merry Pro-A Serum to your fingertips and apply to your skin, don’t forget to get right up under your eyes</li>
            <li>a few drops of the Body Merry Pro-A Serum to your fingertips and apply to your skin, don’t forget to get right up under your eyes</li>
            <li>This serum is seriously hydrating, and is helping with smoothing the fine lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li>when i first put it on after washing my face my face tingled which was completely odd to me</li>
            <li>intend on inquiring about other products they sell because i appreciated their concern about my purchase</li>
            <li>So far, no change on the deep wrinkles on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>It also did not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I used it on a little spot at first</li>
            <li>old female and am starting my second bottle.</li>
            <li>(For reference, I have normal skin that&#x27;s not very prone to breakouts.)</li>
            <li>First I washed and dried my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>My skin tone looked more even and it overall made a dramatic change in my skin.</li>
            <li>I have two small acne right now, one on each cheek, none around my mouth or on my chin.</li>
            <li>My skin has not been this clear in a very long time.  </li>
            <li>(normally it takes at least 6 weeks to see any changes in my face from new products as I&#x27;ve been a sun worshiper for 50 years the old school way, ie: prior to sunscreen... you&#x27;d never know it now!)</li>
            <li>I am 42 years old and suffer from dry, itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for the past few weeks and my skin looks and feels more balanced and radiant.  </li>
            <li>also put some serum on my dark spot, and when I first put some on, it seemed like some layers of my epithelium flaked off on my dark spot, and made the dark spot more pale.</li>
            <li>it actually had to be worn with a UV protection on a daily basis, so it is simply not a good fit for me.</li>
            <li>The only reason I haven&#x27;t given it 5 stars (yet) is because I haven&#x27;t bee using it long enough to see a marked difference in my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>And as a tip, if you&#x27;re serious about getting rid of those annoying wrinkles...I Highly recommended using WITH the retinol moisturizier for best results!</li>
            <li>Oh, and it really does reduce dark spots!</li>

            <li> : A wonderful skin moisturizer!</li>
            <li> The best way to ensure even coverage is to apply a dime sized amount to hands and dot in five places on your face: forehead, nose, each cheek, and chin, then spread evenly over each area of the skin one by one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful to find a product that works and doesn&#x27;t break the bank and 100% guarantee.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels wonderfully hydrated after using this product.  </li>

            <li> I really liked this serum.</li>
            <li> this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Retinol Serum&#x27; by Body Merry was introduced to me, through an exclusive extereme discount, to try and review honestly.</li>
            <li> Im thrilled to have tried it.</li>
            <li> Not only does it feel GREAT on my face but it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> My opinion is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> It has been keeping my face looking hydrated and rejuvenated and I am loving it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So for a retinol abuser, me, this has been the safest yet still effective retinol</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and you feel the results right away.  </li>
            <li> it smooth&#x27;s fine lines and give your skin a lovely glow!!!</li>
            <li> I saw a remarkable difference in the fine lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who is in need of a great serum that won&#x27;t irritate your face!</li>
            <li> I find that retinol serums are among the handful of products that make a difference for my skin (along with vitamin C serum, Hyaluronic Acid, a good mild exfoliant and a good sunscreen).</li>
            <li> Merry 2.5% Retinol Serum is great for helping reduce fine lines and I really love it for evening out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> It goes on nice with a very light pleasant scent it easily coats your skin</li>
            <li> It is priced very fair, &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; free, and a natural/organic product, which has become increasingly important for my skin.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product has a watery yet gel consistency that glides on very easily.</li>
            <li> This serum is awesome so far!</li>
            <li> I look forward to more products from Body Merry, the more the merrier!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light weight, and feels nice on.</li>
            <li> This serum helps to  reduce fine lines and wrinkles and provide superior hydration leaving your face baby</li>
            <li> Retinols can also increase sun sensitivity so it is important to wear a good sunscreen during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice but need more time to see if it works</li>
            <li> I did benefit this product for free in exchange of my fair review.</li>
            <li> This is a 2.5% Retinol Serum, nice and potent.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, and you get good results.</li>
            <li> I would like to continue using it to see what kind of results I get with more time and not doubling it up with the cream.</li>
            <li> Even an old gent needs to look his best you know!</li>
            <li> Love this serum makes my skin feel amazing</li>
            <li> I will say that I have quite good skin, but at 70, I was noticing the wrinkles around my mouth and chin were becoming much more noticeable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to apply morning or night as you can layer your moisturizer and makeup right over</li>
            <li> but at a much better price point and with much more effective ingredients.</li>
            <li> Using this product has been amazing and I am so grateful I was offered to try this free and review this for my HONEST opinion.</li>
            <li> Very nice serum , they ask you to leave a review right after you receive the product</li>
            <li> Love this product very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant refreshing cool feel.</li>
            <li> I did appreciate the seller contacting me prior to beginning using it to insure the best results, that was really nice to have more information</li>
            <li> At first, I wondered if there was any retinol at all in the serum because I experienced no redness or dryness.</li>
            <li> It works great, you can see the difference from the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> I had large pores in my face but after two times of using it my pores SHRUNK!!!!</li>
            <li> The Pro A Serum is a retinol serum which means something very important.</li>
            <li> Very cheap too but works for my skin.</li>
            <li> If there is one, it&#x27;s very light and not unpleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> like this serum as it seems mild (meaning it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin) and seems to have good quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> The texture is nice and it absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> The serum has a nice consistency and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the very quick delivery - one day! - and the considerate concern and personal follow-up of the store owner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> To my happy surprise my skin has responded positively to it.  </li>
            <li> That is completely normal and a good sign that it is working!</li>
            <li> So when I was given the opportunity to try their Hyaluronic Acid free in return for an honest product review I jumped at the opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty happy to try the Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li> This Pro- A Serum is said to be highly effective in diminishing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I put it on with another oil (argan) so that it covers more of my face.  </li>
            <li> Love the feel of my skin when I put this on.</li>
            <li> What I love about this is that it contains more than just retinol.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice your skin retains moisture better and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Retinol: Also known as Vitamin A, Retinol is an amazing antioxidant, so it helps fight free radical damage which increases collagen production and makes the skin look more youthful.</li>

            <li> your favorite moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Apply sunscreen</li>
            <li> I received this product free to try, but ALL opinions are my own*</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my skin and</li>
            <li> I found that most people would recommend for my age group - sunscreen (more than spf 15), retinol cream, and a serum.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Which is ok</li>
            <li> (Which is ok, I am not worried about them, more worried about the acne).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> am also doing this while changing my eating habits to eat more veg/fruit/less meat..</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Most people say that I look about 50.</li>
            <li> I love that it addresses acne as well as aging signs.</li>
            <li> I love these products</li>
            <li> They provide excellent service and I will definitely keep using their products.</li>
            <li> My makeup even seemed to stay on better throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Would have been better off using mashed banana on face every day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok though.</li>
            <li> only used for a couple weeks now - but of all the serums i have tried i think this is the best.</li>
            <li> Love the serum.  </li>
            <li> So so glad I found this product.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to write a review to give it more time.</li>
            <li> So glad to have to spend an arm and leg for my body regime.</li>
            <li> and I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a guy, I&#x27;m in a distinct minority but in my work having a good complexion and aging</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this product, non-greasy and non-allergenic.</li>
            <li> great product (already seeing results) and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have been so pleased with Body Merry&#x27;s Pro-A Serum.  </li>
            <li> What I absolutely love is that this comes in a generous sized bottle and is dispensed using an eye-dropper.  </li>
            <li> Love how it has moisturizer my skin.</li>
            <li> His results would be more drastic than mine</li>
            <li> and I love his one and so does my husband. :</li>
            <li> and I love his one and so does my husband. :</li>
            <li> I bought this as I wasn&#x27;t sure the Body</li>
            <li> Love this serum.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok because I use an eye gel afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m told I would get better benefits of I used a derma roller.</li>
            <li> I love my routine and have had many compliments since using these products.</li>
            <li> :) My skin is acne prone and combination dry/oily.</li>
            <li> After one night, my skin looked and felt suppler and more radiant.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I do put a moisturizer on top after it</li>
            <li> I really love the way my skin feels now, and can&#x27;t wait to see the results in time.  </li>
            <li> I Love this serum....</li>
            <li> I use it at night mostly, but anytime I wash my face (night time or before makeup application)</li>
            <li> I bought this about 2 weeks ago &amp; love it.  </li>
            <li> but I see now why people love this product.</li>

            <li> I LOVE this serum.  </li>
            <li> Body Merry is like a magic potion on my skin.  </li>
            <li> And I love that it is more gel-like than a runny liquid</li>
            <li> I purchased the product I have received 2 emails from the owner making sure I was satisfied and offering to answer any questions I may have...who does that</li>
            <li> I always confirm she has zero wrinkles :)</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this serum and she loves it we purchased 2 more because she swears by this product.</li>
            <li> Love Body</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of their Products</li>
            <li> I figure if the serum works for tightening that area of skin it must be helping elsewhere! :)</li>
            <li> (Why do so many of these serums feel sticky?)</li>
            <li> She is pleased too - and will buy it again.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and I intend to reorder.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Has noticed some effects on mostly the softness of skin.</li>
            <li> I lOVE the way it makes my skin look and</li>
            <li> Retinal serums are one of the most evidence based ways to reduce fines lines and wrinkles.</li>

            <li> I really think this is a great way to preserve my skin from aging.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best facial products with retinol out there.</li>
            <li> This formula has 2.5% which is what is suggested by most studies-</li>
            <li> any more it burns, more it maybe doesn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love using the Body Merry Pro-A Serum at night.</li>
            <li> My makeup even stays on better.</li>
            <li> so I could get the most benefit from the serum.</li>
            <li> It dries immediately which I love since I like to layer my skincare.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this serum.</li>
            <li> and this is just one more that I have reviewed to share with you by the company Body Merry.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this product was that I am highly satisfied whit</li>
            <li> I love this product and wil be ordering bottle number two in a month or so.  </li>
            <li> I love this serum.</li>
            <li> Feels silky smooth, not greasy!</li>
            <li> but I feel so much more confident without make up now.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I swear I have been getting sooooo many compliments on the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was really impressed that the founder of the company took such an interest in how my skin was responding to the serum.  </li>
            <li> I have seen some fading for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this serum</li>
            <li> I also thought my skin seemed to have a more healthy appearance.  </li>
            <li> Nice chemical free serum.</li>
            <li> I was given a free sample in order to review this item but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Love this company&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> received for free, but my opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter, tighter and skin tone more even.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really pleased  </li>
            <li> The tone of my skin is brighter and more even.  </li>
            <li> and i love Body Merry products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this for my 50+ face.</li>
            <li> After a week of use, I noticed my skin is a lot softer, and my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li> This product was free but soley my own opinion.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks, it does appear that my skin looks healthier and more refined with a mor blended look.</li>
            <li> Do not try it for more than a month with no results since you can&#x27;t get a refund after 30 days.</li>
            <li> This is the second product I have purchased from Body Merry and must say that I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
            <li> I reviewed this product for I love to review.</li>
            <li> My face feels &amp; looks better</li>
            <li> Does it get any better than that?  </li>
            <li> I love BodyMerry’s Retinol Serum because unlike some anti aging products, it never dries my face.</li>
            <li> but glad I did.</li>
            <li> I apply this at night too, and in the morning my skin looks even better than when I went to bed.</li>
            <li> I am able to go without makeup once again.  </li>
            <li> In love</li>
            <li> And not an overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li> I just want people to know how great this stuff is so far!!!</li>
            <li> It applies easily ,has a great smooth texture and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> The two of us have decided that we have found our &amp;#34;potion.&amp;#34;  This serum is gentle but very effective.  </li>
            <li> Loving this very easy and worth while product.  </li>
            <li> , so I was very excited to try a Retinol product.</li>
            <li> , so I was very excited to try a Retinol product.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> I got a special deal on it and am very happy so far update used a week</li>
            <li> First day of application I experienced light burning for about 5 minutes, but not anymore.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin and is perfect for anyone that has sensitive skin since it&#x27;s formulated with organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> It smells great, goes on easily and is absolute perfection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The great American adage of &amp;#34;The more, the better!&amp;#34;, does not apply here!</li>
            <li> Retinol is awesome, but it can irritate your skin and take a long time to see results.</li>
            <li> It is considered one of the best antioxidants, which means it finds and destroys free radicals, which are basically the &amp;#34;aging cells&amp;#34; in our body that scavenge and multiply, taking over healthy cells and accelerating the aging process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to get it to spread evenly and when used with the Derma Roller it works even better, allowing it to seep under the skin where it will do the most good.</li>
            <li> this is my honest review of this product, if you are hesitating or have any kind of doubt please be assure that this Retinol Serum is everything, I can&#x27;t say or put enough words in here to describe to good in this product ...</li>
            <li> Not much of a scent to this serum, very light at best.</li>
            <li> I have noticed significant changes with my skin’s appearance – which explains why I am hooked on this product!</li>
            <li> It feels nice on my skin and all around a great product I definitely recommend this product to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I had very fine laugh wrinkles growing around my eyes which I started to notice more and more.</li>
            <li> I have a new favorite face product!!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have any fine lines or wrinkles but even so my skin looked amazingly better using this product.</li>
            <li> It works best on a clean face and  use with consistancy on a daily regimen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil most closely resembles your skin’s natural sebum, so it works very well at hydrating, and best of all it won’t clog your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face feels great, so far.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use, but so far, quite happy with this.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and it leaves my skin feeling tightened and smooth.</li>

            <li> Body Merry makes a great two piece set that leaves your face feeling soft and</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin so smooth &amp; shrinks the pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-scented which is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I just started using it, but it really does a good job on my skin.</li>
            <li> really makes your skin feel good and not greasy</li>
            <li> I did receive a complimentary bottle to review, but this is my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> Along with many of their other products my skin tone is wonderful and alot of the fine lines have faded away.</li>
            <li> I love this product it really works!!!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Loved the idea of adding green tea to the formula, it&#x27;s a great anti-oxidant.  </li>

            <li> I am very pleased with the fast delivery service.</li>
            <li> The solution is a perfect gel that has a slight tint and is easily portioned out by the dropper.</li>
            <li> have not seen a drastic reduction in fine lines or wrinkles, but retinol isn&#x27;t something that works immediately.</li>
            <li> This is why it is best to leave your skin slightly damp after thoroughly cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in the fine lines at the corner of my eyes.</li>
            <li> I also started seeing fine wrinkles under my eyes - again something I never had before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the product about a week and have noticed some changes in the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s progress on fine lines, too.</li>
            <li> My fine lines are diminished and my skin glows.  </li>
            <li> I noticed it reduced fine lines within the week.</li>
            <li> This retinol serum reduced my wrinkles, fine lines and spots, and improved the softness my skin.</li>
            <li> Made my skin softer and improved the look of fine lines</li>
            <li> This is a 2.5% Retinol pro-A serum used to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> After a couple week, my skin appeared lighter and some of my fine lines were not as noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I see the fine lines have minimized.</li>
            <li> This stuff helps reduce the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The smell is nearly non-existent but pleasant what there is of it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a considerable difference in the size of my pores (which I was hoping would be a pleasant side effect)</li>
            <li> I am truly amazed at how quickly it has worked!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and outstanding customer service!  </li>
            <li> After a couple of days, I noticed my laugh lines were fading and the fine lines by my eyes were diminishing as well!</li>
            <li> Its a light serum, I hope it works fine on my face</li>
            <li> Fine lines have diminished and it makes my skin feel smooth and silky without a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I hope to see an improvement in fine lines but for now I am comfortable in using it every night.</li>
            <li> Love this whole product line!!  </li>
            <li> I honestly think it doesn&#x27;t do much for the fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> So I cannot see a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That is a huge huge thing for me.</li>
            <li> Great product that works well with my current moisturizer and fantastic service.</li>
            <li> After just a week I noticed a huge difference in the firmness of my skin and diminished lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference.</li>

            <li> This serum by Body Merry has 3 very powerful components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This serum is very powerful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased that I have not had any reactions to the serum because my skin is normally very sensitive.</li>
            <li> it look more vibrant for sure and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been following it with a normal moisturizer, and have seen my one super-terrible wrinkle become somewhat less-pronounced, and I can feel it working in my lips if I apply it there, but it&#x27;s not going to un-puff your eyes and make your skin flawless and smooth.</li>
            <li> so it is generally believed to be more effective to use before bedtime.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, dries quickly and is not &#x27;sticky&#x27;.</li>
            <li> First off I have to say that I LOVE that Body Mary doesn&#x27;t test of animals.</li>

            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>

            <li> Overall, for the money a good product if care is taken with use.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week</li>
            <li> Chose a collagen peptide for the am and a sweet potato moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> , it leaves my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> No bad smell and no side effects.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product.</li>
            <li> #34;I can not wait until I see the full results in a month.&amp;#34; I am happy to see she has been happy with the product since it is going to be difficult to find the right product.</li>
            <li> This serum goes on smoothly, soaking right into my skin.  </li>
            <li> Its light, not sticky and absorbs right into the skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good product and I feel good using it as it does not have artificial ingredients</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in this product for wrinkles or fine lines, I&#x27;d recommend using it for 10-12 weeks before deciding whether it works for you or not.</li>
            <li> With Body Merry Pro-A Serum, you see results quickly.</li>
            <li> your skin tone starts evening out quickly.</li>
            <li> product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it</li>
            <li> I will keep up using this product and only expect results to be better n better.</li>
            <li> Although serums can often be oily this one absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving oil or a sticky residue - so ladies</li>
            <li> but because I knew Joey would get much better results than I would, being he is 13 years older than me.  </li>
            <li> With the 2.5% retinol, Hyaluronic acid, and green tea, while the Serum is absorbing to get this awesome feeling of freshness.</li>
            <li> Retinol Serum to anyone looking to great real and lasting results from their products.</li>
            <li> Dries rather quickly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely mildly hydrating.</li>
            <li> it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have only used the product for two weeks, so have not noticed any permanent changes yet, but will continue to use it as the skin feels nice and smooth after use.</li>
            <li> and I have to get like super close to the mirror…</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> and it absorbs quickly and is non-sticky,</li>
            <li> and it dries quick.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly</li>
            <li> I got the package quickly too.</li>
            <li> The serum is not sticky and absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I apply this at night and it absorbs rather quickly and does not feel oily or sticky which I had feared.</li>
            <li> for what it&#x27;s worth I highly recommend this product and can honestly say it did what I was hoping it would, just short of miraculously making fine lines go away :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleanse your skin as your normally would &amp; pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;Apply your favorite toner&lt;br /&gt;apply</li>
            <li> This is great for evening your  skin tone and reducing dark spots and acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in a dark bottle which is great for any retinol product.</li>
            <li> First use leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big anti aging aficionado because I believe that it’s never too early to take really good care of your skin using anti aging products!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing serum all by itself but to add body merry&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum takes it to a whole new level!  </li>
            <li> Less wrinkles and firmer jawline skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Their wasn&#x27;t really a smell to it and my skin soaked up the Serum very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have now tried 4 different products in the Body Merry line but this is definitely my favorite!</li>
            <li> What more could a 56 year old ask for?!?</li>
            <li> I love Love every single drop of it</li>
            <li> I have been using a little over a month and have for sure noticed that the fine lines around my eyes have softened, and my skin looks brighter and more youthful.  </li>
            <li> I have for sure noticed a reduction in fine lines, especially on my forehead.</li>
            <li> At 57 my skin was looking really dull, did some research and most sources recommended a good retinol.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews before purchasing and am happy that the positive review turned out to be correct.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid is an amazing moisturizing ingredient that will absorb the water around it, pulling that moisture deep into the pores.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my skin and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> It absorbs really fast and I feel my skin is tighter and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give an update in a few weeks and let you know if I&#x27;m still happy with this product.</li>
            <li> A truly fantastic product I&#x27;d highly recommend to everyone who cares about their skin!</li>
            <li> Having my face fully hydrated all day is such an amazing feeling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review.</li>
            <li> Make sure to avoid the sensitive eye area, as well as the nostrils, ears, and mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure where this holy stuff in a bottle come from but it iz #BEAUTIFUL.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer I put on top of it also absorbed and my face felt so soft.  </li>
            <li> have only been using this serum for four days, but I am so happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it</li>
            <li> I was offered this product for testing and evaluation purposes; the feedback provided is solely based on my own personal use and opinions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seller actually reached out to inquire about efficacy of product which to me was more important than anything else.</li>
            <li> love how soft it makes my face.</li>
            <li> Most moisturizers make me break out - even at 70 years old.  </li>
            <li> I just resently got this product, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the retinol serum but the retinol moisturizer did not really do much</li>
            <li> Worth trying..</li>
            <li> skin.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was given the Body Merry Pro-A Serum complimentary for review purposes.</li>
            <li> So far I love this product.</li>
            <li> This serum is quickly absorbed and adds to the softness of my skin.</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>

            <li> All I can say is I love the fact that its all natural  </li>
            <li> Simple and effective.  </li>
            <li> Love the results so far; I started using this just under a month ago</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with this serum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice/day and have been pleased so far.</li>
            <li> love the result so far.</li>
            <li> I love the results so far and can&#x27;t wait to see what is to come.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin though, but I can&#x27;t imagine many people would have a problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just dab plenty of this on my face and it becomes kind of stiff, which is what I think people with more wrinkles are looking for.</li>
            <li> Serum is light and easily absorbed and has not irritated my super sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> I have tried other Vitamin A products and none of them have felt as good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Just havent really noticed a significant improvement as of yet</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was concerned I potentially could have a negative reaction to the strength; I&#x27;m happy to report nothing to report but great results.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs right away</li>
            <li> right now  </li>
            <li> Recommended to my friend, and she has positive feedback also!</li>
            <li> Immediately upon the first use my skin was noticeably softer, and after using this product for a couple weeks my skin is incredibly soft and smooth, it is also quite a bit brighter!</li>
            <li> Immediately upon the first use my skin was noticeably softer, and after using this product for a couple weeks my skin is incredibly soft and smooth, it is also quite a bit brighter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this isn&#x27;t a recommended action.  </li>
            <li> Retinol is a very strong topical derivative of Vitamin A.</li>
            <li> Within just a few days the fine lines are disappearing, and I love the fact that its made in the USA quality and cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> like the natural scent, and the smooth feel of the skin after the product absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> With the positive changes I&#x27;ve been having so far, I can&#x27;t wait to continue using this combo together to see even better looking skin.</li>
            <li> Still, other serums I&#x27;ve tried have caused splotchiness and breakouts, and this one only makes things better, so this is definitely the best choice.</li>
            <li> so I will see how great my skin will look in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but it makes my wife&#x27;s face look great.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item to help smooth some of the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> works even better and does not dry out my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typically suspicious of serums, but this feels good.</li>
            <li> Wife thinks it really works to smooth away wrinkles - asked me to try it, and it really does seem to help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also very allergic and sensitive to many products, this one didn&#x27;t give any allergies.  </li>
            <li> That kind of personal touch is really valuable when ordering skin products online, instead of buying at a skin boutique.  </li>
            <li> if the price were always this reasonable, I&lt;br /&gt;would be a faithful and loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Its nice to find a product that is reasonably priced and will actually give you results.  </li>
            <li> my previous experience with this company-very good customer treatment.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product to improve the flaws on my face giving me a more youthful look and reduce those laugh lines around my mouth and especially  around and under my eyes.</li>
            <li> and these all are such wonderful non harsh skin products.</li>
            <li> It did not make my skin feel oily, but rather, very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I used the serum the first night, and I immediately noticed that it absorbed completely, and my face felt so smooth.  </li>
            <li> This serum is smooth, not heavy, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and WORKS!</li>
            <li> Both products are made in the USA, cruelty free, natural and organic!</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
            <li> Very gentle to use.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much.</li>
            <li> Left my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> Items arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> my face got all cahapped and this repaired it in 5 days and the price is very reasonable</li>
            <li> However, after a month of using this (directly followed by a moisturizer) I can tell my skin is tighter and my fine lines are reduced.</li>
            <li> You work hard to make us happy</li>
            <li> you must use SPF 30 or higher at day.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> and I complimented her on how pretty her face was.</li>
            <li> We are now both big fans of body merry products and will continue with more of their products in the future!&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Also be sure to wear sunscreen daily regardless of the weather, this will prevent any sunburns and sunspots!vorite</li>
            <li> Also be sure to wear sunscreen daily regardless of the weather, this will prevent any sunburns and sunspots!</li>
            <li> use my toner first, then I put on this retinol serum and then apply my Aveeno night</li>
            <li> Does exactly  what it says it makes my skin glow</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> After the first day, I had friends comment</li>
            <li> and I know how it important it is to start early on your anti-aging skin regime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received so many compliments after using this product it works and it makes my skin extra smooth and soft</li>
            <li> FIRST OFF</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while now, and can confidently say that not only are the wrinkles being kept at bay</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this Retinol Serum to anyone looking to great real and lasting results from their products.</li>
            <li> The first ingredient is water.  </li>
            <li> I just love the feel of my face since starting the serum.</li>
            <li> I have started the C first, and have added this now, for 3 days.  </li>
            <li> I put it on first, let it soak into my skin, then I also use Body Merry&#x27;s eye cream (</li>
            <li> I use it daily &amp; love the results it has given me.</li>
            <li> but most people guess my age to be 10+ years younger.  </li>
            <li> Its my first bottle but</li>
            <li> I have not had a problem with this, and saw a visible difference within the first week of use.  </li>
            <li> This is my first bottle</li>
            <li> Product exactly as advertised and on time...</li>
            <li> , my fine lines are less noticeable and my complexion is more even toned.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend This light weight product that does not clog pores!</li>
            <li> but this bottle looks like it will last 6 months, maybe more.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for myself,  the first time..</li>
            <li> I really like this Retinol Serum!</li>
            <li> Thats why I like about this serum it absorbed fast.</li>
            <li> It could only get better with use.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin evenly toned, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a short trial, I was able to see results of improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I  am now in my 2nd week of using this product and have so far been very pleased with how my skin feels after I apply.</li>
            <li> Still on the first bottle..........so I can not say whether it&#x27;s doing anything or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie and have used pretty much everything out there from prescription, to the highest end to basic coconut oil on my face and this serum is a seriously great product and a steal for what it actually does.</li>
            <li> At first my skin was getting used to this product</li>
            <li> , my skin overall looks better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really lightweight and is easily absorbed and can be worn under make-up.  </li>
            <li> However,  I am PLEASED to say that this product has definitely  made me a believer again.</li>
            <li> I did take before and after pictures  that I will post after I finish my first bottle.</li>
            <li> First I tone with rosewater</li>
            <li> I had noticible results after the first 5 days of using it.</li>
            <li> and I love that they do different things.</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles on my first purchase, to save on the shipping,  I gave one to my daughter.  </li>
            <li> The first thing that struck me was the pretty bottle that the serum came in.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I did was read the directions.  </li>
            <li> I find better results by applying the serum before bedtime under my regular night cream (ROC Multi-Correction cream).</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a decease in wrinkles yet (I am 34 and don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles, more of surface wrinkles that appear when I smile/laugh).</li>
            <li> I found this serum by searching on Amazon for similar products and I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I noticed results after using it for over 2 weeks consistently.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I am 48 and starting to see the sagging and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It is my first time using a retinal serum and &#x27;Retinal Serum&#x27; by Body Merry has worked well for me and for my fresher,brighter complection.</li>
            <li> Thanks Body Merry!</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I cannot speak to the anti-wrinkle properties of this product as I bought it primarily to address my adult acne and dullness of complexion.  </li>
            <li> I am so used to retinol products that I know the signs, the creases of the nose and the corner of my mouth are the first to get hit.  </li>
            <li> After reading the positive reviews and finding the price very reasonable I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> I dont have that tight feeling as I did when I used just the retinol, so using my light moisturizer afterwards is much better than feeling like I have to apply a heavier moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own, if the quality is decent or if it really works if half of the reviews were for people making a review because they were ask for it, because they got it for free.</li>
            <li> I could quickly and easily put a few drops around on my face and it absorbed quickly leaving no trace or residue</li>
            <li> didnt see any significant difference at all...may be its too early</li>
            <li> , after a month, I can really say that my skin looks better the next day after using it, I really like it !</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my face and neck twice a day for a few weeks and it has absolutely made my skin bright</li>
            <li> /&gt;The serum itself is a thick gel consistency which I personally love because it doesn’t run all over the place and spill, but it is still absorbed very quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> I think this is better than Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair at half the price; I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> have not used it regularly for a whole month yet, more on and off for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> In just 2 week my complexion is so much brighter, more even skin tone and pore look much smaller.  </li>
            <li> This serum absorbs quickly and my skin always feels very soft and well hydrated after I put this on.</li>
            <li> Cost $150 for high quality organic ingredients but will give me 20 bottles worth of product.</li>
            <li> no more dry skin + very happy skin</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of Roc and decided to try a more organic solution...</li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference in the first day or two, of using it once a day, at night.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> In less then a month I have my skin in a condition where I don&#x27;t have to wear makeup as it looks flawless, radiant from inside and generally 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> The consistency is gel-like so it is easy to apply and you only need to use 2-3 drops.</li>
            <li> She said most her coworkers are using it with moisturizer after so they don&#x27;t have dry skin while flying.</li>
            <li> This serum made my skin feel super soft &amp; youthful looking.</li>
            <li> I have mild rosacea and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised at the quick improvement in the texture and tone of my face.</li>
            <li> The first one was halfway filled,  and the second one was filed all the way,  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super gentle since my skin can be a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li> It did eliminate some fine lines and reduce the size of larger wrinkles.</li>
            <li> First the fact that you are getting 2.5% retinol Professional grade retinol!!  </li>
            <li> Been using under my moisturizers and oils day and night for about a month now and can see a huge difference in my overall skin tone, texture, firmness and moisture level!</li>
            <li> smooth skin + acne scars gone much smaller +</li>
            <li> /&gt;Speaking of the gel-like consistency, this serum really melts into your skin.</li>
            <li> All you need is a pea-sized bead on your finger to apply to your whole face.</li>
            <li> This has eyedropper lids so you never need to worry about pouring out too much product.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, every [body merry] product I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try has simply been fantastic and I recommend this brand to everyone looking for a quality skincare</li>
            <li> Retinol can also help diminish the look of wrinkles, sun spots, and acne scars by gently exfoliating the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that is the high point for me!</li>
            <li> my make-up goes on soooo much smoother now.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> My face feels much smoother as result.  </li>

            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Adding The Retiinol Serum to my routine (after toning &amp;,before moisturizing)has really brightened my complextion and diminished some of my imperfections.</li>
            <li> Skin feels much smoother after applying.  </li>

            <li> So far, I am quite pleased with the product &amp; will continue to use it to experience the future benefits to my skin.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> Save your money with the 100 dollar Serums this is all natural and it works!!!</li>
            <li> and it was like WOW!!!</li>
            <li> This is such a pretty bottle too I must say!!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> It stood out from other products I have used by doing a superior job of moisturizing and softening my skin, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love the thick, rich serum.</li>
            <li> My usage has been more consistent because it&#x27;s gentle enough for daily use.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products by Body Merry and am usually pleased with this brand.</li>
            <li> It feels great on the skin and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and pretty much anything with too much of anything</li>
            <li> This brand blends it with some other skin healthy items.</li>
            <li> It works better than the other serums I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I did notice a bit of drying which was more than the other serum.</li>
            <li> I use it daily after toning my clean skin and then applying moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> But when you put it on your clean face, you actually feel some tightning.</li>
            <li> I have recently had the pleasure of enjoying sampling many new face products this past week</li>
            <li> on my chest right below my neck and as I would smooth the serum down my neck I would also use it on that area.  </li>
            <li> The serum is very soft and thick so it feels good</li>
            <li> Used it for a few days so far and my skin feels more toned, tighter, and looks healthier already!</li>
            <li> The serum is a watery gel texture and will feel much like water or tears on your face when to apply it, this is completely normal.  </li>
            <li> The Hyaluronic Serum is one product that I can’t live without!</li>
            <li> Fabulous, long lasting, powerful Retinol Serum that really gives results.</li>
            <li> I think I need to use less to really love it.</li>
            <li> Green tea is just as good for you on the outside as it is on the inside.</li>
            <li> Retinol is proven to continue working well after 12 weeks, so this will definitely be a main</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m mainly using it for preventative purposes and to help with my congested skin.</li>
            <li> It does a better job of moisturizing than more expensive products.</li>
            <li> I started using this serum about a month ago without any particular skin concerns in mind, just hoping to enhance my complexion before my wedding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an older woman (66)</li>
            <li> My acne scars I had on my face have lightened and lightened and finally are super unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> My friends can&#x27;t figure out what&#x27;s different, and they keep telling me I look the same &amp;#34;but different&amp;#34;. :)&lt;</li>
            <li> Personally, I use 6 total drops for my face, neck &amp; d&amp;eacute;colletage/cleavage followed by another natural/organic product containing argan stem cell &amp; 2% chlorella growth factor (I attribute both products to my much better skin.)  </li>
            <li> Since they are organic and made without being used and tested on animals that is a super big bonus as well!  </li>
            <li> Ok so I decided to try this for 2 months (actually 50 days close enough) before explaining how I feel about it.</li>
            <li> The ingredient which gives the skin a plump and vibrant look is the hylauronic acid.</li>
            <li> Afraid that I might jinx it, but really impressed with this product so far.  </li>
            <li> Not overly thin, absorbs quickly, and very easy to spread.</li>
            <li> My skin positively glows and it feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> I noticed considerable positive changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 4 even though it is an early review because (1) I am seeing some positive changes in my skin, (2)</li>
            <li> normally do not write reviews unless whatever im reviewing is justified to do so...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Retinol Serum.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Body Merry as a vendor and I highly recommend Body Merry&#x27;s Retinol Serum.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li> I believe I notice a difference in the plumpness and softness of my skin, although it is not as intense and immediately noticeable as with the Hyaluronic Acid and Green Tea morning Dew from Body Merry which is my new favorite face product in my regimen.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because it has green tea, which is a powerful antioxidant.</li>
            <li> Will have to use a little longer to see how well it changes firmness but love the way it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li> My niece, without any prodding from me, mentioned that my skin looked a little better.</li>
            <li> However, I noticed a few months ago that I started having some lines coming from the corner of my mouth toward the sides of my chin - something that I have see in many women my age and older.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this serum for that long, but so far seems to help the fine lines go away.</li>
            <li> apply it in the evening to clean, dry skin.</li>
            <li> Plus, I like that it is natural, doesn&#x27;t sting, and is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised at the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely dissatisfied with this product...doesn&#x27;t seem to have made any difference, and I&#x27;ve officially used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> so the treatment shouldn&#x27;t clear it up too much overnite either!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin is very refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li> Got this as a promotion, really like it so far - been using it just before bedtime.</li>
            <li> The acne areas are just not getting angry anymore, so the Body Merry Pro-A Serum is sort of like a happy pill for my face.</li>
            <li> I will update as time goes on for a long-term report on the results obtained, but so far, I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would almost call it a gel-serum because it doesn&#x27;t have the normal consistency of a serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> received one the products mentioned above complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Green tea will help build collagen which will result in more plump youthful looking</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling fresh and renewed.</li>
            <li> I also like that it comes in a dark colored bottle (important for retinols and really any serum).</li>
            <li> Saw no changes and bottle was not filled to top.</li>
            <li> After trying several products and pretty much giving up hope of finding one that would help</li>
            <li> She said she can definitely see an improvement in her skin tone, her face feels fresh</li>
            <li> Then I do my normal makeup routine.</li>
            <li> The skin appears to be more firm around my cheekbones and eyes as well as my complexion being clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Switched to this serum from the normal serum I had been using.</li>
            <li> and i love green tea.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is infused with Green Tea, not tested on animals and is made in the USA.  </li>
            <li> I love how this makes my skin feel,,have been using it for a few days and</li>
            <li> After putting more on that spot I think my skin doesn&#x27;t flake off the pigment anymore, instead it stays a pale brownish color.</li>
            <li> One drop for left side of face/neck and one drop for the right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for one month, and I can see an improvement in my skin, it does seem to tighten up the lines, &amp; the tightest of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;However I really haven&#x27;t seem too much improvement on my sun spots which is my main concern.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Retinoids are actually parts of Vitamin A that unclog pores and boost collagen making wrinkles and fine line visibly smaller.</li>
            <li> But I primarily use this one in the morning in a combo with other creams.</li>
            <li> I was able to notice the difference in few days where the fine lines were diminish and pores where less visible.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed Esthetician, so I do facials etc all day, and I get compliments on my skin every day which is something new for me.</li>

            <li> noticed that after I have put this serum on my new acne, after a day or two the acne would disappear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to this serum.  </li>
            <li> (I have a new baby, so I basically look like the crypt keeper).</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> product treats wrinkles, fine lines, discolorations or dark spots, as well as acne blemishes.</li>
            <li> Its not as thick as it looks, its actually more of a gel and sticks to the bottle really well.</li>
            <li> using a Retinol Product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol is an exfoliating ingredient, meaning it will constantly reveal soft, fresh skin.</li>
            <li> using a Retinol Product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol is an exfoliating ingredient, meaning it will constantly reveal soft, fresh skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many serums and spent big dollars with no visible results.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to find any kind of  &#x27;miracle&#x27; product, but I have noticed subtle improvement around my eyes and on my hands.</li>
            <li> Of course any product that offers wrinkle and line diminishing takes more than just a few weeks of use to fully notice those results.  </li>
            <li> My reason for purchasing this product was two fold - i wanted to see if using a product that had the added Hyaluronic Acid would tame down the retinol that I have found dries my skin and also I was impressed with the other reviews who gave this a high review.</li>
            <li> Good product if you have skin issues and your skin is not sensitive ...harsher than other such serums I have used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bumped it down a star because I was hoping to lose a couple of fine lines around my eyes disappear and they haven&#x27;t yet.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I use ROC with retinol, so</li>
            <li> Face feels very soft, reddened areas have lightened.</li>
            <li> I Have very sensitive  skin and was worried that I would break out to this product or it would be itchy.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum, and have recommended it to several friends because it absorbs quickly, has a great smell, and does a good job of moisturizing/plumping skin, but I don&#x27;t see any insanely miraculous changes like other reviewers.</li>
            <li> My nightly routine is to wash with facial cleanser first, then use toner (witch hazel), once the toner has soaked in I apply 3 drops of this serum, let that soak in then follow-up with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin is in EXACTLY the same condition as it was before I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I first had Joe apply the serum to his entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> it makes my face feel really soft and it doesn&#x27;t make it greasy feeling!</li>
            <li> and I see a marked improvement!</li>
            <li> My skin has become clearer and the fine lines are less visible.</li>
            <li> I cannot say it&#x27;s only due to Pro-A as I used it in combination, but I recommend it and already bought 2 more for my friend and my mom.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and glowy!</li>
            <li> but after testing I can definitely tell you that it works and works pretty</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> The other product is not living up to it&#x27;s claims, so I will go back to the Retinol Serum and see if there is more improvement.</li>
            <li> Although I have been using this product for a short time, I have seen results that I haven&#x27;t been able to get with other products.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get this result with other pricey products with no avail, so I&#x27;m excited that I can purchase a inexpensive product that has worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> Received it and directions via email have not used long enough to see change but have used it and smell fine</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, goes on &amp; absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> Of course, price is important and other similar products can cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to apply, just takes a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have a few blemishes and wrinkles and this product improved my skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> I expected the serum to go a long way, but it absorbs so quickly into my skin that I have to use more if it than expected in order to get coverage all over my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You only need a small amount in order for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> Its not too strong, so you can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Already starting to see positive results.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this serum for a little less than 2 weeks and am happy  to have seen results already.  </li>
            <li> and it got to the point where I was able to find similar products for less money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update on my fine lines in a few weeks after I&#x27;ve given the retinol a chance to work its magic.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It contains 2.5% retinol which encourages skin to rid itself of dead cells and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I am shocked by how quickly I&#x27;ve seen results with this product, within two weeks fine lines and acne have cleared up significantly.</li>
            <li> For the price and the potency, it is hard to find a better product.</li>
            <li> Even though 2.5% is a very high amount, I tap whatever is left over on my fingers, around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It also contains Organic Aloe which I am a huge fan of for skin products along with green tea and vitamin E.</li>
            <li> and I have to combine a clear skin, with some topic antibiotics and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not cause dryness, redness or peeling or any irritation like old Retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Pro-A Serum has no scent, so if you are sensitive to smells, this is a product for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The serum is made in an FDA registered and GMP compliant facility in the USA, developed with Cruelty-free testing- never on animals.</li>
            <li> It does not contain Parabens, Sulphates, Phthalates, Fragrances or Alcohol.made in an FDA registered and GMP compliant facility in the USA, developed with Cruelty-free testing- never on animals.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 60 year old mother.</li>
            <li> I had a couple of complete strangers comment on my skin.</li>
            <li> makes my face so soft</li>
            <li> Leaves my face soft</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I noticed my skin felt smoother and looked clearer or brighter.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> Also, I was worried about applying a serum on my oily skin during the day but the serum actually helps control some of the oil and my face is so much smoother.  </li>
            <li> It really is a natural product.</li>
            <li> I maybe thirty-three years old, but I work in the cosmetology business</li>
            <li> I think I have been applying too much because its suppose to last a couple months.  </li>
            <li> When it completely absorb you should follow with your choice of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin tone has been very even since starting.</li>
            <li> My face looks considerably smoother and well hydrated and also it control the in-grown hairs.</li>
            <li> My profile picture was taken this year and I&#x27;ll confess that I&#x27;m 57 years old</li>
            <li> After using product for about 4 weeks, I&#x27;m beginning to notice brown spots fading, wrinkle reduction, &amp; diminished appearance of old acne scars.</li>
            <li> This definitely made my skin feel much softer.</li>
            <li> Truly, I think this will help even my 68 year old wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how my skin reacted to this serum.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are all natural and NOT tested on animals.</li>
            <li> so far I like the feel of serum on my face.</li>
            <li> but so far its making my face feel softer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mid 30&#x27;s guy, and don&#x27;t really care about my skin.</li>
            <li> I am 67 years old with a lot of Sun damage.</li>
            <li> I am 69 years old and using this morning and at night.</li>
            <li> no adverse reaction to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I can put it directly on my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Still early to tell.</li>
            <li> I received my product and so far I like it a lot..</li>
            <li> my skin is clearer and radiant soft feel and diferenciacada day goes on</li>
            <li> I did not get the chance to try the product yet since it is sun sensitive and,</li>
            <li> I bought this based off a recommendation of my sister and based on the fact that we have completely different skin types, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve cut my cost considerably.</li>
            <li> I can say it this product works as retinol should and has not dried it out or caused my face to break out.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was very pleased!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The letter from the founder of the company is very helpful and explanatory on how to use the serum properly.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>

            <li> and I have fairly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so far it seems to make my skin feel smoother.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I like it so far</li>
            <li> If my skin improves over the next few months, I will update my review. :)</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30s, very concerned about aging skin, but still dealing with breakouts (which are now hormonal and more cystic in nature.)&lt;br /&gt;My deciding factor on purchasing this serum was that it is one of the few that contains both 2.5% retinol (the highest available in any product) and hyaluronic acid, plus green tea, vitamin E, and other organic oils.</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that it is natural and part of a small business!</li>
            <li> It seems to be a gentle product, very faint pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> so it sinks right into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or stickiness.</li>
            <li> As a 50 year young African American woman , I wanted to be able to maintain my skin elasticity and be proactive about keeping the wrinkles away for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> instantly i saw my skin become less red and more supple</li>
            <li> you can apply your makeup pretty much immediately without it getting cakey or uneven.  </li>
            <li> so these products are definitely fun to try and see what will help to maintain my youthful appearance for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> I have used other Body Merry products and I am just as pleased with this serum as I was with their other products.</li>
            <li> A little goes along way, so the bottle will last me over 2 months easy.</li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive skin, but I regularly use retinol products, so I was quite surprised by this reaction.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> If it burns or itches too harshly, immediately remove with cool water and discontinue use.</li>
            <li> first appreciated that this product had not only retinol but other antioxidants within one bottle!</li>
            <li> Only been using it for a week but already seeing the typical minor peeling of the top layer of skin.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed upon receiving this serum was that it looked super thick in the bottle!</li>
            <li> Then I apply a gentle moisturizer (sometimes retinols can dry the skin, I haven&#x27;t noticed whether this serum does as I always follow with a moisturizer).</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am cautious using any retinol products as they make my skin red for hours.</li>
            <li> I definitely have noticed some of fine lines disappearing and my between the eyebrow furrow lines are noticeably less deep.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few days, but my first impression is Really Like.</li>
            <li> I definitely like this product so far!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I see a significant difference but will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I started using every OTHER day for exactly a week.</li>
            <li> The dark circles under my eyes are less prominent.  </li>
            <li> I think my skin has become smoother and some fine wrinkle lines are slowly diminishing.</li>
            <li> this bottle or others are it really will go and last a long time</li>
            <li> Since the birth of my son 10 years ago I had been having trouble with adult acne and this serum has really made that clear up.  </li>
            <li> It also set itself above competitive products that were nearly twice the cost.</li>
            <li> Although this did not remove all my wrinkles - I am 56 years old and there are simply consequences to aging -</li>
            <li> but I feel like my wrinkles and not as apparent.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my wrinkles are fling in and are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, especially around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> This Serum left my skin feeling soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this for about three weeks, so I can&#x27;t speak to what the long-term effects will be as far as wrinkle reduction.</li>
            <li> It also has a yellowish tint and is thick and the smell is light and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> It did not make my skin feel dirty or oily either which is also good.</li>
            <li> It is easy to discern the two because the night product is in a dark brown bottle with grey label and the day product is in a blue bottle with blue label (hint:</li>
            <li> and I know that my continual use will only help my smile wrinkles become less noticeable.</li>
            <li> My laugh lines around my lips are less noticeable after only about a month of applying, day and night!</li>
            <li> a few drops of the Body Merry Pro-A Serum to your fingertips and apply to your skin, don’t forget to get right up under your eyes</li>
            <li> a few drops of the Body Merry Pro-A Serum to your fingertips and apply to your skin, don’t forget to get right up under your eyes</li>
            <li> This serum is seriously hydrating, and is helping with smoothing the fine lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li> when i first put it on after washing my face my face tingled which was completely odd to me</li>
            <li> intend on inquiring about other products they sell because i appreciated their concern about my purchase</li>
            <li> So far, no change on the deep wrinkles on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> It also did not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I used it on a little spot at first</li>
            <li> old female and am starting my second bottle.</li>
            <li> (For reference, I have normal skin that&#x27;s not very prone to breakouts.)</li>
            <li> First I washed and dried my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> My skin tone looked more even and it overall made a dramatic change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have two small acne right now, one on each cheek, none around my mouth or on my chin.</li>
            <li> My skin has not been this clear in a very long time.  </li>
            <li> (normally it takes at least 6 weeks to see any changes in my face from new products as I&#x27;ve been a sun worshiper for 50 years the old school way, ie: prior to sunscreen... you&#x27;d never know it now!)</li>
            <li> I am 42 years old and suffer from dry, itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for the past few weeks and my skin looks and feels more balanced and radiant.  </li>
            <li> also put some serum on my dark spot, and when I first put some on, it seemed like some layers of my epithelium flaked off on my dark spot, and made the dark spot more pale.</li>
            <li> it actually had to be worn with a UV protection on a daily basis, so it is simply not a good fit for me.</li>
            <li> The only reason I haven&#x27;t given it 5 stars (yet) is because I haven&#x27;t bee using it long enough to see a marked difference in my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> And as a tip, if you&#x27;re serious about getting rid of those annoying wrinkles...I Highly recommended using WITH the retinol moisturizier for best results!</li>
            <li> Oh, and it really does reduce dark spots!</li>
            <li> But we all need to be realistic that no serum will completely reverse time, but I think this serum will actually help improve the look of the skin with continued use and seriously slow the aging process.</li>
            <li> what I find is most of them are very thin and watery feeling.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I notice a dramatic difference, but it makes my face feel smooth</li>
            <li> I am not sure that this serum did much for either of those areas, however, I had stretch marks/wrinkles</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money on several, more expensive serums.</li>
            <li> After using the serum for the past week, the skin is MUCH smoother in that area and appears to be tightening up on my neck and under my chin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 63 year old woman who has some wrinkles, a couple of dark spots and some forehead creases.</li>
            <li> One of the dark spots is much lighter, the other one has changed.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to notice results</li>
            <li> Also stopped using it lately, as the skin got very itchy and red, symptoms of allergy.</li>
            <li> People with less sensitive skin may not have a problem.  </li>
            <li> Definitely wait for it to dry before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not very strong but still works with no down time required.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much of a smell with the Pro A Serum, at least none that I could my finger on.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks every morning and night and my skin is amazingly clear.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to see what it is going to do in the long term.  </li>
            <li> is eliminating a few wrinkles I have near my eyebrow area.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be a long time customer!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really do not see anything different.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it that long...</li>
            <li> The texture of my skin has improved, the rough tiny bumps on my forehead are gone and it feels softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> After I wrote it I took a long stare in the mirror and realized I need to correct my review.</li>
            <li> I am only 25 but tanning for 9 years drastically aged my skin.</li>
            <li> In this two piece set you will find the Hyaluronic Dew Serum, which is made from professional grade vegan hyaluronic acid made with Vitamic C &amp; Green Tea.</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients include: Vitamins C and E, green tea, jojoba oil and polysaccharides.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wait for a long time before putting on my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but my skin is not nearly as flaky as with Retin A.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a few weeks to do my review, although I would have written a glowing review after the first few days.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak on the wrinkle part since I&#x27;m in the prevention faze, but at the rate it&#x27;s going, I&#x27;ll doubt I&#x27;ll have to worry as long as I&#x27;m using this!</li>
            <li> The results - recovery in no time after peel, wrinkles disappeared, even the deep one on forehead - it&#x27;s 2 times smaller, those little breakages - they are almost all gone (in 1 month - 3 home peels and about 20 days of Pro-A use).</li>
            <li> The serum contains no fragrances when placed upon the skin and does not have the burning sensation due to the lack of alcohol that a lot of facial cleansers and lotions contain.</li>
            <li> I can actually read all the ingredients without it looking like a foreign language</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a  fan and will definitely be trying out some other skin care products from this line.</li>
            <li> have extremely dry sometimes flaky skin</li>
            <li> have extremely dry sometimes flaky skin</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> It absorbs effortlessly and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin (I use it on my face and neck).</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I am not new to retinol.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was the Retinol Serum or a combination of things, but I have seen clear improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have dark spots/acne scars all along my cheeks, chin, between my nose and upper lip and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The dark spots are starting to lighten and the texture of my skin is getting smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother, softer and in a few weeks my frown lines are barely there.</li>
            <li> Some of my acne spots have lightened and it&#x27;s actually helped to lessen the amount of blemishes I get and cuts down on the amount of time I have them.</li>
            <li> and I hope it&#x27;s slowing down the aging process if it&#x27;s not reversing my deep wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It nourishes and adds moisture to my perpetually dry skin as well!</li>
            <li> I typically applying it in the morning and night before a moistizuer and also apply a cleanser prior to those.</li>
            <li> I think this will last me about a month and a half with usage 4-5 days a week.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m seeing slight results already and have only used for a week.</li>
            <li> This product turned my skin from dull, dry, flakey and lifeless to soft, dewy, glowy and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but I&#x27;m a middle aged woman</li>
            <li> need a little extra help.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a little over a week, but already I see a change in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> so my skin isn&#x27;t dry and peeling or irritated like it has been with other retinol products.  </li>
            <li> Amazing when used as a base under makeup.</li>
            <li> Given that this may sound crazy but</li>
            <li> Not really sure have not had it long enough</li>
            <li> This serum is  “thick”, so a few drops will cover the whole face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product daily for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I had a few questions and received immediate personal assistance from Body Merry.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s not much hope for miracles -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, just once daily.  </li>
            <li> well.would tell anyone to try this if they were curious about benefits of retinol.</li>
            <li> After a few days I noticed I was getting rid of the &amp;#34;winter dullness&amp;#34; and now a few weeks later, I have actually seen a decrease in my forehead wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Ive only used this for a few days now</li>
            <li> or maybe I expected overnight results, but I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t had any success with this product.  </li>
            <li> On day one, I expected to feel that tingle that in my head means it’s working.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later I received another e-mail checking in to see how things were going</li>
            <li> With both the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and the Pro-A retinol serum, I had absolutely no reaction.  </li>
            <li> The fact that I told four friends about this product after only using it for a few days says everything.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different serums and</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s only been a few weeks</li>
            <li> A few minutes after application the wrinkles are even further diminished.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are starting to look less define Do!</li>
            <li> I am new to using serums in the past few months</li>
            <li> Ive had weird experiences with some serums and they leave a sticky feeling on my skin or didnt absorb right away.</li>
            <li> ,small surface bumps vanished after a few short weeks of adding the Retinol Serum to my daily skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I started slowly using every other day due to sensitive skin with rosacea.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it does not sting because of the hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> They fill the bottle up too, and little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This serum left me walking around with skin that felt moisturized and not irritated or dry in the least as some serums can do.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin like some other retinols have.</li>
            <li> It had the help of my other two products.</li>
            <li> I tried every other day applications and it didn&#x27;t seem to matter.</li>
            <li> AS SUGGESTED AND USED IT EVERY OTHER DAY TO PREVENT IRRITATION.</li>
            <li> I was trying to read the reviews to get and idea and hear other people opinions about the quality of the product .</li>
            <li> I have been using it every other day for about two weeks.  </li>
            <li> This had the highest concentration of vitamin A and other organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> And you can ask my husband I have tried everything  and no difference with any other one.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, I&#x27;m probably getting the same results if not better.</li>
            <li> This serum is vitamin A as compared to other serums I have used with vitamin C.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll check their other products....</li>
            <li> Definitely helped with small eye wrinkles and my brown spots.</li>
            <li> You also really only need a drop on your finger tips so as small as you may think</li>
            <li> so then I started using every other day for about 6 days (with no skin reactions) and then have been using it every day since then.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for 10 weeks.</li>
            <li> After only a few weeks of use(&amp; I still have 1/2 of the bottle left,Yah!)</li>
            <li> Other hyaluronic serums I&#x27;ve used are sticky and flake after I apply my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin is usually very dry especially in the winter, so being in the thick of it at the moment</li>
            <li> When applying this serum it feels a little sticky but dries instantly helping to firm your skin.</li>
            <li> Oh, and a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> It has a slight scent, but its not really a \\&quot;fragrance\\</li>
            <li> I get a slight pink color but</li>
            <li> This bottle lasted a little over half as long as the prescription creams, but it&#x27;s still a bargain.</li>
            <li> i have bought chemical peel, as my skin due to climate change, stress and may be hormone disbalance, went berserk and became oily, blotchy, wide pores, and tons and tons of little breakages.</li>
            <li> As with the other products &amp;#34;Hyaluronic Acid Serum and Eye Cream for Dark Circles&amp;#34;  I have recorded.  </li>
            <li> , I had small patches of rough and dry skin,.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wrinkle serum for about a month and a half now, and i can definitely see small differences in my face.  </li>
            <li> The serum is very thick and clear.  </li>
            <li> so it is less drying that other retinol serums.</li>
            <li> I regularly get pimples and blackheads and buildup on my nose which is hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Feels a little weird putting on at first.  </li>
            <li> My dark spots are fading...</li>
            <li> After allowing time for product to work, I saw a dark spot fade away.</li>
            <li> No flaking, and after 3 weeks of use my skin seems somewhat firmer, but am still waiting for the dark spots to lighten which I am told should start happening in another month.</li>
            <li> The eye cream has helped with my wrinkles, dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> My face is extremely delicate and have used several products that have not tolerated</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 1 month in combination with the Eye Cream for Dark Circles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed dark spots have been lightening and the creases by my mouth have been smoothed.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate this product, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> i like how it helps your skin with dark spotsand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and makes my skin feel so soft..</li>
            <li> I like that this product is thin, not heavy.  </li>
            <li> my new little secret</li>
            <li> After about two and a half weeks of using the Retinol Serum, I can see the dark circles under my eyes lightening up, the dark spots on my skin fading, and I haven&#x27;t had one breakout.</li>
            <li> Watered down.</li>
            <li> No more dry skin and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> because i am not really used to professional grade anything after trying it for a few days the results were completely dramatic nothing has touched my face like this.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;ve had less breakouts than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Made my lines smoother and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> and anyways he loves being my test subject</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are also less noticeable.</li>
            <li> After using the retinol serum for almost one month I can see a slight difference in the deepness of the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My skin is firmer and my lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> The lines on my forehead and around my lips are less noticeable even in my neck area.</li>
            <li> I did not experience any redness or irritation as I had with previous retinol products.</li>
            <li> Skin has been less oily, too.  </li>
            <li> No afternoon sliding or melting off into a shiny mess from the Florida heat!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Our skin is a little tougher on products like this, but after a month I have seen improvement in skin tone and feel.</li>
            <li> THERE IS A LITTLE TINGLING SENSATION AFTER APPLICATION</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve been using the serum a little over a month.</li>
            <li> I use a night moisturizer after I apply this product (after it dries out) because it does dries up your skin a little (because of the exfoliation process).</li>
            <li> my wrinkles the little ones I did have</li>
            <li> little &amp;#34;cracks&amp;#34; by my eyes are smoothed out and around my mouth is a little tighter as well.  </li>
            <li> The wrinkles on the rest of my face are also a little smoother.</li>
            <li> so it has been a little drying</li>
            <li> Retinol products use a variety of &amp;#34;carriers.&amp;#34; In the past, the retinol in other products worked but either dried my skin or caused it to break out.</li>
            <li> It is suppose to visibly reduces the appearance of pigmentation, blemishes and other spot as well as help with unclogging pores, reduce acne marks and minimize breakout!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and my skin did not react badly while using this at all, no rashes, burning sensations or red skin.</li>
            <li> that sink into your skin for a few seconds&lt;br /&gt;Apply</li>
            <li> that sink into your skin for a few seconds&lt;br /&gt;Apply</li>
            <li> In a few days, I started to see the difference.</li>
            <li> IT TAKES A FEW MINTUES TO ABSORB</li>
            <li> OVER ALL I WILL CONTINUE TO USE AND UPDATE MY REVIEW IN A FEW WEEKS</li>
            <li> I use this retinol serum with my hot/cold infuser at night time, day time I just use a few drop and massage onto face.</li>
            <li> I also notice that my skin color is lighter, I think it might be the green tea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months, and don&#x27;t go a day without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Retinol Serum from Body Merry for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t felt any drying at all &amp; even though it&#x27;s 2.5% retinol it doesn&#x27;t seem harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> The formula does not contain any harsh chemicsls.</li>
            <li> I let in soak in for a few minutes</li>
            <li> With in a few days of using I could tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> I notice a difference in moisture retention as well as my pore size and how it has smoothed out a few of my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I am liking this product, it is producing results I wanted without being harsh on my skin.  </li>
            <li> The serum smells like green tea, and it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li> well, flustered because my breakouts are gone and my trouble areas are under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week</li>
            <li> I must admit, every anti-wrinkle cream I&#x27;ve  ever boughten proven  to be a waste of money</li>
            <li> This product caught my attention because it is infused with green tea</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> This is a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use and update results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Uneven blotches,larger pores</li>
            <li> I had a small scar on my face that in a month it reduced to half its size</li>
            <li> Not at thick a other retinol serum that I have used</li>
            <li> If you are a first-time user to Retinol you should start out slow to using it, try every other night to see how your skin is adjusting to it.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily &amp; not at all greasy</li>
            <li> least expensive that I&#x27;ve bought so far).  </li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t even move in the bottle, so I was a little worried!</li>
            <li> This review might sound crazy, stupid maybe all of the above and some.</li>
            <li> You will also need to apply sunscreen during the day and avoid excessive exposure to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference in just a few days!</li>
            <li> The creams I&#x27;ve used in the past by prescription did the job, but at $180 a tube.  </li>
            <li> There has not been aby excessive drying or itching as I thought there might be, but</li>
            <li> The spot is still present, but difficult to see unless you look for it.</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks, no more tightness.  </li>
            <li> This item is something to definitely stand behind!</li>
            <li> but no magic is happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure of this product.  </li>
            <li> Shown a small difference with my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Believe me you won&#x27;t  be disappointed, just be patient, be consistent  and give it the time to work.</li>
            <li> The wrong chemical at all can leave me sore and red for days.  </li>
            <li> There is no more oily look, no more pimples or lines on her face.</li>
            <li> but they are less noticeable and not getting any worse.</li>
            <li> was wary about it at first because my skin usually reacts badly to oil</li>
            <li> Honestly I&#x27;m not keeping that close a tabs on how it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> There is a slight floral scent, but very subtle, that dissipates after application.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any dryness or negative reaction to this serum</li>
            <li> Sort of leaves an oily residue if used to thick.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a slow improvement in my wrinkles around my eyes and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I started out slow (as recommended) to see how product would react on my skin.</li>
            <li> usually nothing works!  </li>
            <li> The dropper with the glass bottle makes getting every last bit of product out very difficult.</li>
            <li> my skin usually looks worse in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because of all the hype</li>
            <li> I never have pimples anymore (the occasional once a month) but never as bad as it was.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the instant results.  </li>
            <li> My problem has always been the same, hurts:(  over time, redness peeling etc.  </li>
            <li> Like, syrup thick!</li>
            <li> It is very thick.</li>
            <li> The consistency is that like a gel or very thick serum</li>
            <li> waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Have not experienced any skin redness or sensitivity.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s addicted to this stuff now..</li>
            <li> have already seen a difference in my skin, my break out areas have significantly decreased if not cleared altogether, my skin also looks tighter &amp; brighter.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, but I hate the greasy feeling of some serums/lotions.</li>
            <li> It should never, however, be irritating or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to be unfair.</li>
            <li> BUT NOTHING UNCOMFORTABLE..</li>
            <li> I am in the \\&quot;over 40\\&quot; age category and sadly the wrinkles were creeping up on me.  </li>
            <li> Another failed product.</li>
            <li> and it has a weird texture.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly skeptical of claims made by beauty products, so I did my research before buying this one.</li>
            <li> I thought it would leave a weird film on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am unable to say what benefits come from using this product, since I was unable to continue use.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> but I had breakouts like crazy.</li>
            <li> Disappointing</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but I will be ordering another bottle of this!  </li>
            <li> Very sad as the reviews were so encouraging.</li>
            <li> I am 35, so they are not too bad, but I wear my emotions on my face, so I have the &amp;#34;what lines&amp;#34; across my forehead, and the disapproval line between my brows.</li>
            <li> To me, my skin is bad.</li>
            <li> i was completely shocked when i tried it</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the product</li>
            <li> Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don’t hate saying it</li>
            <li> My face broke out horribly.</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this serum.  It is very thick. I put it on with another oil (argan) so that it covers more of my face.  I have not used it long enough to notice results but I like the smoothness and how well it absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li> Been using since March 30, here&#x27;s what happen:&lt;br /&gt;Not even one pimple + brown spots faded + bumps under skin gone 80% + smooth skin + acne scars gone much smaller + no more dry skin + very happy skin + no need to pick on my skin anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not cause dryness, redness or peeling or any irritation like old Retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you must use SPF 30 or higher at day.&lt;br /&gt;At this price, you have nothing to loss....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product daily for a few weeks.  I see an incredible difference in my skin - it looks smoother and brighter.  I love the feel as well!!  Great product.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of my skin when I put this on.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed upon receiving this serum was that it looked super thick in the bottle! Like, syrup thick! It wouldn&#x27;t even move in the bottle, so I was a little worried! Its not as thick as it looks, its actually more of a gel and sticks to the bottle really well. I would almost call it a gel-serum because it doesn&#x27;t have the normal consistency of a serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the gel-like consistency, this serum really melts into your skin. All you need is a pea-sized bead on your finger to apply to your whole face. It doesn&#x27;t run like some serums and it doesn&#x27;t sit on your skin. It has a slight scent, but its not really a \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; so you won&#x27;t notice it during or after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway. What I love about this is that it contains more than just retinol. Retinol is awesome, but it can irritate your skin and take a long time to see results. With Body Merry Pro-A Serum, you see results quickly. You&#x27;ll notice your skin retains moisture better and your skin tone starts evening out quickly. After using this for a couple weeks, my skin feels moisturized longer and I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;ve had less breakouts than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen a drastic reduction in fine lines or wrinkles, but retinol isn&#x27;t something that works immediately. If you&#x27;re interested in this product for wrinkles or fine lines, I&#x27;d recommend using it for 10-12 weeks before deciding whether it works for you or not. I&#x27;ll update on my fine lines in a few weeks after I&#x27;ve given the retinol a chance to work its magic.&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
            <li> Pro-A Serum and Hyaluronic Dew. Both of these products are gel dispensed with a dropper. It is easy to discern the two because the night product is in a dark brown bottle with grey label and the day product is in a blue bottle with blue label (hint: blue skies you can see in the morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro-A Serum is a 2.5% retinol and hyaluronic acid gel designed to be used on face and neck in the evening before retiring for the night. This way the full benefit of the product is taken advantage of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product felt good on my skin and I had no adverse effects from using it. The Body Merry product did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review. Opinions expressed are solely my own. I was not compensated for this review.</li>
            <li> the texture in my face feels very good. I recommended it.</li>
            <li> This has eyedropper lids so you never need to worry about pouring out too much product. The consistency is that like a gel or very thick serum so it sinks right into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or stickiness. It&#x27;s great to apply morning or night as you can layer your moisturizer and makeup right over the top.&lt;br /&gt; I really liked using the 2.5% retinol serum at night but you can use it morning or night.  When using these products I definitely noticed a difference in my skin. It was brighter and looked moisturized. My skin tone looked more even and it overall made a dramatic change in my skin. I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s so I don&#x27;t have any fine lines or wrinkles but even so my skin looked amazingly better using this product. I told my mom who is in her 60&#x27;s to try it out, unbenonst to me she started using both products and after about a week she didn&#x27;t have any makeup on and I complimented her on how pretty her face was. She told me she had been using the bottles of Hyaluronic Acid Serum + 2.5% Retinol Serum under her moisturizer and she couldn&#x27;t believe the difference they had made in such a short amount of time. We are now both big fans of body merry products and will continue with more of their products in the future!&lt;br /&gt; In conclusion, every [body merry] product I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try has simply been fantastic and I recommend this brand to everyone looking for a quality skincare system.&lt;br /&gt;I received one the products mentioned above complimentary for testing purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Body Merry Pro-A Serum is a Retinol and Hyaluronic Acid serum used to gently smooth and hydrate the skin. I have been using this product on my face and neck twice a day for a few weeks and it has absolutely made my skin bright and youthful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Merry Pro-A Serum Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plant derived Hyaluronic Acid: A great moisturizer for the skin, known as a “water binder” it will hold up to 1,000 times it’s weight in water! That will help drive moisture deeper into the layers of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic Aloe: Natural skin moisturizer to keep your skin nicely hydrated, it contains Vitamins E and C which help fight the signs of aging by firming and preventing loss of elasticity. Aloe can also help treat acne because it has antimicrobial properties, meaning it will diminish the bacteria on the skin that cause acne, and it has anti-inflammatory properties that will reduce the redness of acne spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol: Also known as Vitamin A, Retinol is an amazing antioxidant, so it helps fight free radical damage which increases collagen production and makes the skin look more youthful. Retinol can also help diminish the look of wrinkles, sun spots, and acne scars by gently exfoliating the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba Oil: A wonderful skin moisturizer! Jojoba oil most closely resembles your skin’s natural sebum, so it works very well at hydrating, and best of all it won’t clog your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green Tea: Will help prevent the signs of aging because of it’s inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Green tea will help build collagen which will result in more plump youthful looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;The serum itself is a thick gel consistency which I personally love because it doesn’t run all over the place and spill, but it is still absorbed very quickly into the skin. The Pro-A Serum has no scent, so if you are sensitive to smells, this is a product for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanse your skin as your normally would &amp; pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;Apply your favorite toner&lt;br /&gt;apply a few drops of the Body Merry Pro-A Serum to your fingertips and apply to your skin, don’t forget to get right up under your eyes&lt;br /&gt;Let that sink into your skin for a few seconds&lt;br /&gt;Apply your favorite moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Apply sunscreen if it’s daytime!&lt;br /&gt;Use this method twice a day morning and night for radiant, youthful skin!&lt;br /&gt;What Body Merry Pro-A Serum did for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry sometimes flaky skin, so I was very excited to try a Retinol product. Immediately upon the first use my skin was noticeably softer, and after using this product for a couple weeks my skin is incredibly soft and smooth, it is also quite a bit brighter! I am a licensed Esthetician, so I do facials etc all day, and I get compliments on my skin every day which is something new for me. I can’t wait to see what my skin will look like after using this serum for a couple months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using a Retinol Product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol is an exfoliating ingredient, meaning it will constantly reveal soft, fresh skin. After quite a bit of use it can cause some flaking and dryness so be sure to always use a great moisturizer to prevent any adverse reactions. Also be sure to wear sunscreen daily regardless of the weather, this will prevent any sunburns and sunspots!vorite toner&lt;br /&gt;apply a few drops of the Body Merry Pro-A Serum to your fingertips and apply to your skin, don’t forget to get right up under your eyes&lt;br /&gt;Let that sink into your skin for a few seconds&lt;br /&gt;Apply your favorite moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Apply sunscreen if it’s daytime!&lt;br /&gt;Use this method twice a day morning and night for radiant, youthful skin!&lt;br /&gt;What Body Merry Pro-A Serum did for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry sometimes flaky skin, so I was very excited to try a Retinol product.

            <li> Let&#x27;s talk ingredients! This serum by Body Merry has 3 very powerful components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Retinol is a very strong topical derivative of Vitamin A. It helps speed up the rate in which your skin cells turnover- that is, to reveal the freshest layers of skin underneath the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Hyaluronic Acid is an amazing moisturizing ingredient that will absorb the water around it, pulling that moisture deep into the pores. This is why it is best to leave your skin slightly damp after thoroughly cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Green tea is just as good for you on the outside as it is on the inside. It is considered one of the best antioxidants, which means it finds and destroys free radicals, which are basically the &amp;#34;aging cells&amp;#34; in our body that scavenge and multiply, taking over healthy cells and accelerating the aging process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may experience redness or flaking. That is completely normal and a good sign that it is working! It should never, however, be irritating or uncomfortable. If it burns or itches too harshly, immediately remove with cool water and discontinue use. Make sure to avoid the sensitive eye area, as well as the nostrils, ears, and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a small amount in order for it to be effective. The great American adage of &amp;#34;The more, the better!&amp;#34;, does not apply here! Instead think, &amp;#34;Less is more&amp;#34;. The best way to ensure even coverage is to apply a dime sized amount to hands and dot in five places on your face: forehead, nose, each cheek, and chin, then spread evenly over each area of the skin one by one. You will also need to apply sunscreen during the day and avoid excessive exposure to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product treats wrinkles, fine lines, discolorations or dark spots, as well as acne blemishes. This product is a go-to for just about any skin issue you may be experiencing. It comes in a safety sealed brown colored 1 oz. glass bottle with a dropper for dispensing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is made in an FDA registered and GMP compliant facility in the USA, developed with Cruelty-free testing- never on animals. It does not contain Parabens, Sulphates, Phthalates, Fragrances or Alcohol.made in an FDA registered and GMP compliant facility in the USA, developed with Cruelty-free testing- never on animals.

            <li> This serum is the business! Not overly thin, absorbs quickly, and very easy to spread. A little goes along way, so the bottle will last me over 2 months easy. My skin is absolutely glowing, looks more even, and well hydrated. My dark spots are fading... that is the high point for me! I am definitely hooked! I can&#x27;t speak on the wrinkle part since I&#x27;m in the prevention faze, but at the rate it&#x27;s going, I&#x27;ll doubt I&#x27;ll have to worry as long as I&#x27;m using this! Retinol is proven to continue working well after 12 weeks, so this will definitely be a main stay!&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer I received this product free to try, but ALL opinions are my own*</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my skin and my make-up goes on soooo much smoother now. I use this along with Dr. Oz&#x27;s vitamin c serum. It&#x27;s a winning combo! I will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Product is very nice. It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy at all. I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in the fine lines at the corner of my eyes. I&#x27;m 58 years old and have always taken extremely good care of my face and neck. It&#x27;s wonderful to find a product that works and doesn&#x27;t break the bank and 100% guarantee. I strongly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 yo and was researching ways to help protect and enhance my skin.&lt;br /&gt; I found that most people would recommend for my age group - sunscreen (more than spf 15), retinol cream, and a serum.&lt;br /&gt;I first appreciated that this product had not only retinol but other antioxidants within one bottle! This is great to me, because I would rather have one bottle than multiple bottles of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has has very mild acne (I get maybe 0-3 pimples on my cheeks or nose), and I have a darkspot/sunspot on my face, and several acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that after I have put this serum on my new acne, after a day or two the acne would disappear.&lt;br /&gt;I think it helps heal my acne, but I have not seen it improve my acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;I also put some serum on my dark spot, and when I first put some on, it seemed like some layers of my epithelium flaked off on my dark spot, and made the dark spot more pale. After putting more on that spot I think my skin doesn&#x27;t flake off the pigment anymore, instead it stays a pale brownish color. Which is ok, I just put concealer on it...&lt;br /&gt;I have crow&#x27;s feet and some wrinkles under my eyes from not sleeping, but I have not seen an improvement in clearing my wrinkles.  (Which is ok, I am not worried about them, more worried about the acne).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used it regularly for a whole month yet, more on and off for 3 weeks. So I cannot see a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;I use my toner first, then I put on this retinol serum and then apply my Aveeno night cream.&lt;br /&gt;I am also doing this while changing my eating habits to eat more veg/fruit/less meat..so that could contribute to some differences.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 60 year old mother. She said that she likes it. It doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin like some other retinols have. She said it&#x27;s too soon to say if it will give noticeable results, but she likes the way her skin feels after using it and will continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> I started using this in place of retin-a and it seems to be effective.  I had a couple of complete strangers comment on my skin.</li>
            <li> love it. makes my face so soft</li>
            <li> I finished one bottle and just started on my 2nd.  The serum is very nice.  A little goes a long way, and it does not sting because of the hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> Sort of leaves an oily residue if used to thick. Leaves my face soft I think I need to use less to really love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to be unfair. I am not sure if it was the Retinol Serum or a combination of things, but I have seen clear improvement on my skin. I am 61, but I don&#x27;t look my age. Most people say that I look about 50. However, I noticed a few months ago that I started having some lines coming from the corner of my mouth toward the sides of my chin - something that I have see in many women my age and older. I also started seeing fine wrinkles under my eyes - again something I never had before. So, I bought this product along with Vitamin E, 45000 IU, and a cream that contains Hyaluronic Acid. However, I mixed some of the Retinol Serum and some of my Vitamin E Oil in My Anti-Wrincle cream, and I started using it daily, morning and evening. In a few days, I started to see the difference. It&#x27;s been over a month since I have been using this combination and my skin looks radically different. The wrinkles that used to be around my chin and under my eyes have dissipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I give this product only four stars? I don&#x27;t know... Maybe it is because I believe it did not work alone. It had the help of my other two products. So, that&#x27;s my story...</li>
            <li> Save your money with the 100 dollar Serums this is all natural and it works!!!</li>
            <li> Great product skin starts flaking 24hrs later, using it on bikini area. Using it on darker skin it&#x27;s not very strong but still works with no down time required. Pain free</li>
            <li> Great serum, I love the way it feels on my skin.  My wrinkles are starting to look less define Do!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 3 months now.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  I see no difference in my skin since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t a big fan. My face broke out horribly. It stopped once I discontinued the product. I tried every other day applications and it didn&#x27;t seem to matter.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Not at thick a other retinol serum that I have used and I like that. My skin is smooth and glowing. I have received many compliments since using this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Made my lines smoother and less noticeable. It also did not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This serum is very powerful. I love that it addresses acne as well as aging signs. I am in my 30&#x27;s and suffer from acne. I was so relieved to see a serum that addresses all of my skin issues. It left my skin feeling fresh and renewed. It stayed hydrated all day as well. This is definitely on my must have list! I am so glad that I had a chance to review it!</li>
            <li> I find that retinol serums are among the handful of products that make a difference for my skin (along with vitamin C serum, Hyaluronic Acid, a good mild exfoliant and a good sunscreen). I apply retinol in the evening as it is not recommended to use it during the day. Light can damage the retinol so it is generally believed to be more effective to use before bedtime. Retinols can also increase sun sensitivity so it is important to wear a good sunscreen during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it in the evening to clean, dry skin. Then I apply a gentle moisturizer (sometimes retinols can dry the skin, I haven&#x27;t noticed whether this serum does as I always follow with a moisturizer). Then get a good night sleep (sleep is one of the best things for the skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients in Body Merry&#x27;s Retinol include:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Organic Herbal Water&amp;#34;, Organic Aloe, Plant Derived Hyaluronic Acid, Witch Hazel, Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic Jojoba Oil, Wheat Germ Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Organic Green Tea, Wildcrafted Propolis, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this serum as it seems mild (meaning it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin) and seems to have good quality ingredients. I also like that it comes in a dark colored bottle (important for retinols and really any serum). I would prefer a pump dispenser as that decreases the need to open and close the bottle daily.  I received a sample of Body Merry&#x27;s Pro-A Retinol Serum to review. I have tried other products by Body Merry and am usually pleased with this brand.</li>
            <li> I just used it for 2 days and I can see the difference already. My skin is glowing. I definitely want to recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> First off I have to say that I LOVE that Body Mary doesn&#x27;t test of animals. That is a huge huge thing for me. Second... this stuff is amazing. I have tried other Vitamin A products and none of them have felt as good on my skin. I have extremely dry skin and my skin feels wonderfully hydrated after using this product.  LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I have used this oil for a month I can&#x27;t say it has make a difference yet, but I do like how smooth it goes on my skin. I will probably continue to use it and see if it makes any difference.</li>
            <li> In just 2 week my complexion is so much brighter, more even skin tone and pore look much smaller.  My nightly routine is to wash with facial cleanser first, then use toner (witch hazel), once the toner has soaked in I apply 3 drops of this serum, let that soak in then follow-up with a moisturizer. My face feels much smoother as result.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and I think my skin is being refined.  Light, soaks in immediately.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, quality made.  Works well!  I got this on a promotion to provide my experience about it.</li>
            <li> I used it for couple of week already and cannot see any difference. Also stopped using it lately, as the skin got very itchy and red, symptoms of allergy. I still think the product is good but not for my skin.</li>
            <li> Ok. I am not sure where this holy stuff in a bottle come from but it iz #BEAUTIFUL. I put some on my face. A lot. Not recommended but I did it. Like maybe 6 drops all over. The next day I could see an improvement in my face. I did it again the next night and it was like WOW!!! lol. I am not joking. This review might sound crazy, stupid maybe all of the above and some. Yet it remains I am telling the truth. O. I didnt get paid to try it. I purchased on my own after reading the reviews. I jave crows feet and wrinkles on my forehead. I had large pores in my face but after two times of using it my pores SHRUNK!!!! Buy it people!!!</li>
            <li> I am always seeking products to add to my beauty regimen to help minimize and prevent any premature aging. I have come across some good ones and some not so good ones as well.&lt;br /&gt;I love the Body Merry brand, it is one of my favorites! So when I was given the opportunity to try their Hyaluronic Acid free in return for an honest product review I jumped at the opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty happy to try the Hyaluronic Acid. It goes on nice with a very light pleasant scent it easily coats your skin so you don&#x27;t need very much. It leaves my skin bright and radiant throughout my entire day, even under makeup. It does not leave much of a residue. I can feel the antioxidants nourishing my skin. I really feel like I am doing a service to my skin by using this product.</li>
            <li> Great product that works well with my current moisturizer and fantastic service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typically suspicious of serums, but this feels good. It absorbs right away and I like the progress I&#x27;m seeing!</li>
            <li> I started using this product when I was offered it for free for review. Along with many of their other products my skin tone is wonderful and alot of the fine lines have faded away. I love these products</li>
            <li> First let me say that Body Merry is the best company. They provide excellent service and I will definitely keep using their products. The serum is great. My face feels and looks firmer. I&#x27;m so pleased to find a wonderful product that I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Brightens and Smooths skin.  I started slowly using every other day due to sensitive skin with rosacea.  I was pleasantly surprised when I noticed my skin felt smoother and looked clearer or brighter.&lt;br /&gt;Hope improvement continues.  Ordered 2d bottle.</li>
            <li> Probably too soon to tell, but no breakouts or problems with it</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but I did notice a difference within in a week of using it. Very nice. Plus, I like that it is natural, doesn&#x27;t sting, and is gentle on the skin. I will definitely buy this product again. It&#x27;s probably going to be a staple of my skin care regimen. Oh, and it really does reduce dark spots!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she is loving it.  Within just a few days the fine lines are disappearing, and I love the fact that its made in the USA quality and cruelty free.</li>
            <li> This serum is awesome so far! I bought this bottle last week, and have used it for 4 days now. I will update this review at the 6 week mark, but I wanted to go ahead and review it now.  I was shocked at the instant results.  I have tried all sorts of serums, in all price ranges.  All of them come with extravagant promises of youth, but I have never found one that delivered.  Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, after my bottle was delivered, I received a personal email from the owner of the company.  She basically thanked me for purchasing, and added some tips on using the serum.  That is true customer service!!! I used the serum the first night, and I immediately noticed that it absorbed completely, and my face felt so smooth.  The moisturizer I put on top of it also absorbed and my face felt so soft.  The next morning, my makeup went on like silk.  My face looked so bright and just different.  My makeup even seemed to stay on better throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this serum for four days, but I am so happy with it so far.  I cannot wait to see what it is going to do in the long term.  I am really surprised at the reasonable price. I am not in any way affiliated with this company, nor am I being compensated in any way to write this review.  I just want people to know how great this stuff is so far!!!</li>
            <li> Used it every day for 2 months. Absolutely zero change. Nada. Zilch. Would have been better off using mashed banana on face every day. It&#x27;s ok though. Lesson learned. Just finished making my OWN serum. Cost $150 for high quality organic ingredients but will give me 20 bottles worth of product.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the serum. Gentle on my skin and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> only used for a couple weeks now - but of all the serums i have tried i think this is the best.</li>
            <li> Love the serum.  After just a couple days I could feel my face begin to tighten.  Also, I was worried about applying a serum on my oily skin during the day but the serum actually helps control some of the oil and my face is so much smoother.  So so glad I found this product.  I wish I would have discovered it 15 years ago!</li>
            <li> I been using this product about a month. I haven&#x27;t saw any improvement but I keep using expect at some point soon see a difference.  What I can say is that liked the feeling when apply it to my face. I didn&#x27;t want to write a review to give it more time.</li>
            <li> I would like to continue using this product!!</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Does exactly  what it says it makes my skin glow but you have to use a moisturizer.  It gradually  reduces the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This serum has made no noticeable difference in the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> Retinol Serum makes you look younger. I noticed the difference in just a few days!</li>
            <li> I adore this serum. Just one month after starting use n I am happy with the results. It&#x27;s not irritating to my skin at all. I will keep up using this product and only expect results to be better n better.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> Received item promptly.  Am using it as directed.  Results still undetermined.</li>
            <li> This Body Merry drop serum is a miracle. My daughter has a deep crease between eyebrows. Seems to be melting it away. I too have used the brown. So glad to have to spend an arm and leg for my body regime. We both keep purchasing this serum. Thanks so much for making us look and be happier. It really is a natural product. Please make a sunscreen. Life would even bright.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Wife thinks it really works to smooth away wrinkles - asked me to try it, and it really does seem to help.</li>
            <li> Great product! My skin is a lot smoother when I use it. No itch, no residue. I use it with a shea face cream and sun screen. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum, and have recommended it to several friends because it absorbs quickly, has a great smell, and does a good job of moisturizing/plumping skin, but I don&#x27;t see any insanely miraculous changes like other reviewers. I&#x27;ve been following it with a normal moisturizer, and have seen my one super-terrible wrinkle become somewhat less-pronounced, and I can feel it working in my lips if I apply it there, but it&#x27;s not going to un-puff your eyes and make your skin flawless and smooth. Still, other serums I&#x27;ve tried have caused splotchiness and breakouts, and this one only makes things better, so this is definitely the best choice.</li>
            <li> I receive this product a discount for my fair and honest opinion. I&#x27;ve had the product about a week and have noticed some changes in the fine lines around my eyes. I am looking forward to seeing what the following weeks bring!</li>
            <li> I dont think I overused, Read directions, got a rash on my neck.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom and she loves it! Helps her skin look younger and feel great. Smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel on the skin. Great quality product.</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing! it makes my skin tone clearer and and my skin nicely hydrated. i received this complimenatry from the seller for my unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> Its a light serum, I hope it works fine on my face</li>
            <li> This works! After the first day, I had friends comment that something about me just &amp;#34;looked different&amp;#34;. After a couple of days, I noticed my laugh lines were fading and the fine lines by my eyes were diminishing as well! I love the quickness of the results I have seen already!</li>
            <li> Saw no changes and bottle was not filled to top.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this face serum! It actually does what it claims to do. After about two and a half weeks of using the Retinol Serum, I can see the dark circles under my eyes lightening up, the dark spots on my skin fading, and I haven&#x27;t had one breakout. My skin feels amazing as well! I maybe thirty-three years old, but I work in the cosmetology business and I know how it important it is to start early on your anti-aging skin regime. I highly recommend this product &amp; this seller! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is my second jar of night cream and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cd from the mtns.</li>
            <li> I received this just a week ago and so far so good.  I will update my post as time goes on with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received so many compliments after using this product it works and it makes my skin extra smooth and soft</li>
            <li> nice but need more time to see if it works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely dissatisfied with this product...doesn&#x27;t seem to have made any difference, and I&#x27;ve officially used the whole bottle. My skin is in EXACTLY the same condition as it was before I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I think my skin has become smoother and some fine wrinkle lines are slowly diminishing. .i intend on inquiring about other products they sell because i appreciated their concern about my purchase</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff.  It did not irritate my skin, and I did notice a clearer, tighter appearance after about 1 1/2 weeks.  I haven&#x27;t really compared it to anything else, yet.</li>
            <li> so on my 1st bottle very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> As a guy, I&#x27;m in a distinct minority but in my work having a good complexion and aging well are a plus. Our skin is a little tougher on products like this, but after a month I have seen improvement in skin tone and feel. There&#x27;s progress on fine lines, too. It feels great on the skin and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My face feels great, so far.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this product, non-greasy and non-allergenic. My skin is very sensitive but I didn&#x27;t get any reaction from this product.</li>
            <li> Very good stuff!!!  It actually is clearing my skin and usually nothing works!  I will buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully and great with Body  Merry retinol 2.5 surge moisturizer. The 2 together are awesome.</li>
            <li> I RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.  FIRST OFF I HAVE NEVER USED A RETINOL PRODUCTR LIKE THIS SO I DID AS SUGGESTED AND USED IT EVERY OTHER DAY TO PREVENT IRRITATION. I LOVED THE PRODUCTS AMAZING SCENT , YOU NOTICE IT AS SOON AS YOU OPEN THE BOTTLE. IT TAKES A FEW MINTUES TO ABSORB AND THEN I APPLIED MY DAILY MOISTURIZER WITH SPF 30. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AWESOME AS SOON AS I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT THEY EMAILED ME WITH LOTS OF HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS. I HAVEN&#x27;T NOTICED ANY SIGNIFICANT RESULTS YET BUT MY SKIN FEELS SILKLY. THERE IS A LITTLE TINGLING SENSATION AFTER APPLICATION BUT NOTHING UNCOMFORTABLE..OVER ALL I WILL CONTINUE TO USE AND UPDATE MY REVIEW IN A FEW WEEKS</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this has made my skin feel supple again.</li>
            <li> I saw a remarkable difference in the fine lines on my forehead. My entire face looks brighter and smooth. I love it!!  I&#x27;m hooked. I ordered another bottle right away!</li>
            <li> A+++ great product (already seeing results) and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I used it every morning and every night after cleansing my face and throat.  I noticed absolutely nothing.  Very sad as the reviews were so encouraging.</li>
            <li> Great product. Well worth it</li>
            <li> I have been so pleased with Body Merry&#x27;s Pro-A Serum.  It contains 2.5% retinol which encourages skin to rid itself of dead cells and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  I am in the \\&quot;over 40\\&quot; age category and sadly the wrinkles were creeping up on me.  I have been using this for a while now, and can confidently say that not only are the wrinkles being kept at bay but my skin has never looked so fresh! Since the birth of my son 10 years ago I had been having trouble with adult acne and this serum has really made that clear up.  After trying several products and pretty much giving up hope of finding one that would help, I think I have finally found one.  What I absolutely love is that this comes in a generous sized bottle and is dispensed using an eye-dropper.  Although serums can often be oily this one absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving oil or a sticky residue - so ladies you can apply your makeup pretty much immediately without it getting cakey or uneven.  I was offered this product for testing and evaluation purposes; the feedback provided is solely based on my own personal use and opinions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost a month, twice daily and I really like it. Results are not immediate but over time I&#x27;m noticing my skin is brighter and clearer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for one month, and I can see an improvement in my skin, it does seem to tighten up the lines, &amp; the tightest of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;However I really haven&#x27;t seem too much improvement on my sun spots which is my main concern.&lt;br /&gt;But I will order another bottle and I will see what that does?&lt;br /&gt;My skin didn&#x27;t get this way overnite. so the treatment shouldn&#x27;t clear it up too much overnite either!&lt;br /&gt;I do Like the product.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely&lt;br /&gt;Pam&lt;br /&gt;Naples, FL</li>
            <li> I have not seen that much of a difference since i started using it.  Its been almost a month and I apply it twice a day.  I just ordered another bottle because its almost gone.  I think I have been applying too much because its suppose to last a couple months.  I ordered again because I want to give it a good chance.  My mother in law wanted to try it too so I ordered one for her for mothers day.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Love how it has moisturizer my skin.</li>
            <li> I actually tried this on my husband, not because I wasn&#x27;t also using it but because I knew Joey would get much better results than I would, being he is 13 years older than me.  His results would be more drastic than mine and anyways he loves being my test subject lol. I  received 2 products from Body Merry to try out in the same time frame their Pro-A Serum and also their Age Defense Neck Cream.  These 2 products work incredibly well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I first had Joe apply the serum to his entire face and neck. There isn&#x27;t much of a smell with the Pro A Serum, at least none that I could my finger on. The serum is a watery gel texture and will feel much like water or tears on your face when to apply it, this is completely normal.  With the 2.5% retinol, Hyaluronic acid, and green tea, while the Serum is absorbing to get this awesome feeling of freshness. When it completely absorb you should follow with your choice of moisturizer. Or if you have it follow with Body Merry&#x27;s Neck Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Joe did this he could feel the firming and Hydration immediately. You will need to use sunscreen with this Serum. As I always say, you should always use sunscreen no matter what. The Pro A Serum is a retinol serum which means something very important. Retinoids are actually parts of Vitamin A that unclog pores and boost collagen making wrinkles and fine line visibly smaller. They also speed up your cells into healing your own skin. Making your skin clearer, softer, brighter and smoother lines. If you are a first-time user to Retinol you should start out slow to using it, try every other night to see how your skin is adjusting to it. It is the sort of thing that you need to work up to using day and night. So essentially Body Merry&#x27;s Pro-A Serum is a big miracle in a tiny bottle. It is unique in its formula, and I trust Body Merry as a brand. I know they try hard to please their customers by making the best product they can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this Retinol Serum to anyone looking to great real and lasting results from their products. Not all Retinol Serums are the same and I love his one and so does my husband. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product free, ​but that does not change my honest opinion about it.Retinol Serum to anyone looking to great real and lasting results from their products.

            <li> I use this retinol serum with my hot/cold infuser at night time, day time I just use a few drop and massage onto face. It absorbs really fast and I feel my skin is tighter and smooth. I also notice that my skin color is lighter, I think it might be the green tea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW***</li>
            <li> didnt see any significant difference at all...may be its too early</li>
            <li> So far so good feels awesome</li>
            <li> I just started using Retinol Serum for about three weeks. I have noticed a difference already. It goes on nicely with no smell. I didn&#x27;t have any reaction to the Retinol, so I will incorprate this product into my weekly routine. I product provider was very good with a follow up email to be sure I was using the product correctly.</li>
            <li> The thought &amp;#34;snake oil&amp;#34; entered my mind after using product for a week.  The first ingredient is water.  That should alert you to how well this product works.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I wasn&#x27;t sure the Body Merry Moisturizer was doing enough alone and I love both products, I especially love this serum!  I think they are complimentary to each other and works wonderfully under makeup too!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months, and don&#x27;t go a day without it. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this serum!  I&#x27;ve been a long time user of Roc and decided to try a more organic solution... My fine lines are diminished and my skin glows.  Very pleased with the switch!</li>
            <li> Love this serum. Dries rather quickly but that&#x27;s ok because I use an eye gel afterwards. I then use my Lumene brightening day cream. Then Lumene CC color corrector as sort of concealer. Then finish with Lumene BB cream in medium. It&#x27;s like a foundation that helps my skin. I just love the feel of my face since starting the serum. This is an integral part of my daily routine. I&#x27;m told I would get better benefits of I used a derma roller. The ones with the needles, prior to using the serum but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet. I love my routine and have had many compliments since using these products. I just wish I had started at 30 vs 44. But ladies we need to take care of our skin now. You will be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Excellent and very efficient product! Amazing when used as a base under makeup. No afternoon sliding or melting off into a shiny mess from the Florida heat!&lt;br /&gt;Seller actually reached out to inquire about efficacy of product which to me was more important than anything else.</li>
            <li> I wanted To wait a bit before I reviewed so I could really get an idea of the product. So far I love it! The texture is nice and it absorbs very quickly. My skin tone has been very even since starting. I&#x27;m only 24 so I&#x27;m mainly using it for preventative purposes and to help with my congested skin. No break outs and it seems to be doing the job wonderfully! I received the item very quickly and the transaction went well. The seller is very kind and polite. :) My skin is acne prone and combination dry/oily.</li>
            <li> This is quite an excellent product. My face looks considerably smoother and well hydrated and also it control the in-grown hairs. I typically applying it in the morning and night before a moistizuer and also apply a cleanser prior to those. I am quite happy to says I am incredibly proud to have this product that minimize the damages to my face against outside elements and will be looking to buy some more in near the future.</li>
            <li> After 4 months of use this Body Merry Pro A Serum has made a believer out of me. It does a better job of moisturizing than more expensive products. It is easy to apply and absorbs quickly. It has no odor and I experienced no irritation. It did lighten my acne marks and even out my skin tone. It did eliminate some fine lines and reduce the size of larger wrinkles. It stood out from other products I have used by doing a superior job of moisturizing and softening my skin, especially around my eyes. It also set itself above competitive products that were nearly twice the cost.</li>
            <li> I started using this serum about a month ago without any particular skin concerns in mind, just hoping to enhance my complexion before my wedding. After one night, my skin looked and felt suppler and more radiant. I&#x27;ve since gotten lots of compliments! I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. (For reference, I have normal skin that&#x27;s not very prone to breakouts.)</li>
            <li> After reading the positive reviews and finding the price very reasonable I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I have noticed my skin tone even out and glow. Fine lines have diminished and it makes my skin feel smooth and silky without a greasy residue. I do put a moisturizer on top after it dries.&lt;br /&gt;I normally do not write reviews unless whatever im reviewing is justified to do so...this product is awesome and I&#x27;ve already reordered another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;So for what it&#x27;s worth I highly recommend this product and can honestly say it did what I was hoping it would, just short of miraculously making fine lines go away :)</li>
            <li> I have been using retinal face cream since my 30&#x27;s, I&#x27;m now 65.  This serium mixed with vitamin C serium is eliminating a few wrinkles I have near my eyebrow area.  I really love the way my skin feels now, and can&#x27;t wait to see the results in time.  I have started the C first, and have added this now, for 3 days.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I Love this serum....awesome!!</li>
            <li> Works as described. My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> AMAZING. I can&#x27;t even put into words how awesome this serum is. I use it at night mostly, but anytime I wash my face (night time or before makeup application) it makes my face feel really soft and it doesn&#x27;t make it greasy feeling! I have dry skin, but I hate the greasy feeling of some serums/lotions. The only thing I dislike is the dropper. I wish it had a pump. The dropper with the glass bottle makes getting every last bit of product out very difficult. I just finished my 1st bottle but I know there&#x27;s some left in there I can&#x27;t get to and it&#x27;s killing me! I need it! But either way, it makes my skin look amazing, it feels amazing and it makes my makeup look FLAWLESS. I put it on first, let it soak into my skin, then I also use Body Merry&#x27;s eye cream (makes my eyeshadow look SO blended and flawless) then I use my moisturizer and primer and I swear, the combination makes foundation/concealer look flawless every time. This is definitely a holy grail for me! Oh, and a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> As with the other products &amp;#34;Hyaluronic Acid Serum and Eye Cream for Dark Circles&amp;#34;  I have recorded.  After allowing time for product to work, I saw a dark spot fade away.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Retinol Serum I ordered - it has made my skin more supple and the fine lines seem less noticeable.  The price was great, as well!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Absorbs well and smells good.</li>
            <li> Have used it for about 3 weeks.  Seems good enough.  Used it with Vichy night and day creams.  Alittle pricey</li>
            <li> This serum definitely improved my skin.  Dries quickly and leaves skin soft and smooth. I already see a difference and i have just recently started using this product.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see much difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks and I see a marked improvement! I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> This serum goes on smoothly, soaking right into my skin.  The smell is nearly non-existent but pleasant what there is of it.  Honestly I&#x27;m not keeping that close a tabs on how it&#x27;s working but my skin does look great and is silky smooth.  My profile picture was taken this year and I&#x27;ll confess that I&#x27;m 57 years old so what I&#x27;m using(Vit C serums also) seems to be working.  I also always use a 50 sunblock, take vitamins, and drinks lots of water which in combination with the Retinol Serum seems to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt; There are a lot of Retinol creams on the market, but this is the strongest(and least expensive that I&#x27;ve bought so far).  The creams I&#x27;ve used in the past by prescription did the job, but at $180 a tube.  This bottle lasted a little over half as long as the prescription creams, but it&#x27;s still a bargain.</li>
            <li> Using it for about 3 weeks, the skin condition improved nicely. Recommended to my friend, and she has positive feedback also!</li>
            <li> After using product for about 4 weeks, I&#x27;m beginning to notice brown spots fading, wrinkle reduction, &amp; diminished appearance of old acne scars. Have not experienced any skin redness or sensitivity. So far, I am quite pleased with the product &amp; will continue to use it to experience the future benefits to my skin.</li>
            <li> I was trying to read the reviews to get and idea and hear other people opinions about the quality of the product . There are 77 reviews of 4 stars and 38 of the 77 reviews were sponsored, given to review. How am I going to know if this product is good enough to stand by it&#x27;s own, if the quality is decent or if it really works if half of the reviews were for people making a review because they were ask for it, because they got it for free. I feel I can&#x27;t trust amazon costumers reviews anymore.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and it appears to be making a difference. Furthermore, it is unscented which is a great plus as I am allergic to scents.</li>
            <li> Great product! Makes my face feel wonderful :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to this serum.  I bought this about 2 weeks ago &amp; love it.  I use it daily &amp; love the results it has given me. Would definately recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for about three weeks now and she says it has made her face smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> great product! works even better and does not dry out my skin!</li>
            <li> This retinol serum is great! I was a little skeptical because of all the hype but I see now why people love this product. The consistency is gel-like so it is easy to apply and you only need to use 2-3 drops. I can imagine this bottle will last a while since a few drops really does the trick.  My skin is already getting smoother by the day. I use the serum and a moisturizer each morning and night. My skin has become clearer and the fine lines are less visible. I was using ROC&#x27;s retinol product but ROC cannot even compare to what this retinol serum does for my skin.</li>
            <li> Received this free for my review of the product. This definitely made my skin feel much softer. Will have to use a little longer to see how well it changes firmness but love the way it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li> This serum feels great going on. It rivals the Bobby Brown serum I was using prior in its consistency going on and feel to the skin but at a much better price point and with much more effective ingredients. I had a few questions and received immediate personal assistance from Body Merry. No flaking, and after 3 weeks of use my skin seems somewhat firmer, but am still waiting for the dark spots to lighten which I am told should start happening in another month. I read other reviews before purchasing and am happy that the positive review turned out to be correct.</li>
            <li> love how soft it makes my face.</li>
            <li> I used this product both with a toner before and not using a toner before. In a week I noticed my skin was smoother and had smaller wrinkle lines. I didn&#x27;t notice a considerable difference in the size of my pores (which I was hoping would be a pleasant side effect) but I had no expectations of that since this is a wrinkle serum. All-in-all I love it and I know that my continual use will only help my smile wrinkles become less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I am 68 and this is a helpful and safe product.  It is a nice absorbing oil. Truly, I think this will help even my 68 year old wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Retinol Serum from Body Merry for a few weeks now. I&#x27;m an older woman (66) so there&#x27;s not much hope for miracles - but my skin looks a bit more radiant. People keep telling me I look young for my age, but I think they&#x27;re just being nice. Anyway - so far, so good. No bad smell and no side effects.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this serum.  I use it daily after toning my clean skin and then applying moisturizer.  My skin positively glows and it feels so soft.  I&#x27;ve tried many serums and spent big dollars with no visible results.  Body Merry is like a magic potion on my skin.  The first time I used it, it felt wonderful on my face; like silk.  And I love that it is more gel-like than a runny liquid so it&#x27;s easier to apply.  I highly recommend this Retinol Serum.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this serum for that long, but so far seems to help the fine lines go away.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a serum for my skin that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my face.  I have very sensitive skin.  I was pleasantly surprised at how my skin reacted to this serum.  I will definitely be purchasing this product again.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is in need of a great serum that won&#x27;t irritate your face!</li>
            <li> I am a 68 year old male who never really took care of his skin. I was watching a Dr. Oz show with my wife and he mentioned that only retinol products work on wrinkles. So I went to Amazon, read the reviews and settled on this product. The product is easy to apply, just takes a few minutes. I have noticed a slow improvement in my wrinkles around my eyes and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Since I purchased the product I have received 2 emails from the owner making sure I was satisfied and offering to answer any questions I may have...who does that anymore.&lt;br /&gt;For those of you that are looking for a retinol product give this a try. It&#x27;s reasonably priced and seems to work.</li>
            <li> The product is great. It helps restructure your skin, hydrate, rejuvenate and it works the best if used under hydrating cream or mask. It helps to get rid of wrinkles (I would say even deep wrinkles), it helps with pores too. Has no smell, absorbs immediately. In less then a month I have my skin in a condition where I don&#x27;t have to wear makeup as it looks flawless, radiant from inside and generally 10 years younger. I cannot say it&#x27;s only due to Pro-A as I used it in combination, but I recommend it and already bought 2 more for my friend and my mom. I&#x27;m also very allergic and sensitive to many products, this one didn&#x27;t give any allergies.  I&#x27;m writing detailed routine that worked for me.  i have bought chemical peel, as my skin due to climate change, stress and may be hormone disbalance, went berserk and became oily, blotchy, wide pores, and tons and tons of little breakages. Pro-A retinol cannot be used after peel, but on a 3rd day only, and I would recommend to use it under hydrating cream or mask. The results - recovery in no time after peel, wrinkles disappeared, even the deep one on forehead - it&#x27;s 2 times smaller, those little breakages - they are almost all gone (in 1 month - 3 home peels and about 20 days of Pro-A use).</li>
            <li> Received it and directions via email have not used long enough to see change but have used it and smell fine no irritation product seems very nice I got a special deal on it and am very happy so far update used a week seems to help my skin looks smoother</li>
            <li> I gave this to my fianc&amp;eacute; as a gift and she absolutely loves it. She said she can definitely see an improvement in her skin tone, her face feels fresh and she says she can even see a reduction in her wrinkles. I always confirm she has zero wrinkles :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, just once daily.  After cleansing skin at night, I use the retinol serum &amp; then a moisturizer.  I haven&#x27;t felt any drying at all &amp; even though it&#x27;s 2.5% retinol it doesn&#x27;t seem harsh on the skin. I definitely have noticed some of fine lines disappearing and my between the eyebrow furrow lines are noticeably less deep.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and glowy!</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this serum and she loves it we purchased 2 more because she swears by this product. The ingredients are all natural and NOT tested on animals. Easy to use and not oily. She feels good and I am happy. We have several beauty products from this company and will continue to use them. Great product.</li>
            <li> Another failed product. I used every morning with no change after a full month. I wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love Body Merry  right now  I am using the Pro A serum &amp; Age Defense Neck Cream  I&#x27;ve used many Retinol Products and I have to say this is the Best  Also the Neck cream  Really helps with keeping the wrinkles away  I will be buying more of their Products</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but I will be ordering another bottle of this!  I am close to 60 but most people guess my age to be 10+ years younger.  (I was blessed with good family genes!)  I have some sagging around the jaw-line, and my neck is starting to do the turkey waddle!  I am not sure that this serum did much for either of those areas, however, I had stretch marks/wrinkles (Sun-damage?) on my chest right below my neck and as I would smooth the serum down my neck I would also use it on that area.  I have had those marks for years and just thought I would have them forever.  Well, they are gone!  I wouldn&#x27;t wear &amp;quot;V&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;U&amp;quot; - necks, but now I can! I figure if the serum works for tightening that area of skin it must be helping elsewhere! :)</li>
            <li> This is a good serum. I really like the feel of it. This item was received as part of a site of discounted or free items in return for review on them. I do really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It feels very good on my face and is excellent under my makeup</li>
            <li> I started using it as soon as it came in. I noticed it reduced fine lines within the week. I have incorporated it into my daily morning routine. I became a fan of this product within the week. I was hoping not to get an oily serum and it&#x27;s not.. texture is lightweight great even for my oily skin.  The serum blends into my skin and gives it a youthful glow. I will purchase again. Great product and a good value.</li>
            <li> Its my first bottle but so far I like the feel of serum on my face. Great price. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for the past few weeks and my skin looks and feels more balanced and radiant.  Will continue to use, but so far, quite happy with this.</li>
            <li> I prefer the creams but this is a very good RA serum!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few days, but my first impression is Really Like. It goes on easily, dries quickly and is not &#x27;sticky&#x27;. (Why do so many of these serums feel sticky?) I bought this product along with the Body Merry eye cream and the retinol moisturizer. The eye cream has helped with my wrinkles, dark circles and puffiness. And the moisturizing cream leaves my face feeling velvety smooth.  I&#x27;ll give an update in a few weeks and let you know if I&#x27;m still happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have now purchased three bottles of this serum.  I absolutely love it!  Most moisturizers make me break out - even at 70 years old.  I have not had a problem with this, and saw a visible difference within the first week of use.  My lines began to smooth out and my skin appeared younger.  I also gave one to my daughter for her birthday.  She is pleased too - and will buy it again.  I have now tried 4 different products in the Body Merry line but this is definitely my favorite!</li>
            <li> I just resently got this product, but so far I love it. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and moisturized. I am eager to see how it does on my wrinkles over time. I will update my review and let you know.</li>
            <li> I honestly think it doesn&#x27;t do much for the fine wrinkles. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month. It has a pleasant refreshing cool feel. I guess, it won&#x27;t hurt your skin. It&#x27;s definitely mildly hydrating. But overall, my skin looks the same.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I intend to reorder.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Goes on smooth and my skin soaks it up</li>
            <li> Another great product from Body Merry!  Serum is light and easily absorbed and has not irritated my super sensitive skin!  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve been using the serum a little over a month. Some of my acne spots have lightened and it&#x27;s actually helped to lessen the amount of blemishes I get and cuts down on the amount of time I have them. It&#x27;s very light weight, and feels nice on. I&#x27;m very pleased that I have not had any reactions to the serum because my skin is normally very sensitive. I will definitely be a long time customer!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see much of a difference</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have been using it for one month and already seeing a noticeable difference!!!</li>
            <li> Great product.It applies easily ,has a great smooth texture and dries quickly.My skin is very refreshed and soft.This product incorporates hyaluronic acid and green tea which is wonderful for my skin.</li>
            <li> Very good serum for under make up. Very gentle to use. Has noticed some effects on mostly the softness of skin.</li>
            <li> I like this serum a lot.  I have been using it every other day for about two weeks.  I believe I notice a difference in the plumpness and softness of my skin, although it is not as intense and immediately noticeable as with the Hyaluronic Acid and Green Tea morning Dew from Body Merry which is my new favorite face product in my regimen.  I like this company a lot.  After the product was delivered I recieved an email from Body Merry with detailed instructions for using the product and the benefits I should look for.  It also gives you an easy contact in case you should have any questions.  That kind of personal touch is really valuable when ordering skin products online, instead of buying at a skin boutique.  I am looking forward to continueing to see benefits from this product and will update my review when I have been using it for longer.  I think this will last me about a month and a half with usage 4-5 days a week.  It takes about 3 drops to cover my entire face, 4 with my neck and decolette!</li>
            <li> I bought this during&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s summer &amp;#34;black Friday&amp;#34; sale: if the price were always this reasonable, I&lt;br /&gt;would be a faithful and loyal customer. I lOVE the way it makes my skin look and&lt;br /&gt;feel.</li>
            <li> smoother skin,still testing it but so far its making my face feel softer and i can see a bit of  improvement  having to do with the lines.</li>
            <li> No burning or redness and I noticed a difference with in days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mid 30&#x27;s guy, and don&#x27;t really care about my skin. I just dab plenty of this on my face and it becomes kind of stiff, which is what I think people with more wrinkles are looking for. So I have to say it works. I still have to put moisturizing lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle but I really like it. I need a retinol treatment and this works well on my skin, no reaction and it absorbs quickly.  I will definitely order another bottle.</li>
            <li> This retinol serum reduced my wrinkles, fine lines and spots, and improved the softness my skin. The formula does not contain any harsh chemicsls. No fragrances or alcohol. It is made in the USA and is not tested on animals. I am happy to recieve this item to review. It&#x27;s a really great serum.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and outstanding customer service!  I really love the product and feel it has worked well!</li>
            <li> Terrible! Saw no changes whatsoever...waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I had never tried a retinal serum before. After just a week I noticed a huge difference in the firmness of my skin and diminished lines around my eyes. As a health care provider, I have some friends in dermatology. Retinal serums are one of the most evidence based ways to reduce fines lines and wrinkles. Thanks for a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Very nice serum , they ask you to leave a review right after you receive the product but you need time to see how the product will work about a month, so, after a month, I can really say that my skin looks better the next day after using it, I really like it !</li>
            <li> It really makes your skin look great and the price is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as advertised and on time...great experience!</li>
            <li> I like the product very much. There has not been aby excessive drying or itching as I thought there might be, but not.&lt;br /&gt;Face feels clean and not oily after application. Will buy again ehen I need more.</li>
            <li> This is my second review of this Best Retinol Serum.  In the beginning I saw dome results which were good.  Now after using this every night I see fantastic results. You have made a fabulous product.  It has helped my wrinkles and has changed the texture and smoothness of my skin.  I love it. I am 67 years old with a lot of Sun damage. Thank you for your help.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Although this did not remove all my wrinkles - I am 56 years old and there are simply consequences to aging - it did help. I used it in conjunction with hyaluronic acid serum from the same company. My niece, without any prodding from me, mentioned that my skin looked a little better.</li>
            <li> Am very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law is flight attendant and recommended this serum. She said most her coworkers are using it with moisturizer after so they don&#x27;t have dry skin while flying. No more dry skin and wrinkles. I am 69 years old and using this morning and at night. Always follow with cream after. Withing 2 weeks all my friends start asking if I went for Botox. My skin is smooth and younger. First day of application I experienced light burning for about 5 minutes, but not anymore. I am using only 3 drops on my face.  Going this fall to Europe and can&#x27;t wait to try it on plane. Excellent product for incredible price.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent retinol serum. I have been using the t for a month and I already see a difference in my skin, my fine lines are less noticeable and my complexion is more even toned. I like that it has hyaluronic acid so it is less drying that other retinol serums. I definitely intend to repurchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mom after trying sever products similar to this, this one actually worked!!! She loves it and uses it daily. I&#x27;m planning on buying another as soon as it runs out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the retinol serum but the retinol moisturizer did not really do much and it has a weird texture.&lt;br /&gt;I will get the serum again but I have been using the moisturizer on my knees and elbows and will not re-purchase.&lt;br /&gt;4 stars for serum, 2 for moisturizer</li>
            <li> I really do not see anything different. I use it daily and apply spf50. It does have a nice consistency to it. Feels better applying than Sephora&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;Anna</li>
            <li> Love this product! It leaves my skin feeling and looking smoother and has worked on my crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes . Definitely recommend This light weight product that does not clog pores!</li>
            <li> Made my skin softer and improved the look of fine lines</li>
            <li> My skin has been glowing since using this! I am really hoping it will help diminish the darker pigmentation areas with time. I have for sure noticed a reduction in fine lines, especially on my forehead.</li>
            <li> no adverse reaction to my sensitive skin. My face seem to look a bit firmer. no peeling inspite of the strong retinol content. Worth trying..</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this serum. It&#x27;s light enough for after I wash my face just to wear it all day with no issues.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Great product.never really thought of using retinol serum but after testing I can definitely tell you that it works and works pretty well.would tell anyone to try this if they were curious about benefits of retinol.</li>
            <li> I have a few blemishes and wrinkles and this product improved my skin very quickly. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I definitely like this product so far!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I noticed considerable positive changes in my skin. I am 45 years of age.</li>
            <li> I really like the Retinol Seum.  It works excellent!</li>
            <li> The serum is very soft and thick so it feels good and I can put it directly on my wrinkles. i have only been using it for a couple weeks and not every night as sometimes I forget but I feel like my wrinkles and not as apparent. I look forward to continuing to use this serum and seeing what the outcome will be after I finish the bottle. Definitely worth the money thus far.</li>
            <li> Still early to tell. I&#x27;ve been using the serum every day for about one month now. I do find some overall improvement with my skin, especially around my eyes. Skin seems firmer, lines reduced a bit. I&#x27;m highly skeptical of claims made by beauty products, so I did my research before buying this one. This had the highest concentration of vitamin A and other organic ingredients. I use it in the morning- apply to my clean/dry face. One drop for left side of face/neck and one drop for the right. I let in soak in for a few minutes then I apply a SPF face cream. Then I do my normal makeup routine. At the rate I use this product, I would expect it to last for about 3 months, maybe longer.  The company has good customer service. A few days after I received the serum, I received an email from them telling me how to best use the product and warning about sensitivity possibility. I appreciated that info. I&#x27;m giving this a 4 even though it is an early review because (1) I am seeing some positive changes in my skin, (2) the ingredients are good and (3) customer service is good.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great customer service.  My skin is glowing!!</li>
            <li> I am using it with another eye cream on top and it really works well. I saw a definite difference within a month. Buying again when it runs out but this bottle looks like it will last 6 months, maybe more. I am very impressed and recommend it. I&#x27;m looking in the mirror in the morning really seeing a difference, not imagining oh hoping to. Fast and does what it says.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Love this serum.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling great and smells nice</li>
            <li> My wife is using this for a spot on her arm.  I can&#x27;t believe it but it is working.  The spot is still present, but difficult to see unless you look for it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for myself,  the first time.. and I didn&#x27;t get the results I wanted. But my husband Had amazing results with this stuff. So I guess it just depends on how your skin reacts to it. He&#x27;s addicted to this stuff now..</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the product</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like the reviews state.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the very quick delivery - one day! - and the considerate concern and personal follow-up of the store owner.&lt;br /&gt;I like the natural scent, and the smooth feel of the skin after the product absorbs quickly.  I have only used the product for two weeks, so have not noticed any permanent changes yet, but will continue to use it as the skin feels nice and smooth after use.</li>
            <li> I received my product and so far I like it a lot.. It&#x27;s thin and makes my skin feel so soft.. I just started using it so I will see how great my skin will look in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I am very happy to have tried this product. My face is extremely delicate and have used several products that have not tolerated and I had to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;But this merry retinol body is very good my skin is clearer and radiant soft feel and diferenciacada day goes on mirror&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it and I will continue using LVM. my skin every day is better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS BODY MERRY</li>
            <li> I did not notice any visible results from this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this Retinol Serum! I just started using it, but it really does a good job on my skin.</li>
            <li> Not too impressed, perhaps I need to be consistent with it. The vitamin C serum works for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. With in a few days of using I could tell a difference.  And you can ask my husband I have tried everything  and no difference with any other one. I had 2 spots on my face that have been there a year or so..I&#x27;ve as beginning  to think skin cancer.  They are gone..YES I HAVE RECOMMENDED  TO FRIENDS</li>
            <li> This is one of the best choices I&#x27;ve made. This product is just amazing to keep your skin smooth and with that fresh morning appearance. I have many problems with acne and I have to combine a clear skin, with some topic antibiotics and this amazing product was what I was waiting for to make my home recipe PERFECT. It&#x27;s just incredible the effects on my skin, like a real baby skin!!! I Do recommend it</li>
            <li> This stuff works great</li>
            <li> Follow direction on use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 1 month in combination with the Eye Cream for Dark Circles. I have yet to find any kind of  &#x27;miracle&#x27; product, but I have noticed subtle improvement around my eyes and on my hands. I love the way it smells and it leaves my skin feeling tightened and smooth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly amazing. I wanted to wait a few weeks to do my review, although I would have written a glowing review after the first few days. I have very sensitive skin and am cautious using any retinol products as they make my skin red for hours. This serum is smooth, not heavy, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and WORKS! After a few days I noticed I was getting rid of the &amp;#34;winter dullness&amp;#34; and now a few weeks later, I have actually seen a decrease in my forehead wrinkles. I am 35, so they are not too bad, but I wear my emotions on my face, so I have the &amp;#34;what lines&amp;#34; across my forehead, and the disapproval line between my brows. The one between my brows is almost gone, and the lines on my forehead are no longer visible with makeup on... which means the makeup isn&#x27;t settling, which means the wrinkles are diminishing. LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff. I even turned my mom onto it, and she bought a bottle after just two uses just because she loved the way it made her skin feel.</li>
            <li> I did not get the chance to try the product yet since it is sun sensitive and, well it is kind of summertime already !&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had know that prior purchase as it was not mentioned and I have never bought such a product before. it actually had to be worn with a UV protection on a daily basis, so it is simply not a good fit for me. I did benefit this product for free in exchange of my fair review.</li>
            <li> I really like all the products. The company itself is wonderful. I intend to reorder and continue trying all their products!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. My skin is smooth and I&#x27;ve also noticed a definite evening of skin tone</li>
            <li> I think I will really like this serum. I haven&#x27;t been using it that long...but so far so good. I will order again. It isn&#x27;t taking my wrinkles away...but they are less noticeable and not getting any worse. The results are good and the price for this product is affordable.</li>
            <li> Got this as a promotion, really like it so far - been using it just before bedtime. Feels really refreshing and gentle on my skin. Planing on purchasing more after I run out :)</li>
            <li> Ive only used this for a few days now and Im already starting to like it. I thought it would leave a weird film on my skin. Ive had weird experiences with some serums and they leave a sticky feeling on my skin or didnt absorb right away. Thats why I like about this serum it absorbed fast. you dont need a lot. I use it around my eyes and my cheeks mostly. I like using it in the morning because it feels almost cooling and helps me wake up some. Im definitely going to purchase this product again. It could only get better with use.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It feels like I am actually doing something good for my skin. I notice a difference in moisture retention as well as my pore size and how it has smoothed out a few of my wrinkles. I bought this based off a recommendation of my sister and based on the fact that we have completely different skin types, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised! This will always be a part of my skincare regimen and I love the fact that it is natural and part of a small business!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! I noticed a difference after a weeks use!! Will buy again!!</li>
            <li> Not really sure have not had it long enough</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I have sensitive skin and pretty much anything with too much of anything will break me out. But not this product. It absorbs effortlessly and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin (I use it on my face and neck). As a 50 year young African American woman , I wanted to be able to maintain my skin elasticity and be proactive about keeping the wrinkles away for as long as possible. This has been really good for my skin and I would definitely buy it again. I believe that using this along with drinking plenty of water, eating right, getting plenty of rest, and taking vitamins is an amazing combination. I&#x27;m not knocking folks that do Botox and whatever else, but using Best Retinol Serum just makes sense and it doesn&#x27;t break the bank. I use to go to esthetician and pay over $200 every couple of months and it got to the point where I was able to find similar products for less money. This serum is newest addition to my regimen and I&#x27;ve cut my cost considerably. Not to mention, I&#x27;m probably getting the same results if not better. So, KUDOS TO BEST RETINOL SERUM!!!! I will be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> This serum is by far the best Ive used and the best price as well. Ive used serums that costed upwards of 100 and did not have the results ive had with Body Merry. No smell, and absorbs instantly . I had no greasy feeling and i could see a difference instead of waiting months. This stuff is the real deal. Will definatley purchase again</li>
            <li> Enjoying using this product. Not sure if I see a significant difference but will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;Have had no problems with any allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and you feel the results right away.  This is my second  purchase and will purchase again in the future.  It is reasonable priced in comparison to best selling counterparts!</li>
            <li> Bought this serum to put on my legs that are beginning to look &amp;#34;crepie&amp;#34;.  Seems to have made a difference. I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!!! I am almost finished with the first bottle and love the results! it smooth&#x27;s fine lines and give your skin a lovely glow!!!</li>
            <li> this product works really well, I had small patches of rough and dry skin,. moisturizer alone wasn&#x27;t working. however this product underneath is amazing.</li>
            <li> This light non-greasy serum delivers deep, long-lasting hydration and helps prevent wrinkles.I use it at night. My skin looks better!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased thank you</li>
            <li> Fantastic night serum!!!!  If you are not use to using products with retinol, you may notice some tightness or dryness....but once your skin gets use to it, it will balance out.  I use 3 drops and am able to cover my face and neck.  Its light, not sticky and absorbs right into the skin.  I have the day serum, eye cream and night cream as well.  They all work together very well.  I would, in the beginning, you the night serum one night and the night cream the next, until my skin got use to using them.  After about 2 weeks, no more tightness.  I have been using a little over a month and have for sure noticed that the fine lines around my eyes have softened, and my skin looks brighter and more youthful.  Its nice to find a product that is reasonably priced and will actually give you results.  Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really good product. It did not irritated my skin (although I have to mention that I have used Retinol before so my skin has probably adjusted to this type of products). It leaves your skin more radiant. I use a night moisturizer after I apply this product (after it dries out) because it does dries up your skin a little (because of the exfoliation process). I only use it at night, not during the day. I also use a sunscreen with SPF 30 during the day. I am really happy with my purchase and will recommend to others and also purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! I&#x27;ve used almost all of it. It makes my skin evenly toned, soft and smooth. I love Body Merry&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li> really makes your skin feel good and not greasy</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about the difference I can see from using this product.</li>
            <li> As we all know, not all skin, especially facial skin, responds the same to products we apply to it. Retinol products use a variety of &amp;#34;carriers.&amp;#34; In the past, the retinol in other products worked but either dried my skin or caused it to break out. I&#x27;ve only used Body Merry&#x27;s Pro-A Serum for several weeks. I can say it this product works as retinol should and has not dried it out or caused my face to break out. Pro-A Serum has created a product that is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin had cleared up all ready</li>
            <li> I received this as part of a promotion and was excited to test it out. It seems to work, I&#x27;m not quite sure what I expected or maybe I expected overnight results, but I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it every night and my skin looks great! I am a Grandma who is never mistaken for one:)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased if I tried!! There really is a reason that there are so many 5 star reviews on this Retinol Serum. First the fact that you are getting 2.5% retinol Professional grade retinol!!  Next; it has Hyaluronic Acid in it so my skin isn&#x27;t dry and peeling or irritated like it has been with other retinol products.  I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled! My age spots are fading! My skin feels smooth and soft. What more could a 56 year old ask for?!?</li>
            <li> This is very nice stuff  I have been using this and the  Morning Dew also by Body Merry. I really think this is a great way to preserve my skin from aging. It works best on a clean face and  use with consistancy on a daily regimen.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product to review and it&#x27;s one of the good ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More of my reviews at  http://ureadmorebooks.blogspot.com/2014/10/body-merry-hyaluronic-dew-serum-and-pro.html</li>
            <li> I used Jojoba oil for years but it seemed to go out of fashion. This brand blends it with some other skin healthy items. As always I like the consistency of these serums rather than greasy moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item to help smooth some of the fine lines on my face. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin in a relatively short period of time. Just what I was looking for, I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best facial products with retinol out there.</li>
            <li> Using retinol is scientifically proven to improve the appearance of lines on the face. This formula has 2.5% which is what is suggested by most studies- any more it burns, more it maybe doesn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a short trial, I was able to see results of improvement in my skin. I did not experience any burning or redness with this formula. Overall, I was very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for providing a product for review on my blog.</li>
            <li> It realy works good on me, makes my skin soft and smooth, brighten the scars too. Love it.</li>
            <li> Retinol is one of my favorite ingredients for skin care because it is very effective. This serum made my skin feel super soft &amp; youthful looking. I highly recommend it. I received this free of charge for review purposes.</li>
            <li> One of the better products that I have tried,  my skin is noticeably improved.</li>
            <li> I am liking this product, it is producing results I wanted without being harsh on my skin.  I am 71 and my face does not show my age.  It is my intent to keep it that way.</li>
            <li> My reason for purchasing this product was two fold - i wanted to see if using a product that had the added Hyaluronic Acid would tame down the retinol that I have found dries my skin and also I was impressed with the other reviews who gave this a high review. I  am now in my 2nd week of using this product and have so far been very pleased with how my skin feels after I apply. I dont have that tight feeling as I did when I used just the retinol, so using my light moisturizer afterwards is much better than feeling like I have to apply a heavier moisturizer.  My only reason for not giving this product five stars is that I&#x27;m only in my second week of use and so I&#x27;m not seeing a big difference in the appearance of my skin.  But of course there is no way I would see results after only 2 weeks, so I will update my review once I have hit the 5th or 6th week of use.</li>
            <li> I love using the Body Merry Pro-A Serum at night. I like that I wake up with plump, bright, healthy looking skin. The serum smells like green tea, and it&#x27;s not overpowering. It absorbs quickly into the skin and is perfect for anyone that has sensitive skin since it&#x27;s formulated with organic ingredients. I love this serum! I don&#x27;t break out either and that&#x27;s a plus for me since I have acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was given the Body Merry Pro-A Serum complimentary for review purposes. However, the opinions expressed are 100% my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have used it almost two weeks. The texture of my skin has improved, the rough tiny bumps on my forehead are gone and it feels softer and smoother. My makeup even stays on better. I plan to continue using this and I would recommend this product. I did appreciate the seller contacting me prior to beginning using it to insure the best results, that was really nice to have more information so I could get the most benefit from the serum.</li>
            <li> I have to give this a low rating only because it caused my skin to break out.  I have very sensitive skin, and I use ROC with retinol, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the retinol causing that skin reaction.  People with less sensitive skin may not have a problem.  I am unable to say what benefits come from using this product, since I was unable to continue use.</li>
            <li> This really is the best.</li>
            <li> Love this product very easy to use. I use it morning and night and have been seeing results. My skin does have a youthful look and glow to it now. I plan to keep using this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Is use it with a vitamin c serum on my face and neck and get great results.</li>
            <li> My mom has been using this for over a week now and she has noticed it is working well. She said &amp;#34;I can not wait until I see the full results in a month.&amp;#34; I am happy to see she has been happy with the product since it is going to be difficult to find the right product.</li>
            <li> Still on the first bottle..........so I can not say whether it&#x27;s doing anything or not.</li>
            <li> I bought a Body Merry Retinol Serum for my mother who has age spots, wrinkle, and discoloration issues. I am very pleased with the fast delivery service. The letter from the founder of the company is very helpful and explanatory on how to use the serum properly. My mother has been using the serum for several days. I can perceive a remarkable improvement from her complexion that is more even tone, brighter, and softened wrinkle lines. She absolutely loves Body Merry Retinol Serum, which I am going to purchase for myself.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t had any success with this product.  Didn&#x27;t work for me but I haven&#x27;t found anything that works on my wrinkles and I have tried tons of products as instructed but never have any luck.</li>
            <li> This is a 2.5% Retinol Serum, nice and potent. The texture is like water. It dries immediately which I love since I like to layer my skincare. Even though 2.5% is a very high amount, I tap whatever is left over on my fingers, around my eyes. Never have I had an issue with using this under my eyes.  Amazing since I deal with crows feet.&lt;br /&gt;You can read my full review at hopesbeautybar.com</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this serum. I&#x27;m a product junkie and have used pretty much everything out there from prescription, to the highest end to basic coconut oil on my face and this serum is a seriously great product and a steal for what it actually does. It&#x27;s super gentle since my skin can be a bit sensitive. Been using under my moisturizers and oils day and night for about a month now and can see a huge difference in my overall skin tone, texture, firmness and moisture level! My skin is usually very dry especially in the winter, so being in the thick of it at the moment I&#x27;ve been totally overjoyed at my sudden dewy and hydrated complexion! A truly fantastic product I&#x27;d highly recommend to everyone who cares about their skin!</li>
            <li> I recently wrote a review about how this doesn&#x27;t work on wrinkles. After I wrote it I took a long stare in the mirror and realized I need to correct my review. I am only 25 but tanning for 9 years drastically aged my skin. Not only was my akin starting to wrinkle but I had breakouts like crazy. In my review I did state how amazing this serum has been for my acne. At first my skin was getting used to this product so I did still have acne. You need to know this product doesn&#x27;t work instantly but it does work!!! I have been using this for a few weeks every morning and night and my skin is amazingly clear. I never have pimples anymore (the occasional once a month) but never as bad as it was. My acne scars I had on my face have lightened and lightened and finally are super unnoticeable. Now for the wrinkles. Even though I am young, as I mentioned tanning aged my skin. I have deep lines on my forehead and around my mouth. I have noticed that my wrinkles are fling in and are barely noticeable. It is almost like they are disappearing! I love this product it really works!!! It&#x27;s an affordable miracle!!!</li>
            <li> Its not too strong, so you can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Hey Guys! I have recently had the pleasure of enjoying sampling many new face products this past week and this is just one more that I have reviewed to share with you by the company Body Merry. This is a 2.5% Retinol pro-A serum used to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines. I am 32 years old and this is becoming more of a maintenance requirement for me as the years seem to pass. I hope to have youthful looking skin so these products are definitely fun to try and see what will help to maintain my youthful appearance for as long as possible. This serum is vitamin A as compared to other serums I have used with vitamin C. The serum contains no fragrances when placed upon the skin and does not have the burning sensation due to the lack of alcohol that a lot of facial cleansers and lotions contain. This serum left me walking around with skin that felt moisturized and not irritated or dry in the least as some serums can do. I have noticed by using it a difference with texture of the skin. The skin appears to be more firm around my cheekbones and eyes as well as my complexion being clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to enhance their daily skin routine. This serum is not tested on animals and is FDA approved. This item is something to definitely stand behind!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference at all</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money on several, more expensive serums. I will definitely purchase this. It works just as well.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with it so far</li>
            <li> I have only have this product for 4 days and see a difference in my skin tone. My wrinkles are also less noticeable. So far I love this product.</li>
            <li> I feel it did what it was intended to do.</li>
            <li> I have extremely deep wrinkles. After using the retinol serum for almost one month I can see a slight difference in the deepness of the wrinkles. I plan to continue using the serum to improve the appearance of the wrinkles.  My skin does feel a lot softer even after the short period of time.</li>
            <li> This serum works. Very cheap too but works for my skin. I&#x27;ll check their other products.... A must buy!</li>
            <li> Good product if you have skin issues and your skin is not sensitive ...harsher than other such serums I have used. Overall, for the money a good product if care is taken with use.</li>
            <li> This serum is quickly absorbed and adds to the softness of my skin. I feel like it has helped the area around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Definitely helped with small eye wrinkles and my brown spots.</li>
            <li> I really have noticed a difference in softness and my face is smoother would order it again.love it!!!</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the results.  It really seems to work.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks I could see a difference in skin tone &amp; texture. A little goes a long way, goes on &amp; absorbs nicely. I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Watered down. Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Very good! Products works just like i need it to! I will buy again</li>
            <li> I am shocked by how quickly I&#x27;ve seen results with this product, within two weeks fine lines and acne have cleared up significantly.</li>
            <li> I am in the beginning of my bottle and I think it is work great for now.The reason I bought this product was that I am highly satisfied whit my previous experience with this company-very good customer treatment.</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week One- On day one, I expected to feel that tingle that in my head means it’s working. I get a slight pink color but that is mostly from me tapping on my skin (lightly). The solution is a perfect gel that has a slight tint and is easily portioned out by the dropper. Three drops covers the “problem areas” where I have breakouts occasionally in total and also covers what I somehow know will be “future problem areas”. I continue use and by day #3, I’m thinking this is just gelatin-ized water Yes, my skin absorbs it, feels nice but no magic is happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week Two- I notice on day #8, my skin overall looks better. Like the type of skin you think looks nice and wish you could obtain. I look less…..well, flustered because my breakouts are gone and my trouble areas are under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week Three- I have consecutive “good days”, so I shine off the results and just think it was a good week now. Continue on this and I notice things like my chin has 2 mini white heads and I have to get like super close to the mirror….you know when your nose fogs it up to even see them. The acne areas are just not getting angry anymore, so the Body Merry Pro-A Serum is sort of like a happy pill for my face. I realize what you don’t want to jinx because somehow if you acknowledge it, my face will revolt and avenge this goodness. I don’t hate saying it but my face looks good….feels good….and I sort of am starting to like it (don’t let it go to your head). I love this product and wil be ordering bottle number two in a month or so.  Thank you for the trial otherwise would have not had the opportunity to better my face!</li>
            <li> The serum works well. Tightens and clears without drying. Already starting to see positive results. I will continue to buy this product and use it faithfully.</li>
            <li> This is GREAT stuff!  I think this is better than Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair at half the price; I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not sure of this product.  I have sensitive skin so I am waiting to finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a great retinol for sensitive skin. At first, I wondered if there was any retinol at all in the serum because I experienced no redness or dryness. However, after a month of using this (directly followed by a moisturizer) I can tell my skin is tighter and my fine lines are reduced. I will re-order!</li>
            <li> Shown a small difference with my wrinkles. But when you put it on your clean face, you actually feel some tightning. I like that.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. I haven&#x27;t had any reaction to it and my skin has become smoother. I use it at night alone and during the day under moisturizer and facial SPF.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Great moisture, doesn&#x27;t break out my skin ! Feels silky smooth, not greasy!</li>
            <li> I have received my product and it works very well</li>
            <li> To me, my skin is bad. I regularly get pimples and blackheads and buildup on my nose which is hard to get rid of. I have dark spots/acne scars all along my cheeks, chin, between my nose and upper lip and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;I was wary about it at first because my skin usually reacts badly to oil but I just tried it anyway. I used it on a little spot at first but then I decided to just go all out and use it all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;And that was the best thing I have ever done in my life. This product turned my skin from dull, dry, flakey and lifeless to soft, dewy, glowy and moisturized. I&#x27;ve had it for seven days and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference. I know it&#x27;s going to take a while for the scarring to start to disappear but I feel so much more confident without make up now. I use it morning and night - as a moisturizer - and it&#x27;s like magic.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different but I recommend this product, even just to try. It&#x27;s affordable and easy to use. I am in love with this product. Definitely will buy again when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;i received a sample of this product in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This is the best product! Must try! I had a small scar on my face that in a month it reduced to half its size</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. Great price and great value.</li>
            <li> At 57 my skin was looking really dull, did some research and most sources recommended a good retinol. This fit my criteria. Using this at night as my skin is sensitive to retinol when exposed to sunlight.  Chose a collagen peptide for the am and a sweet potato moisturizing lotion. Am definitely seeing improvement using this regime.  Less wrinkles and firmer jawline skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Loved the idea of adding green tea to the formula, it&#x27;s a great anti-oxidant.  Left my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> I was so please with my retinol serum. Feels so great on face and neck. Can wear under makeup. After showing and before bed. Is one of the best I have ever purchased. Would say to all, ORDER,ORDER, ORDER.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly, goes on smooth. Too soon to tell if it&#x27;s working, will update when I&#x27;ve used it awhile.</li>
            <li> I have used other Body Merry products and I am just as pleased with this serum as I was with their other products. Face feels very soft, reddened areas have lightened. Very easy to use. Attractive packaging. I wash my face, apply Retinol serum, then vitamin C serum and then moisturizer. This regime works best for me. free Sample provided for my review</li>
            <li> Body Merry sent me this serum to review for my blog, GlamRiver.  The Body Merry 2.5% Retinol Serum is great for helping reduce fine lines and I really love it for evening out my skin tone.  It&#x27;s also really lightweight and is easily absorbed and can be worn under make-up.  However, I only use it in my nightly skin care routine.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. It works great, you can see the difference from the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 20&#x27;s, and read reviews on this product (OF COURSE) before I decided what the fuss was all about for myself. I must admit, every anti-wrinkle cream I&#x27;ve  ever boughten proven  to be a waste of money and I saw no results. However,  I am PLEASED to say that this product has definitely  made me a believer again. I had very fine laugh wrinkles growing around my eyes which I started to notice more and more. So as preventative measures I wanted a product to improve the flaws on my face giving me a more youthful look and reduce those laugh lines around my mouth and especially  around and under my eyes. YES!!! I HAVE TO SAY THIS WORKS!!! I also would like to include  I Have very sensitive  skin and was worried that I would break out to this product or it would be itchy. Not to worry...did NOT had that problem, and what a relief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I started out slow (as recommended) to see how product would react on my skin. I started using every OTHER day for exactly a week. Then I increased to everynight followed by the moisturizier lotion that goes along with the serum (sold separately ). I swear I have been getting sooooo many compliments on the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; look of my skin. My friends can&#x27;t figure out what&#x27;s different, and they keep telling me I look the same &amp;#34;but different&amp;#34;. :)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s  my new little secret and I will Definitely  be a repeat customer! I did take before and after pictures  that I will post after I finish my first bottle. Believe me you won&#x27;t  be disappointed, just be patient, be consistent  and give it the time to work. And as a tip, if you&#x27;re serious about getting rid of those annoying wrinkles...I Highly recommended using WITH the retinol moisturizier for best results!</li>
            <li> You will notice a difference with this product immediately. It works better than the other serums I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I hav received this product for free for review. When applying this serum it feels a little sticky but dries instantly helping to firm your skin.</li>
            <li> Great formula! Makes my skin feel so refreshed!</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOP5c546347bcb25402162dcfe38135e79c&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&amp;lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this though it has a weird smell, I tried this and the hyaluronic acid the blue bottle but am still trying and feeling that one out. But I primarily use this one in the morning in a combo with other creams. First I tone with rosewater then I add this and a retinol cream, and a spot checker last I add a moisturizer and I haven&#x27;t had a flare up or skin irritation and my face is visibly softer and smoother. I&#x27;ve noticed dark spots have been lightening and the creases by my mouth have been smoothed. I love the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOM5c546347bcb25402162dcfe38135e79c&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&amp;lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I love this Serum! I had noticible results after the first 5 days of using it. I would totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, long lasting, powerful Retinol Serum that really gives results. I love the thick, rich serum. Goes on smooth, absorbs easily. Not sticky on my skin. Not much of a scent to this serum, very light at best. Used it for a few days so far and my skin feels more toned, tighter, and looks healthier already! I am looking forward to the continued results of this serum.  I also love that it contains Green Tea, an excellent antioxidant!  Very impressed with it. Thrilled to get to try and review this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good retinol product and thought I would give Body Merry&#x27;s Retinol Serum a try.  To my happy surprise my skin has responded positively to it.  The dark spots are starting to lighten and the texture of my skin is getting smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the customer service at Body Merry is wonderful.  Once I purchased the Retinol Serum I got an e-mail from the owner walking me thru how to use it.  A few weeks later I received another e-mail checking in to see how things were going and if I had any questions.  I was really impressed that the founder of the company took such an interest in how my skin was responding to the serum.  I highly recommend Body Merry as a vendor and I highly recommend Body Merry&#x27;s Retinol Serum.</li>
            <li> Using this product has been amazing and I am so grateful I was offered to try this free and review this for my HONEST opinion. All I can say is I love the fact that its all natural  I can actually read all the ingredients without it looking like a foreign language lol I also used this combined with the Hyaluronic acid serum and Eye Cream by Body Merry and these all are such wonderful non harsh skin products. You also really only need a drop on your finger tips so as small as you may think this bottle or others are it really will go and last a long time oh and best part is and this is also great for people who are sensitive to fragrances as well because this does not have any odor at all !! I been using this for about 2 weeks now and I can definitely see a difference in my all over skin tone its has left it look more vibrant for sure and my wrinkles the little ones I did have I have seen some fading for sure. This is such a pretty bottle too I must say!!</li>
            <li> Very good product for my face and neck, I have sensitive skin, roschae, not a problem😃</li>
            <li> It works. Great product.</li>
            <li> I am new to using serums in the past few months and I&#x27;m quite fond of them. These are awesome and I love that they do different things. I&#x27;m especially loving the retinol ones since around my eyes need a little extra help.</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles on my first purchase, to save on the shipping,  I gave one to my daughter.  The two of us have decided that we have found our &amp;#34;potion.&amp;#34;  This serum is gentle but very effective.  We love the results!</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing. My laugh lines around my lips are less noticeable after only about a month of applying, day and night! I would definitely reorder this product again!</li>
            <li> My lines have diminished around my eyes and mouth.  Working like I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great product, very happy with it !!</li>
            <li> So far my skin feels smoother. I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this serum and I use it 3 times a week. You don&#x27;t need much to get it to spread evenly and when used with the Derma Roller it works even better, allowing it to seep under the skin where it will do the most good. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love it ! I was skeptical at first, but I&#x27;m a middle aged woman and I&#x27;m seeing slight results already and have only used for a week. I&#x27;m adding this to my regiman! Thanks for the fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the improvement.</li>
            <li> This serum is great!  I have sensitive skin, but it didn&#x27;t cause me any problems at all.  My skin is softer and seems smoother after using this for the last month.  It goes on lightly and absorbs quickly. I am very happy with this product, it works! And it&#x27;s made in the USA, and cruelty-free, both of which influence my choice of products I prefer to use. I did receive a complimentary bottle to review, but this is my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t caused any dryness or irritation. It goes on smoother when mixed with moisturizer so I mix two drops with a dab of moisturizer with sunscreen each day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product nightly for 2+ weeks now.  I did not have an &amp;#34;adjustment&amp;#34; period where my skin became used to the retinol b/c I just finished another serum that contained retinol.  But I would suggest one if your skin is not already used to retinol, esp since this product contains 2.5%.&lt;br /&gt;I have already seen a difference in my skin, my break out areas have significantly decreased if not cleared altogether, my skin also looks tighter &amp; brighter. Personally, I use 6 total drops for my face, neck &amp; d&amp;eacute;colletage/cleavage followed by another natural/organic product containing argan stem cell &amp; 2% chlorella growth factor (I attribute both products to my much better skin.)  I am in my early 30s, very concerned about aging skin, but still dealing with breakouts (which are now hormonal and more cystic in nature.)&lt;br /&gt;My deciding factor on purchasing this serum was that it is one of the few that contains both 2.5% retinol (the highest available in any product) and hyaluronic acid, plus green tea, vitamin E, and other organic oils. It is priced very fair, &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; free, and a natural/organic product, which has become increasingly important for my skin. I highly suggest this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9-8-15 Update........&lt;br /&gt;I still really like this product, I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle.  I have continued to use this product at night and recently added [[ASIN:B00THEGVCG Best Vitamin C Serum 22% for Anti-Aging, Wrinkles, Fine Lines, Acne, Sun and Age Spots - Also has 2.5% Retinol + 20% Hyaluronic Acid + 2.5% Niacinamide + 2.5% CoQ10 + 0.5% Astaxanthin - By Body Merry]] to my daytime routine. Both products by Body Merry are wonderful.  I suppose they could be used interchangeably, but I like to have have separate products for night and day.&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate what this serum has done for my skin and I would still recommend this product to anyone considering adding retinol to their facial routine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference in the first day or two, of using it once a day, at night.  However, by the week&#x27;s end, the skin on my forehead is smooth and taught.  It is taking longer on my cheeks, but I do see a difference.  So far, no change on the deep wrinkles on my upper lip. I will continue use and update the review, if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 5/27/2015&lt;br /&gt;It is still working, however I have been alternating this with another product to work on the deep wrinkles.  The other product is not living up to it&#x27;s claims, so I will go back to the Retinol Serum and see if there is more improvement.</li>
            <li> Like very.much. Saw an improvement with skin texture and diminished wrinkles. Plan on ordering again.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing serum all by itself but to add body merry&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum takes it to a whole new level!  My skin has never felt this great. I have sensitive skin, especially around my eyes.  The wrong chemical at all can leave me sore and red for days.  With both the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and the Pro-A retinol serum, I had absolutely no reaction.  They worked great together on my skin.  They are a perfect combination together.  I also thought my skin seemed to have a more healthy appearance.  Having my face fully hydrated all day is such an amazing feeling.  Since they are organic and made without being used and tested on animals that is a super big bonus as well!  Of course any product that offers wrinkle and line diminishing takes more than just a few weeks of use to fully notice those results.  With the positive changes I&#x27;ve been having so far, I can&#x27;t wait to continue using this combo together to see even better looking skin.</li>
            <li> I have used many Body Merry products and have loved each one! I always use a Hyaluronic Acid Serum every morning after washing my face. Body Merry makes a great two piece set that leaves your face feeling soft and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;  In this two piece set you will find the Hyaluronic Dew Serum, which is made from professional grade vegan hyaluronic acid made with Vitamic C &amp; Green Tea. This serum helps to  reduce fine lines and wrinkles and provide superior hydration leaving your face baby smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The second item is the Pro-A Serum  with 2.5% retinol and hyaluronic acid. It is natural and organic and is plant based. This is great for evening your  skin tone and reducing dark spots and acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Both products are made in the USA, cruelty free, natural and organic! I use both products every morning. Neither one has ever caused irritation or redness. It is on my MUST have list!&lt;br /&gt; Get the Hyaluronic Dew Serum here.&lt;br /&gt; Get the Pro-A Serum here.</li>
            <li> This Serum left my skin feeling soft to the touch.  It also contains Organic Aloe which I am a huge fan of for skin products along with green tea and vitamin E. All of these ingredients are great for skin.  This serum doesn&#x27;t contain sulphates, parabens or phthalates, which is the number 1 feature that I like about this serum. Its also made in the US and is NOT tested on animals. This serum comes in a opaque glass bottle to preserve your serum longer which is very nice. This serum goes on and does not leave any type of oily residue. I did not smell any smell or fragrance to it. Its a nice Retinol serum with Hyaluronic Acid which I like. After using this serum for a month my skin was softer, and felt firmer. Nice chemical free serum. I was given a free sample in order to review this item but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Loving this very easy and worth while product.  I use in PM and Vitamin C in AM along with Argan or another oil as my moisturizer.  Simple and effective.  Thank You...</li>
            <li> like the way this makes my skin feel.  Look better already!</li>
            <li> This serum is  “thick”, so a few drops will cover the whole face. This bottle will last a while with proper use</li>
            <li> This product gave my wife&#x27;s face a cleaner and healthier look. There is no more oily look, no more pimples or lines on her face. This product seems to work like a cleaner/moisturizer. I&#x27;m not sure, but it makes my wife&#x27;s face look great. She appreciates getting to try this product for free and she likes how her face looks and feels. She looks great and is getting that youthful look back.</li>
            <li> I received the Body Merry Brand Hyaluronic Pro-A Serum complementary for trial and review.  The first thing that struck me was the pretty bottle that the serum came in.  It is a blue glass bottle with a dropper.  It is very attractive looking and does not look junky on my bathroom counter.  The first thing I did was read the directions.  I decided it was best to try it in the mornings.  I followed the directions step by step.  First I washed and dried my face and neck.  I then applied my regular moisturizer.  Then, came my foundation and make-up.  What I really liked was the fact that it is natural and safe to use on the face area.  I also like that you can use it on our neck which tends to age.  The serum is very thick and clear.  I used about 2 drops each application.  It did not make my skin feel oily, but rather, very soft and smooth.  After a couple week, my skin appeared lighter and some of my fine lines were not as noticeable.  Natural ingredients include: Vitamins C and E, green tea, jojoba oil and polysaccharides.  There is a slight floral scent, but very subtle, that dissipates after application.  This is a very good product and I feel good using it as it does not have artificial ingredients</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell a difference, but I only used it for a week....</li>
            <li> Received and just started using.  I think I am going to like the results.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this serum for about a week, but I have already seen results. I will say that I have quite good skin, but at 70, I was noticing the wrinkles around my mouth and chin were becoming much more noticeable and of course I didn&#x27;t like that. After using the serum for the past week, the skin is MUCH smoother in that area and appears to be tightening up on my neck and under my chin. I am truly amazed at how quickly it has worked! I will update as time goes on for a long-term report on the results obtained, but so far, I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I started using the serum twice a day, but that did cause irritation. The manufacturer recommends once a day, which I have been doing now and it works great. I find better results by applying the serum before bedtime under my regular night cream (ROC Multi-Correction cream).</li>
            <li> I  received this for free.  I have been using it for over 30 days and can tell the difference.  My skin is firmer and my lines are less noticeable. I am 50 years old and people have been telling me that I look like I am in my 30&#x27;s.  Oh to be 30 again. If you want to look younger buy this product.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product. Just havent really noticed a significant improvement as of yet</li>
            <li> Although I have been using this product for a short time, I have seen results that I haven&#x27;t been able to get with other products. I see a significant difference in my pores and in the texture of my skin. I have been trying to get this result with other pricey products with no avail, so I&#x27;m excited that I can purchase a inexpensive product that has worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> Switched to this serum from the normal serum I had been using. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell and it absorbs into the skin well. I did notice a bit of drying which was more than the other serum. It seems to be working the same though I&#x27;ve only used it for two weeks.</li>
            <li> Very good serum.  I see the fine lines have minimized.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Items arrived very fast. I like the retinol serum so far, it&#x27;s light and refreshing. Just started using it so I will update on my results. I loved the neck cream I purchased about a month ago as well. Love this company&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> Very effective! This serum does what it the producers of the product says it will do. I use it before bedtime. I see the effect on the skin surface!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product!  My skin feels smoother, softer and in a few weeks my frown lines are barely there. Great product, great price. Will continue to use this! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks now. I have mild rosacea and sensitive skin and it is not irritating . I hope to see an improvement in fine lines but for now I am comfortable in using it every night.</li>
            <li> This stuffs great because with zero below temperature in the northeast my face got all cahapped and this repaired it in 5 days and the price is very reasonable</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin so smooth &amp; shrinks the pores. It&#x27;s really a HUGE difference. Goes on easily &amp; not at all greasy but you do have to use moisturizer over it. The only reason I haven&#x27;t given it 5 stars (yet) is because I haven&#x27;t bee using it long enough to see a marked difference in my wrinkles. I was also impressed with the customer service. After I bought it I was contacted &amp; given instructions on using it properly. I definitely would have done some things I shouldn&#x27;t have! I look forward to revisiting this review &amp; giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is not like every other serum, Body Merry is an exceptional company and has perfected their formula! It smells great, goes on easily and is absolute perfection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received for free, but my opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter, tighter and skin tone more even.  I heard from the owner prior to delivery of the product indicating strength and initial use instructions~  I have very sensitive skin and was concerned I potentially could have a negative reaction to the strength; I&#x27;m happy to report nothing to report but great results.  I took owner&#x27;s advise and made sure to use a good moisturizer for best results!  Love the results so far; I started using this just under a month ago and I&#x27;m really pleased  (normally it takes at least 6 weeks to see any changes in my face from new products as I&#x27;ve been a sun worshiper for 50 years the old school way, ie: prior to sunscreen... you&#x27;d never know it now!)</li>
            <li> So far so good. Only been using it for a week but already seeing the typical minor peeling of the top layer of skin. You don&#x27;t need a lot per application and it feels good. Definitely wait for it to dry before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I notice a dramatic difference, but it makes my face feel smooth and I hope it&#x27;s slowing down the aging process if it&#x27;s not reversing my deep wrinkles.  I&#x27;ll keep using, especially at this price.</li>
            <li> Very light and fast drying. I don&#x27;t have to wait for a long time before putting on my moisturizer. And for me,that&#x27;s a must!</li>
            <li> This serum works well on my face. It removes my wrinkles from daily use! Definitely would buy it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.**</li>
            <li> I definitely see the results of this after using it for a week.  A little goes a long way.  The tone of my skin is brighter and more even.  It absorbs quickly so I don&#x27;t have to find some stuff to do in between applying it and my moisturizing cream.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a smell. If there is one, it&#x27;s very light and not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a  fan and will definitely be trying out some other skin care products from this line.</li>
            <li> You work hard to make us happy</li>
            <li> I got the opportunity to test this product out, was excited because its Body Merry and i love Body Merry products. This product caught my attention because it is infused with green tea and i love green tea. Its natural and organic and it doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals and it absorbs quickly and is non-sticky,plus. This product is great for wrinkles and fine lines, helps redness and dark spots. It comes in a glass bottle with an eye dropper so you can control how much you want to use. It also has a yellowish tint and is thick and the smell is light and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. Makes my skin soft and leaves it feeling hydrated. I think my favorite thing about this product is that it evens skin tone and helps with acne, those are my biggest problems right now with my skin. I really appreciate this product, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I love it! I see a definite difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> this is my honest review of this product, if you are hesitating or have any kind of doubt please be assure that this Retinol Serum is everything, I can&#x27;t say or put enough words in here to describe to good in this product ... I love Love every single drop of it i give this miracle in a bottle 110 over 100</li>
            <li> I think I have finally found my face regime! I love this stuff.  I noticed a difference within a couple f weeks.  I will be buying more of this for my 50+ face.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I love this serum! I was excited to try this product because it has green tea, which is a powerful antioxidant. This serum is seriously hydrating, and is helping with smoothing the fine lines around my mouth. Will be ordering another bottle!</li>
            <li> This product has given Amazing Results!!! It leaves my skin skin feeling smooth and younger looking. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Overall it has improved the appearance of my skin and the best part is it works great on my hormonal chin acne.</li>
            <li> This is the ABSOLUTE BEST product on the market and my skin is extremely sensitive acne prone skin ever!  I&#x27;ve tried just about everything and this product by far exceeds them all.  Within about a week or so using this serum in conjunction with Proactiv+.  I was already using Proactiv+ but this took it to the next level that I hadn&#x27;t experienced using the three step Proactiv+ regime.  I need a case of this serum because I never want to be without!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a month now. Per the instructions, I started out using once every three days for about 9 days. My skin didn&#x27;t have any reactions so then I started using every other day for about 6 days (with no skin reactions) and then have been using it every day since then. I have not noticed a decease in wrinkles yet (I am 34 and don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles, more of surface wrinkles that appear when I smile/laugh). It seems to be a gentle product, very faint pleasant fragrance. I expected the serum to go a long way, but it absorbs so quickly into my skin that I have to use more if it than expected in order to get coverage all over my face. I will continue using for 6 months to see if there&#x27;s a noticeable decrease in surface wrinkles and will update my post, so for now 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This Pro- A Serum is said to be highly effective in diminishing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Its said to even out your skin tone and texture for a brighter and clearer complexion. It is suppose to visibly reduces the appearance of pigmentation, blemishes and other spot as well as help with unclogging pores, reduce acne marks and minimize breakout!! These are all amazing things this serum is said to do &amp; after trying it out for myself I noticed a visible difference to my skin!! It cleared away so of the lines on my skin as well as brightening and clearing my complexion!! It feels nice on my skin and all around a great product I definitely recommend this product to everyone!!</li>
            <li> This product works well. It is easy to use and lasts for a long time. I will continue to use it because I get results.</li>
            <li> instantly i saw my skin become less red and more supple i was completely shocked when i tried it because i am not really used to professional grade anything after trying it for a few days the results were completely dramatic nothing has touched my face like this. when i first put it on after washing my face my face tingled which was completely odd to me, i have never had something tingle then through out the day i was getting compliments on how beautiful my face looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It goes on smoothly, and you get good results.</li>
            <li> Have only used a short time but have seen instant result. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service, fast shipping. Great product. I noticed an improvement in my skin after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> At 55 yrs of age I didn&#x27;t think I would see a difference.  I&#x27;ve been using Body Merry for 4 weeks now and I am very impressed. The lines on my forehead and around my lips are less noticeable even in my neck area. I can&#x27;t wait to see the changes with continued use. I am so excited!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Body Merry, for a superb product!</li>
            <li> I found this serum by searching on Amazon for similar products and I&#x27;m glad I found it. I noticed results after using it for over 2 weeks consistently. My skin is clearer and smoother. The serum has a nice consistency and is easy to apply. Of course, price is important and other similar products can cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wrinkle serum for about a month and a half now, and i can definitely see small differences in my face.  little &amp;#34;cracks&amp;#34; by my eyes are smoothed out and around my mouth is a little tighter as well.  Don&#x27;t expect Face Lift results, but there&#x27;s a softness and firmness to my face and neck that i think is def from the serum.  Feels a little weird putting on at first.  But you get used to it and it dries quick.</li>
            <li> I only used it once and it made my skin break out. I do have very sensitive skin, but I regularly use retinol products, so I was quite surprised by this reaction.</li>
            <li> This  product seems to be working great with the vitamin c serum. i have just ordered another bottle.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 63 year old woman who has some wrinkles, a couple of dark spots and some forehead creases. I followed the directions that were sent via email after I purchased the product. I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for 10 weeks. I am pleased with the results! There is a noticeable difference in the creases on my forehead and between my eyebrows. They aren&#x27;t gone - just smoother in appearance. One of the dark spots is much lighter, the other one has changed. The wrinkles on the rest of my face are also a little smoother. If my skin improves over the next few months, I will update my review. :)</li>
            <li> Love this whole product line!!  I can see a difference in my skin.  It glows!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any difference at all in my skin. Disappointing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good serum to use, and this serum exceeded my expectations. This serum absorbs quickly and my skin always feels very soft and well hydrated after I put this on. After a week of use, I noticed my skin is a lot softer, and my skin tone is more even. I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a good anti-aging serum.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I am 48 and starting to see the sagging and wrinkles.  I use a derma roller before applying, soaks into skin great with no mess.</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with this serum.  It is not oily at all and make up goes on with no worries.  For the price and the potency, it is hard to find a better product.</li>
            <li> I believe I like this product. It seems to be doing something. I will reorder again &amp; see the results.</li>
            <li> This feels really good on your face and Time will tell how well it truly works?? This product was free but soley my own opinion.</li>
            <li> Did not like it, too strong</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I also am now a huge fan of Body Merry.  I love the way that my skin feels now after using the product and the texture has improved significantly.  I like that this product is thin, not heavy.  It dries quickly and I can tell a significant difference.</li>
            <li> I am a 53 yr. old female and am starting my second bottle. Extremely great results, cooling, moisturizing, clarifying. I have a new favorite face product!!</li>
            <li> The fact that I told four friends about this product after only using it for a few days says everything. My skin looked fresher and smoother after only a couple of uses.The instructions say that best results will be achieved after 6-8 weeks so I can&#x27;t wait to see the results then!</li>
            <li> Ok so I decided to try this for 2 months (actually 50 days close enough) before explaining how I feel about it. This product has a watery yet gel consistency that glides on very easily. It&#x27;s non-scented which is great for sensitive skin. It&#x27;s in a dark bottle which is great for any retinol product. The ingredient which gives the skin a plump and vibrant look is the hylauronic acid. It made my skin look and feel better with consistent use. My husband thinks my face looks healthier too! They fill the bottle up too, and little goes a long way. I got the package quickly too. I would buy this product again. I like experimenting with lots of beauty serums and cream on amazon, so I think I can safely say this is up there with the best brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice/day and have been pleased so far. First use leaves skin feeling smooth. After a couple of weeks, it does appear that my skin looks healthier and more refined with a mor blended look. I plan on buying this product again. I would recommend washing your hands after though because my fingertips started peeling from retinol.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time. So far I like this product, it leaves my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my face.  The serum leaves my face soft but I have not seen any of my blemishes or wrinkles fade.</li>
            <li> This is a really good serum...love the result so far. I am getting ready to order my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> I think it is a great product. Plan to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost two months and I see no results!  Do not try it for more than a month with no results since you can&#x27;t get a refund after 30 days.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of time and money. Don&#x27;t be fooled by unproven claim of effectiveness. It does NOT work.</li>
            <li> I received this serum along with a retinol cream for free* to try together and review and though the cream was just alright I really liked this serum. Now I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different serums and what I find is most of them are very thin and watery feeling. This one is not, this was thicker and stayed in the dropper while you were moving it from the bottle to your face. I could quickly and easily put a few drops around on my face and it absorbed quickly leaving no trace or residue and my skin felt moisturized where I used it. It did not make my skin feel dirty or oily either which is also good. I have sensitive skin and my skin did not react badly while using this at all, no rashes, burning sensations or red skin. I was worried it would be too drying with the retinol in it but like I said it actually moisturized my skin just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bumped it down a star because I was hoping to lose a couple of fine lines around my eyes disappear and they haven&#x27;t yet. So goodbye star. However since I do like the way this moisturizes my skin and it&#x27;s only been a few weeks I would like to continue using it to see what kind of results I get with more time and not doubling it up with the cream. I want to use it alone and see how it does on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*regardless of getting both items for free this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for 5 days and can see changes in the tightness around my eyes. I will continue to use and update results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 30 days and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin tone and texture. The serum is not sticky and absorbs fairly quickly. It leaves my face feeling fresh and smooth. I use this serum at night followed by a moisturizer. I use Body Merry&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum in the morning which is a perfect compliment to the retinol serum. This is the second product I have purchased from Body Merry and must say that I&#x27;m very impressed! I look forward to more products from Body Merry, the more the merrier!</li>
            <li> I reviewed this product for I love to review. I really like how this serum makes my skin feel. I love the results so far and can&#x27;t wait to see what is to come.</li>
            <li> I like this serum a lot, it goes on non greasy and leaves ur skin feeling great!</li>
            <li> Works really well. I see improvement in my 60&#x27;s skin texture and evenness of color. Great company to do business with, they email tips and do follow ups.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed at how quickly my complextion began to show results from using&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Retinal Serum&#x27;.I have always had a cleansing regimine that I incorporate into my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;It consists of washing,exfoliating,toning and moisturizing.Adding The Retiinol Serum to my routine (after toning &amp;,before moisturizing)has really brightened my complextion and diminished some of my imperfections.Uneven blotches,larger pores,small surface bumps vanished after a few short weeks of adding the Retinol Serum to my daily skin care routine.I am pleasantly surprised at the quick improvement in the texture and tone of my face.&#x27;Retinol Serum&#x27; by Body Merry was introduced to me, through an exclusive extereme discount, to try and review honestly.After only a few weeks of use(&amp; I still have 1/2 of the bottle left,Yah!) Im thrilled to have tried it.My face feels &amp; looks better and I am excited to continue using this product.It is my first time using a retinal serum and &#x27;Retinal Serum&#x27; by Body Merry has worked well for me and for my fresher,brighter complection.I would definitely reccommed using this product to my friends.Thanks Body Merry!</li>
            <li> It works great. I was able to notice the difference in few days where the fine lines were diminish and pores where less visible.</li>
            <li> This stuff helps reduce the fine lines around my eyes. Even an old gent needs to look his best you know!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Not only does it feel GREAT on my face but it smells wonderful. I rub it all over my eyes and it gets rid of the puffiness that I&#x27;ve had for the last four months (I have a new baby, so I basically look like the crypt keeper). I highly recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it. Great STUFF.. Reordered</li>
            <li> I love that this product is infused with Green Tea, not tested on animals and is made in the USA.  Does it get any better than that?  Their wasn&#x27;t really a smell to it and my skin soaked up the Serum very quickly.  Skin feels much smoother after applying.  Easy to add to your beauty regimen.  I rec&#x27;d this product free for testing and sampling purposes.  My opinion is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> The Hyaluronic Serum is one product that I can’t live without! I put it under my moisturizer, as it helps protect my face with its anti aging benefits. It nourishes and adds moisture to my perpetually dry skin as well! This brand uses all natural ingredients that I gravitate towards, as it works best for my overly sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big anti aging aficionado because I believe that it’s never too early to take really good care of your skin using anti aging products! I love BodyMerry’s Retinol Serum because unlike some anti aging products, it never dries my face. I have noticed significant changes with my skin’s appearance – which explains why I am hooked on this product! It has been keeping my face looking hydrated and rejuvenated and I am loving it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any breakout. I like that it&#x27;s not greasy and it really hydrates my skin. I&#x27;m really happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> This is great! I have only been using it for a little over a week, but already I see a change in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have an oily complexion so was hesitant to use a &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; based product but glad I did. I did not experience any redness or irritation as I had with previous retinol products. I have seen a reduction in my adult acne but my pores still remain a problem. I cannot speak to the anti-wrinkle properties of this product as I bought it primarily to address my adult acne and dullness of complexion.  I apply this at night and it absorbs rather quickly and does not feel oily or sticky which I had feared. It has helped smooth my skin texture which has helped a lot with addressing &amp;#34;dullness&amp;#34;. A little goes a long way and I feel that it is a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Afraid that I might jinx it, but really impressed with this product so far.  I&#x27;ve tried everything for my persistent acne and oily skin.  My skin has not been this clear in a very long time.  I have not been using a moisturizer with it so it has been a little drying but my skin is not nearly as flaky as with Retin A.  My usage has been more consistent because it&#x27;s gentle enough for daily use.  Skin has been less oily, too.  So far, so good...</li>
            <li> i like how it helps your skin with dark spotsand i don&#x27;t really have wrinkles so i don&#x27;t know if it helps well with the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is a great serum. These are the things I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;1. Immediately plumps the skin and fills in wrinkles. A few minutes after application the wrinkles are even further diminished.&lt;br /&gt;2. Skin looks firmer, plumped even after work. Yes I use this during the day when I&#x27;m not going to be out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;3. I apply this at night too, and in the morning my skin looks even better than when I went to bed. I think that&#x27;s pretty impressive considering my skin usually looks worse in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;4. This is NOT sticky and does NOT flake. Other hyaluronic serums I&#x27;ve used are sticky and flake after I apply my moisturizer. This means it absorbs well, and that&#x27;s why my skin is plumper and wrinkles are reduced because I feel it actually penetrates the skin and plumps it from within.&lt;br /&gt;5. This serum does not sting, cause redness or irritation. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin though, but I can&#x27;t imagine many people would have a problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this for about three weeks, so I can&#x27;t speak to what the long-term effects will be as far as wrinkle reduction. But we all need to be realistic that no serum will completely reverse time, but I think this serum will actually help improve the look of the skin with continued use and seriously slow the aging process.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a decrease in the size of a crease on my neck as well as a softening of crows feet.  I use it at night after cleaning my face then I apply moisturizer. I have not had any dryness or negative reaction to this serum and I have fairly sensitive skin. I have only been using this serum for a little less than 2 weeks and am happy  to have seen results already.  This is something I would recommend and will order again.</li>
            <li> Love this!!  Inexpensive and it I wake up with my skin looking refreshed.  I have oily skin and this product is the best!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that it is dispensed with a dropper, but there is a smooth feeling after use</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re all different so?  I am 52 and have had to deal with acne all my life. I am not new to retinol. My problem has always been the same, hurts:(  over time, redness peeling etc.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem with this. I am so used to retinol products that I know the signs, the creases of the nose and the corner of my mouth are the first to get hit.  Given that this may sound crazy but, I like to make faces at myself in the mirror and press retinol into the various wrinkles that appear. I&#x27;m pretty sure this isn&#x27;t a recommended action.  I have been smiling and filling up the wrinkles of my eyes then waiting till it soaks in and lathering on moisturizer. I do exfoliate, quite a bit.  I have two small acne right now, one on each cheek, none around my mouth or on my chin. My skin is clear and smooth and bright.  So for a retinol abuser, me, this has been the safest yet still effective retinol I have used to date.</li>
            <li> Great product and quality. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the moisturizer, eye cream and serum for just two weeks and my skin is already thanking me.  I am 42 years old and suffer from dry, itchy skin.  My skin feels tighter, softer, and perfectly hydrated.  The dark circles under my eyes are less prominent.  I am able to go without makeup once again.  You can&#x27;t beat the price or the results.</li>
            <li> Love this serum makes my skin feel amazing and I am seeing a differenece. In love</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my skin feel,,have been using it for a few days and so far it seems to make my skin feel smoother.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin so soft. And not an overwhelming smell. And the size of the bottle will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> The first one was halfway filled,  and the second one was filed all the way,  I like it so far</li>
    </ol>
