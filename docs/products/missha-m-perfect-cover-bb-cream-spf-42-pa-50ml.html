            <li>Shade is perfect for fair complexions.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product--surface of skin looks almost flawless...</li>

            <li>Works great for me.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>but I think it would give great great coverage.  </li>
            <li>One thing I forgot to mention is that it has great SPF (SPF 42 PA+++).</li>
            <li>The coverage was great, but i looked like an oompa</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m a light-complexioned person and wasn&#x27;t sure what color would look best on me.</li>
            <li>Like I said I think it&#x27;s a good cover and sunscreen with some great features just not for me.</li>

            <li>Missha BB Cream evens out your whole skin tone making your face a perfect palette with which to apply your makeup and look your best!  </li>
            <li>MISSHA M Perfect Cover BB Cream is my new favorite!!!</li>
            <li>MISSHA M Perfect Cover BB Cream is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect coverture and very easy to apply; I strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I have some old acne marks that I have to cover up, and it does a wonderful job without looking like I&#x27;m wearing makeup at all, it&#x27;s incredible!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it did a good job in concealing my blemishes either.</li>
            <li>the shipment was really good...</li>
            <li>good quality..</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>It works best if you are looking for a foundation with light coverage.</li>
            <li>it had mostly good reviews, 2.</li>
            <li>I read in another review that the No. 23 was good for someone who was a MAC NC 25.  </li>
            <li>I got this BB cream and immediately loved it.  </li>
            <li>The color has been good for me, I think there is some lee-way with it</li>
            <li>well i suppose \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; is a good word.</li>
            <li>Saw all the good reviews and had to try this.  </li>
            <li>When I used to have acne, this product was really good at covering it up, and it did not block pores or make me break out.</li>
            <li>, it provides good coverage, something that I always look for in a foundation.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shade for ladies who have fair skin.</li>
            <li>price wise</li>
            <li>My coworker even said my skin is so good, and she didn&#x27;t know anything about bb cream.</li>
            <li>Provides good coverage without looking cakey.  </li>
            <li>Besides the color match, I loved this product</li>
            <li>I take good care of my skin.</li>
            <li>I loved the product.</li>
            <li>Also, it has really good coverage and covers my blemishes and acne scars well.</li>
            <li>This is a good bb cream...but not my fav...</li>
            <li>, It was delivered in time and my mother loved it.</li>
            <li>Good product and</li>
            <li>I also feel good about using it because of the SPF42.  </li>
            <li>The smell is good too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good primer for me to use.</li>
            <li>but it has good coverage for being a bb cream.</li>
            <li>so finding a good foundation</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t looked this good since before having children!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered it with excitement based on the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>This cream got good reviews, which is why I tried it.  </li>
            <li>and i loved it.. will purchase from this seller again..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s &#x27;sale by&#x27; date but was still good.</li>
            <li>Customer service is good.</li>
            <li>surprisingly this works for me</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good for the day.  </li>
            <li>Price was good also.</li>
            <li>This is really good item.</li>
            <li>Missha does a good job at even-ing out my skin and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>so thats good, and</li>
            <li>Compared to its good qualities the issue I have with its fragrance is minusculed.</li>
            <li>The coverage is that good.</li>
            <li>I have been hearing all kinds of good reviews from using BB cream, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>or not it&#x27;s actually good for the skin remains to be seen.</li>
            <li>good cover</li>
            <li>All in all a good bb cream.</li>
            <li>My sister tried it and loved it as well.</li>
            <li>Provides good coverage.</li>
            <li>Nice coverage and a great delivery system.</li>
            <li>This is a really good BB cream.</li>
            <li>The fact it is so good for your skin is also a bonus.</li>
            <li>but if no update then its all good.</li>
            <li>it does not look good.</li>
            <li>It worsen my acne, but my sister loves it because of its good coverage.</li>
            <li>After reading good reviews, my wife decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li>good cosmetic came with box.</li>
            <li>It provides good coverage and isn&#x27;t too oily as some BB creams I have tried before.  </li>
            <li>Got a number of compliments on how good my skin looked.</li>
            <li>Color is good for my skin (asian)tone.</li>
            <li>GOOD</li>
            <li>I was looking for a BB Cream that would provide good coverage for my spots and unevenness.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say it really is good makeup</li>

            <li>I bought this product because I have heard about the good propties of BB creams.  </li>
            <li>It will be a good cover for a rafting trip we are planning.</li>
            <li>and I just use my fingers, it&#x27;s awesome no dirty brushes!</li>
            <li>When it comes to bb creams, this is the best brand ever among those with a better price (you can probably find a better chanel one).</li>
            <li>Very light on my skin and great coverage on my spotty skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good product, it goes on smooth and is my skin color</li>
            <li>Matches my skin color well, isn&#x27;t too drying but doesn&#x27;t leave an oily finish, reduces the look of fine lines, reduced the appearance of my acne scars (even just after a week of use!!)</li>
            <li>Lovely product, gave me great converge.  </li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with the result.     </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m sure it is great for some.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this BB Cream.</li>
            <li>This is a nice BB cream that is easily a good medium coverage foundation.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong smell and I wouldn&#x27;t call it a pleasant one.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s my Cakey, looks so flawless and natural, but has GREAT coverage.</li>
            <li>The best part about Missha&#x27;s BB cream is that it works GREAT even on sensitive skin.</li>

            <li>Must we put another positive review for the MISSHA M PERFECT COVER BB Cream No. 23?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled with my purchase I will be buying more!</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t going to use this under my makeup as I thought beige on beige would be too much, but it seems to tone in perfectly with my foundation creating a flawless finish.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, but still has medium coverage, and it hasn&#x27;t broke me out yet which is great.</li>
            <li>anyways, product&#x3D; AMAZING  </li>
            <li>This product works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>It is amazing product.  </li>
            <li>and i have been on the search for an amazing foundation...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Great coverage and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>but this stuff is great because it does smooth my skin out and provides the sun protection.</li>
            <li>Anyhow...this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Just an amazing BB cream.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light to medium coverage, with a great finish.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice; however, it&#x27;s one shade and not recommended for darker than NC-35.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have perfect skin either, so it really covers well.</li>
            <li>However, I took off a star just because of the box was kind of opened and damaged...</li>
            <li>This BB cream gives me good and natural coverage and its great for my skin!</li>
            <li>but I honestly haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li>I shouldnt even say nice things about it.</li>
            <li>I just need to find a good setting powder to use on top of it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried another BB by Missha and it was good, but this one is better.</li>
            <li>and this product is smell nice</li>
            <li>I liked the Laneige BB cream over this one.  </li>
            <li>This BB cream covers so nice</li>
            <li>It is kind of a grayish color.</li>
            <li>You kind of have to be white/fair-skinned for this BB</li>
            <li>I really recommend it :D</li>
            <li>but it kind of fades away</li>
            <li>its a thicker consistency than some others, which is good for me because i need more coverage to cover my blemishes.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the product itself is really nice.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>It feels nice throughout the day</li>
            <li>Effective &amp; affordable.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s really good for people with many imperfections)</li>
            <li>product would work well for someone who enjoys a perfumey scent and whose skin does not have sensitivity to fragrances; I would suggest applying a nice lotion before using this product.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>cream is really nice to put on, and blends in well after it finishes oxidizing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fully cover my blemishes, so I do have to use my own concealer (I use sonia kashuk).</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m thrilled with not having to use sunscreen, moisurizer and foundation separately.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own and has SPF protection built in.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more happy. :)</li>
            <li>I really like this bb cream is one of the best.</li>
            <li>I prefer using this in the colder months as it is hydrating and might look oily in the warm weather.</li>
            <li>I have tried many kinds of foundation, including the  spray on product and powdered minerals, which I loved.  </li>
            <li>LOVE, Love, love!!</li>
            <li>Love, Love, LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li>Very nice and light on your face.</li>
            <li>I also like the scent, which is pleasant and not too strong.</li>
            <li>It is a bit ashy when you put it on, but it goes on very smooth and offers surprising coverage and blends wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I love the shisheido compressed power because it had really great coverage, great match to my complexion, and priced reasonably.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this :))))</li>
            <li>My Mother&#x27;s makeup looked flawless and I had to ask what new product she was using.</li>
            <li>which greyish tint doesn&#x27;t sound good but it looks beyond amazing.</li>
            <li>I own Etude House&#x27;s Bright Fit Mineral BB Cream in W13/Natural Beige</li>
            <li>It came very quickly, so it was good.</li>
            <li>Upon initial application, the color is not the best match for my complexion, but after maybe 30 min. - 1 hour, it oxidizes and matches the skin fairly well.  </li>
            <li>It provides WonDeRfuL coverage, the color is way to light for my golden olive skin, and my skin broke out like a teenager.  </li>
            <li>This cream comes on smooth and smells pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply compared to some concealers and liquid foundations.</li>
            <li>However, the very strong (old-fashioned powdery) smell wasn&#x27;t mentioned in the reviews I read.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>but I absouletly love this product and will be buying more of this when it runs out!</li>
            <li>But all in all, I just love this product! :)</li>
            <li>I wore it the first day to a non-important event and before I could ask my friend how it looked, she mentioned that she loved whatever I was using, my skin looked radiant!  </li>
            <li>I originally received it in my Glossybox and found it here on Amazon with a great price and more colors to choose from.  </li>
            <li>stand by my original review of this excellent product WHEN the right shade is packed in the tube.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m soooooo in love with this cream, I highly recommend it &#x3D;D</li>
            <li>I sing high praises of it to every girl I know, and eventually converted most of my friends to fellow Perfect Cover BB Cream fans.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST foundation that I&#x27;ve ever used so far.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look almost flawless and natural.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the revision spf 45 which is just amazing, however a bit more pricey.</li>
            <li>I have oily combination skin, this product works and smells good, light on face  </li>
            <li>Im a natural beige and the color matches me perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love this product, gives me a nice dewy finish but could be matted with a bit of powder.</li>
            <li>it absorbs into your skin giving you almost flawless natural coverage...</li>
            <li>My skin look flawless with this product and natural not like I am wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>I got this product from a friend and it is by far the best BB cream ive ever used.</li>
            <li>And, the 23 (color) is really a nice neutral that would go with many a complexion.</li>
            <li>Came very quick; in about 15 days!</li>
            <li>Also, the delivery is very quick!  </li>
            <li>I love, love love this cream!</li>
            <li>Love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It has very good coverage for a BB cream and does not break me out at all, which is the main reason I use these creams instead of foundations.</li>
            <li>It gives great coverage, especially for those with acne-prone skin like mine, who are looking for a lightweight product, but yet still gives great coverage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried 5 BB creams so far, and Missha&#x27;s Perfect BB Cream ranks in at #2 (their Signature BB cream performed better for me).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy and love the SPF protection it offers as well.</li>
            <li>The quality of this product was high and incredible.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the quickness &amp; smooth transaction and shipping.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it, I used it around my eyes and face because some reviews said it worked as a great concealer too.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>In all the reviews I read, everyone said that both of the shades are very, very light.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of compliments on my skin when I wear this and best of all, it has a high SPF which was really important to me.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin feel very light and refreshed.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very light on the skin.</li>
            <li>This cream is a very light alternative to foundation during the summer that helped to even out my skin color.</li>
            <li>ON MY FACE,,IT IS VERY LIGHT AND NOT GREASY,,FEELS</li>
            <li>This cream is very light to the feel, not cakey at all.</li>
            <li>is very light.</li>
            <li>Blends easily and covers nicely on the discoloration areas on my face.</li>
            <li>Since it is a moisturizer, it has been great for my combination skin; not too oily for the oily bits and greatly helping out the dry spots.</li>
            <li>but I have reordered this product MANY times for myself and friends.</li>
            <li>Also, buy from a reputable Ebay sellers.  </li>
            <li>But since we can&#x27;t get our hands on, we are paying a bit more.  </li>
            <li>We will continue using it to see if our skin improves more.</li>
            <li>I need a shade lighter! :)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like a tinted moisturizer, but better.</li>
            <li>My skin is brighter and more even now.</li>
            <li>Missha&#x27;s Perfect Cover BB cream is the only thing that I&#x27;ll use for foundation.  </li>
            <li>It definitely decreases the appearance of pores, and I am always complimented on how flawless my skin is...</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The more people that buy it the more it might drive up the price.</li>
            <li>My favorite makeup.</li>
            <li>Everyone should make sure this is authentic bb cream.</li>
            <li>when there&#x27;s a sale, it&#x27;s about $22-23...just a heads up! :]</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure which color to get but settled on the darker of the two.  </li>
            <li>I love that this cream has a lot of things we women look for:  anti-wrinkle, spf, acne treatment, etc.  </li>
            <li>What I love about it is how it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have anything on.  </li>
            <li>I also like the fact that you can layer it on to give more coverage.  </li>
            <li>I also love the price point.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, they will come out w/ more color choices.</li>
            <li>couple times I have stippled some foundation over the BB cream to give it more coverage.</li>
            <li>I know this because I am using the authentic one (which I had bought from Misshaus.com website) and compared it..   </li>
            <li>the product, i love it.</li>
            <li>but i still love it.</li>
            <li>i honestly love it.  </li>
            <li>and I just simply LOVE LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Great service and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Maybe if I had chosen lighter shade it would look much better on my face.</li>
            <li>Love this BB cream....</li>
            <li>Does wonders for my skin, love love this</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>The best thing is that it has SPF in it which is why I initially wanted to try BB cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be my favorite for the summer.</li>
            <li>it was more of a tan shade.</li>
            <li>bummer because i love the texture and coverage it provided without the need of wearing foundation to school.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really pleased with this product because it has so many benefits.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t love it more.</li>
            <li>but I find this  more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>A better texture and a smoother cover.</li>
            <li>Met my wife&#x27;s expectation and I love the way she looks when she does the make up.</li>
            <li>but it did makes my face look more better</li>
            <li>Everyone comments that my skin looks great - very even toned.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to go without BB cream now.</li>
            <li>I will re order for sure.</li>
            <li>But it I absolutely love this bb cream</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a better match to my skin tone</li>
            <li>However, after a couple weeks more had passed, I noticed that there were even more pimples</li>
            <li>The product provides great coverage and stays on despite my having a very oily T-zone.</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>For the price, I don&#x27;t think you can do better for a BB cream.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am very happy overall!  </li>
            <li>I tried better products of Korean brands</li>
            <li>I love the SPF.  </li>
            <li>, that means I&#x27;m gonna lose one of them for sure.</li>
            <li>Missha BB cream, not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>but I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>maybe the wrinkles around my eyes are better...</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t light at all!</li>
            <li>I can not believe there aren&#x27;t more comments on this...</li>
            <li>whatever you want to call it that I have fell in love with.</li>
            <li>I have to put powder on top of it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really satisfied.</li>
            <li>You can build it up a bit more</li>
            <li>Having read so many rave reviews about this product, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>That combination of products seem to combat the oiliness a bit better.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to most people, after all</li>
            <li>i love it..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rating this a four since I just started using this product, but I already love the results.</li>
            <li>I love the pump as it is way more hygienic that way&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s not the most appealing look</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also not horrible.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t have time to reapply, touching up with a bit of blush or bronzer or even just some powder helps a ton.</li>
            <li>Besides the container issue, the cream itself was not my favorite, either.</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my skin look.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel like I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup, but on top of that,  it evens my skin tone and gives me a dewy complexion.</li>
            <li>It tightens skin and makes the skin tone look better.</li>
            <li>Looks natural, color is perfect, evens my skin tone, is light, and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>it is the best BB cream ever, with SPF, smells like baby lotion, but it goes on sheer and if you want more coverage it makes it thicker but not caker...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect final step in my Korean skincare routine!</li>
            <li>Satisfied and recommend it for you to try it</li>
            <li>This is the third tube of Missha M Perfect Cover Cream that I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it, I will buy this again.</li>
            <li>product does go on gray, but after a while it will oxidize and blend in better.</li>
            <li>this video for more information.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell is okay.</li>
            <li>I do love this product...</li>
            <li>I just  love it.</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this BB cream is so affordable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now dealing with the breack outs hoping I don&#x27;t gettoo many scars.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure abt shade</li>
            <li>really love this BBcream</li>
            <li>Most foundation I purchase leave a residue on my face, not this one.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and</li>
            <li>I have been using 3 various foundations, but Missha&#x27;s BB cream is the best!!!</li>
            <li>They were ok, but nothing to rave about.</li>
            <li>While the cream felt great, and smelled nice, it just never looked natural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite BB cream.</li>
            <li>The MISSHA M PERFECT COVER BB CREAM #23 does a really good job at coverage and doesn&#x27;t have a heavy feeling, but the colors are limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this BB Cream.  </li>
            <li>#34;Natural Beige&amp;#34;, it is really light beige and is for fair to light skin.</li>
            <li>If the color had been better I would have given this product a better review.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have too many blemishes</li>
            <li>I love missha</li>
            <li>all look better when applied after putting on BB cream.</li>
            <li>I love it the color match my skin.</li>
            <li>I will buy more</li>
            <li>I also love how it has SPF.</li>
            <li>use it many times with many powder but the color still gray.&lt;br /&gt;save</li>
            <li>The color did have a \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; effect, but more of just adding a luminous glow to my face.</li>
            <li>It also had a perfume-y soap-y smell which I don&#x27;t love but can overlook.</li>
            <li>Stays on for most of the day.</li>
            <li>Ok, so stuff happens in the mail</li>
            <li>This is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>but now i really love this product.</li>
            <li>Use this on most days and it has replaced the need for a sunscreen and foundation.</li>
            <li>Has more coverage than a tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m just happy to use it in place of foundation, highly recommend for that!</li>
            <li>I love love love that product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Simply...I love it.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Do not need more, I ordered.</li>
            <li>how they are almost magic.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this hearing so many rave reviews about BB Creams.</li>
            <li>I must say that I like the color of this more than the Etude House BB cream.</li>
            <li>and it appears to be an authentic product.</li>
            <li>Much better than an BB cream I have purchased at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>Color was pasty, there are better products out there.</li>
            <li>I purchased this bb cream twice and really love it.</li>
            <li>the more you layer on.</li>
            <li>Love this BB cream.  </li>
            <li>Once on it won&#x27;t wipe off on a tissue like most bb creams.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my skin look, without being &amp;#34;made-up&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>ok, dont know if i would purchase again....</li>
            <li>Love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>Really love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup.</li>
            <li>and I went to look for more on Amazon and found it</li>
            <li>I was glad I ordered more of it</li>
            <li>Try it you will love it just like I did.</li>
            <li>need more of a matte type..</li>
            <li>I LOVE BB CREAMS.</li>
            <li>and I really really love this one.</li>
            <li>I started looking for something that has color choices that would better suit my skin color and my oily skin.  </li>
            <li>matt mousse medium beige over the top just for more coverage.  </li>
            <li>Really glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li>I put this on and then a bronzer on top</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this bb cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>This color is better for me than no.</li>
            <li>Lovely results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this BB cream for two years now and love it.</li>
            <li>It DOES make ur skin brighter, lighter, without looking cakey :)</li>
            <li>I ordered this product after reading many reviews.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of covering my old acne scars, although I have to apply 2 coats over the darker marks to get good coverage.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think i like the fragrance, would prefer if is fragrance free!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After having bought 5 different kinds and receiving 2 from a friend in Asia and tried them all, the Missha M Perfect BB Cream #23 is the one - for me.  </li>
            <li>more yellow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am allergic to many perfumed products for that reason I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li>Love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>medium coverage and looks wonderful when it finally set on the skin</li>
            <li>i love this product..</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have had so many compliments for my complexion since I have been using this.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I used to use a separate product for sun protection, then yet another to moisturize and then to top if all off a foundation.</li>
            <li>and it has skincare benefits that I can safely say do help</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li>I love how it works.</li>
            <li>this is the 3rd time I am ordering and I can&#x27;t stop suing this!!!&lt;br /&gt;color is perfect with the spf 42.</li>
            <li>but when I did it worked ok.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It is not oily or cakey like many products.  </li>
            <li>I like this better</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not my favorite color to wear all the time, so</li>
            <li>I use it mostly during the cooler fall/winter months when my skin has a lighter shade.</li>
            <li>Very kind service of you and thanks for sending variety of bb cream samples.</li>
            <li>So far so good great in the natural color easy to apply great coverage.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li>It goes on real smooth and is moisturizing and clean.</li>
            <li>Never mind the great price even with high shipping charges.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but for normal to oily skin, i think it works great.</li>
            <li>It gives a fresh dewy finish, has good coverage, looks natural, has great spf protection,  and fixes wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I bought it and loved it the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this B.B cream for a long time and still this brand is the best!</li>
            <li>Plus, smell is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have pretty fair skin and use the No.23.</li>
            <li>Tried it for the first time based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and loved it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s never made me break out, gives me instant perfect complexion, doesn&#x27;t streak, and I always love the light fragrance of it.</li>
            <li>Once I became aware of the types of BB creams and manufacturers, I went onto the manufacturer&#x27;s website to check out the ingredients, the color, and what type of skin the BB cream is good for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You cannot do that with the original bottle!</li>
            <li>The smell was too fragrant versus the original!</li>
            <li>I found that product to be great, but when I ran out, I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day, blends to the perfect color once oxidized, and keeps my oily parts matte and my dry parts moisturized.</li>
            <li>The BB cream has a strong fragrance,  which I love and it has a creamy (moist) consistancy, excellent for combination and dry skin.</li>
            <li>If you see Korean girls near you, you can find most of them have really great skin.</li>
            <li>The changing of color is also not big of a problem because I have it in shade #23 which is still a bit too light for me, but it&#x27;s perfect as the day goes on.</li>
            <li>Most of the other BB creams I looked at did not have many color options and most people that reviewed them were very fair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Mineral oil is well known to clog pores, and most good companies do not use mineral oil as one of their main ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Coverage is good, feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>but I havent found one that is reasonably priced, provides great coverage, fairly good match to my skin tone, last thru most of the day, great packaging, feels good on my skin (doesnt make it oily or dry -</li>
            <li>Missha BB cream is a good product, a smooth and perfect match for Asian skin stone with high protection of SPF 42</li>
            <li>I like to use over the prime cream and works perfect and keeps my skin silky soft, fresh and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Just all around amazing, and totallt worth it.</li>
            <li>Etude House Precious Mineral #13 is a bit light for me.  </li>
            <li>Although it is lighter weight than makeup, it gives more coverage than light powder or tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li>This amazingly light weighted foundation (BB Cream) is fabulous!</li>
            <li>, covers scars and pores, and most importantly, does not make me break out or clog my pores.  </li>
            <li>It covers most blemishes perfectly, almost so well that I feel as though I could go without concealer and foundation (coming from someone who has dark acne scars).</li>
            <li>Matches my blonde hair, light skin complexion nicely, and blends great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly light too, and isn&#x27;t oily like most SPFs.</li>
            <li>the formula isn&#x27;t as light as a tinted moisturizer but more of a medium coverage foundation...</li>
            <li>I love how light it feels and that it has SPF 42.</li>
            <li>One thing worth mentioning is that, I am indeed Asian, which this product is often geared towards, but my skin has a more olive-yellow undertone to it, and it&#x27;s not the perfect match with Missha No. 23.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, goes on creamy and light, works wells.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this BB Cream is still available via Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t make sure the product is genuine.</li>
            <li>cream is smooth and a touch grainy (like many BB creams I&#x27;ve seen).</li>
            <li>I ordered this and the Skin79 BB cream (pink bottle) and this is the perfect match for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I love that product which gives light translucent cover with some sunscreen protection.</li>
            <li>You can apply this with your hands, but make sure to warm it up first between your fingers, as this helps it spread</li>
            <li>MIssha M perfect cover was not what I expected, but it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li>It is great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but as you rub it into your skin it actually looks incredible.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the end of the summer, and I have a pretty good tan (one that was gained with sunscreen, so I&#x27;m not that dark), and this color is perfect for my summer skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and price was good.</li>
            <li>I love it so much!!!  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, great coverage and extremely natural looking.</li>
            <li>Foundation was making my skin look much older, so glad I found BB Cream, and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li>My skin is dry,so it was not creamy enough for me,the color was good!</li>
            <li>Compare to other bb cream that I&#x27;ve used this is one of the best bb cream out there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a very good BB cream that looks best with pale skintones and offers a matte, clean finish.  </li>
            <li>My color tends to range in the Fair to Light, depending on the time of the year and how much sun I get.</li>
            <li>-easily to put up!!!can</li>
            <li>I used  -easily to  remove.</li>
            <li>whi;e others said it was very quick for them.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and re-layer.</li>
            <li>a lot of coverage and easy to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is very close to my own, but I use powder to blend it more.</li>
            <li>I bit the bullet and placed my order, and am happy to say that she is 100% correct in her love and admiration of such a cream.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Today I only use this one amazing product and my skin looks so good.</li>
            <li>It blends easily and lasts well throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This bb cream blends with your skin color so easy</li>
            <li>good for fast whiteing &amp; cover , this will make your skin 2 shades light,   </li>
            <li>I strongly suggest this bb cream to those who have oily/mild acne skin like me, as it does not harm the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 42 years old and spanish with light to medium skin color, this product bb cream #23 is perfect, very good cover for my ages spots and discoloration areas, not heavy cream, very very light scent, and excelent sun protection.</li>
            <li>Also feels good about the high SPF in the summer.</li>
            <li>does not make you break out either for the price its really good stuff its like really high end makeup.</li>
            <li>They are ok but nothing special.</li>
            <li>it covers amazing and really helps keep my skin matte for hours!  </li>
            <li>It has great coverage, and it&#x27;s not pink.  </li>
            <li>I liked it the first day,</li>
            <li>I used a #27 this summer when I had a tan, and it was a perfect color for me, but it&#x27;s too dark now that it&#x27;s winter.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is good although it does make you look a bit paler than normal</li>
            <li>Hands down, this is THE best BB cream.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is smoother, the application is ideal (with my clean hands), and the coverage is sheer to medium.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any whitening or improvement in fine lines.  </li>
            <li>They all go on every smooth and easy to blend (I use stippling brush).  </li>
            <li>Although, both are fine.</li>
            <li>For wrinkles it covers the fine lines well.</li>
            <li>No.21 is a bit white when first applied, but when oxidized it&#x27;s matching perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s greyish when you first apply it, shortly after it matches my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and blends in easily.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have fine pores.</li>
            <li>The 40 SPF is true, it offers great protection.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 and have some sun spots and fine lines and am medium complected .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream for about a year and a half-</li>
            <li>But they would show the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I also bought the Super Plush Balm Triple Functions and find I like this one better.</li>
            <li>This would be a top contender except that the smell to me is strong its a like an old person perfume smell and its kind of strong</li>
            <li>well, this product has really changed my skin for the better!  </li>
            <li>at first it is a bit gray but later on it blends in within 3-4 hours :))) definitively buying again soon!!!</li>
            <li>This BB Cream (which I purchased in the darkest color) is easy to apply, long-lasting, a great sunscreen, and an overall fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It certainly does moisturizes my skin (to be honest  though, I blend it in with a bit of moisturizer..</li>
            <li>Misha&#x27;s product are very good and we will certainly buy more in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>I kind of like the Maybelline BB a little better but either one is good.</li>
            <li>There was a very nice view of the Missha store in the main area and it looked very modern and chic.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li>This gave me huge cystic acne.</li>
            <li>For light coverage, Skin 79.  </li>
            <li>I have problem skin, and the coverage is fantastic.</li>
            <li>and so I decided to try the NO 23 color because I thought the NO 21 would be to light for me.   </li>
            <li>I think the No.21 would be too light for me</li>
            <li>Light and dewey look.  </li>
            <li>but it blends in perfectly after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I have light skin</li>
            <li>I also dislike the heavily made-up look, so this cream is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>it was still too light for me.</li>
            <li>The initial color matched great</li>
            <li>It brightens my eyelids, covers the light circles under my eyes, and smooths and evens my skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how cheap this product is for the coverage that it provides.  </li>
            <li>I started applying this to my neck as welll to smooth out the look.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;P.S. Seoulglamour is fantastic too...</li>
            <li>I touch up lightly with some mineral powder</li>
            <li>So basically it makes your good-looking skin look great, and your blemishes only somewhat covered, so</li>
            <li>and it was way too light.  </li>
            <li>I read someone&#x27;s comment about their receiving a knockoff version or something, but I believe the product I received to be 100% genuine.  </li>
            <li>I set this with a light powder and wear it as my make-up, and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>She received the indication from a friend and fortunately I found it in Amazon site</li>
            <li>it has light coverage</li>
            <li>It covers, goes on smooth as silk and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>(Light Beige) also and see how that one turns out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, blendable and isn&#x27;t sticky at all.</li>
            <li>I purchased this BB creme in No.21 - Light Beige.</li>
            <li>so it may be because of this (the primer I use is [[ASIN:B000UGUB1W Smashbox Photo Finish Oil Free Primer</li>
            <li>so it may be because of this (the primer I use is [[ASIN:B000UGUB1W Smashbox Photo Finish Oil Free Primer 1oz/30ml]])</li>
            <li>, i tell you just like this foundation product its light and smooth</li>
            <li>This gives such great coverage that I use it as my &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; now.  </li>
            <li>It goes on light but gets darker as you wear it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>Even then, this BB Cream is a tad bit too light for me.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and evenly and my skin tone is even and glowing.</li>
            <li>and it feels so light.</li>
            <li>how light this bb cream feels however i fell that this bb cream has a grey-ish hue to it even though i purchased it in a darker/ warmer shade.</li>
            <li>The delivery was extremely fast (got them in just a week), the BB cream were nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>Anytime I wear this I get compliments in how fabulous my skin looks</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s smooth and does&#x27;t cake.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>This BB cream has a greyish cast that didn&#x27;t really fit my yellowish skin tone.</li>
            <li>so I prefer a light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li>The texture was so smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Coverage: I&#x27;d put this as light to medium coverage.  </li>
            <li>The product is amazing, it really hides blemishes well and lightens skin tone.</li>
            <li>a bit light but</li>
            <li>I used a light mineral powdewr over to set</li>
            <li>(I have light beige skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I felt like I wouldn&#x27;t enjoy the scent of this bb cream.</li>
            <li>And I definitely don&#x27;t have great skin.</li>
            <li>No 21 was too light.  </li>
            <li>Light coverage but even tone.</li>
            <li>21.(too light).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and smooth when pumped out.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>It blends in perfectly with my skin tone and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all.</li>
            <li>it will oxidize to fit your skin tone</li>
            <li>This does cover your light skin flaws.</li>
            <li>Pairing it with a darker foundation since this a tad light</li>
            <li>Overall, I give this 4 stars because the coverage is really great</li>
            <li>It smells lovely, covers acne, acne marks, scars, enlarged pores, and leaves my skin looking and feeling fresh and dewy.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>I have light to medium skin</li>
            <li>It covers without looking cakey, and still feels light.</li>
            <li>I actually use this in the winter than the summer more often because it does a good job of hydrating my skin.</li>
            <li>(it also leaves a grayish tint if you put too much on) but overall it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Beblesh Balm but find the shade of the MISSHA much more natural and warm and the coverage thicker and smoother.  </li>
            <li>: This is best for pale people.  </li>
            <li>She said just be sure you choose the right shade number for your complexion.</li>
            <li>As far as the seller is concerned, they were awesome (and I loved the pink package!), the product came wrapped in bubble wrap and right within the time they said.</li>
            <li>I had originally ordered color21 and it was too light for my light skin tone and looked chalky.</li>
            <li>However, I had an easy time with the seller returning the product for a full refund.</li>
            <li>NIce BB cream, does good job smoothing out and covering up age spots and other imperfections.  </li>
            <li>If you are planning to order from here please be aware or do not order any at all would be my advice!!  </li>
            <li>First it has a SPF of 42!!</li>
            <li>The reason I&#x27;m giving this product an ok, is because I love this product, but the pump in this particular one did not work.</li>
            <li>This is definitely more coverage than most American BB creams, which I like, so if you have mild to moderate discolorations on your face, this will make your face look flawless.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that you need very little amount of it and it gives your skin a good coverage.</li>
            <li>Nice texture, decent coverage and feels moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It gives me a dewy, bright, youthful look that no other foundation gives me (I&#x27;m 35).  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this long craved BB Cream after hearing so many good things about it.</li>
            <li>(Since I do tan easily in the summer months, I have found the other BB cream to be a better match color wise when my skin darkens.)  </li>
            <li>I use a different one before, but this is one is Amazing!</li>
            <li>Figured I could get a discount versus buying it for the original price at $30 realizing it being the holidays</li>
            <li>The bb cream was way lighter than the original #23.</li>
            <li>When you first apply it, make sure you dont put on moisturizer</li>
            <li>so i decided to use my favorite moisturizer First Aid beauty and then applied this bb</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this BB cream when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>long as I don&#x27;t breakout, I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;ve found my BB</li>
            <li>I just wanted to share that I had originally purchased the No. 21 BB cream</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product and applied it to my face.</li>
            <li>but im pretty sure its not meant to be on the face</li>
            <li>Totally worth the wait!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>On top of it (and here&#x27;s where I may be kind of paranoid), the cream only filled 2/3 of the container.</li>
            <li>It will still show through a bit, but I shouldn&#x27;t expect completely full coverage from a BB cream, but it does make my skin look really smooth and helps blur my pores.</li>
            <li>and they were also willing to exchange it for a better one or refund my money.  </li>
            <li>and my face looks really great after a long day at the office.</li>
            <li>Thanks you guys! :)</li>
            <li>so I wonder if the product is original or a conterfeit.</li>
            <li>Ever since the first application, I&#x27;ve been in love.</li>
            <li>By all means, it is very light and fairly sheer and has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>be applied to the whole face evenly and easily!  </li>
            <li>Because of all the good reviews and high recommendations, I was willing to keep trying it because sometime you will see the difference after using it for awhile.</li>
            <li>The shade is light but absorbs quickly in the skin.</li>
            <li>I found the Natural Beige to be the perfect shade for my medium-toned Asian skin.</li>
            <li>The pump is pretty nice too and keeps the product pretty clean and neat in its container.</li>
            <li>So if you have dry skin, great product; if you don&#x27;t, try it or look for something else.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>OH MY holy bb cream this is by far the best asian bb cream I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually between NC20-25 with cool undertones and this color works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>However, I love it because it makes my face look more natural instead of a caked on mask.  </li>
            <li>This product has a VERY strong \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; scent that lingers for awhile; I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances, but this was so strong that it gave me a headache.</li>
            <li>This provides great coverage and I love the fact that it has such high SPF.  </li>
            <li>Missha BB Cream is amazing at the coverage I need as well as making my skin feel soft!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Can&#x27;t say anything special about it.</li>
            <li>But when I put it on my face, it blends right into my skin after about 10 mins!</li>
            <li>This color is perfect for my complexion, it&#x27;s seems a little grayish when you first applying</li>
            <li>I am so pleased the clerk also told me that the concept of BB creams originated with the Asian gals and their products are more effective often containing high SPF&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>There is a very light scent that comes with it, which I don&#x27;t much care for, but it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>It works ok - however, I find it does make my wrinkles around my eyes more apparent.</li>
            <li>This provides great coverage even when it is a BB cream; however, it can swim all over your face if you don&#x27;t set with powder so be careful.</li>
            <li>So so...not that great as I expected...</li>
            <li>Too Face gives a dewy/sheer/natural look and good for yellow tone</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice the ashy hue that some people did, but maybe because I&#x27;m not using as much product as recommended so more of my skin tone comes through.</li>
            <li>but once you apply it on your face and smooth it out, it actually has some pretty nice coverage!</li>
            <li>True to its name</li>
            <li>I think this product is good for spot coverage insteaed of entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is true</li>
            <li>This is such a shame because my skin looked good with it</li>
            <li>Makes the makeup removal process that much simpler, and it is certainly better for the skin.  </li>
            <li>Will order it again when she is ready for more.</li>
            <li>No matter what the coverage, whether it&#x27;s on the lighter more sheer side or thicker more makeup-y side, they all seem to do a fabulous job in evening out skin tone and brightening up the skin.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this 3 times now and getting ready to order more.  </li>
            <li>The pump did not work because the tube was 25% full.</li>
            <li>I got this for my mom for Christmas hoping she would love it, but I got this and was really upset.</li>
            <li>It offers a nice finished look, and wears well throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>You can layer this up for more coverage, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it because it can look really cakey.  </li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite foundation.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t really wear anything on top of it, like blusher, because it won&#x27;t blend well.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time I really can&#x27;t tell if I have anything on my face.</li>
            <li>It smoothens out my face nicely and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>no. 23 is a true match for my skin color and oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I order missha m for my 85 years old mother, after one use she was amazed how nicely covering all of imperfection on her face.</li>
            <li>Like it, but don&#x27;t know if SPF is good enough.</li>
            <li>This is a true beauty balm.  </li>
            <li>This is an okay product to use when you don&#x27;t want to put too much makeup.</li>
            <li>i am a fair skin asian</li>
            <li>yet it does a full coverage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>If I sound like I&#x27;m raving, it&#x27;s because I really do feel that strongly about this product.     </li>
            <li>good for light and dry skinned people</li>
            <li>It is a good product to use for daily quick make up.</li>
            <li>No 23 is a little too fair for my skin!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine, and it has great coverage, but the color is not suitable once again for rich or light skinned folk.</li>
            <li>Less is best, I use less than a full pump when I apply and still get good coverage.</li>
            <li>It blends and builds nicely, gives my skin an amazing glow, and I appreciate that it has such high SPF, as I am a fair-skinned redhead.</li>
            <li>my favorite is definitely dr jarts silver label, which stays on alot longer and provides full coverage with just some mineral powder on top.</li>
            <li>I love BB cream in general and this BB cream is great for starter or younger teenager to try it.</li>
            <li>I think is a good product with a good coverage for a BB Cream, it will last all day long in my combination skin.</li>
            <li>I used Dior Nude foundation, Channel Solid Foundation, Estee lauder Double wear, Armarni Foundation which costs almost twice(or three thimes)than this, but comparing to price this is the best one.</li>
            <li>I kind of have light tan skin with yellow undertones</li>
            <li>Overall, so glad I bought it and will probably order again unless I happen to come across one that convinces me it is better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this, would be even better if they came in more variety of shades to cater to a bigger market of consumers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than a concealer (prior to this my favorite concealer was eve pearl - salmon) -</li>
            <li>but i think this product is worthy of my time.  </li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t perfect, and it looks like this brand just doesn&#x27;t have my actual color, but its close enough and no one notices.</li>
            <li>I have a super oily T zone but not when using this.</li>
            <li>I purchased this bb cream and boomer and arrived early than i expected, and very happy</li>
            <li>It looks great when first put on but after oxidating for a couple of hours, it starts to have a bit of a grey tint to it.</li>
            <li>and i notices it makes my facial skins nice and smooth</li>
            <li>Gives me a super clean and fresh look.</li>
            <li>My Giorgio Armani foundation is running out and even though it covers great and last forever, I&#x27;m ready to try something else.</li>
            <li>It has good coverage, it offers sun protection, you don&#x27;t really need concealer after using this.</li>
            <li>Definitely one of the better BB Creams that are on the more affordable end of the spectrum.</li>
            <li>Beware, goes on with a whitish look but quickly assimilates to your skin color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After research, this particular brand seemed to be the favorite and also do what it claims.</li>
            <li>the finish in your skin looks super.</li>
            <li>so you have to blend it in quickly.</li>
            <li>I have also bought the SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li>I love BB Creams vs Foundation, but with my skin type I found this particular BB Cream a bit too dewy looking for my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do mix it with the skin79 super bb cream and this works for me .</li>
            <li>This product only got 2 stars for 2 reasons- 1: fast shipping and 2: The bottle design is a great concept.</li>
            <li>and I love that it has the high SPF.  </li>
            <li>Better than any high end</li>
            <li>I love this bb cream because the fact that it have high SPF.</li>
            <li>I am also pleased that both the bbcream and the concealer have a high SPF.  </li>
            <li>Since it was pretty cheap (&lt;$20), I gave it a try...</li>
            <li>It is pretty comfortable to wear.    </li>
            <li>It spread out pretty smoothly and uniformly.</li>
            <li>ive tried, and i normally wouldnt say that :)</li>
            <li>This BB Cream is light weight, i suggest to shake the product first before using.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>Coworkers have commented on how young my skin looks, and it has some very fine light-reflecting particles that make my dkin glow without being sparkly.&lt;br /&gt;Comments:</li>
            <li>Love love this product, the color suits my asian type of skin, and very moisturizing and smooth to be applied.</li>
            <li>light on your skin, perfect coverage, dont make your face oily, and i have acne prone skin so far its actually help with to clear my acne.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I wanted an SPF because I live in Hawaii and most tinted moisturizers are SPF15 or have no SPF at all.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say that this is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li>It last a long time and seems to be the best one I have tried.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is extremely strong, unlike the real product.</li>
            <li>It is really creamy and easy to apply with your fingers, although I prefer a beauty blender.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight and easy to apply with hands or with a brush.</li>
            <li>It does not settle in fine line and it makes skin look very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Some people might be bothered by smell if you are very sensitive, but I like the smell :)</li>
            <li>I love that fact that it looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>coworkers try this bb cream and every single one has loved it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it says it is!</li>
            <li>THIS IS NOT THE REAL PRODUCT.!!</li>
            <li>Makes me wonder why I&#x27;m even using this one in the first place!</li>
            <li>it actually has coverage unlike most bb creams !</li>
            <li>ps.shipping was fast too!!</li>
            <li>It also covers and conceals pretty well!  </li>
            <li>only way more affordable!</li>
            <li>but this was just my first impression and some of the reasons on why I didn&#x27;t purchase this!</li>
            <li>First of all, shipping was a day faster than promised!</li>
            <li>Very natural feeling and great coverage at the same time.</li>
            <li>I have very fair complexion and am in my late sixties.</li>
            <li>Not only is it cost efficient, but it works amazingly.</li>
            <li>But if you are buying this product as a moisturizer, for SPF, and a light foundation that really covers your skin well, then this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>The coverage is great and it doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>Shipping is fast and it&#x27;s genuine from Korea.</li>
            <li>skin is very prone to oil/ shine when I wear makeup even with oil free cosmetics...</li>
            <li>Few months ago, after all the hype about BB cream, I bought Missha Perfect BB Cream #23, Etude House Precious Mineral BB Cream #13, and Skin 79 pink label BB Cream (Ebay seller in Korea).  </li>
            <li>I love the coverage and the natural look, it does not feel like having foundation on your face at all.</li>
            <li>IF you want to look more natural and shinny, you need to put missha BB Boomer before this.</li>
            <li>This product brighten my skin and gives pretty good coverage for my minor acne scars.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it works miracles, but I have gotten so many compliments on my face saying that I look naturally radiant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a product that is well worth</li>
            <li>arrived two weeks earlier than expected and was perfectly wrapped.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>But this product stays fresh on my face for the longest time.</li>
            <li>It seems to be absorbed by the skin in a matter of mintutes and stays put.  </li>
            <li>I only get a pimple once in a while and the condition minus makeup is superb.</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the old version one.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t even worth spending any money on.</li>
            <li>She shipment is kinda longer but still worth it.</li>
            <li>I really hope that it was something else that caused my pimples because I just love the finish and the coverage of this bb cream too much.</li>
            <li>I would call this more of an ivory than a natural beige.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is smooth and not thick, yet full coverage can be achieved.</li>
            <li>It does look semi natural and gives you that dewy glow, but if you apply more than one layer, it starts to look cakey.</li>
            <li>I found results and I received a lot of compliments about my skin and how I rarely have wrinkles.</li>
            <li>But, like I said, worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with this cream, it provides a lightweight, flexible coverage that seems to last all day.</li>
            <li>Also, the color I chose off the internet, #23, is a bit ashy, so I mix it equal parts with Clinique CC cream which is a bit warm for my complexion.</li>
            <li>I knew this one was a really popular one among American people</li>
            <li>My makeup does looks more natural and not cakey.</li>
            <li>Overall great coverage medium...lasts long good SPF and great price for the amount you get because you only need a little to do the job.</li>
            <li>I get oily skin pretty quickly, even after powdering with this product on, but</li>
            <li>I need something quick, easy to apply and make me look natural.  </li>
            <li>The color is not too bright like other product which makes me look like wearing a ghost mask.</li>
            <li>It works just as well, and blends good, but I still prefer the other, as it is brighter.</li>
            <li>I loved this prodect so much that I bought a second tube before the first one was gone.</li>
            <li>you will find a right products.</li>
            <li>I think I made the right choice.  </li>
            <li>it ends up blending right in with your skin.  </li>
            <li>If you keep that in mind when you order, you&#x27;ll get the right shade.</li>
            <li>I have a problem, but customer service answered my questions right away.</li>
            <li>As the instructions are in Korean, a bit worried if I should be using this cream while breast feeding (right now using vary sparingly).</li>
            <li>not the right color.........</li>
            <li>Honestly, I got so sensitive skin that I can&#x27;t normally put on anything over my face</li>
            <li>It is very easy to wash off (whether it is on your hands on or on your face), and I definitely like that.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, it is natural on the skin and has a good coverage, quilidade is far superior to other bb cream</li>
            <li>Slightly deeper and more yellow than #21, looks very nice on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky in that I managed to buy the exact shade for my skin the first time.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and I love the availability of various colors.</li>
            <li>that I normally wear and it was way too light, even the package say &amp;#34;light beige&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It covers my pores really good, but not the dark circle eyes.  </li>
            <li>Tried a drug store brand and was very disappointed, but then ordered Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream, great product.</li>
            <li>It goes on as easy as sunscreen and offers just the right amount of coverage for me.  </li>
            <li>At first i thought it would be too light for my skin, but it looks super natural on my skin after i apply.   </li>
            <li>I am very fair with a smattering of freckles and red hair (technically it&#x27;s not my real hair color</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy this again!</li>
            <li>Overall, a great B.B. cream to try for the price and definitely will repurchase.</li>
            <li>Wow my forty eight year old skin looks amazing..</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast too.</li>
            <li>It came super fast and packaging was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because it tends to get greyer later on when thicker, multiple layers isn&#x27;t a great idea</li>
            <li>it gives my skin a good coverage it make my facial skins looks so glowy and seems so natural looks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a makeup artist myself, so I&#x27;m constantly in the lookout for great products that actually do what they say.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair skinned half Filipino/white mix.</li>
            <li>Excellent used on it&#x27;s own or as a base..</li>
            <li>It gives skin a nice glowy/smooth look, although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you are looking for full coverage for things like dark circles and so on.</li>
            <li>The yellow undertones work great for my Asian skin.</li>
            <li>My advice is to spend some extra time looking at shades to make sure you get the right one.</li>
            <li>The product says it&#x27;s supposed to be healthy for the skin, and I definitely believe it, my skin hasn&#x27;t reacted to the bb cream at all, and I love that the ingredients are natural and gentle</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, but with Missha&#x27;s BB cream, it does not only moisturize my skin during the day, it also provides great natural coverage over my face.</li>
            <li>it has a very strong perfume smell and comes out a grey color and stays that way</li>
            <li>but I add a little bit of bronzer on my cheek bones and forehead and its all good.</li>
            <li>It gives just the right amount of coverage and still looks very natural, and it can be built up to full coverage.</li>
            <li>While the other is lighter and thinner (great for summer time), I like this product for not only matching my yellow undertones during the winter months, but also it&#x27;s nice to sometimes wear something with a matte finish.  </li>
            <li>I think if you have a clear and blemish free skin you can skip the foundation.</li>
            <li>I have been using Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer for years, but I recently moved to a much more humid climate.</li>
            <li>B/c of popularity of Missha, I used it first.  </li>
            <li>This one seems to cover the imperfections better such as discolorations.</li>
            <li>This bb cream appears to be a greyish tan color at first</li>
            <li>This was the first BB cream I ever bought</li>
            <li>It seems to not only look better with this on it but without makeup my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li>On the top back of the container, there is a date reading</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed was the that the cosmetic bottle was bloated.</li>
            <li>im pretty pissed off.</li>
            <li>First time using a BB Cream and ordering from Seouleglamour.  </li>
            <li>I really like this BB Cream!  </li>
            <li>It feels light on my skin, and hasn&#x27;t seemed to cause any irritation to my usually sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>First off is the color..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first BB cream.</li>
            <li>The actual product is lighter in body, and more moisturizing, with a dewey finish.</li>
            <li>( I am an avid sephora &amp; ulta shopper).</li>
            <li>My favorite coverage is shisheido compressed powder #21 (which is now discontinued - hence i&#x27;m trying out different products).</li>
            <li>must admit this is the first BB cream I ever purchased/tried.  </li>
            <li>My first one was #21.  </li>
            <li>This has never irritated my skin, and gives me a bit of a dewey look for the first couple of hours after application.  </li>
            <li>the bb cream lasts all day and is absolutely life-changing!</li>
            <li>Both my friends and I have used this before and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I ordered a second tube within two weeks of using the first one, just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>This is the first foundation, bb cream,</li>
            <li>It seemed greasier and thinner at first which meant it didn&#x27;t cover as well.</li>
            <li>Now, whenever I decide to use this product I first use a primer and pore filler.</li>
            <li>I will recommend to my friends and order more for myself in a future.</li>
            <li>Price aside, it lasts all day in the hot weather and driest winter.</li>
            <li>When I put this product on my face first time, looks like it&#x27;s darker than my skin.</li>
            <li>They re wrapped really carefully and nice.</li>
            <li>First of all, the product I&#x27;ve received has a defective pump.</li>
            <li>and I was even more so on this since the result that vary enormously depending on your skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that this is the seller&#x27;s fault--perhaps more likely a mistake at the factory.</li>
            <li>Sure enough after a couple uses, I had a break out.</li>
            <li>when you first out it on.</li>
            <li>natural beige is fairly light</li>
            <li>You can apply with a beauty blender for a light natural coverage or with your fingers or a brush for heavier coverage.</li>
            <li>First of all, it took quite awhile to come.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using BB cream</li>
            <li>My daughter told me about this product and first got it for me as a gift.  </li>
            <li>For the first week it worked well but after that--i noticed i started getting itchy redness around my mouth and nose.</li>
            <li>Oh and p.s., the  pump that exudes the cream does not work after the first application.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it didn&#x27;t blend as well as my Origins tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li>I like the results of the BB cream much more than regular liquid foundation and mineral make-up</li>
            <li>I will order more in the future.</li>
            <li>The problem is that this BB Cream is very smelly!</li>
            <li>It is the real deal!</li>
            <li>When I tried the Missha product for the first time, I was quite astounded.</li>
            <li>One review said if u need moisture use that first then this product but that seems to defeat the convenience of using a B&amp;B cream.</li>
            <li>Definitely will get another one once mine starts to run out. :)</li>
            <li>There was much more of a difference from 27 to 23, and I have to send it back for, oh, maybe a 25?  </li>
            <li>It blends well and looks like your skin only better.</li>
            <li>others sit on top of your skin like an extra layer.  </li>
            <li>Have been using for the last year and have gotten many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>, so higher kudos for this company</li>
            <li>Lovely product, will purchase in the future.</li>
            <li>This was the first BB cream I tried</li>
            <li>The only con to this product is that it leaves a greyish cast when you first put it on and its more notiecable</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>and actually I think my skin is in better condition since using it.</li>
            <li>This was the first BB Cream that I purchased along with a BB Cream from Etude House, this BB cream worked so well that I did not even use the one from Etude House.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also soooooooo much cheaper to buy it from this seller than when I see it out in the stores!  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t fit my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I find that the Korean brands perform much better than their American counterparts.</li>
            <li>The result is even skin tone that lasts the whole day!</li>
            <li>I was able to make one 50ml tube last more than 3 months with daily wear.</li>
            <li>Love this product and I will definitely buy it again, as soon as I finish the one that i just got.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is SPF 40 and protects my skin from future damage.  </li>
            <li>will definitely look into more products by this company.</li>
            <li>As for this BB Cream, it&#x27;s my first one</li>
            <li>/&gt;I don&#x27;t know what to say about this because this is my first cream</li>
            <li>I am definitely ordering more when this runs out.</li>
            <li>When I first heard of BB Cream on TV, I went to amazon.com to poke around and read the reviews.</li>
            <li>It just produces an overall better and even looking face.</li>
            <li>my first time using BB cream</li>
            <li>I have tried many different foundations and bb creams.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a LOT of BB creams but this one is definitely at the top of my list.</li>
            <li>When you first squeeze it out of the bottle the color may look somewhat &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; or grayish</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Loreal and Maybelline BB creams, and this product is definitely of a much higher quality.</li>
            <li>Although it wasn&#x27;t pleasant at first order but will be keep looking forward to make different order in future.</li>
            <li>It stays very fresh looking all day and doesn&#x27;t cake up; in fact it looks quite natural because it is so moisturised.</li>
            <li>so you know - I&#x27;ve always had really good, clear skin; a bit dry,</li>
            <li>Is very not hi cost, will buy forever, my skin is very oily, and feel very confortable!!&lt;br /&gt;Loved it!!</li>
            <li>It comes on sort of thick at first, but when you apply it to your face it does smoothe out and leave a nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li>This is my third tube, and I love it just as much as I did the first time I bought it.</li>
            <li>I opted for the #23, based on other user&#x27;s reviews and my own &amp;#34;guess&amp;#34; work.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Hopefully MISHA BB CREAM will come out in other shades so that more people can try this super</li>
            <li>Also I have neutral undertones but it&#x27;s great for all undertones (pink, yellow, and neutral).</li>
            <li>lol i pumped out one tiny drop and started dotting around the center area of my face and blended it all over..</li>
            <li>It moisturizes also, but best if used with your daily facial moisturizer if you have dry skin like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gives a natural yet clean look.</li>
            <li>I think the No. 21 will be good in the dead of winter when I&#x27;m much paler.</li>
            <li>Firstly, my skin tone is pretty much spot on with anything that is named &amp;#34;beige&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I am relatively fair complected and caucasian, with some natural pink to my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I can&#x27;t give a true true review since I don&#x27;t use it on a regular basis</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- takes a long time to set and oxidize (30 min or more) and it will look a bit unnatural when worn the first couple of hours (2-3 hours) with a setting powder</li>
            <li>It also kind of showed up with a grey cast (initially) which kind of scares me a tiny bit.</li>
            <li>I have medium, yellowish asian skin and this is a very light beige color and because of the high spf, dries my skin.</li>
            <li>when i first put this on, i didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li>However, after the \\&quot;oxidation\\&quot;, the color blends into your natural skin tone and, at least for me, it is a perfect and natural match.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t write a long review because there are many reviews here already.  </li>
            <li>This is a fabulous BB cream - it goes on smoothly and covers up my imperfections like hyper-pigmentation and other blemishes.  </li>
            <li>The box and bottle looks sophisticated but no clear instructions as how and what to do to pump the fluids out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my 50 yr old American white girl complexion.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more grey than beige.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>I love this BB Cream and will never ever use another brands BB Cream as long as Missa makes BB Creams.</li>
            <li>The cream looks dark coming out from its container, but blends in nicely and does not change the tone of my skin.  </li>
            <li>While it did a good job at covering my redness, it was not able to cover some acne scars on my chin and cheeks.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it improves skins condition any but still a good product.</li>
            <li>and reply back right away!!</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that it really did diminish the appearance of my fairly large pores.</li>
            <li>but I am not because I wish there was more moisturizing if you put this on and your skin is dry</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and offers full coverage.</li>
            <li>it certainly doesn&#x27;t exacerbate the oiliness during the day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light in color, but with a little bronzer on top, the look is very natural.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t really feel like sending it back and getting a new since i love it and don&#x27;t feel like waiting another week for it to get here and ect.</li>
            <li>Very high SPF for a BB cream</li>
            <li>Certainly, their coverage and sunscreen last all day and feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more for people with dry skin because it has a lot more oil in it than other BB creams I have and use.</li>
            <li>The only problem for me was that I am very tanned, so even number 23 was a bit light for me.</li>
            <li>I myself am someone who wears makeup once in a blue moon, so I really wanted something that I could feel comfortable in.  </li>
            <li>I think that it minimizes the appearance of my pores more than Bare Minerals does, but I still prefer the ease and lightness of Bare Minerals during the day.</li>
            <li>I really like the consistency and coverage.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommended it!</li>
            <li>The only thing that&#x27;s a bit iffy is that it does oxidize a bit throughout the day, meaning that it changes color and can sweat off, but this is no longer a problem for me as I set it with a light dusting of powder.</li>
            <li>however, it wasn&#x27;t until a week into this routine that i noticed much difference.</li>
            <li>my forehead gets shiny before the end of the day and bb cream doesn&#x27;t really help this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a whole range of types of foundation, from compact foundation to liquid, from mineral to tinted moisturizers.</li>
            <li>you dont really need powder unless you sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I use it now for the tops of my hands, and it&#x27;s very waterproof.</li>
            <li>However, I found it didn&#x27;t control oil that much - I still get oily on my nose -</li>
            <li>like I didn&#x27;t have much make-up on.</li>
            <li>The product is light but provides enough coverage that I don&#x27;t have to use anything</li>
            <li>I absolutely swear by this stuff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like this shade</li>
            <li>I ordered a lot for my mom as well because she loves that the SPF is so high!</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, buy the real thing.</li>
            <li>Although the coverage its not work very well</li>
            <li>This is similar quality as the Light Beige.  </li>
            <li>I really like the packaging -</li>
            <li>It stays almost the whole day too</li>
            <li>People said my skin looks very glowing.</li>
            <li>but it blends very well.</li>
            <li>Save your money and please buy a real foundation, like make up forever.</li>
            <li>I can tell my skin looks much nicer.</li>
            <li>I really like it because it covers all of my blemishes in pictures and the fact that it has sunblock protection in it too.</li>
            <li>I am all about BB creams and haven&#x27;t really used one I don&#x27;t like, but this one is tops for me.  </li>
            <li>I do feel like after long-term use it has really balanced out my skin and helped to heal any scars/dark spots.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to face the day.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it in a while since I stopped wearing so much make-up.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a fabulous BB cream</li>
            <li>I started out with skin79&#x27;s pink label, but this one is a lot better.</li>
            <li>So I really like how this product is SPF42.</li>
            <li>It blends really well too.</li>
            <li>I really can think of no cons.</li>
            <li>and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>but with this one, i dont have to really blot at all...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even need the oil papers as much</li>
            <li>But after a couple of days it seemed to thicken up and coveres very well.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s one of the reasons I like this product so much.</li>
            <li>: shipping was fairly fast</li>
            <li>what I do like about it is that it is very breathable.  </li>
            <li>Much of the time after I wear makeup, my skin feels like it is dying because it can&#x27;t breath (clogged pores).  </li>
            <li>Gives enough coverage to be considered a light foundation in my book, if you issues about not wearing anything, but need sunscreen and just a bit of balancing.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and creamy, and it soaks into the skin instantly...</li>
            <li>My application in the morning at 6:00 AM lasts me the whole day.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m Asian, the creams available at retail don&#x27;t match my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Because it is not the same as I brought in Korea, however the price is cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never broken out.</li>
            <li>Granted, I don&#x27;t really have any blemishes on my face.</li>
            <li>The 3 stars is for the surprisingly fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>The BB cream does not cover much of my blemishes from what it promises.  </li>
            <li>- Cleanse  - Kiehl&#x27;s Cucumber Toner  - MAC Strobe Cream  - Missha BB Cream  - Facial mist (either MyChelle&#x27;s Fruit Enzyme Mist or Clinique&#x27;s Thirsty Skin Relief)  - Brush light powder    </li>
            <li>This product arrived fast and was packed very well.</li>
            <li>While it did cover some blotches, to me, it covered too much.  </li>
            <li>The pump also comes off which you can&#x27;t do with the real product.</li>
            <li>I really like how it goes on</li>
            <li>have to use a moisturizer before applying the MISHA BB CREAM, also, because it has very matte</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s really opaque.</li>
            <li>I really like this BB cream, but wish it was made without parabens.</li>
            <li>The color was much lighter than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really give me the coverage I&#x27;m expecting</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and don&#x27;t want too much oil but don&#x27;t like the chalky look</li>
            <li>the whole</li>
            <li>I really like this Missha BB Cream.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, but I didn&#x27;t get it for that</li>
            <li>it feels very oily and makes me break out.</li>
            <li>But it absorbs fast and ends up rather velvety and not shiny.</li>
            <li>Now I see what the whole BB cream hype is all about.</li>
            <li>is very desaturated in color.</li>
            <li>If I have a really pigmented blemish/pimple, etc.</li>
            <li>I just get really oily during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Is greasy and makes me very oily prone.</li>
            <li>Sooo much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It blended really well.</li>
            <li>The shipping wasn&#x27;t particularly fast or anything, but it arrived around the time it said it would.</li>
            <li>It goes on a bit gray but blends in really well and hides imperfections.</li>
            <li>Covers very well</li>
            <li>It covers so much of my problem areas and does not cause me to break out</li>
            <li>I really like how it smell,look and feel on my face.  </li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>It covers my face really well.</li>
            <li>this made my face look very shiny.</li>
            <li>But of course it gets oxidized and changes color (not too much though..</li>
            <li>$13.46 is really really reasonable</li>
            <li>and has SPF 42...lots of benefits in one product...and very affordable.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover some skin discolorations, which I don&#x27;t really expect it to do.  </li>
            <li>much thicker than i thought.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really say how well it is compared to -blank-.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its cover ability is very pefect.</li>
            <li>All of the rest are simply too light in color and</li>
            <li>Blends in really well with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Really the product.</li>
            <li>However, it makes my skin very oily.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and don&#x27;t like using liquid foundation or any of the bb creams.</li>
            <li>I really adore this BB cream.</li>
            <li>The product works well, but doesn&#x27;t help much with my oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Plus of Missha BB cream, high SPF (maybe that why it seems more oily).&lt;br /&gt;In summary, for medium coverage Missha (if you don&#x27;t mind the fragrant), Etude House (if you don&#x27;t have dry skin).  </li>
            <li>It goes on the skin very smoothly, and unlike some other BB creams that I&#x27;ve tried, does give that ashy complexion after a while.</li>
            <li>I would advise against making a purchase for this product unless you want full coverage, complete with new breakouts.</li>
            <li>The coverage is amazing and it does not leave your face looking like a pale ghost.</li>
            <li>I have dry to normal skin, and I don&#x27;t have many pimples either.</li>
            <li>but i find that the \\&quot;natural beige\\&quot; isn&#x27;t the right match for my Caucasian skin.</li>
            <li>They are as good as any other similar product you buy at the drugstore</li>
            <li>I originally bought this a few months ago for my mom, but it was too light for her skin tone, so she gave it to</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super strong but quite potent enough to have a sniff.</li>
            <li>This natural beige is VERY light and has a tint of grey.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all and washes off easily with mild face soap.</li>
            <li>My first impression was wow!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker and more matte than other BB creams I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>The color is off when comparing with my original Missha, and printing on the tub is very different.  </li>
            <li>Definitely better than other foundations.</li>
            <li>1oz/30ml]])has a lot more oil in it than other BB creams I have and use.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other BB creams and nothing compares to the Missha.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear foundation due to heaviness, I love this maybelline&lt;br /&gt;Product instead</li>
            <li>The cream is really good,has a good texture,smell and lovely covering effect,makes your skin soft and natural but the problem is that i picked the wrong color..</li>
            <li>I have oily skin with mild acne, and this cream not only controlled the oil really well but also covered up my blemishes as well as lightened up my whole face.</li>
            <li>it becomes grey quickly !</li>
            <li>It smells good and covers well.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, even on my relatively tan skin, the color is on the dark side, and it lacks in color -</li>
            <li>The product does not look dry after application and the high SPF is a great bonus as I am using multiple topical medications and must be very cautious with my sun exposure.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use this BB cream with high SPF than any other suncreens however as most tend to be too greasy or they break me out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it before, and this one has the same perfect effect as my previous one bought from other places.</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast and was in brand new box wrapped as well...was a little light for me</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, so it works fine with me.  </li>
            <li>I have a few discolorations, and occasional cystic acne, and this really makes my skin look even and bright.  </li>
            <li>This #23 shade comes out lighter than my natural tone at first</li>
            <li>i bought the number 23 in hopes that once it oxidized that i would suit my shade (i have a medium-olived tone skin, ie bare mineral golden medium, MUFE 123)and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s similar to the cho bo yang (missha) cream in cool beige</li>
            <li>skin colors offered are pretty natural  -neat bottle  </li>
            <li>it doesnt provide full coverage and the color and product does wear off in a short while.</li>
            <li>this was my first of two bb creams to try so far.  </li>
            <li>It looks beautiful on the skin without looking fake.</li>
            <li>I am able to use less and less over time because my skin really is getting that much better.    </li>
            <li>My favorite BB creme hands down.</li>
            <li>This cream covers beautifully, however it is a little dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I live in the humid Virginia state and the BB cream does very well in the summer.</li>
            <li>When you apply it, it goes on easily but as it gets absored into the skin, it becomes harder to work into the skin as it becomes matt/powderly like.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I&#x27;m never buying foundation again, bb creams have changed me ^^</li>
            <li>I need to order a different  shade for better coverage however for my asian skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m asian with fairly light skin tone in my early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I only wish they had a more yellow-based color - but that seems to be a universal issue with make</li>
            <li>After countless trips and dollars spent at Sephora on many expensive brands, this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>No big deal, I thought I would just open the top to use it.</li>
            <li>and I use it as my main foundation.  </li>
            <li>on, the cream does cover remarkably well and seems to last all day, without causing my face to become an oil slick and shiny.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this product and would definitely order again.</li>
            <li>I have older oily skin</li>
            <li>I particularly don&#x27;t like things that have a scent</li>
            <li>This particular BB cream from Missha retails (in Korea) for 11,000  won</li>
            <li>Decently priced product here in amazon.</li>
            <li>It is a little light so mix it with No. 27 to get right shade.</li>
            <li>Like the other reviewers, it coveraged well and very light in order to look natural.</li>
            <li>and im fair liek asian pale.</li>
            <li>The medium coverage is just enough to dull my blemishes and the super lightweight formula feels amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li>So we highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>i have tried everything from drugstore foundations to the high end</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Coverage is more than expected for such a sheer and light seeming cream.</li>
            <li>Highly recomment</li>
            <li>My problem with it is the high perfume odor.</li>
            <li>And the SPF is high which is a plus.  </li>
            <li>high SPF and lots of skin benefits</li>
            <li>I like the coverage of this bb cream and the high SPF.</li>
            <li>The only thing that has been keeping me from using my current tube of the Perfect Cover is the fact that it is clearly too dark for my current winter skin.</li>
            <li>It lasted thru most of the day (unlike my powder) and it hid all my imperfections (little freckles on my cheeks).  </li>
            <li>It looks alot better on when you have it blended in after its oxidized a little bit.</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to remove</li>
            <li>Really smells like an old woman&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the CREAM is great.</li>
            <li>but if you add the shipping your spending 8 more bucks which I guess isn&#x27;t incredibly bad considering your not buying it in Korea but just FYI on how much it&#x27;s actually worth :).</li>
            <li>Then, I was really surprised that this cream really is what I hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li>the real deal not fake American copies...</li>
            <li>and then normal cheeks.</li>
            <li>this bb cream covers well on my normal and oily skin area...</li>
            <li>Currently My skin tone is fairly light in Bare minerals matte foundation.</li>
            <li>With my normal foundation I would&#x27;ve started to become oily in one or two hours.</li>
            <li>(not common)</li>
            <li>This shade is darker than normal BB cream</li>
            <li>If I use it like a normal sized amount, like the size of a quarter, it gives my face a ashen/corpse like color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have noticed that even when I don&#x27;t do this the BB cream oxidizes and matches my skinetone better after a few hours.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t heavy coverage, more medium coverage.  </li>
            <li>waste of money and don&#x27;t require me to add more words to this surey as it is insult to injury</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the winter/fall months which may make your skin dry and dull.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastability: If you don&#x27;t top this off with finishing powder, it won&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is, it seems to start drying right away</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re weighing your options with BB creams right now, look no further.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m Asian, and this BB cream, though it had a great consistency (not too thin but not creamy thick) and smells nice,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used quite a few BB creams in the last few months and this one is by far the BEST!</li>
            <li>I am asian with light brown tone, i was skeptical when i first used it bcuz its kind of a little light on my skin</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly without the cakey look i&#x27;ve encountered with some other brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much coverage it offers for someone who needs more coverage.</li>
            <li>However it was very generous of amazon to give me a return slip for free, and didn&#x27;t take long to see my money back in my card.</li>
            <li>I am new to BB creams</li>
            <li>I live in the desert</li>
            <li>However, my husband even commented, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t like your new foundation\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>and i live in the desert.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing that I couldn&#x27;t live without..</li>
            <li>Especially since it has sunscreen built in (with my combination skin, it&#x27;s hard to find a good sunscreen that won&#x27;t make me shiny or oily.)</li>
            <li>but after I saw myself in the mirror a few hours later my skin looked amazing and</li>
            <li>The only reason I prefer the skin79 one over this is because I feel this has more pink tones in it and</li>
            <li>It still worked okay, but sadly I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable to continue using it after a while...</li>
            <li>Just think enough to provide coverage but light enough to just feel like face cream.</li>
            <li>I only wish it was available at local drug stores.</li>
            <li>It did NOT set smoothly at all either but left my face feeling overly heavy, oily, and super shiney.</li>
            <li>On top of that, it&#x27;s not too pink and not too yellow.</li>
            <li>It is more coverage than other tinted moisturizers I have tried but lighter than a full face of foundation (which in summer can get messy).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s thicker and provides more coverage than I expected, so I used too much the first few times after switching from Maybelline.</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin was very clear and even toned.</li>
            <li>I have splotchy, reddish skin that is very sensitive, and it was visibly improved after a week.  </li>
            <li>I was worried about it causing breakouts, since I have very sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>right when i put this on, the color was much darker than what i expected.</li>
            <li>Like others have mentioned, a little bit of this product goes a looooooooong way, so the price is extremely reasonable considering how other liquid foundations don&#x27;t cover as well as this bb cream, or offer as many benefits as the Missha, either!  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, but after showering and washing my face it can be pretty dry because I use benzoyl peroxide for my acne.</li>
            <li>Also bought Smash Box BB cream and tried many other American brands BB creams (Dior, Boscia, Too Face, Tarte).  </li>
            <li>Some of the comments said the color was on the light side and to order up, but I found the #23 too dark and am going to order the #21.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I use it everyday!</li>
            <li>At first I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work for me because I have a different skin type from them, but my cousin said it should be alright.</li>
            <li>This IS the expiration date so same as other BB cream sellers, they advertise to sell the &amp;#34;2013 latest products&amp;#34; and they are expired.</li>
            <li>In the future, I will probably test out many other bb creams but buy this product again since I already know it works for me.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>and if you have an aversion to flowery smells its pretty gross.</li>
            <li>After reading other reviews, and seeing this type of product recommended on tv, I was excited to try.  </li>
            <li>I am going to throw these out and go back to the one for $15.99 and hope I get the product I purchased the first time.  </li>
            <li>While probably not necessary, I do set it with a powder, although it dries pretty well -</li>
            <li>I usually never give reviews.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin with very large pores, uneven skin tone, and mild acne, and I would normally wear a primer, concealer, and Bare Minerals foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a slight perfume smell (I like it) that quickly dissolves and I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s really matte.</li>
            <li>I normally use the bare minerals line or the smashbox mineral \\&quot;foundation\\&quot; because I tend to find regular foundation too time consuming to choose (the right color).</li>
            <li>Even though, you can build for more coverage, but I&#x27;d not recommended b/c it will look very heavy.  </li>
            <li>There is a definite reason that Missha BB creams are so highly regarded - it really does work.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a minor point when the overall coverage is so smooth and even.</li>
            <li>Dior BB creams are more of yellow tone and dark.  </li>
            <li>It meets my expections because I serves many beneficial aspects for my face such as covering blemishes and dark spots, making my face look smoother and prettier.</li>
            <li>The color sets in very naturally and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So - with much research I settled on the MISSHA because, as a caucasian with light to med skin, not all brands would have a pigment dark enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently on my second tube of this, the first last me over a year because I just use one pump to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li>I love how it evens my skin tone and texture without feeling heavy or like its just sitting on my skin and even better, little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I do wear a serum underneath and sometimes will wear a light moisturizer if my skin is extra dry.  </li>
            <li>But since I like the product so much, I just apply my shisheido power over it  (which is use sparingly since the reserves are running low) and it gives a very natural looking finish.  </li>
            <li>This makeup has lasted me a long time, it works better than any other BB cream I have tried yet</li>
            <li>The product is made in Korea, where the \\&quot;BB Cream\\&quot; is very hot, and so you buy from a third party seller here on Amazon or maybe find it in Asian</li>
            <li>A light dusting of loose facial powder</li>
            <li>Not pale.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cause any break outs on me considering that my skin is sensitive and usually acne prone (easily breaks out with new products).</li>
            <li>It goes on a little oily, especially if you apply it on top of a moisturizer, like I do.</li>
            <li>It has also helped even my skin tone, which is important to us middle aged women.  </li>
            <li>I can see a clear line between my face and neck when I wear the cream.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look clumpy or cakey, it kept a natural, dewey finish on my skin.</li>
            <li>I was also surprised how fragrant it is.</li>
            <li>I no longer have oily skin at the end of the day, and my complexion has evened out considerably.</li>
            <li>BB cream No.23 blends into my skin naturally</li>
            <li>However, after about 5 min, it looks entirely natural.</li>
            <li>Yes, when you first put it on, it gives you a mask of a strange color.</li>
            <li>the cream doesn&#x27;t completely match my skin color.</li>
            <li>Also the smell is different from the real one.</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised when my order arrived by airmail</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t noticed this effect yet</li>
            <li>You only need a pea size drop on your hand to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li>I have ordered 3 times so far.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a light/medium complected Caucasian woman) and looks natural.</li>
            <li>and so far I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>It is definitely very spreadable and can be thinned out with moisturizer if needed (depending upon your personal choice of texture).  </li>
            <li>No. 23 Natural Beige tube.</li>
            <li>But it costs me $12.75 USD to ship back, so I decided not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am curious as to how many person has bought this product and encountered the same problem when trying to return the product.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft afterwords and not sticky.</li>
            <li>But when I ordered the No. 23 (natural beige)</li>
            <li>This time I avoided the eye area completely.</li>
            <li>and wow I&#x27;m amazed on how well it goes on my face.</li>
            <li>It just gives my skin a natural look.</li>
            <li>It feels heavy and oily -- cheap type of ingredients.</li>
            <li>you will look green with in the sun light.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>Its not heavy but</li>
            <li>so I purchase both natural and honey beige.</li>
            <li>In fact, it seemed to take all of the natural \\&quot;life\\&quot; out of my face.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have unusually sensitive skin, so this surprised me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, I can only apply a teeny-tiny amount, like the size of a number 2 pencil eraser on the back of my hand and use that as a palette to smooth on my entire face.</li>
            <li>Have since replaced this with the Misha Complete BB.</li>
            <li>Gives a natural &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li>But so far, haven&#x27;t had this problem with BB Cream.  </li>
            <li>but I really believe I look younger with it on.</li>
            <li>In fact, I was so not impatient that I forgot I ordered it until the package arrived!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The finish is natural -- matte and makes your skin look soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color</li>
            <li>Covers up blemishes well with the natural skin tone shading.  </li>
            <li>However, it can cause some skin irritation for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you have imperfections that are to be covered well but look natural, this is it.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product especially if you&#x27;ve never tried a BB crema before.</li>
            <li>Doesnt match, not smooth, its not oil free</li>
            <li>I was surprised, they sent from Korea, they mail on 11/3/14</li>
            <li>I had developed some pimples</li>
            <li>It just looks soo natural.</li>
            <li>It has a grey looking tone - don&#x27;t really like at first sight - and upon initially put on the face, the color looks lighter shade than my skin color.  </li>
            <li>It also almost completely covers my melasma.</li>
            <li>This really has reduced my blemishes overall, even during my cycle!  </li>
            <li>It does have a stronger scent, so if you are sensitive, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>It may look darker than your skin tone, but after you dot it and blend it out all over your face, it will oxidize and blend with your natural skin tone..</li>
            <li>I am self conscious about them, but I feel like this product covers them well.  </li>
            <li>Also it feels great; it isn&#x27;t thick or heavy, it just feels light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It covers more like a foundation, but not quite as thick.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a grey cast and it gives you a very natural finish with very decent coverage (buildable).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just very desaturated, so it doesn&#x27;t have a sunny warm look, more of a cold, pale look.</li>
            <li>But right now I will not go back to any traditional foundation!</li>
            <li>Maybe I just picked the wrong color, but I&#x27;d want to know for sure this is the right color match before shelling out an amount of money for something that doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li>The coverage is better than any other, a little goes a long way, it smells amazing and after applied, a little powder is all you need to set it.  </li>
            <li>It was the only makeup product I used on my face over the summer, besides the occasional concealer (when I didn&#x27;t want full makeup), and Maybelline&#x27;s \\&quot;FIT\\&quot; foundation (which was a MISTAKE for me personally).</li>
            <li>When I got it, I was no less worried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to get my skin back into decent shape.</li>
            <li>If this breaks me out, I&#x27;ll be pretty sad, but as of now I&#x27;m seriously in love.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup, and this is pretty much what I need for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>Pigmented, long wearing, large color selection.</li>
            <li>On the thin side and very easy to blend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big foundation user nor high maintenance person</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a true light olive skin toned (Korean/Caucasian) who has struggled to find a medium to full coverage foundation base to cover my acne marks and skin discolorations.  </li>
            <li>The top came off by twisting, not good.</li>
            <li>I have combination, normal to oil skin, thus, make-up only lasts about 4 hours, even though I work indoor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other BB creams before in the past, and this one blends the easiest and is a pretty good match after it oxidizes.  </li>
            <li>It looked a little more lighter than I expected.</li>
            <li>A little thick but gives good coverage.</li>
            <li>It is important to bear in mind that it is only medium-light coverage due to the fact that it is labeled \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; not necessarily foundation.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that gets really dry and really oily in some parts.</li>
            <li>and i have combo skin (very oily in t-zone but extremely dry in the cheeks).  </li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t really need a \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; coverage (I used Laura Bare Mineral and Mercier tinted moisturizure for a long time).  </li>
            <li>After using #21 for while, I started realizing how grayish yellow/brown it is and after seeing a few pictures of myself, it doesn&#x27;t really match my neck very well.  </li>
            <li>It also has a grey tone when you first apply, but it adjusts to your skin shortly after.</li>
            <li>I actually like to use a thin layer under foundation as kind of a primer.</li>
            <li>This BB cream has much better coverage than my other BB cream and lasts for the entire day without feeling oily or anything!(My other one did as well, the only thing I have a problem with it the color is a little light and the coverage)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the major high-end brands, some drug store brands and I&#x27;ve never found a tinted moisturizer or foundation that seemed to work with my combination skin.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of scars from acne but the foundation covers it pretty well, along with other blemishes on my face.</li>
            <li>I never break out after wearing it, so that is a major</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, not too thin so it doesn&#x27;t do good coverage but also not too thick and clunky (like some other BB creams).  </li>
            <li>When I first applied it, the shade appeared a little too light (I purchased the darker 23 shade), but it took only a few minutes to oxidize on my skin, and after it did, it looked really natural,</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it is making any positive permanent changes to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I even tried a few different things to create a \\&quot;natural glow\\&quot; that really makes my slightly bumpy skin look really smooth (and I&#x27;ve received lots of compliments):  </li>
            <li>It provides almost full coverage, but even after letting it oxidize and adjust to my skin tone, it is still a little pink/gray for my neutral (leaning slightly yellow) skin tone.</li>
            <li>the good thing is that you only need a small amount, which means my little 20ml bottle will last me a while.</li>
            <li>It provides a much fuller coverage than my other BB cream, but I just use less when necessary (opting for 1/2 a pump rather than a full pump.)  </li>
            <li>if anything, and I have never (even throughout puberty) experienced a bad breakout.</li>
            <li>After using for a week, I&#x27;ve noticed a general improvement in skin tone.</li>
            <li>After doing extensive research and pouring over multiple reviews of this product I ordered both this and the Missha M Signature Real Complete BB Cream No. 23.  </li>
            <li>The coloring is a bit strange at first (as everyone says, rather grey)</li>
            <li>I tried several BB creams when I switched and this one is the clear winner.</li>
            <li>I have not been using it long enough to know if it really whitens and that it does not break me out.</li>
            <li>So far what I like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t make my face extra oily and</li>
            <li>But when I saw their bare skin, I thought that there were some seceret.</li>
            <li>Apparently, the tube was stuck or mis-functioned.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps my skin was not use to having a liquid smeared on it since i&#x27;ve been using bare escential for about 8 yeras.</li>
            <li>I actually couldn&#x27;t even bear a sunscreen that has SPF30 (my skin its just way too sensitive)</li>
            <li>I use a beauty blender (pink egg sponge) to apply this and it goes on really well.  </li>
            <li>Was a bit leary about the color of the product when i first put it on, appeared dark.</li>
            <li>it will completely break your face out with white heads and boils.</li>
            <li>#23 looks natural on Asian beige skin.</li>
            <li>The package came sooner than expected, so I really trust Seoul</li>
            <li>This is NOT the Missha product that is the same when ordered directly from Missha.</li>
            <li>The color is much lighter than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a relatively medium tan asian (a bit on the light side) and I bought this bb cream because I don&#x27;t like heavy foundation.</li>
            <li>so far, I like them equally.  </li>
            <li>It last all day, looks natural and is in a convenient pump bottle.</li>
            <li>I have the color #23 and at first I thought it was way too dark, but it blends like a dream into the skin</li>
            <li>As for a natural glowing look, I would personally go for the Etude House BB cream.</li>
            <li>It lasts longer than bare mineral powder.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using Bare Minerals for years, and to be honest, I&#x27;m getting tired of it, because during the day, I would see the \\&quot;shine\\&quot; in my face, and overall, just dying to find a different foundation product.</li>
            <li>Received it much sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>was interested to see a Korean documentary about a shopping center in Seoul.</li>
            <li>it ranks #2 next to Skin79 triple BB cream in the hot pink can.  </li>
            <li>I should try a few more times to see if my skin actually &amp;#34;adapts&amp;#34; to this BB cream, but this is truly not the one I expected.</li>
            <li>they either didn&#x27;t cover enough or were slipping off my face within a few hours...not to mention some of them made me oilier or made me break out more...</li>
            <li>It looked shiny on my skin, and I started breaking out after using it a few days (and I rarely break out</li>
            <li>This bb cream feels like a thick moisturizer , it has a light to medium coverage</li>
            <li>Is thick but feels light when you put it on.</li>
            <li>It covers my dark spots and bumps very well without feeling to heavy and it evens out my skin tone super well.</li>
            <li>There is a slight perfume scent, when I first applied it but disappeared soon after.</li>
            <li>This cream is for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>Read reviews about the Missha product and decided to try it as it has much higher SPF and several other ingredients.  </li>
            <li>moisturized in summer and not dry at all in winter!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to explain since it isn&#x27;t like a floral scent; it just smells like a rich cream.</li>
            <li>the color make you look like a zombie at first, then quite dark after if you are not a very dark asian don&#x27;t buy it, and don&#x27;t put a lot on</li>
            <li>I am reading the other reviews that said this this product is very moisturizing and looks dewey.</li>
            <li>The color is MUCH lighter than my other two tubes of No. 23--to</li>
            <li>But the color is a little too light for me and the texture is thicker than expected.</li>
            <li>Lovely, silky, spf + coverage that you can build up from little to heavy.</li>
            <li>A small amount goes a long way and gives a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>This gives the skin a really nice glow and doesn&#x27;t look heavy or thick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cursed with acne and acne scars ever since I was little and there are still some areas with hyperpigmentation that I am always trying to cover up- with little luck and more white heads in the end.   </li>
            <li>You only need a little bit to cover your cheeks, a little more for the forehead and chin.  </li>
            <li>a single use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is much drier than the american BB creams that I have tried, so you may need several pumps to get enough product to cover your face.</li>
            <li>The cream really brightens up the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have only worn Bare Minerals since 2000, so I&#x27;m getting used to a heavier makeup.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use a full pump for my face, so I&#x27;ve been using it for at least six months and it shows no immediate signs of running out.</li>
            <li>It feels natural, provides nice coverage over my spots, not too thin nor heavy.</li>
            <li>The #23 is slightly too cool for my summer tan skin tone, but this bb cream darkens a bit as it oxidizes and with just a little contouring looks natural and brightening.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m pretty pale</li>
            <li>Even though I have light hair and blue eyes, my skin is not fair</li>
            <li>and after less than one hour it really blend into your skin...</li>
            <li>You gave will looks so natural when u putting on and it won&#x27;t make ur skin looks dry.</li>
            <li>Skin toward sensitive and dry</li>
            <li>but i think it wouldn&#x27;t really cover dark scars or big blemishes alone.</li>
            <li>The result is natural and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical buying make-up online without being able to try it first.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try because my old foundation (Estee Lauder Double Wear) was too dry for me, especially in the winter season.</li>
            <li>I only use half a pump, if that much, and still have left over for the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the product, although the perfumes are a little much for me.  </li>
            <li>It comes out a little grey at first so it can color correct and try to match to your skin color.</li>
            <li>I only use a little bit, like one tiny fingertip size and that&#x27;s enough to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li>Very soft to skin, doesn&#x27;t look so cake like other bb cream</li>
            <li>To me it gives just enough coverage and a very natural looking, so bare in mind that this is not a full coverage</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The coverage is excellent, and you can also use this as concealer.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product--surface of skin looks almost flawless...</li>
            <li> The perfect kind of foundation--natural but with great coverage.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>

            <li> Color was great and product packaging held up.  </li>

            <li> Works great for me.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>

            <li> but I think it would give great great coverage.  </li>
            <li> One thing I forgot to mention is that it has great SPF (SPF 42 PA+++).</li>
            <li> The coverage was great, but i looked like an oompa</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> She hasnt said anything about it, so I believe shes happy with the purchase.  </li>

            <li> Missha BB Cream evens out your whole skin tone making your face a perfect palette with which to apply your makeup and look your best!  </li>
            <li> MISSHA M Perfect Cover BB Cream is my new favorite!!!</li>
            <li> MISSHA M Perfect Cover BB Cream is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect coverture and very easy to apply; I strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have some old acne marks that I have to cover up, and it does a wonderful job without looking like I&#x27;m wearing makeup at all, it&#x27;s incredible!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it did a good job in concealing my blemishes either.</li>
            <li> the shipment was really good...</li>
            <li> good quality..</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> It works best if you are looking for a foundation with light coverage.</li>
            <li> it had mostly good reviews, 2.</li>
            <li> I read in another review that the No. 23 was good for someone who was a MAC NC 25.  </li>
            <li> I got this BB cream and immediately loved it.  </li>
            <li> The color has been good for me, I think there is some lee-way with it</li>
            <li> well i suppose \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; is a good word.</li>
            <li> Saw all the good reviews and had to try this.  </li>
            <li> When I used to have acne, this product was really good at covering it up, and it did not block pores or make me break out.</li>
            <li> , it provides good coverage, something that I always look for in a foundation.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shade for ladies who have fair skin.</li>
            <li> price wise</li>
            <li> My coworker even said my skin is so good, and she didn&#x27;t know anything about bb cream.</li>
            <li> Provides good coverage without looking cakey.  </li>
            <li> Besides the color match, I loved this product</li>
            <li> I take good care of my skin.</li>
            <li> I loved the product.</li>
            <li> Also, it has really good coverage and covers my blemishes and acne scars well.</li>
            <li> This is a good bb cream...but not my fav...</li>
            <li> , It was delivered in time and my mother loved it.</li>
            <li> Good product and</li>
            <li> I also feel good about using it because of the SPF42.  </li>
            <li> The smell is good too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good primer for me to use.</li>
            <li> but it has good coverage for being a bb cream.</li>
            <li> so finding a good foundation</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t looked this good since before having children!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered it with excitement based on the good reviews.  </li>

            <li> When it comes to bb creams, this is the best brand ever among those with a better price (you can probably find a better chanel one).</li>
            <li> Very light on my skin and great coverage on my spotty skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product, it goes on smooth and is my skin color</li>

            <li> Must we put another positive review for the MISSHA M PERFECT COVER BB Cream No. 23?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thrilled with my purchase I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t going to use this under my makeup as I thought beige on beige would be too much, but it seems to tone in perfectly with my foundation creating a flawless finish.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, but still has medium coverage, and it hasn&#x27;t broke me out yet which is great.</li>
            <li> anyways, product&#x3D; AMAZING  </li>
            <li> This product works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> It is amazing product.  </li>
            <li> and i have been on the search for an amazing foundation...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Great coverage and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> but this stuff is great because it does smooth my skin out and provides the sun protection.</li>
            <li> Anyhow...this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Just an amazing BB cream.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light to medium coverage, with a great finish.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice; however, it&#x27;s one shade and not recommended for darker than NC-35.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have perfect skin either, so it really covers well.</li>
            <li> However, I took off a star just because of the box was kind of opened and damaged...</li>
            <li> This BB cream gives me good and natural coverage and its great for my skin!</li>
            <li> but I honestly haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li> I shouldnt even say nice things about it.</li>
            <li> I just need to find a good setting powder to use on top of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried another BB by Missha and it was good, but this one is better.</li>
            <li> and this product is smell nice</li>
            <li> I liked the Laneige BB cream over this one.  </li>
            <li> This BB cream covers so nice</li>
            <li> It is kind of a grayish color.</li>
            <li> You kind of have to be white/fair-skinned for this BB</li>
            <li> I really recommend it :D</li>
            <li> but it kind of fades away</li>
            <li> its a thicker consistency than some others, which is good for me because i need more coverage to cover my blemishes.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the product itself is really nice.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> It feels nice throughout the day</li>
            <li> Effective &amp; affordable.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s really good for people with many imperfections)</li>
            <li> product would work well for someone who enjoys a perfumey scent and whose skin does not have sensitivity to fragrances; I would suggest applying a nice lotion before using this product.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> cream is really nice to put on, and blends in well after it finishes oxidizing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fully cover my blemishes, so I do have to use my own concealer (I use sonia kashuk).</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m thrilled with not having to use sunscreen, moisurizer and foundation separately.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own and has SPF protection built in.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more happy. :)</li>
            <li> I really like this bb cream is one of the best.</li>
            <li> I prefer using this in the colder months as it is hydrating and might look oily in the warm weather.</li>
            <li> I have tried many kinds of foundation, including the  spray on product and powdered minerals, which I loved.  </li>
            <li> LOVE, Love, love!!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> Very nice and light on your face.</li>
            <li> I also like the scent, which is pleasant and not too strong.</li>
            <li> It is a bit ashy when you put it on, but it goes on very smooth and offers surprising coverage and blends wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> I love the shisheido compressed power because it had really great coverage, great match to my complexion, and priced reasonably.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this :))))</li>
            <li> My Mother&#x27;s makeup looked flawless and I had to ask what new product she was using.</li>
            <li> which greyish tint doesn&#x27;t sound good but it looks beyond amazing.</li>
            <li> I own Etude House&#x27;s Bright Fit Mineral BB Cream in W13/Natural Beige</li>
            <li> It came very quickly, so it was good.</li>
            <li> Upon initial application, the color is not the best match for my complexion, but after maybe 30 min. - 1 hour, it oxidizes and matches the skin fairly well.  </li>
            <li> It provides WonDeRfuL coverage, the color is way to light for my golden olive skin, and my skin broke out like a teenager.  </li>
            <li> This cream comes on smooth and smells pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply compared to some concealers and liquid foundations.</li>
            <li> However, the very strong (old-fashioned powdery) smell wasn&#x27;t mentioned in the reviews I read.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> but I absouletly love this product and will be buying more of this when it runs out!</li>
            <li> But all in all, I just love this product! :)</li>
            <li> I wore it the first day to a non-important event and before I could ask my friend how it looked, she mentioned that she loved whatever I was using, my skin looked radiant!  </li>
            <li> I originally received it in my Glossybox and found it here on Amazon with a great price and more colors to choose from.  </li>
            <li> stand by my original review of this excellent product WHEN the right shade is packed in the tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooooo in love with this cream, I highly recommend it &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I sing high praises of it to every girl I know, and eventually converted most of my friends to fellow Perfect Cover BB Cream fans.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST foundation that I&#x27;ve ever used so far.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look almost flawless and natural.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the revision spf 45 which is just amazing, however a bit more pricey.</li>
            <li> I have oily combination skin, this product works and smells good, light on face  </li>
            <li> Im a natural beige and the color matches me perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this product, gives me a nice dewy finish but could be matted with a bit of powder.</li>
            <li> it absorbs into your skin giving you almost flawless natural coverage...</li>
            <li> My skin look flawless with this product and natural not like I am wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> I got this product from a friend and it is by far the best BB cream ive ever used.</li>
            <li> And, the 23 (color) is really a nice neutral that would go with many a complexion.</li>
            <li> Came very quick; in about 15 days!</li>
            <li> Also, the delivery is very quick!  </li>
            <li> I love, love love this cream!</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It has very good coverage for a BB cream and does not break me out at all, which is the main reason I use these creams instead of foundations.</li>
            <li> It gives great coverage, especially for those with acne-prone skin like mine, who are looking for a lightweight product, but yet still gives great coverage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried 5 BB creams so far, and Missha&#x27;s Perfect BB Cream ranks in at #2 (their Signature BB cream performed better for me).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy and love the SPF protection it offers as well.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product was high and incredible.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the quickness &amp; smooth transaction and shipping.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it, I used it around my eyes and face because some reviews said it worked as a great concealer too.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> In all the reviews I read, everyone said that both of the shades are very, very light.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on my skin when I wear this and best of all, it has a high SPF which was really important to me.  </li>
            <li> Makes skin feel very light and refreshed.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very light on the skin.</li>
            <li> This cream is a very light alternative to foundation during the summer that helped to even out my skin color.</li>
            <li> ON MY FACE,,IT IS VERY LIGHT AND NOT GREASY,,FEELS</li>
            <li> This cream is very light to the feel, not cakey at all.</li>
            <li> is very light.</li>
            <li> Blends easily and covers nicely on the discoloration areas on my face.</li>
            <li> Since it is a moisturizer, it has been great for my combination skin; not too oily for the oily bits and greatly helping out the dry spots.</li>
            <li> but I have reordered this product MANY times for myself and friends.</li>
            <li> Also, buy from a reputable Ebay sellers.  </li>
            <li> But since we can&#x27;t get our hands on, we are paying a bit more.  </li>
            <li> We will continue using it to see if our skin improves more.</li>
            <li> I need a shade lighter! :)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like a tinted moisturizer, but better.</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter and more even now.</li>
            <li> Missha&#x27;s Perfect Cover BB cream is the only thing that I&#x27;ll use for foundation.  </li>
            <li> It definitely decreases the appearance of pores, and I am always complimented on how flawless my skin is...</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The more people that buy it the more it might drive up the price.</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup.</li>
            <li> Everyone should make sure this is authentic bb cream.</li>
            <li> when there&#x27;s a sale, it&#x27;s about $22-23...just a heads up! :]</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure which color to get but settled on the darker of the two.  </li>
            <li> I love that this cream has a lot of things we women look for:  anti-wrinkle, spf, acne treatment, etc.  </li>
            <li> What I love about it is how it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have anything on.  </li>
            <li> I also like the fact that you can layer it on to give more coverage.  </li>
            <li> I also love the price point.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, they will come out w/ more color choices.</li>
            <li> couple times I have stippled some foundation over the BB cream to give it more coverage.</li>
            <li> I know this because I am using the authentic one (which I had bought from Misshaus.com website) and compared it..   </li>
            <li> the product, i love it.</li>
            <li> but i still love it.</li>
            <li> i honestly love it.  </li>
            <li> and I just simply LOVE LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> Great service and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Maybe if I had chosen lighter shade it would look much better on my face.</li>
            <li> Love this BB cream....</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my skin, love love this</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> The best thing is that it has SPF in it which is why I initially wanted to try BB cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll be my favorite for the summer.</li>
            <li> it was more of a tan shade.</li>
            <li> bummer because i love the texture and coverage it provided without the need of wearing foundation to school.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this BB cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really pleased with this product because it has so many benefits.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t love it more.</li>
            <li> but I find this  more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> A better texture and a smoother cover.</li>
            <li> Met my wife&#x27;s expectation and I love the way she looks when she does the make up.</li>
            <li> but it did makes my face look more better</li>
            <li> Everyone comments that my skin looks great - very even toned.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to go without BB cream now.</li>
            <li> I will re order for sure.</li>
            <li> But it I absolutely love this bb cream</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a better match to my skin tone</li>
            <li> However, after a couple weeks more had passed, I noticed that there were even more pimples</li>
            <li> The product provides great coverage and stays on despite my having a very oily T-zone.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream.</li>
            <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t think you can do better for a BB cream.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am very happy overall!  </li>
            <li> I tried better products of Korean brands</li>
            <li> I love the SPF.  </li>
            <li> , that means I&#x27;m gonna lose one of them for sure.</li>
            <li> Missha BB cream, not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> but I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> maybe the wrinkles around my eyes are better...</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t light at all!</li>
            <li> I can not believe there aren&#x27;t more comments on this...</li>
            <li> whatever you want to call it that I have fell in love with.</li>
            <li> I have to put powder on top of it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really satisfied.</li>
            <li> You can build it up a bit more</li>
            <li> Having read so many rave reviews about this product, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> That combination of products seem to combat the oiliness a bit better.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to most people, after all</li>
            <li> i love it..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this a four since I just started using this product, but I already love the results.</li>
            <li> I love the pump as it is way more hygienic that way&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s not the most appealing look</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also not horrible.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t have time to reapply, touching up with a bit of blush or bronzer or even just some powder helps a ton.</li>
            <li> Besides the container issue, the cream itself was not my favorite, either.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin look.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel like I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup, but on top of that,  it evens my skin tone and gives me a dewy complexion.</li>
            <li> It tightens skin and makes the skin tone look better.</li>
            <li> Looks natural, color is perfect, evens my skin tone, is light, and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> it is the best BB cream ever, with SPF, smells like baby lotion, but it goes on sheer and if you want more coverage it makes it thicker but not caker...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect final step in my Korean skincare routine!</li>
            <li> Satisfied and recommend it for you to try it</li>
            <li> This is the third tube of Missha M Perfect Cover Cream that I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.  </li>
            <li> I love it, I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> product does go on gray, but after a while it will oxidize and blend in better.</li>
            <li> this video for more information.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smell is okay.</li>
            <li> I do love this product...</li>
            <li> I just  love it.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this BB cream is so affordable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now dealing with the breack outs hoping I don&#x27;t gettoo many scars.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure abt shade</li>
            <li> really love this BBcream</li>
            <li> Most foundation I purchase leave a residue on my face, not this one.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and</li>
            <li> I have been using 3 various foundations, but Missha&#x27;s BB cream is the best!!!</li>
            <li> They were ok, but nothing to rave about.</li>
            <li> While the cream felt great, and smelled nice, it just never looked natural.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite BB cream.</li>
            <li> The MISSHA M PERFECT COVER BB CREAM #23 does a really good job at coverage and doesn&#x27;t have a heavy feeling, but the colors are limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this BB Cream.  </li>
            <li> #34;Natural Beige&amp;#34;, it is really light beige and is for fair to light skin.</li>
            <li> If the color had been better I would have given this product a better review.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have too many blemishes</li>
            <li> I love missha</li>
            <li> all look better when applied after putting on BB cream.</li>
            <li> I love it the color match my skin.</li>
            <li> I will buy more</li>
            <li> I also love how it has SPF.</li>
            <li> use it many times with many powder but the color still gray.&lt;br /&gt;save</li>
            <li> The color did have a \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; effect, but more of just adding a luminous glow to my face.</li>
            <li> It also had a perfume-y soap-y smell which I don&#x27;t love but can overlook.</li>
            <li> Stays on for most of the day.</li>
            <li> Ok, so stuff happens in the mail</li>
            <li> This is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> but now i really love this product.</li>
            <li> Use this on most days and it has replaced the need for a sunscreen and foundation.</li>
            <li> Has more coverage than a tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m just happy to use it in place of foundation, highly recommend for that!</li>
            <li> I love love love that product.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Simply...I love it.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Do not need more, I ordered.</li>
            <li> how they are almost magic.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this hearing so many rave reviews about BB Creams.</li>
            <li> I must say that I like the color of this more than the Etude House BB cream.</li>
            <li> and it appears to be an authentic product.</li>
            <li> Much better than an BB cream I have purchased at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Color was pasty, there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bb cream twice and really love it.</li>
            <li> the more you layer on.</li>
            <li> Love this BB cream.  </li>
            <li> Once on it won&#x27;t wipe off on a tissue like most bb creams.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my skin look, without being &amp;#34;made-up&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> ok, dont know if i would purchase again....</li>
            <li> Love this BB cream.</li>
            <li> Really love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup.</li>
            <li> and I went to look for more on Amazon and found it</li>
            <li> I was glad I ordered more of it</li>
            <li> Try it you will love it just like I did.</li>
            <li> need more of a matte type..</li>
            <li> I LOVE BB CREAMS.</li>
            <li> and I really really love this one.</li>
            <li> I started looking for something that has color choices that would better suit my skin color and my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> matt mousse medium beige over the top just for more coverage.  </li>
            <li> Really glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li> I put this on and then a bronzer on top</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this bb cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> This color is better for me than no.</li>
            <li> Lovely results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this BB cream for two years now and love it.</li>
            <li> It DOES make ur skin brighter, lighter, without looking cakey :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after reading many reviews.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of covering my old acne scars, although I have to apply 2 coats over the darker marks to get good coverage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think i like the fragrance, would prefer if is fragrance free!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After having bought 5 different kinds and receiving 2 from a friend in Asia and tried them all, the Missha M Perfect BB Cream #23 is the one - for me.  </li>
            <li> more yellow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am allergic to many perfumed products for that reason I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this BB cream.</li>
            <li> medium coverage and looks wonderful when it finally set on the skin</li>
            <li> i love this product..</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I have had so many compliments for my complexion since I have been using this.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I used to use a separate product for sun protection, then yet another to moisturize and then to top if all off a foundation.</li>
            <li> and it has skincare benefits that I can safely say do help</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li> I love how it works.</li>
            <li> this is the 3rd time I am ordering and I can&#x27;t stop suing this!!!&lt;br /&gt;color is perfect with the spf 42.</li>
            <li> but when I did it worked ok.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> It is not oily or cakey like many products.  </li>
            <li> I like this better</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not my favorite color to wear all the time, so</li>
            <li> I use it mostly during the cooler fall/winter months when my skin has a lighter shade.</li>
            <li> Very kind service of you and thanks for sending variety of bb cream samples.</li>
            <li> So far so good great in the natural color easy to apply great coverage.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> It goes on real smooth and is moisturizing and clean.</li>
            <li> Never mind the great price even with high shipping charges.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but for normal to oily skin, i think it works great.</li>
            <li> It gives a fresh dewy finish, has good coverage, looks natural, has great spf protection,  and fixes wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I bought it and loved it the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this B.B cream for a long time and still this brand is the best!</li>
            <li> Plus, smell is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have pretty fair skin and use the No.23.</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and loved it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s never made me break out, gives me instant perfect complexion, doesn&#x27;t streak, and I always love the light fragrance of it.</li>
            <li> Once I became aware of the types of BB creams and manufacturers, I went onto the manufacturer&#x27;s website to check out the ingredients, the color, and what type of skin the BB cream is good for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You cannot do that with the original bottle!</li>
            <li> The smell was too fragrant versus the original!</li>
            <li> I found that product to be great, but when I ran out, I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day, blends to the perfect color once oxidized, and keeps my oily parts matte and my dry parts moisturized.</li>
            <li> The BB cream has a strong fragrance,  which I love and it has a creamy (moist) consistancy, excellent for combination and dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you see Korean girls near you, you can find most of them have really great skin.</li>
            <li> The changing of color is also not big of a problem because I have it in shade #23 which is still a bit too light for me, but it&#x27;s perfect as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> Most of the other BB creams I looked at did not have many color options and most people that reviewed them were very fair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Mineral oil is well known to clog pores, and most good companies do not use mineral oil as one of their main ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Coverage is good, feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> but I havent found one that is reasonably priced, provides great coverage, fairly good match to my skin tone, last thru most of the day, great packaging, feels good on my skin (doesnt make it oily or dry -</li>
            <li> Missha BB cream is a good product, a smooth and perfect match for Asian skin stone with high protection of SPF 42</li>
            <li> I like to use over the prime cream and works perfect and keeps my skin silky soft, fresh and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Just all around amazing, and totallt worth it.</li>
            <li> Etude House Precious Mineral #13 is a bit light for me.  </li>
            <li> Although it is lighter weight than makeup, it gives more coverage than light powder or tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li> This amazingly light weighted foundation (BB Cream) is fabulous!</li>
            <li> , covers scars and pores, and most importantly, does not make me break out or clog my pores.  </li>
            <li> It covers most blemishes perfectly, almost so well that I feel as though I could go without concealer and foundation (coming from someone who has dark acne scars).</li>
            <li> Matches my blonde hair, light skin complexion nicely, and blends great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly light too, and isn&#x27;t oily like most SPFs.</li>
            <li> the formula isn&#x27;t as light as a tinted moisturizer but more of a medium coverage foundation...</li>
            <li> I love how light it feels and that it has SPF 42.</li>
            <li> One thing worth mentioning is that, I am indeed Asian, which this product is often geared towards, but my skin has a more olive-yellow undertone to it, and it&#x27;s not the perfect match with Missha No. 23.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, goes on creamy and light, works wells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this BB Cream is still available via Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t make sure the product is genuine.</li>
            <li> cream is smooth and a touch grainy (like many BB creams I&#x27;ve seen).</li>
            <li> I ordered this and the Skin79 BB cream (pink bottle) and this is the perfect match for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I love that product which gives light translucent cover with some sunscreen protection.</li>
            <li> You can apply this with your hands, but make sure to warm it up first between your fingers, as this helps it spread</li>
            <li> MIssha M perfect cover was not what I expected, but it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> It is great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but as you rub it into your skin it actually looks incredible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the end of the summer, and I have a pretty good tan (one that was gained with sunscreen, so I&#x27;m not that dark), and this color is perfect for my summer skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and price was good.</li>
            <li> I love it so much!!!  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply, great coverage and extremely natural looking.</li>
            <li> Foundation was making my skin look much older, so glad I found BB Cream, and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry,so it was not creamy enough for me,the color was good!</li>
            <li> Compare to other bb cream that I&#x27;ve used this is one of the best bb cream out there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a very good BB cream that looks best with pale skintones and offers a matte, clean finish.  </li>
            <li> My color tends to range in the Fair to Light, depending on the time of the year and how much sun I get.</li>
            <li> -easily to put up!!!can</li>
            <li> I used  -easily to  remove.</li>
            <li> whi;e others said it was very quick for them.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and re-layer.</li>
            <li> a lot of coverage and easy to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is very close to my own, but I use powder to blend it more.</li>
            <li> I bit the bullet and placed my order, and am happy to say that she is 100% correct in her love and admiration of such a cream.</li>
            <li> Easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Today I only use this one amazing product and my skin looks so good.</li>
            <li> It blends easily and lasts well throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This bb cream blends with your skin color so easy</li>
            <li> good for fast whiteing &amp; cover , this will make your skin 2 shades light,   </li>
            <li> I strongly suggest this bb cream to those who have oily/mild acne skin like me, as it does not harm the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42 years old and spanish with light to medium skin color, this product bb cream #23 is perfect, very good cover for my ages spots and discoloration areas, not heavy cream, very very light scent, and excelent sun protection.</li>
            <li> Also feels good about the high SPF in the summer.</li>
            <li> does not make you break out either for the price its really good stuff its like really high end makeup.</li>
            <li> They are ok but nothing special.</li>
            <li> it covers amazing and really helps keep my skin matte for hours!  </li>
            <li> It has great coverage, and it&#x27;s not pink.  </li>
            <li> I liked it the first day,</li>
            <li> I used a #27 this summer when I had a tan, and it was a perfect color for me, but it&#x27;s too dark now that it&#x27;s winter.  </li>
            <li> The coverage is good although it does make you look a bit paler than normal</li>
            <li> Hands down, this is THE best BB cream.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is smoother, the application is ideal (with my clean hands), and the coverage is sheer to medium.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any whitening or improvement in fine lines.  </li>
            <li> They all go on every smooth and easy to blend (I use stippling brush).  </li>
            <li> Although, both are fine.</li>
            <li> For wrinkles it covers the fine lines well.</li>
            <li> No.21 is a bit white when first applied, but when oxidized it&#x27;s matching perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s greyish when you first apply it, shortly after it matches my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and blends in easily.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have fine pores.</li>
            <li> The 40 SPF is true, it offers great protection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 and have some sun spots and fine lines and am medium complected .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream for about a year and a half-</li>
            <li> But they would show the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I also bought the Super Plush Balm Triple Functions and find I like this one better.</li>
            <li> This would be a top contender except that the smell to me is strong its a like an old person perfume smell and its kind of strong</li>
            <li> well, this product has really changed my skin for the better!  </li>
            <li> at first it is a bit gray but later on it blends in within 3-4 hours :))) definitively buying again soon!!!</li>
            <li> This BB Cream (which I purchased in the darkest color) is easy to apply, long-lasting, a great sunscreen, and an overall fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It certainly does moisturizes my skin (to be honest  though, I blend it in with a bit of moisturizer..</li>
            <li> Misha&#x27;s product are very good and we will certainly buy more in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I kind of like the Maybelline BB a little better but either one is good.</li>
            <li> There was a very nice view of the Missha store in the main area and it looked very modern and chic.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li> This gave me huge cystic acne.</li>
            <li> For light coverage, Skin 79.  </li>
            <li> I have problem skin, and the coverage is fantastic.</li>
            <li> and so I decided to try the NO 23 color because I thought the NO 21 would be to light for me.   </li>
            <li> I think the No.21 would be too light for me</li>
            <li> Light and dewey look.  </li>
            <li> but it blends in perfectly after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have light skin</li>
            <li> I also dislike the heavily made-up look, so this cream is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> it was still too light for me.</li>
            <li> The initial color matched great</li>
            <li> It brightens my eyelids, covers the light circles under my eyes, and smooths and evens my skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how cheap this product is for the coverage that it provides.  </li>
            <li> I started applying this to my neck as welll to smooth out the look.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;P.S. Seoulglamour is fantastic too...</li>
            <li> I touch up lightly with some mineral powder</li>
            <li> So basically it makes your good-looking skin look great, and your blemishes only somewhat covered, so</li>
            <li> and it was way too light.  </li>
            <li> I read someone&#x27;s comment about their receiving a knockoff version or something, but I believe the product I received to be 100% genuine.  </li>
            <li> I set this with a light powder and wear it as my make-up, and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> She received the indication from a friend and fortunately I found it in Amazon site</li>
            <li> it has light coverage</li>
            <li> It covers, goes on smooth as silk and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> (Light Beige) also and see how that one turns out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, blendable and isn&#x27;t sticky at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this BB creme in No.21 - Light Beige.</li>
            <li> so it may be because of this (the primer I use is [[ASIN:B000UGUB1W Smashbox Photo Finish Oil Free Primer</li>
            <li> so it may be because of this (the primer I use is [[ASIN:B000UGUB1W Smashbox Photo Finish Oil Free Primer 1oz/30ml]])</li>
            <li> , i tell you just like this foundation product its light and smooth</li>
            <li> This gives such great coverage that I use it as my &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; now.  </li>
            <li> It goes on light but gets darker as you wear it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li> Even then, this BB Cream is a tad bit too light for me.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and evenly and my skin tone is even and glowing.</li>
            <li> and it feels so light.</li>
            <li> how light this bb cream feels however i fell that this bb cream has a grey-ish hue to it even though i purchased it in a darker/ warmer shade.</li>
            <li> The delivery was extremely fast (got them in just a week), the BB cream were nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> Anytime I wear this I get compliments in how fabulous my skin looks</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s smooth and does&#x27;t cake.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> This BB cream has a greyish cast that didn&#x27;t really fit my yellowish skin tone.</li>
            <li> so I prefer a light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li> The texture was so smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Coverage: I&#x27;d put this as light to medium coverage.  </li>
            <li> The product is amazing, it really hides blemishes well and lightens skin tone.</li>
            <li> a bit light but</li>
            <li> I used a light mineral powdewr over to set</li>
            <li> (I have light beige skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I felt like I wouldn&#x27;t enjoy the scent of this bb cream.</li>
            <li> And I definitely don&#x27;t have great skin.</li>
            <li> No 21 was too light.  </li>
            <li> Light coverage but even tone.</li>
            <li> 21.(too light).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and smooth when pumped out.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> It blends in perfectly with my skin tone and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all.</li>
            <li> it will oxidize to fit your skin tone</li>
            <li> This does cover your light skin flaws.</li>
            <li> Pairing it with a darker foundation since this a tad light</li>
            <li> Overall, I give this 4 stars because the coverage is really great</li>
            <li> It smells lovely, covers acne, acne marks, scars, enlarged pores, and leaves my skin looking and feeling fresh and dewy.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.</li>
            <li> I have light to medium skin</li>
            <li> It covers without looking cakey, and still feels light.</li>
            <li> I actually use this in the winter than the summer more often because it does a good job of hydrating my skin.</li>
            <li> (it also leaves a grayish tint if you put too much on) but overall it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Beblesh Balm but find the shade of the MISSHA much more natural and warm and the coverage thicker and smoother.  </li>
            <li> : This is best for pale people.  </li>
            <li> She said just be sure you choose the right shade number for your complexion.</li>
            <li> As far as the seller is concerned, they were awesome (and I loved the pink package!), the product came wrapped in bubble wrap and right within the time they said.</li>
            <li> I had originally ordered color21 and it was too light for my light skin tone and looked chalky.</li>
            <li> However, I had an easy time with the seller returning the product for a full refund.</li>
            <li> NIce BB cream, does good job smoothing out and covering up age spots and other imperfections.  </li>
            <li> If you are planning to order from here please be aware or do not order any at all would be my advice!!  </li>
            <li> First it has a SPF of 42!!</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m giving this product an ok, is because I love this product, but the pump in this particular one did not work.</li>
            <li> This is definitely more coverage than most American BB creams, which I like, so if you have mild to moderate discolorations on your face, this will make your face look flawless.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that you need very little amount of it and it gives your skin a good coverage.</li>
            <li> Nice texture, decent coverage and feels moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It gives me a dewy, bright, youthful look that no other foundation gives me (I&#x27;m 35).  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this long craved BB Cream after hearing so many good things about it.</li>
            <li> (Since I do tan easily in the summer months, I have found the other BB cream to be a better match color wise when my skin darkens.)  </li>
            <li> I use a different one before, but this is one is Amazing!</li>
            <li> Figured I could get a discount versus buying it for the original price at $30 realizing it being the holidays</li>
            <li> The bb cream was way lighter than the original #23.</li>
            <li> When you first apply it, make sure you dont put on moisturizer</li>
            <li> so i decided to use my favorite moisturizer First Aid beauty and then applied this bb</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this BB cream when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> long as I don&#x27;t breakout, I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;ve found my BB</li>
            <li> I just wanted to share that I had originally purchased the No. 21 BB cream</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product and applied it to my face.</li>
            <li> but im pretty sure its not meant to be on the face</li>
            <li> Totally worth the wait!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> On top of it (and here&#x27;s where I may be kind of paranoid), the cream only filled 2/3 of the container.</li>
            <li> It will still show through a bit, but I shouldn&#x27;t expect completely full coverage from a BB cream, but it does make my skin look really smooth and helps blur my pores.</li>
            <li> and they were also willing to exchange it for a better one or refund my money.  </li>
            <li> and my face looks really great after a long day at the office.</li>
            <li> Thanks you guys! :)</li>
            <li> so I wonder if the product is original or a conterfeit.</li>
            <li> Ever since the first application, I&#x27;ve been in love.</li>
            <li> By all means, it is very light and fairly sheer and has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> be applied to the whole face evenly and easily!  </li>
            <li> Because of all the good reviews and high recommendations, I was willing to keep trying it because sometime you will see the difference after using it for awhile.</li>
            <li> The shade is light but absorbs quickly in the skin.</li>
            <li> I found the Natural Beige to be the perfect shade for my medium-toned Asian skin.</li>
            <li> The pump is pretty nice too and keeps the product pretty clean and neat in its container.</li>
            <li> So if you have dry skin, great product; if you don&#x27;t, try it or look for something else.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> OH MY holy bb cream this is by far the best asian bb cream I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually between NC20-25 with cool undertones and this color works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> However, I love it because it makes my face look more natural instead of a caked on mask.  </li>
            <li> This product has a VERY strong \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; scent that lingers for awhile; I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances, but this was so strong that it gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> This provides great coverage and I love the fact that it has such high SPF.  </li>
            <li> Missha BB Cream is amazing at the coverage I need as well as making my skin feel soft!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t say anything special about it.</li>
            <li> But when I put it on my face, it blends right into my skin after about 10 mins!</li>
            <li> This color is perfect for my complexion, it&#x27;s seems a little grayish when you first applying</li>
            <li> I am so pleased the clerk also told me that the concept of BB creams originated with the Asian gals and their products are more effective often containing high SPF&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> There is a very light scent that comes with it, which I don&#x27;t much care for, but it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> It works ok - however, I find it does make my wrinkles around my eyes more apparent.</li>
            <li> This provides great coverage even when it is a BB cream; however, it can swim all over your face if you don&#x27;t set with powder so be careful.</li>
            <li> So so...not that great as I expected...</li>
            <li> Too Face gives a dewy/sheer/natural look and good for yellow tone</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice the ashy hue that some people did, but maybe because I&#x27;m not using as much product as recommended so more of my skin tone comes through.</li>
            <li> but once you apply it on your face and smooth it out, it actually has some pretty nice coverage!</li>
            <li> True to its name</li>
            <li> I think this product is good for spot coverage insteaed of entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is true</li>
            <li> This is such a shame because my skin looked good with it</li>
            <li> Makes the makeup removal process that much simpler, and it is certainly better for the skin.  </li>
            <li> Will order it again when she is ready for more.</li>
            <li> No matter what the coverage, whether it&#x27;s on the lighter more sheer side or thicker more makeup-y side, they all seem to do a fabulous job in evening out skin tone and brightening up the skin.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this 3 times now and getting ready to order more.  </li>
            <li> The pump did not work because the tube was 25% full.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom for Christmas hoping she would love it, but I got this and was really upset.</li>
            <li> It offers a nice finished look, and wears well throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> You can layer this up for more coverage, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it because it can look really cakey.  </li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite foundation.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t really wear anything on top of it, like blusher, because it won&#x27;t blend well.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time I really can&#x27;t tell if I have anything on my face.</li>
            <li> It smoothens out my face nicely and looks natural.  </li>
            <li> no. 23 is a true match for my skin color and oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I order missha m for my 85 years old mother, after one use she was amazed how nicely covering all of imperfection on her face.</li>
            <li> Like it, but don&#x27;t know if SPF is good enough.</li>
            <li> This is a true beauty balm.  </li>
            <li> This is an okay product to use when you don&#x27;t want to put too much makeup.</li>
            <li> i am a fair skin asian</li>
            <li> yet it does a full coverage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> If I sound like I&#x27;m raving, it&#x27;s because I really do feel that strongly about this product.     </li>
            <li> good for light and dry skinned people</li>
            <li> It is a good product to use for daily quick make up.</li>
            <li> No 23 is a little too fair for my skin!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine, and it has great coverage, but the color is not suitable once again for rich or light skinned folk.</li>
            <li> Less is best, I use less than a full pump when I apply and still get good coverage.</li>
            <li> It blends and builds nicely, gives my skin an amazing glow, and I appreciate that it has such high SPF, as I am a fair-skinned redhead.</li>
            <li> my favorite is definitely dr jarts silver label, which stays on alot longer and provides full coverage with just some mineral powder on top.</li>
            <li> I love BB cream in general and this BB cream is great for starter or younger teenager to try it.</li>
            <li> I think is a good product with a good coverage for a BB Cream, it will last all day long in my combination skin.</li>
            <li> I used Dior Nude foundation, Channel Solid Foundation, Estee lauder Double wear, Armarni Foundation which costs almost twice(or three thimes)than this, but comparing to price this is the best one.</li>
            <li> I kind of have light tan skin with yellow undertones</li>
            <li> Overall, so glad I bought it and will probably order again unless I happen to come across one that convinces me it is better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this, would be even better if they came in more variety of shades to cater to a bigger market of consumers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than a concealer (prior to this my favorite concealer was eve pearl - salmon) -</li>
            <li> but i think this product is worthy of my time.  </li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t perfect, and it looks like this brand just doesn&#x27;t have my actual color, but its close enough and no one notices.</li>
            <li> I have a super oily T zone but not when using this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bb cream and boomer and arrived early than i expected, and very happy</li>
            <li> It looks great when first put on but after oxidating for a couple of hours, it starts to have a bit of a grey tint to it.</li>
            <li> and i notices it makes my facial skins nice and smooth</li>
            <li> Gives me a super clean and fresh look.</li>
            <li> My Giorgio Armani foundation is running out and even though it covers great and last forever, I&#x27;m ready to try something else.</li>
            <li> It has good coverage, it offers sun protection, you don&#x27;t really need concealer after using this.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the better BB Creams that are on the more affordable end of the spectrum.</li>
            <li> Beware, goes on with a whitish look but quickly assimilates to your skin color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After research, this particular brand seemed to be the favorite and also do what it claims.</li>
            <li> the finish in your skin looks super.</li>
            <li> so you have to blend it in quickly.</li>
            <li> I have also bought the SKIN79 Super+</li>
            <li> I love BB Creams vs Foundation, but with my skin type I found this particular BB Cream a bit too dewy looking for my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do mix it with the skin79 super bb cream and this works for me .</li>
            <li> This product only got 2 stars for 2 reasons- 1: fast shipping and 2: The bottle design is a great concept.</li>
            <li> and I love that it has the high SPF.  </li>
            <li> Better than any high end</li>
            <li> I love this bb cream because the fact that it have high SPF.</li>
            <li> I am also pleased that both the bbcream and the concealer have a high SPF.  </li>
            <li> Since it was pretty cheap (&lt;$20), I gave it a try...</li>
            <li> It is pretty comfortable to wear.    </li>
            <li> It spread out pretty smoothly and uniformly.</li>
            <li> ive tried, and i normally wouldnt say that :)</li>
            <li> This BB Cream is light weight, i suggest to shake the product first before using.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> Coworkers have commented on how young my skin looks, and it has some very fine light-reflecting particles that make my dkin glow without being sparkly.&lt;br /&gt;Comments:</li>
            <li> Love love this product, the color suits my asian type of skin, and very moisturizing and smooth to be applied.</li>
            <li> light on your skin, perfect coverage, dont make your face oily, and i have acne prone skin so far its actually help with to clear my acne.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I wanted an SPF because I live in Hawaii and most tinted moisturizers are SPF15 or have no SPF at all.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d say that this is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li> It last a long time and seems to be the best one I have tried.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is extremely strong, unlike the real product.</li>
            <li> It is really creamy and easy to apply with your fingers, although I prefer a beauty blender.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight and easy to apply with hands or with a brush.</li>
            <li> It does not settle in fine line and it makes skin look very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Some people might be bothered by smell if you are very sensitive, but I like the smell :)</li>
            <li> I love that fact that it looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> coworkers try this bb cream and every single one has loved it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says it is!</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT THE REAL PRODUCT.!!</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder why I&#x27;m even using this one in the first place!</li>
            <li> it actually has coverage unlike most bb creams !</li>
            <li> ps.shipping was fast too!!</li>
            <li> It also covers and conceals pretty well!  </li>
            <li> only way more affordable!</li>
            <li> but this was just my first impression and some of the reasons on why I didn&#x27;t purchase this!</li>
            <li> First of all, shipping was a day faster than promised!</li>
            <li> Very natural feeling and great coverage at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have very fair complexion and am in my late sixties.</li>
            <li> Not only is it cost efficient, but it works amazingly.</li>
            <li> But if you are buying this product as a moisturizer, for SPF, and a light foundation that really covers your skin well, then this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> The coverage is great and it doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> Shipping is fast and it&#x27;s genuine from Korea.</li>
            <li> skin is very prone to oil/ shine when I wear makeup even with oil free cosmetics...</li>
            <li> Few months ago, after all the hype about BB cream, I bought Missha Perfect BB Cream #23, Etude House Precious Mineral BB Cream #13, and Skin 79 pink label BB Cream (Ebay seller in Korea).  </li>
            <li> I love the coverage and the natural look, it does not feel like having foundation on your face at all.</li>
            <li> IF you want to look more natural and shinny, you need to put missha BB Boomer before this.</li>
            <li> This product brighten my skin and gives pretty good coverage for my minor acne scars.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it works miracles, but I have gotten so many compliments on my face saying that I look naturally radiant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a product that is well worth</li>
            <li> arrived two weeks earlier than expected and was perfectly wrapped.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> But this product stays fresh on my face for the longest time.</li>
            <li> It seems to be absorbed by the skin in a matter of mintutes and stays put.  </li>
            <li> I only get a pimple once in a while and the condition minus makeup is superb.</li>
            <li> Worth a try.</li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the old version one.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t even worth spending any money on.</li>
            <li> She shipment is kinda longer but still worth it.</li>
            <li> I really hope that it was something else that caused my pimples because I just love the finish and the coverage of this bb cream too much.</li>
            <li> I would call this more of an ivory than a natural beige.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is smooth and not thick, yet full coverage can be achieved.</li>
            <li> It does look semi natural and gives you that dewy glow, but if you apply more than one layer, it starts to look cakey.</li>
            <li> I found results and I received a lot of compliments about my skin and how I rarely have wrinkles.</li>
            <li> But, like I said, worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with this cream, it provides a lightweight, flexible coverage that seems to last all day.</li>
            <li> Also, the color I chose off the internet, #23, is a bit ashy, so I mix it equal parts with Clinique CC cream which is a bit warm for my complexion.</li>
            <li> I knew this one was a really popular one among American people</li>
            <li> My makeup does looks more natural and not cakey.</li>
            <li> Overall great coverage medium...lasts long good SPF and great price for the amount you get because you only need a little to do the job.</li>
            <li> I get oily skin pretty quickly, even after powdering with this product on, but</li>
            <li> I need something quick, easy to apply and make me look natural.  </li>
            <li> The color is not too bright like other product which makes me look like wearing a ghost mask.</li>
            <li> It works just as well, and blends good, but I still prefer the other, as it is brighter.</li>
            <li> I loved this prodect so much that I bought a second tube before the first one was gone.</li>
            <li> you will find a right products.</li>
            <li> I think I made the right choice.  </li>
            <li> it ends up blending right in with your skin.  </li>
            <li> If you keep that in mind when you order, you&#x27;ll get the right shade.</li>
            <li> I have a problem, but customer service answered my questions right away.</li>
            <li> As the instructions are in Korean, a bit worried if I should be using this cream while breast feeding (right now using vary sparingly).</li>
            <li> not the right color.........</li>
            <li> Honestly, I got so sensitive skin that I can&#x27;t normally put on anything over my face</li>
            <li> It is very easy to wash off (whether it is on your hands on or on your face), and I definitely like that.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, it is natural on the skin and has a good coverage, quilidade is far superior to other bb cream</li>
            <li> Slightly deeper and more yellow than #21, looks very nice on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky in that I managed to buy the exact shade for my skin the first time.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and I love the availability of various colors.</li>
            <li> that I normally wear and it was way too light, even the package say &amp;#34;light beige&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It covers my pores really good, but not the dark circle eyes.  </li>
            <li> Tried a drug store brand and was very disappointed, but then ordered Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream, great product.</li>
            <li> It goes on as easy as sunscreen and offers just the right amount of coverage for me.  </li>
            <li> At first i thought it would be too light for my skin, but it looks super natural on my skin after i apply.   </li>
            <li> I am very fair with a smattering of freckles and red hair (technically it&#x27;s not my real hair color</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy this again!</li>
            <li> Overall, a great B.B. cream to try for the price and definitely will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Wow my forty eight year old skin looks amazing..</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast too.</li>
            <li> It came super fast and packaging was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because it tends to get greyer later on when thicker, multiple layers isn&#x27;t a great idea</li>
            <li> it gives my skin a good coverage it make my facial skins looks so glowy and seems so natural looks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist myself, so I&#x27;m constantly in the lookout for great products that actually do what they say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair skinned half Filipino/white mix.</li>
            <li> Excellent used on it&#x27;s own or as a base..</li>
            <li> It gives skin a nice glowy/smooth look, although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you are looking for full coverage for things like dark circles and so on.</li>
            <li> The yellow undertones work great for my Asian skin.</li>
            <li> My advice is to spend some extra time looking at shades to make sure you get the right one.</li>
            <li> The product says it&#x27;s supposed to be healthy for the skin, and I definitely believe it, my skin hasn&#x27;t reacted to the bb cream at all, and I love that the ingredients are natural and gentle</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, but with Missha&#x27;s BB cream, it does not only moisturize my skin during the day, it also provides great natural coverage over my face.</li>
            <li> it has a very strong perfume smell and comes out a grey color and stays that way</li>
            <li> but I add a little bit of bronzer on my cheek bones and forehead and its all good.</li>
            <li> It gives just the right amount of coverage and still looks very natural, and it can be built up to full coverage.</li>
            <li> While the other is lighter and thinner (great for summer time), I like this product for not only matching my yellow undertones during the winter months, but also it&#x27;s nice to sometimes wear something with a matte finish.  </li>
            <li> I think if you have a clear and blemish free skin you can skip the foundation.</li>
            <li> I have been using Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer for years, but I recently moved to a much more humid climate.</li>
            <li> B/c of popularity of Missha, I used it first.  </li>
            <li> This one seems to cover the imperfections better such as discolorations.</li>
            <li> This bb cream appears to be a greyish tan color at first</li>
            <li> This was the first BB cream I ever bought</li>
            <li> It seems to not only look better with this on it but without makeup my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li> On the top back of the container, there is a date reading</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed was the that the cosmetic bottle was bloated.</li>
            <li> im pretty pissed off.</li>
            <li> First time using a BB Cream and ordering from Seouleglamour.  </li>
            <li> I really like this BB Cream!  </li>
            <li> It feels light on my skin, and hasn&#x27;t seemed to cause any irritation to my usually sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> First off is the color..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first BB cream.</li>
            <li> The actual product is lighter in body, and more moisturizing, with a dewey finish.</li>
            <li> ( I am an avid sephora &amp; ulta shopper).</li>
            <li> My favorite coverage is shisheido compressed powder #21 (which is now discontinued - hence i&#x27;m trying out different products).</li>
            <li> must admit this is the first BB cream I ever purchased/tried.  </li>
            <li> My first one was #21.  </li>
            <li> This has never irritated my skin, and gives me a bit of a dewey look for the first couple of hours after application.  </li>
            <li> the bb cream lasts all day and is absolutely life-changing!</li>
            <li> Both my friends and I have used this before and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I ordered a second tube within two weeks of using the first one, just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> This is the first foundation, bb cream,</li>
            <li> It seemed greasier and thinner at first which meant it didn&#x27;t cover as well.</li>
            <li> Now, whenever I decide to use this product I first use a primer and pore filler.</li>
            <li> I will recommend to my friends and order more for myself in a future.</li>
            <li> Price aside, it lasts all day in the hot weather and driest winter.</li>
            <li> When I put this product on my face first time, looks like it&#x27;s darker than my skin.</li>
            <li> They re wrapped really carefully and nice.</li>
            <li> First of all, the product I&#x27;ve received has a defective pump.</li>
            <li> and I was even more so on this since the result that vary enormously depending on your skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that this is the seller&#x27;s fault--perhaps more likely a mistake at the factory.</li>
            <li> Sure enough after a couple uses, I had a break out.</li>
            <li> when you first out it on.</li>
            <li> natural beige is fairly light</li>
            <li> You can apply with a beauty blender for a light natural coverage or with your fingers or a brush for heavier coverage.</li>
            <li> First of all, it took quite awhile to come.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using BB cream</li>
            <li> My daughter told me about this product and first got it for me as a gift.  </li>
            <li> For the first week it worked well but after that--i noticed i started getting itchy redness around my mouth and nose.</li>
            <li> Oh and p.s., the  pump that exudes the cream does not work after the first application.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it didn&#x27;t blend as well as my Origins tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li> I like the results of the BB cream much more than regular liquid foundation and mineral make-up</li>
            <li> I will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> The problem is that this BB Cream is very smelly!</li>
            <li> It is the real deal!</li>
            <li> When I tried the Missha product for the first time, I was quite astounded.</li>
            <li> One review said if u need moisture use that first then this product but that seems to defeat the convenience of using a B&amp;B cream.</li>
            <li> Definitely will get another one once mine starts to run out. :)</li>
            <li> There was much more of a difference from 27 to 23, and I have to send it back for, oh, maybe a 25?  </li>
            <li> It blends well and looks like your skin only better.</li>
            <li> others sit on top of your skin like an extra layer.  </li>
            <li> Have been using for the last year and have gotten many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> , so higher kudos for this company</li>
            <li> Lovely product, will purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> This was the first BB cream I tried</li>
            <li> The only con to this product is that it leaves a greyish cast when you first put it on and its more notiecable</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> and actually I think my skin is in better condition since using it.</li>
            <li> This was the first BB Cream that I purchased along with a BB Cream from Etude House, this BB cream worked so well that I did not even use the one from Etude House.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also soooooooo much cheaper to buy it from this seller than when I see it out in the stores!  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t fit my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I find that the Korean brands perform much better than their American counterparts.</li>
            <li> The result is even skin tone that lasts the whole day!</li>
            <li> I was able to make one 50ml tube last more than 3 months with daily wear.</li>
            <li> Love this product and I will definitely buy it again, as soon as I finish the one that i just got.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is SPF 40 and protects my skin from future damage.  </li>
            <li> will definitely look into more products by this company.</li>
            <li> As for this BB Cream, it&#x27;s my first one</li>
            <li> /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what to say about this because this is my first cream</li>
            <li> I am definitely ordering more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> When I first heard of BB Cream on TV, I went to amazon.com to poke around and read the reviews.</li>
            <li> It just produces an overall better and even looking face.</li>
            <li> my first time using BB cream</li>
            <li> I have tried many different foundations and bb creams.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a LOT of BB creams but this one is definitely at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> When you first squeeze it out of the bottle the color may look somewhat &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; or grayish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Loreal and Maybelline BB creams, and this product is definitely of a much higher quality.</li>
            <li> Although it wasn&#x27;t pleasant at first order but will be keep looking forward to make different order in future.</li>
            <li> It stays very fresh looking all day and doesn&#x27;t cake up; in fact it looks quite natural because it is so moisturised.</li>
            <li> so you know - I&#x27;ve always had really good, clear skin; a bit dry,</li>
            <li> Is very not hi cost, will buy forever, my skin is very oily, and feel very confortable!!&lt;br /&gt;Loved it!!</li>
            <li> It comes on sort of thick at first, but when you apply it to your face it does smoothe out and leave a nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li> This is my third tube, and I love it just as much as I did the first time I bought it.</li>
            <li> I opted for the #23, based on other user&#x27;s reviews and my own &amp;#34;guess&amp;#34; work.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully MISHA BB CREAM will come out in other shades so that more people can try this super</li>
            <li> Also I have neutral undertones but it&#x27;s great for all undertones (pink, yellow, and neutral).</li>
            <li> lol i pumped out one tiny drop and started dotting around the center area of my face and blended it all over..</li>
            <li> It moisturizes also, but best if used with your daily facial moisturizer if you have dry skin like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gives a natural yet clean look.</li>
            <li> I think the No. 21 will be good in the dead of winter when I&#x27;m much paler.</li>
            <li> Firstly, my skin tone is pretty much spot on with anything that is named &amp;#34;beige&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I am relatively fair complected and caucasian, with some natural pink to my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I can&#x27;t give a true true review since I don&#x27;t use it on a regular basis</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- takes a long time to set and oxidize (30 min or more) and it will look a bit unnatural when worn the first couple of hours (2-3 hours) with a setting powder</li>
            <li> It also kind of showed up with a grey cast (initially) which kind of scares me a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> I have medium, yellowish asian skin and this is a very light beige color and because of the high spf, dries my skin.</li>
            <li> when i first put this on, i didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li> However, after the \\&quot;oxidation\\&quot;, the color blends into your natural skin tone and, at least for me, it is a perfect and natural match.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t write a long review because there are many reviews here already.  </li>
            <li> This is a fabulous BB cream - it goes on smoothly and covers up my imperfections like hyper-pigmentation and other blemishes.  </li>
            <li> The box and bottle looks sophisticated but no clear instructions as how and what to do to pump the fluids out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my 50 yr old American white girl complexion.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more grey than beige.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> I love this BB Cream and will never ever use another brands BB Cream as long as Missa makes BB Creams.</li>
            <li> The cream looks dark coming out from its container, but blends in nicely and does not change the tone of my skin.  </li>
            <li> While it did a good job at covering my redness, it was not able to cover some acne scars on my chin and cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it improves skins condition any but still a good product.</li>
            <li> and reply back right away!!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that it really did diminish the appearance of my fairly large pores.</li>
            <li> but I am not because I wish there was more moisturizing if you put this on and your skin is dry</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and offers full coverage.</li>
            <li> it certainly doesn&#x27;t exacerbate the oiliness during the day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light in color, but with a little bronzer on top, the look is very natural.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really feel like sending it back and getting a new since i love it and don&#x27;t feel like waiting another week for it to get here and ect.</li>
            <li> Very high SPF for a BB cream</li>
            <li> Certainly, their coverage and sunscreen last all day and feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more for people with dry skin because it has a lot more oil in it than other BB creams I have and use.</li>
            <li> The only problem for me was that I am very tanned, so even number 23 was a bit light for me.</li>
            <li> I myself am someone who wears makeup once in a blue moon, so I really wanted something that I could feel comfortable in.  </li>
            <li> I think that it minimizes the appearance of my pores more than Bare Minerals does, but I still prefer the ease and lightness of Bare Minerals during the day.</li>
            <li> I really like the consistency and coverage.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommended it!</li>
            <li> The only thing that&#x27;s a bit iffy is that it does oxidize a bit throughout the day, meaning that it changes color and can sweat off, but this is no longer a problem for me as I set it with a light dusting of powder.</li>
            <li> however, it wasn&#x27;t until a week into this routine that i noticed much difference.</li>
            <li> my forehead gets shiny before the end of the day and bb cream doesn&#x27;t really help this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a whole range of types of foundation, from compact foundation to liquid, from mineral to tinted moisturizers.</li>
            <li> you dont really need powder unless you sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I use it now for the tops of my hands, and it&#x27;s very waterproof.</li>
            <li> However, I found it didn&#x27;t control oil that much - I still get oily on my nose -</li>
            <li> like I didn&#x27;t have much make-up on.</li>
            <li> The product is light but provides enough coverage that I don&#x27;t have to use anything</li>
            <li> I absolutely swear by this stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like this shade</li>
            <li> I ordered a lot for my mom as well because she loves that the SPF is so high!</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, buy the real thing.</li>
            <li> Although the coverage its not work very well</li>
            <li> This is similar quality as the Light Beige.  </li>
            <li> I really like the packaging -</li>
            <li> It stays almost the whole day too</li>
            <li> People said my skin looks very glowing.</li>
            <li> but it blends very well.</li>
            <li> Save your money and please buy a real foundation, like make up forever.</li>
            <li> I can tell my skin looks much nicer.</li>
            <li> I really like it because it covers all of my blemishes in pictures and the fact that it has sunblock protection in it too.</li>
            <li> I am all about BB creams and haven&#x27;t really used one I don&#x27;t like, but this one is tops for me.  </li>
            <li> I do feel like after long-term use it has really balanced out my skin and helped to heal any scars/dark spots.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to face the day.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it in a while since I stopped wearing so much make-up.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a fabulous BB cream</li>
            <li> I started out with skin79&#x27;s pink label, but this one is a lot better.</li>
            <li> So I really like how this product is SPF42.</li>
            <li> It blends really well too.</li>
            <li> I really can think of no cons.</li>
            <li> and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> but with this one, i dont have to really blot at all...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need the oil papers as much</li>
            <li> But after a couple of days it seemed to thicken up and coveres very well.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s one of the reasons I like this product so much.</li>
            <li> : shipping was fairly fast</li>
            <li> what I do like about it is that it is very breathable.  </li>
            <li> Much of the time after I wear makeup, my skin feels like it is dying because it can&#x27;t breath (clogged pores).  </li>
            <li> Gives enough coverage to be considered a light foundation in my book, if you issues about not wearing anything, but need sunscreen and just a bit of balancing.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and creamy, and it soaks into the skin instantly...</li>
            <li> My application in the morning at 6:00 AM lasts me the whole day.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m Asian, the creams available at retail don&#x27;t match my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Because it is not the same as I brought in Korea, however the price is cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never broken out.</li>
            <li> Granted, I don&#x27;t really have any blemishes on my face.</li>
            <li> The 3 stars is for the surprisingly fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> The BB cream does not cover much of my blemishes from what it promises.  </li>
            <li> - Cleanse  - Kiehl&#x27;s Cucumber Toner  - MAC Strobe Cream  - Missha BB Cream  - Facial mist (either MyChelle&#x27;s Fruit Enzyme Mist or Clinique&#x27;s Thirsty Skin Relief)  - Brush light powder    </li>
            <li> This product arrived fast and was packed very well.</li>
            <li> While it did cover some blotches, to me, it covered too much.  </li>
            <li> The pump also comes off which you can&#x27;t do with the real product.</li>
            <li> I really like how it goes on</li>
            <li> have to use a moisturizer before applying the MISHA BB CREAM, also, because it has very matte</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s really opaque.</li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream, but wish it was made without parabens.</li>
            <li> The color was much lighter than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really give me the coverage I&#x27;m expecting</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and don&#x27;t want too much oil but don&#x27;t like the chalky look</li>
            <li> the whole</li>
            <li> I really like this Missha BB Cream.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, but I didn&#x27;t get it for that</li>
            <li> it feels very oily and makes me break out.</li>
            <li> But it absorbs fast and ends up rather velvety and not shiny.</li>
            <li> Now I see what the whole BB cream hype is all about.</li>
            <li> is very desaturated in color.</li>
            <li> If I have a really pigmented blemish/pimple, etc.</li>
            <li> I just get really oily during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Is greasy and makes me very oily prone.</li>
            <li> Sooo much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It blended really well.</li>
            <li> The shipping wasn&#x27;t particularly fast or anything, but it arrived around the time it said it would.</li>
            <li> It goes on a bit gray but blends in really well and hides imperfections.</li>
            <li> Covers very well</li>
            <li> It covers so much of my problem areas and does not cause me to break out</li>
            <li> I really like how it smell,look and feel on my face.  </li>
            <li> VERY</li>
            <li> It covers my face really well.</li>
            <li> this made my face look very shiny.</li>
            <li> But of course it gets oxidized and changes color (not too much though..</li>
            <li> $13.46 is really really reasonable</li>
            <li> and has SPF 42...lots of benefits in one product...and very affordable.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover some skin discolorations, which I don&#x27;t really expect it to do.  </li>
            <li> much thicker than i thought.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really say how well it is compared to -blank-.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its cover ability is very pefect.</li>
            <li> All of the rest are simply too light in color and</li>
            <li> Blends in really well with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Really the product.</li>
            <li> However, it makes my skin very oily.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and don&#x27;t like using liquid foundation or any of the bb creams.</li>
            <li> I really adore this BB cream.</li>
            <li> The product works well, but doesn&#x27;t help much with my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Plus of Missha BB cream, high SPF (maybe that why it seems more oily).&lt;br /&gt;In summary, for medium coverage Missha (if you don&#x27;t mind the fragrant), Etude House (if you don&#x27;t have dry skin).  </li>
            <li> It goes on the skin very smoothly, and unlike some other BB creams that I&#x27;ve tried, does give that ashy complexion after a while.</li>
            <li> I would advise against making a purchase for this product unless you want full coverage, complete with new breakouts.</li>
            <li> The coverage is amazing and it does not leave your face looking like a pale ghost.</li>
            <li> I have dry to normal skin, and I don&#x27;t have many pimples either.</li>
            <li> but i find that the \\&quot;natural beige\\&quot; isn&#x27;t the right match for my Caucasian skin.</li>
            <li> They are as good as any other similar product you buy at the drugstore</li>
            <li> I originally bought this a few months ago for my mom, but it was too light for her skin tone, so she gave it to</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super strong but quite potent enough to have a sniff.</li>
            <li> This natural beige is VERY light and has a tint of grey.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all and washes off easily with mild face soap.</li>
            <li> My first impression was wow!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker and more matte than other BB creams I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> The color is off when comparing with my original Missha, and printing on the tub is very different.  </li>
            <li> Definitely better than other foundations.</li>
            <li> 1oz/30ml]])has a lot more oil in it than other BB creams I have and use.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other BB creams and nothing compares to the Missha.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear foundation due to heaviness, I love this maybelline&lt;br /&gt;Product instead</li>
            <li> The cream is really good,has a good texture,smell and lovely covering effect,makes your skin soft and natural but the problem is that i picked the wrong color..</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with mild acne, and this cream not only controlled the oil really well but also covered up my blemishes as well as lightened up my whole face.</li>
            <li> it becomes grey quickly !</li>
            <li> It smells good and covers well.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, even on my relatively tan skin, the color is on the dark side, and it lacks in color -</li>
            <li> The product does not look dry after application and the high SPF is a great bonus as I am using multiple topical medications and must be very cautious with my sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use this BB cream with high SPF than any other suncreens however as most tend to be too greasy or they break me out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before, and this one has the same perfect effect as my previous one bought from other places.</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast and was in brand new box wrapped as well...was a little light for me</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, so it works fine with me.  </li>
            <li> I have a few discolorations, and occasional cystic acne, and this really makes my skin look even and bright.  </li>
            <li> This #23 shade comes out lighter than my natural tone at first</li>
            <li> i bought the number 23 in hopes that once it oxidized that i would suit my shade (i have a medium-olived tone skin, ie bare mineral golden medium, MUFE 123)and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similar to the cho bo yang (missha) cream in cool beige</li>
            <li> skin colors offered are pretty natural  -neat bottle  </li>
            <li> it doesnt provide full coverage and the color and product does wear off in a short while.</li>
            <li> this was my first of two bb creams to try so far.  </li>
            <li> It looks beautiful on the skin without looking fake.</li>
            <li> I am able to use less and less over time because my skin really is getting that much better.    </li>
            <li> My favorite BB creme hands down.</li>
            <li> This cream covers beautifully, however it is a little dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I live in the humid Virginia state and the BB cream does very well in the summer.</li>
            <li> When you apply it, it goes on easily but as it gets absored into the skin, it becomes harder to work into the skin as it becomes matt/powderly like.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;m never buying foundation again, bb creams have changed me ^^</li>
            <li> I need to order a different  shade for better coverage however for my asian skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian with fairly light skin tone in my early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I only wish they had a more yellow-based color - but that seems to be a universal issue with make</li>
            <li> After countless trips and dollars spent at Sephora on many expensive brands, this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> No big deal, I thought I would just open the top to use it.</li>
            <li> and I use it as my main foundation.  </li>
            <li> on, the cream does cover remarkably well and seems to last all day, without causing my face to become an oil slick and shiny.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this product and would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I have older oily skin</li>
            <li> I particularly don&#x27;t like things that have a scent</li>
            <li> This particular BB cream from Missha retails (in Korea) for 11,000  won</li>
            <li> Decently priced product here in amazon.</li>
            <li> It is a little light so mix it with No. 27 to get right shade.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers, it coveraged well and very light in order to look natural.</li>
            <li> and im fair liek asian pale.</li>
            <li> The medium coverage is just enough to dull my blemishes and the super lightweight formula feels amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li> So we highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i have tried everything from drugstore foundations to the high end</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Coverage is more than expected for such a sheer and light seeming cream.</li>
            <li> Highly recomment</li>
            <li> My problem with it is the high perfume odor.</li>
            <li> And the SPF is high which is a plus.  </li>
            <li> high SPF and lots of skin benefits</li>
            <li> I like the coverage of this bb cream and the high SPF.</li>
            <li> The only thing that has been keeping me from using my current tube of the Perfect Cover is the fact that it is clearly too dark for my current winter skin.</li>
            <li> It lasted thru most of the day (unlike my powder) and it hid all my imperfections (little freckles on my cheeks).  </li>
            <li> It looks alot better on when you have it blended in after its oxidized a little bit.</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to remove</li>
            <li> Really smells like an old woman&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the CREAM is great.</li>
            <li> but if you add the shipping your spending 8 more bucks which I guess isn&#x27;t incredibly bad considering your not buying it in Korea but just FYI on how much it&#x27;s actually worth :).</li>
            <li> Then, I was really surprised that this cream really is what I hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li> the real deal not fake American copies...</li>
            <li> and then normal cheeks.</li>
            <li> this bb cream covers well on my normal and oily skin area...</li>
            <li> Currently My skin tone is fairly light in Bare minerals matte foundation.</li>
            <li> With my normal foundation I would&#x27;ve started to become oily in one or two hours.</li>
            <li> (not common)</li>
            <li> This shade is darker than normal BB cream</li>
            <li> If I use it like a normal sized amount, like the size of a quarter, it gives my face a ashen/corpse like color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have noticed that even when I don&#x27;t do this the BB cream oxidizes and matches my skinetone better after a few hours.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t heavy coverage, more medium coverage.  </li>
            <li> waste of money and don&#x27;t require me to add more words to this surey as it is insult to injury</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the winter/fall months which may make your skin dry and dull.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastability: If you don&#x27;t top this off with finishing powder, it won&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is, it seems to start drying right away</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re weighing your options with BB creams right now, look no further.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m Asian, and this BB cream, though it had a great consistency (not too thin but not creamy thick) and smells nice,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few BB creams in the last few months and this one is by far the BEST!</li>
            <li> I am asian with light brown tone, i was skeptical when i first used it bcuz its kind of a little light on my skin</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly without the cakey look i&#x27;ve encountered with some other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much coverage it offers for someone who needs more coverage.</li>
            <li> However it was very generous of amazon to give me a return slip for free, and didn&#x27;t take long to see my money back in my card.</li>
            <li> I am new to BB creams</li>
            <li> I live in the desert</li>
            <li> However, my husband even commented, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t like your new foundation\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> and i live in the desert.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing that I couldn&#x27;t live without..</li>
            <li> Especially since it has sunscreen built in (with my combination skin, it&#x27;s hard to find a good sunscreen that won&#x27;t make me shiny or oily.)</li>
            <li> but after I saw myself in the mirror a few hours later my skin looked amazing and</li>
            <li> The only reason I prefer the skin79 one over this is because I feel this has more pink tones in it and</li>
            <li> It still worked okay, but sadly I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable to continue using it after a while...</li>
            <li> Just think enough to provide coverage but light enough to just feel like face cream.</li>
            <li> I only wish it was available at local drug stores.</li>
            <li> It did NOT set smoothly at all either but left my face feeling overly heavy, oily, and super shiney.</li>
            <li> On top of that, it&#x27;s not too pink and not too yellow.</li>
            <li> It is more coverage than other tinted moisturizers I have tried but lighter than a full face of foundation (which in summer can get messy).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s thicker and provides more coverage than I expected, so I used too much the first few times after switching from Maybelline.</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin was very clear and even toned.</li>
            <li> I have splotchy, reddish skin that is very sensitive, and it was visibly improved after a week.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about it causing breakouts, since I have very sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> right when i put this on, the color was much darker than what i expected.</li>
            <li> Like others have mentioned, a little bit of this product goes a looooooooong way, so the price is extremely reasonable considering how other liquid foundations don&#x27;t cover as well as this bb cream, or offer as many benefits as the Missha, either!  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, but after showering and washing my face it can be pretty dry because I use benzoyl peroxide for my acne.</li>
            <li> Also bought Smash Box BB cream and tried many other American brands BB creams (Dior, Boscia, Too Face, Tarte).  </li>
            <li> Some of the comments said the color was on the light side and to order up, but I found the #23 too dark and am going to order the #21.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> At first I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work for me because I have a different skin type from them, but my cousin said it should be alright.</li>
            <li> This IS the expiration date so same as other BB cream sellers, they advertise to sell the &amp;#34;2013 latest products&amp;#34; and they are expired.</li>
            <li> In the future, I will probably test out many other bb creams but buy this product again since I already know it works for me.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> and if you have an aversion to flowery smells its pretty gross.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, and seeing this type of product recommended on tv, I was excited to try.  </li>
            <li> I am going to throw these out and go back to the one for $15.99 and hope I get the product I purchased the first time.  </li>
            <li> While probably not necessary, I do set it with a powder, although it dries pretty well -</li>
            <li> I usually never give reviews.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with very large pores, uneven skin tone, and mild acne, and I would normally wear a primer, concealer, and Bare Minerals foundation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a slight perfume smell (I like it) that quickly dissolves and I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s really matte.</li>
            <li> I normally use the bare minerals line or the smashbox mineral \\&quot;foundation\\&quot; because I tend to find regular foundation too time consuming to choose (the right color).</li>
            <li> Even though, you can build for more coverage, but I&#x27;d not recommended b/c it will look very heavy.  </li>
            <li> There is a definite reason that Missha BB creams are so highly regarded - it really does work.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a minor point when the overall coverage is so smooth and even.</li>
            <li> Dior BB creams are more of yellow tone and dark.  </li>
            <li> It meets my expections because I serves many beneficial aspects for my face such as covering blemishes and dark spots, making my face look smoother and prettier.</li>
            <li> The color sets in very naturally and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So - with much research I settled on the MISSHA because, as a caucasian with light to med skin, not all brands would have a pigment dark enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently on my second tube of this, the first last me over a year because I just use one pump to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li> I love how it evens my skin tone and texture without feeling heavy or like its just sitting on my skin and even better, little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I do wear a serum underneath and sometimes will wear a light moisturizer if my skin is extra dry.  </li>
            <li> But since I like the product so much, I just apply my shisheido power over it  (which is use sparingly since the reserves are running low) and it gives a very natural looking finish.  </li>
            <li> This makeup has lasted me a long time, it works better than any other BB cream I have tried yet</li>
            <li> The product is made in Korea, where the \\&quot;BB Cream\\&quot; is very hot, and so you buy from a third party seller here on Amazon or maybe find it in Asian</li>
            <li> A light dusting of loose facial powder</li>
            <li> Not pale.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cause any break outs on me considering that my skin is sensitive and usually acne prone (easily breaks out with new products).</li>
            <li> It goes on a little oily, especially if you apply it on top of a moisturizer, like I do.</li>
            <li> It has also helped even my skin tone, which is important to us middle aged women.  </li>
            <li> I can see a clear line between my face and neck when I wear the cream.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look clumpy or cakey, it kept a natural, dewey finish on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was also surprised how fragrant it is.</li>
            <li> I no longer have oily skin at the end of the day, and my complexion has evened out considerably.</li>
            <li> BB cream No.23 blends into my skin naturally</li>
            <li> However, after about 5 min, it looks entirely natural.</li>
            <li> Yes, when you first put it on, it gives you a mask of a strange color.</li>
            <li> the cream doesn&#x27;t completely match my skin color.</li>
            <li> Also the smell is different from the real one.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised when my order arrived by airmail</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed this effect yet</li>
            <li> You only need a pea size drop on your hand to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li> I have ordered 3 times so far.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a light/medium complected Caucasian woman) and looks natural.</li>
            <li> and so far I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> It is definitely very spreadable and can be thinned out with moisturizer if needed (depending upon your personal choice of texture).  </li>
            <li> No. 23 Natural Beige tube.</li>
            <li> But it costs me $12.75 USD to ship back, so I decided not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am curious as to how many person has bought this product and encountered the same problem when trying to return the product.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft afterwords and not sticky.</li>
            <li> But when I ordered the No. 23 (natural beige)</li>
            <li> This time I avoided the eye area completely.</li>
            <li> and wow I&#x27;m amazed on how well it goes on my face.</li>
            <li> It just gives my skin a natural look.</li>
            <li> It feels heavy and oily -- cheap type of ingredients.</li>
            <li> you will look green with in the sun light.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It is not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> Its not heavy but</li>
            <li> so I purchase both natural and honey beige.</li>
            <li> In fact, it seemed to take all of the natural \\&quot;life\\&quot; out of my face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have unusually sensitive skin, so this surprised me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, I can only apply a teeny-tiny amount, like the size of a number 2 pencil eraser on the back of my hand and use that as a palette to smooth on my entire face.</li>
            <li> Have since replaced this with the Misha Complete BB.</li>
            <li> Gives a natural &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> But so far, haven&#x27;t had this problem with BB Cream.  </li>
            <li> but I really believe I look younger with it on.</li>
            <li> In fact, I was so not impatient that I forgot I ordered it until the package arrived!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The finish is natural -- matte and makes your skin look soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color</li>
            <li> Covers up blemishes well with the natural skin tone shading.  </li>
            <li> However, it can cause some skin irritation for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you have imperfections that are to be covered well but look natural, this is it.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product especially if you&#x27;ve never tried a BB crema before.</li>
            <li> Doesnt match, not smooth, its not oil free</li>
            <li> I was surprised, they sent from Korea, they mail on 11/3/14</li>
            <li> I had developed some pimples</li>
            <li> It just looks soo natural.</li>
            <li> It has a grey looking tone - don&#x27;t really like at first sight - and upon initially put on the face, the color looks lighter shade than my skin color.  </li>
            <li> It also almost completely covers my melasma.</li>
            <li> This really has reduced my blemishes overall, even during my cycle!  </li>
            <li> It does have a stronger scent, so if you are sensitive, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It may look darker than your skin tone, but after you dot it and blend it out all over your face, it will oxidize and blend with your natural skin tone..</li>
            <li> I am self conscious about them, but I feel like this product covers them well.  </li>
            <li> Also it feels great; it isn&#x27;t thick or heavy, it just feels light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It covers more like a foundation, but not quite as thick.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a grey cast and it gives you a very natural finish with very decent coverage (buildable).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just very desaturated, so it doesn&#x27;t have a sunny warm look, more of a cold, pale look.</li>
            <li> But right now I will not go back to any traditional foundation!</li>
            <li> Maybe I just picked the wrong color, but I&#x27;d want to know for sure this is the right color match before shelling out an amount of money for something that doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> The coverage is better than any other, a little goes a long way, it smells amazing and after applied, a little powder is all you need to set it.  </li>
            <li> It was the only makeup product I used on my face over the summer, besides the occasional concealer (when I didn&#x27;t want full makeup), and Maybelline&#x27;s \\&quot;FIT\\&quot; foundation (which was a MISTAKE for me personally).</li>
            <li> When I got it, I was no less worried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to get my skin back into decent shape.</li>
            <li> If this breaks me out, I&#x27;ll be pretty sad, but as of now I&#x27;m seriously in love.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup, and this is pretty much what I need for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> Pigmented, long wearing, large color selection.</li>
            <li> On the thin side and very easy to blend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big foundation user nor high maintenance person</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a true light olive skin toned (Korean/Caucasian) who has struggled to find a medium to full coverage foundation base to cover my acne marks and skin discolorations.  </li>
            <li> The top came off by twisting, not good.</li>
            <li> I have combination, normal to oil skin, thus, make-up only lasts about 4 hours, even though I work indoor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other BB creams before in the past, and this one blends the easiest and is a pretty good match after it oxidizes.  </li>
            <li> It looked a little more lighter than I expected.</li>
            <li> A little thick but gives good coverage.</li>
            <li> It is important to bear in mind that it is only medium-light coverage due to the fact that it is labeled \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; not necessarily foundation.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that gets really dry and really oily in some parts.</li>
            <li> and i have combo skin (very oily in t-zone but extremely dry in the cheeks).  </li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t really need a \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; coverage (I used Laura Bare Mineral and Mercier tinted moisturizure for a long time).  </li>
            <li> After using #21 for while, I started realizing how grayish yellow/brown it is and after seeing a few pictures of myself, it doesn&#x27;t really match my neck very well.  </li>
            <li> It also has a grey tone when you first apply, but it adjusts to your skin shortly after.</li>
            <li> I actually like to use a thin layer under foundation as kind of a primer.</li>
            <li> This BB cream has much better coverage than my other BB cream and lasts for the entire day without feeling oily or anything!(My other one did as well, the only thing I have a problem with it the color is a little light and the coverage)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the major high-end brands, some drug store brands and I&#x27;ve never found a tinted moisturizer or foundation that seemed to work with my combination skin.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of scars from acne but the foundation covers it pretty well, along with other blemishes on my face.</li>
            <li> I never break out after wearing it, so that is a major</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, not too thin so it doesn&#x27;t do good coverage but also not too thick and clunky (like some other BB creams).  </li>
            <li> When I first applied it, the shade appeared a little too light (I purchased the darker 23 shade), but it took only a few minutes to oxidize on my skin, and after it did, it looked really natural,</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it is making any positive permanent changes to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I even tried a few different things to create a \\&quot;natural glow\\&quot; that really makes my slightly bumpy skin look really smooth (and I&#x27;ve received lots of compliments):  </li>
            <li> It provides almost full coverage, but even after letting it oxidize and adjust to my skin tone, it is still a little pink/gray for my neutral (leaning slightly yellow) skin tone.</li>
            <li> the good thing is that you only need a small amount, which means my little 20ml bottle will last me a while.</li>
            <li> It provides a much fuller coverage than my other BB cream, but I just use less when necessary (opting for 1/2 a pump rather than a full pump.)  </li>
            <li> if anything, and I have never (even throughout puberty) experienced a bad breakout.</li>
            <li> After using for a week, I&#x27;ve noticed a general improvement in skin tone.</li>
            <li> After doing extensive research and pouring over multiple reviews of this product I ordered both this and the Missha M Signature Real Complete BB Cream No. 23.  </li>
            <li> The coloring is a bit strange at first (as everyone says, rather grey)</li>
            <li> I tried several BB creams when I switched and this one is the clear winner.</li>
            <li> I have not been using it long enough to know if it really whitens and that it does not break me out.</li>
            <li> So far what I like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t make my face extra oily and</li>
            <li> But when I saw their bare skin, I thought that there were some seceret.</li>
            <li> Apparently, the tube was stuck or mis-functioned.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps my skin was not use to having a liquid smeared on it since i&#x27;ve been using bare escential for about 8 yeras.</li>
            <li> I actually couldn&#x27;t even bear a sunscreen that has SPF30 (my skin its just way too sensitive)</li>
            <li> I use a beauty blender (pink egg sponge) to apply this and it goes on really well.  </li>
            <li> Was a bit leary about the color of the product when i first put it on, appeared dark.</li>
            <li> it will completely break your face out with white heads and boils.</li>
            <li> #23 looks natural on Asian beige skin.</li>
            <li> The package came sooner than expected, so I really trust Seoul</li>
            <li> This is NOT the Missha product that is the same when ordered directly from Missha.</li>
            <li> The color is much lighter than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a relatively medium tan asian (a bit on the light side) and I bought this bb cream because I don&#x27;t like heavy foundation.</li>
            <li> so far, I like them equally.  </li>
            <li> It last all day, looks natural and is in a convenient pump bottle.</li>
            <li> I have the color #23 and at first I thought it was way too dark, but it blends like a dream into the skin</li>
            <li> As for a natural glowing look, I would personally go for the Etude House BB cream.</li>
            <li> It lasts longer than bare mineral powder.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Bare Minerals for years, and to be honest, I&#x27;m getting tired of it, because during the day, I would see the \\&quot;shine\\&quot; in my face, and overall, just dying to find a different foundation product.</li>
            <li> Received it much sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> was interested to see a Korean documentary about a shopping center in Seoul.</li>
            <li> it ranks #2 next to Skin79 triple BB cream in the hot pink can.  </li>
            <li> I should try a few more times to see if my skin actually &amp;#34;adapts&amp;#34; to this BB cream, but this is truly not the one I expected.</li>
            <li> they either didn&#x27;t cover enough or were slipping off my face within a few hours...not to mention some of them made me oilier or made me break out more...</li>
            <li> It looked shiny on my skin, and I started breaking out after using it a few days (and I rarely break out</li>
            <li> This bb cream feels like a thick moisturizer , it has a light to medium coverage</li>
            <li> Is thick but feels light when you put it on.</li>
            <li> It covers my dark spots and bumps very well without feeling to heavy and it evens out my skin tone super well.</li>
            <li> There is a slight perfume scent, when I first applied it but disappeared soon after.</li>
            <li> This cream is for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Read reviews about the Missha product and decided to try it as it has much higher SPF and several other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> moisturized in summer and not dry at all in winter!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain since it isn&#x27;t like a floral scent; it just smells like a rich cream.</li>
            <li> the color make you look like a zombie at first, then quite dark after if you are not a very dark asian don&#x27;t buy it, and don&#x27;t put a lot on</li>
            <li> I am reading the other reviews that said this this product is very moisturizing and looks dewey.</li>
            <li> The color is MUCH lighter than my other two tubes of No. 23--to</li>
            <li> But the color is a little too light for me and the texture is thicker than expected.</li>
            <li> Lovely, silky, spf + coverage that you can build up from little to heavy.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way and gives a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> This gives the skin a really nice glow and doesn&#x27;t look heavy or thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cursed with acne and acne scars ever since I was little and there are still some areas with hyperpigmentation that I am always trying to cover up- with little luck and more white heads in the end.   </li>
            <li> You only need a little bit to cover your cheeks, a little more for the forehead and chin.  </li>
            <li> a single use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is much drier than the american BB creams that I have tried, so you may need several pumps to get enough product to cover your face.</li>
            <li> The cream really brightens up the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have only worn Bare Minerals since 2000, so I&#x27;m getting used to a heavier makeup.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use a full pump for my face, so I&#x27;ve been using it for at least six months and it shows no immediate signs of running out.</li>
            <li> It feels natural, provides nice coverage over my spots, not too thin nor heavy.</li>
            <li> The #23 is slightly too cool for my summer tan skin tone, but this bb cream darkens a bit as it oxidizes and with just a little contouring looks natural and brightening.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m pretty pale</li>
            <li> Even though I have light hair and blue eyes, my skin is not fair</li>
            <li> and after less than one hour it really blend into your skin...</li>
            <li> You gave will looks so natural when u putting on and it won&#x27;t make ur skin looks dry.</li>
            <li> Skin toward sensitive and dry</li>
            <li> but i think it wouldn&#x27;t really cover dark scars or big blemishes alone.</li>
            <li> The result is natural and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical buying make-up online without being able to try it first.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try because my old foundation (Estee Lauder Double Wear) was too dry for me, especially in the winter season.</li>
            <li> I only use half a pump, if that much, and still have left over for the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the product, although the perfumes are a little much for me.  </li>
            <li> It comes out a little grey at first so it can color correct and try to match to your skin color.</li>
            <li> I only use a little bit, like one tiny fingertip size and that&#x27;s enough to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li> Very soft to skin, doesn&#x27;t look so cake like other bb cream</li>
            <li> To me it gives just enough coverage and a very natural looking, so bare in mind that this is not a full coverage</li>
            <li> now waiting to see if my laugh lines and crows feet will slowly disappear.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I have a hard time getting it to look right.</li>
            <li> usually I put on a light moisturizer after cleansing, let it sit for a half hour, and then dab and blend MISSHA.  </li>
            <li> I have normal skin with a slightly oily t-zone and have not had an issue at all</li>
            <li> I have normal skin with a slightly oily t-zone and have not had an issue at all</li>
            <li> I will only use this BB cream because it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy like the other one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> As someone with red flushes and splotches for no apparent reason as well as the occasional blemish, BB creams are a godsend.</li>
            <li> My skin is very clear except for the capillary red spots around the nose and occasional black acne spots.  </li>
            <li> It does come out gray and your face will look very pale when first applied...</li>
            <li> After a few hours it looks a little shine but not really bad.</li>
            <li> i bought number 23 natural beige and it was too dark for my skin,i&#x27;m a Mediterranean girl with not so white skin</li>
            <li> When I first heard about BB cream I thought it was going to be expensive but $18 isn&#x27;t&#x27; much at all if you take into account all that is inside the cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but once I rub it in and some time passes it looks completely natural (for your average white girl).</li>
            <li> This is product has now become part of my daily routine and a tiny amount goes a long way...</li>
            <li> This is product has now become part of my daily routine and a tiny amount goes a long way...</li>
            <li> And you really need to use very little.  </li>
            <li> First off, i don&#x27;t lower product ratings because of things like late shipping and ect.  </li>
            <li> For future purchases, I would like you send them with a long expiration date.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it has helped the scars lessen</li>
            <li> But it took me so long before needing to open this tube that I don&#x27;t believe I can return it.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 tubes already they last long time it stays on your face all day</li>
            <li> However, it does not last long and can look oily after a while; it also does not cover blemishes well.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost out of my current tube and couldn&#x27;t go long without it!  </li>
            <li> it last very long and my skin is getting lighter and lighter now.   </li>
            <li> Went through 3 different ones from cheap (Garnier) to expensive (Clinique).  </li>
            <li> My skin is dry with yellow undertones and this product blended well into my skin.  </li>
            <li> The consistency seemed a tiny bit dry and cakey</li>
            <li> I ordered this without reading the ratings and it is different from the normal product i usually get.</li>
            <li> But people with problem skin or old tired out looking skin really should know about this and give it a try.</li>
            <li> I recommend this cream for kinda dry to normal and oily skin, but&lt;br /&gt;definitely not pretty dry skin because it WILL dry and accentuate your flaky skin!</li>
            <li> Just prior to this, I was using a drugstore brand which for some reason became flaky after I topped it off with loose powder, but not with this bb cream.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other BB Creams (Skin 79 - various types)</li>
            <li> i will keep trying out other brands, but i have a hunch that i will go back to this one in the future.</li>
            <li> and it last long too!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little too pale when you first applied to your face</li>
            <li> I was worried that the color would be wrong for my skin tone because although I have light skin, I am olive toned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 and suffer from cystic acne, hyperpigmentation (dark splotches), oily-combination, and general redness.</li>
            <li> Skin 79 pink label only comes in 1 color</li>
            <li> After using Armani, Bobbi Brown and Laura Mercier for a long time, I think I&#x27;m a fan of BB Cream and will stay so.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a grey tan instead of making you orange</li>
            <li> This one tube goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> The colors run a tiny bit lighter than I expected, but that&#x27;s a risk factor buying on line vs. in person purchasing.</li>
            <li> I bought #23 and was worried because it has a grey color to it</li>
            <li> I am a middle aged woman with oily skin and this does not let a lot of shine through.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been long time I used that product it helps for sun protection..</li>
            <li> a grey cast on skin</li>
            <li> The color was slightly grey</li>
            <li> I have already had one a long time ago</li>
            <li> But after 15 minutes, the grey tone goes away, the color shade blends well with my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> It goes on with a grey cast but blends in with my skin tone within secs.</li>
            <li> I usually use it when I need to wear sunblock since normal sunblock will turn oily on my face, but this one sits dewey and just perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was doubtful initially but this is way better than Lancôme and makes skin look dewy and natural.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is very sticky and thick.</li>
            <li> It also finished very fast, at least 2 times faster than other foundations I had.</li>
            <li> Not only did this cream NOT give me much coverage, it smelled rancid of cheap perfume and left this shinny look to my face that I hated.</li>
            <li> however, i would search other products before coming back to missha.</li>
            <li> or maybe it&#x27;s due to the estee lauder idealist pore minimizer that i started using at around the same time as the bb cream.</li>
            <li> I have tried only one other BB cream before which was by Skin79.</li>
            <li> but I have pictures to prove with other creams in the same brand, that this is NOT the manufacturing date.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even beat the other Korean brand and other US big brands, but white people may like darker skin</li>
            <li> Especially since the SPF20 is a little low in the summer.</li>
            <li> color is way different than the other</li>
            <li> I purchased this BB cream on the impulse and due to a low price and lots of reviews.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with 3 other brands (of the same product - BB Cream).</li>
            <li> but I personally didn&#x27;t pick it up simply because of small various factors.</li>
            <li> Cream is thick and hard to smooth evenly on skin.</li>
            <li> Also when I got it, The bottle looked a little flat to me, so I&#x27;m think how long this bottle will last me?</li>
            <li> I originally left a bad review because the pump would not work, had I contacted the seller I would have had a better idea of how to work it</li>
            <li> However, I found that it&#x27;s a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> I use moisturizer underneath as my skin is on the dry side.</li>
            <li> its not itchy, cakey, and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
            <li> Um, I have dry flaky forehead but oily nose.</li>
            <li> and I have dry and oily skin and seems to soothe that for me.</li>
            <li> which has a tendancy to dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I do need to use a cream or lotion before applying BB cream, but that&#x27;s because my skin is really dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Sticks onto dry skin</li>
            <li> I also found it rather dry.</li>
            <li> I am slightly dry, so I use moisturizer with SPF then apply the bbcream and concealer.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I did not pack the old tube, so I just looked washed out the whole trip--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the one product that I can never live without.  </li>
            <li> I know the color selections are limited but</li>
            <li> I have dry 50 year old skin, so I usually wear a moisturizer under it, but often don&#x27;t need to in the summer.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll have to do multiple layers if you&#x27;re hiding blemishes or dark circles under your eyes.</li>
            <li> I can get dark in the summer, but this would be only for winter coverage</li>
            <li> I began to try over the counter brands recently with not much success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an average beige complexion Asian woman and had been looking for a BB cream to use.</li>
            <li> and I usually wear a Clinique foundation in Natural</li>
            <li> Even with my loose powder on, it provides a dewy finish which isn&#x27;t greasy to the touch...</li>
            <li> but once you used a loose powder that match your skin tone</li>
            <li> The only down side is I am getting darker, so</li>
            <li> Then finally I turned it upside down and pressed the spout and the cream came out.</li>
            <li> The colour is a little bit grey but mixed with my Physician Formula BB cream</li>
            <li> then I make tiny dots in different parts of my face using that small amount, then I spread &amp; blend it all over.</li>
            <li> Seems bit watery and the color is slightly lighter compared to the same product that I got in Korea.</li>
            <li> I usually apply this after my moisturizer and no more else, it has SPF 42 in, very convenient!</li>
            <li> It just felt dry and harder to apply.</li>
            <li> I ran out of this (which I bought for $50 at a Korean store) -- i was worried because some reviewers said it was fake, but it&#x27;s definitely exactly the same as the one I bought from the store</li>
            <li> , i realized there&#x27;s only half of the product inside.</li>
            <li> Another con is that it only lasts for about 6 hours, but that is typical for a BB cream.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little extra moisturizer before I apply on really dry days.</li>
            <li> The product stays in place, especially with a little primer and finishing powder.</li>
            <li> It looks a little grey/silver when you put it on but that will go away shortly.</li>
            <li> I only use a little bit (about 3 little pumps), just enough to cover my face.  </li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s hard for me to say whether this product is delivering results as far as whitening and anti-aging, as I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet</li>
            <li> but it does not cover capillary red spots or black spots due to acnes.  </li>
            <li> I happen to remember that the previous ones I&#x27;ve ordered (from other sellers) would not allow you to twist it open.</li>
            <li> BB.&lt;br /&gt;The fake one, you can open the product but the real one you can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;please</li>
            <li> for American brands, Smash Box is heavy, almost like foundation.  </li>
            <li> Ive only been using this product a few weeks after reading reviews about it.</li>
            <li> I am trying to return the product to Pink Gelee that&#x27;s where I got it from.  </li>
            <li> It is a moisturizer, it has SPF, and it evens out my skin tone since my jaw is slightly pink.</li>
            <li> this bbcream was not real.</li>
            <li> partially used 50ml</li>
            <li> and it was not real.  </li>
            <li> I like it except the fact that it was a lot lighter than expected.</li>
            <li> The Missha 23 and The pink Skin 79.</li>
            <li> Pink undertones -</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> EXPIRED, AND ALMOST EMPTY.</li>
            <li> it self within 30 sec.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, there was no tube inside the cream (the one that usually connects to the pump).</li>
            <li> I received it a few days later.</li>
            <li> i have to be careful to exfoiliate and find products that don&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> DID NOT MUCH  </li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t wear makeup, I really am not looking for foundation stuff to cake up my face.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> so thats sooner than the expected shipment date.</li>
            <li> My face didnt have uneven yellow undertones, and my eye bags disappeared.</li>
            <li> I have never had such a slow delivery in my entire life.</li>
            <li> This product will last you a very long time because you need very little to cover the problem areas.</li>
            <li> I am Asian and not so tanned, but this product is too pale for my skin.</li>
            <li> I also have dry skin and usually have to moisturize in layers, but with this product I only need it.</li>
            <li> This can be layered for heavy coverage, but a single layer will cover redness, unevenness, and minor imperfections.</li>
            <li> It goes on with a slight grey hue, but blends with my skin tone soon after application.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I agree that this product does not have a wide range of options for everyone&#x27;s skin tone.</li>
            <li> this product will definitely last you a long time and the price is hard to beat</li>
            <li> So just be careful when you order that if you have a Caucasian skin tone (if you&#x27;re white without a very dark tan), do not order No. 23!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t THAT bad but its summer where I live and I can&#x27;t stand any type of fragrance really</li>
            <li> I had bad experiences with BB creams in the past (mostly that they seem to be for people with ghostly white skin), but I saw that Missha&#x27;s BB cream came in a slightly darker shade.</li>
            <li> That was also one other reason I stopped using Missha.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me breakout like with other foundations and it covers up my blemishes.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t bother to write reviews for products, but this one I simply could not pass up.</li>
            <li> FYI, I have oily skin and while it isn&#x27;t extremely mattifying</li>
            <li> Have not tried any other brands.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t using it every day, maybe every other day.</li>
            <li> i used to have to blot within 2 hours of wearing my other foundations</li>
            <li> Same as usual.</li>
            <li> With this product,  a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I only use 1 small pump and a tube lasts me about 4 months</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if they have different shades.</li>
            <li> The texture of this cream is extremely watery and I realized that this is NOT the legit Missha cream.</li>
            <li> It also does not make my face oily and shiny like other BB</li>
            <li> However, I haven&#x27;t read any other reviews with this issue, so maybe it is just me.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look all caked like other cover-ups.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with SPF in facial creams in the past.</li>
            <li> I will never use anything else other than this product.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I find the coverage on this to be extremely sufficient for redness and discoloration.</li>
            <li> I only put a small dot on each cheek and it blends into my skin.</li>
            <li> And the price tag was hefty compared to other brands (Garnier and L&#x27;Oreal).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan and look forward to the other benefits over time.</li>
            <li> My sister suggested that I purchase this due to the fact that she swears by this brand/cream.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount too.</li>
            <li> altho, I was skeptical when I first saw it.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other BB creams have worn off by the end of the day or separated, this one doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me break out, doesn&#x27;t make me oily and comes off easier than other makeup I use and lasts almost all day.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I set it with a little loose powder because it gets shiny if I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> And because it&#x27;s relatively thick, you only need to use a little bit and one tube goes a long way</li>
            <li> Lighter texture than other BB creams, but too dark for me.  </li>
            <li> I have a normal to dry skin (unfortunately).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if other BB creams also typically have talc or not.</li>
            <li> The color actually makes my face look dull.  </li>
            <li> I find that I usually have to add a little powder later in the day.  </li>
            <li> I am Asian, and my skin isn&#x27;t very pale but I am not super tan</li>
            <li> i bought the number 31 in another site and that was too dark.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it reduces acne or dark spots as I have none.</li>
            <li> I sometimes have redness of my face and dark circles under my eyes...</li>
            <li> In fact, I sometimes need an extra moisturizer because it zaps oil so much (at least for me).</li>
            <li> but I was shocked to discover a shiny/oily face by mid afternoon the first day I used this product.</li>
            <li> I want tell you information between real and fake of this</li>
            <li> I use 23 to cover my dark under-eye circles.</li>
            <li> Also, it didn&#x27;t cover up the one rather dark spot on my face</li>
            <li> Like everyone had said: a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It seemed to somewhat cover my dark undereye circles.  </li>
            <li> Is way dark on me</li>
            <li> Thought it much dark............</li>
            <li> I use this for a slightly more colourful base.</li>
            <li> And so far, I haven&#x27;t broken out or had any irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now sorry I didn&#x27;t contact them, they wrote me and asked if I could hold it upside down and pump it to see if that worked and it did work much to my shame.  </li>
            <li> and I had to mix with other face lotion to make a little lighter.</li>
            <li> This means I usually have dry flaky skin on my cheek area, and acne on my forehead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super dark, but you can still notice the difference and you&#x27;ll spend time blending out the color to make the rest of your skin look darker.</li>
            <li> Her skin is less oily now too.  </li>
            <li> so it was less oily but everything was in vain.</li>
            <li> For me, I just squeeze the pump half way</li>
            <li> The fragrance is slightly stronger but I like that.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and got a refund for half of what I paid.</li>
            <li> The smell is the typical lotiony makeup scent</li>
            <li> but there is a message that says it&#x27;s too late for returns even though I ordered it within the last few months.</li>
            <li> The colour I chose was not a perfect match for my skin tone but using the product sparingly and blending carefully, it made for a seamless cover up.</li>
            <li> I typically use Bobbi Brown Sand Beige or Mac NC30.  </li>
            <li> even though it goes on with a slight greyish hue, within a minute it is virtually invisible.</li>
            <li> If nothing at all, use it as sun screen because it is not oily like the typical sun</li>
            <li> odd color cast with a death mask</li>
            <li> Then the slightly off gray color doesn&#x27;t matter, but I get the benefits.</li>
            <li> Had major problems with rash and broken blood vessels on my chest.</li>
            <li> But a little too dark a shade for me</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use powder, it makes your skin look a little ashy, but I think this is because my skin tone is dark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too &#x27;&#x27;heavy&#x27;&#x27; and too dark for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have spent an embarrassing amount of money on foundations in the past.</li>
            <li> Seems like the container was not full.</li>
            <li> and I have a tight budget.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy it, but without much hope as I&#x27;ve bought countless skin products that have disappointed me.</li>
            <li> so I was pretty much resigned to terrible skin for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> -little coverage  </li>
            <li> This is a little bit out of my expectation.</li>
            <li> Well, after reading the reviews about this little BB cream, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> NOT fun!</li>
            <li> Believe me this little amount covers.</li>
            <li> My skin has gotten a little brighter as well</li>
            <li> Something just seems a little off.</li>
            <li> This cream goes on a little off color but then blends to my skin in moments.</li>
            <li> The SKIN79 product does seem to go a little farther, though.</li>
            <li> I find it a little heavier than I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a full coverup, but I prefer that because I don&#x27;t want anything too heavy.</li>
            <li> It does start out a little gray but blends well.</li>
            <li> but it works with a little ducting of poweder or the t-zone.</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble at the beginning trying to get the product out</li>
            <li> However, it is a little too heavy for me and caused me to break out.</li>
            <li> Also, this BB Cream needs to set for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Some reasons, I felt it was too heavy, too oily.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using Missha BB cream for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t comment on whether it helps wrinkles (maybe in another few years...).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a lot either just a few pea sizes</li>
            <li> I feel this is too heavy to wear.</li>
            <li> Searched and searched for a BB cream that would not look or feel to heavy for my skin type(oily).</li>
            <li> so after a few hours, I just blot the oil out with a paper absorbent towel.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use this everyday (i.e. to the office)</li>
            <li> and I wear it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I did not enjoy using this product at all, it felt heavy and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I realized it&#x27;s coming from across the Pacific, so I wasn&#x27;t too impatient.</li>
            <li> It was totally missing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one for unnatural heavy foundation</li>
            <li> and it is all messy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly really light -</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago.</li>
            <li> One of the few bb creams that doesn&#x27;t cause me to have break outs.</li>
            <li> I just find this product too sticky and heavy.</li>
            <li> after a few hours of it applied, my skin (oily skin type) starts to shine like no other!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So i got this product few days ago..</li>
            <li> The authenticity label is missing-</li>
            <li> It does not feel heavy and</li>
            <li> I just got it a few days ago in the mail</li>
            <li> It also made me break out in little irritation pimples which might have been due to how thick it is</li>
            <li> A little to pasty or thick than I compare with some other BB cream.</li>
            <li> A little heavy so a little dab will do ya!</li>
            <li> Recommend shade 21 even if you&#x27;re pale (13 is too washed out and will make anyone look like a ghost).</li>
            <li> the point that I looked sickly pale.</li>
            <li> pale</li>
            <li> However - about two weeks into using this product, I began to notice a few small pimples on my chin and jaw.</li>
            <li> I usually buy it from another website, and I probably will continue to buy it from there since this wasted my time.</li>
            <li> Delivery was about 2 weeks ahead of schedule &amp; they included a little freebie!</li>
            <li> pump needs a few pumps before it works!</li>
            <li> for some weird reason, i have just the opposite effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what to say about this product.</li>
            <li> To begin with, I don&#x27;t usually wear any makeup or foundation.</li>
            <li> It was about 6 months past</li>
            <li> but over time it made my skin a bit oilier than usual.  </li>
            <li> In the winter I stick with my usual No 21.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it will hold on in the dryer winter.</li>
            <li> The problems I have is smell, and it gave me two small pimples.</li>
            <li> I usually use a cream moisturize under it.</li>
            <li> Not those fake ones used for marketing approaches just because they have a big name!</li>
            <li> I apply this on my fingers (2 small pumps)</li>
            <li> I never liked heavy foundations and never wanted to use them.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this has happened to anyone else?</li>
            <li> Have been obsessed with trying different BB creams since I&#x27;ve heard of it this year.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s caused by this though.</li>
            <li> As others have commented, not much is needed and if you have a small blemish, another thin layer will suffice.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not entirely sure what to expect out of it.</li>
            <li> There are a number that demonstrate the various kinds of BB cream but still difficult to decide what works for me.  </li>
            <li> This is all I  wear now no more foundation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure about this.</li>
            <li> but it is very heavy.</li>
            <li> I heard about Missha BB cream but was a little skeptical since I tried some unknown brand of BB cream from a Korean supermarket a while ago</li>
            <li> This color is a little weird until I rub into my skin and it may be slightly too pale for me</li>
            <li> Have some small freckles and small dark spots from the sun - nothing dramatic though.</li>
            <li> but once it was on my face it gave me a very pale cast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m a very pale warm/olive toned person.</li>
            <li> I looked very pale with it on.  </li>
            <li> BUT THE TUBE IS NOT FULL  VERY SLOW SHIPPMENT</li>
            <li> provides way less coverage then implicated.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t hardly breathe because of the perfume.</li>
            <li> really hard.</li>
            <li> and I hardly need powder.</li>
            <li> It hardly looks like I have makeup on and it evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> for once, i didnt have to work hard on my foundation routine.</li>
            <li> I hardly used it</li>
            <li> At least when I wear it, it makes me look like a clay-zombie.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 but am told I look like I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The product was shipped from China, and after filing a complaint seller agreed to provide RMA number and return label.  </li>
            <li> On some people this will be a really negative thing for their skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 60s</li>
            <li> The product was way too thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> The texture is thick and creamy and I will sometimes put on another moisturizer on immediately before application in order to allow for smoother application of the BB Cream.</li>
            <li> it evens out skin tone but isn&#x27;t the slightest bit thick or cakey.  </li>
            <li> thick coverage</li>
            <li> and my wrinkles are slowly fading away.</li>
            <li> It is thick, yet it blends well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it did anything to my skin (probably because I&#x27;m horrible at telling differences), but after applying it for a while, I noticed my skin started to break out in tiny areas, especially on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Love the coverage but giving me bad acne and redness... :((</li>
            <li> Too dark and made me look weirdly gray faced</li>
            <li> It seriously is a MIRACLE CREAM.  </li>
            <li> The color has an odd gray cast to it which washed me out and created a weird tone to my face.</li>
            <li> The consistency is also extremely thick which made it both difficult to blend and made my skin feel heavy while wearing it.</li>
            <li> When a particularly bad breakout occurred recently, I decided to change my make-up and came across this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> this one i just now use on my neck and chest for the spf and blending, but definitely not as good as dr jarts.</li>
            <li> Not good at all</li>
            <li> It has a faint fragrance, but nothing too jarring--and definitely not as strong as Garnier&#x27;s BB cream.  </li>
            <li> so i only use this product on my face except my forehead :(</li>
            <li> Overall I am disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m utterly disappointed and honestly kinda distressed about how disgusting this makeup made my skin look.</li>
            <li> The cream was very thick</li>
            <li> I hate the Garnier (hardly any coverage, smelled icky, color had a weird pink undertone, consistency was watery).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s her &amp; her mom&#x27;s (my aunt&#x27;s) beauty secret.</li>
            <li> The tint covers my sun spots, blemishes, and broken capillaries.</li>
            <li> I have semi-sensitive skin, but nothing has broken me out like this</li>
            <li> For my allergy eyes (they do get tired looking), I use Maybelline Dream Lumi Touch Radiant Highlighting Concealer in Ivory.  </li>
            <li> The seller sold a false missha bb cream product with me being uptight having no idea</li>
            <li> I tried another high end CC cream that supposedly offered a 50 SPF, but got a terrible sunburn and returned to the Missha.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the new Olay BB (called CC) cream and was disgusted to learn from the clerk at the Beauty boutique that Olay just took a poorly selling BB product and placed a CC sticker over it.</li>
            <li> It went on dry and showed every line on my face!! :(</li>
            <li> If I can, I will post the photo I took of the two identical-appearing tubes with the makeup shades, so you can see how dramatic the difference is.</li>
            <li> A little too perfumy for my taste, but the smell isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I usually have at least one zit on my face which is really annoying.</li>
            <li> I have broken capillaries on my cheeks and have a difficult time covering them up with concealer and foundation.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll end up with a thick and artificial look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work out for me, but I&#x27;ll try it for a little longer to see if it was just a fluke?</li>
            <li> No more!!!</li>
            <li> Beware, fake products are out there</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not every expensive, why do people make/sell fake products).  </li>
            <li> I also found it to be a bit uncomfortable when placing it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am hooked and am a bit sad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely difficult finding foundation that can accommodate both these issues.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m unable to find a darker shade under Missha on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Having bought this from the website and in-store, I can confirm that this product is a fake.</li>
            <li> It has some weird &amp;#34;grey clay&amp;#34; look/color.</li>
            <li> My acne isn&#x27;t really horrible although I would call it moderate to severe.</li>
            <li> my skin is not perfect, i have blemishes from time to time, acne scarring</li>
            <li> Meanwhile this seller is selling fake products without the need to refund the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a bit obsessed with BB creams.</li>
            <li> Again, this is probably just because I got the wrong one for my skintone so this might not have an effect on you at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about things i buy online</li>
            <li> After googling Missha information on how to tell if it&#x27;s fake or not, I found the area for an expiration date and realized I received an expired BB cream.</li>
            <li> I purchased the wrong color but nonetheless, I&#x27;m giving this five stars.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t their fault that I bought the wrong color.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after a closer inspection of the label, it&#x27;s expired (date on it was 20130121)...</li>
            <li> I just chose the wrong color.</li>
            <li> but i got the wrong color.</li>
            <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE!</li>
            <li> Seriously, compared to this stuff, foundation is crap.</li>
            <li> , it looks greyish and kinda gives effect of dirty skin.</li>
            <li> The color tone was very wrong.</li>
            <li> BAD NEWS....</li>
            <li> And the price isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, she was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Tips: even though, BB creams are all in one products, always wear moisturizures (&#x3D;/-</li>
            <li> Lesson learned :(</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Boscia is water base</li>
            <li> If you wear some foundation, you can see that in your pore which I hate to see.</li>
            <li> I was planning to use it as a base, and then apply foundation over it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very shocked too to see the color is not well blended and could see the brown paste among beige.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTING!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It made my face oily and clogged my pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this BB cream every day for 2 months now. I use it as an extra moisturizer and primer before putting on my foundation. So far what I like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t make my face extra oily and it has SPF 42 so this becomes my sunblock now. I didn&#x27;t notice any whitening or improvement in fine lines.  I don&#x27;t think it did a good job in concealing my blemishes either. I think if you have a clear and blemish free skin you can skip the foundation. But not for me, I was hoping that I can use this alone but I still need to put on foundation after this as I don&#x27;t like the coverage. Also this doesn&#x27;t match my neutral skintone, it makes my face look greyish. I&#x27;m a NC 30-35 in Mac foundation.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews....but I have reordered this product MANY times for myself and friends. great SPF, great coverage, great blend...goes on grayish, but quickly oxidizes to PERFECT MATCH. LOVE, Love, love!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I have been using Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer for years, but I recently moved to a much more humid climate. LM constantly slid off my oily/combination skin, so I had to make the switch. After reading lots and lots of reviews, I ordered Missha&#x27;s BB Cream and I love it! The product stays in place, especially with a little primer and finishing powder. This can be layered for heavy coverage, but a single layer will cover redness, unevenness, and minor imperfections. Also, this BB Cream needs to set for a few minutes. It looks a little grey/silver when you put it on but that will go away shortly. Really happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Few months ago, after all the hype about BB cream, I bought Missha Perfect BB Cream #23, Etude House Precious Mineral BB Cream #13, and Skin 79 pink label BB Cream (Ebay seller in Korea).  Also bought Smash Box BB cream and tried many other American brands BB creams (Dior, Boscia, Too Face, Tarte).  I have combination, normal to oil skin, thus, make-up only lasts about 4 hours, even though I work indoor (I am a once-a-day make-up kindda girl). B/c of popularity of Missha, I used it first.  Some reasons, I felt it was too heavy, too oily.  Then I switched to Skin 79 and Etude House.  They all go on every smooth and easy to blend (I use stippling brush).  Skin 79 pink label only comes in 1 color and it&#x27;s sheer/light coverage.  It&#x27;s even out my skin but it does not cover capillary red spots or black spots due to acnes.  It lasts 4-5 hours.  Etude House Precious Mineral #13 is a bit light for me.  It is medium coverage.  However, I found that it&#x27;s a bit dry.  It makes me flaky around the nose area.  I decided to use Etude House as concealer.  Not the best but it works.  It also works when I mix Skin 79 and Etude House together.  Neither one of these products have any fragant to it.  Missha BB cream does have fragrant.  It smells like baby powder-ish.  It&#x27;s not bad (it eventually goes away after after few hours); however, I really don&#x27;t care for the smell.  Some people actually like the fragrant (on youtube). That was also one other reason I stopped using Missha.  After months, I decided to \\&quot;re-visit\\&quot; Missha BB cream again.  Still don&#x27;t care for the fragrant; however, it gives a medium coverage.  My skin is very clear except for the capillary red spots around the nose and occasional black acne spots.  So I don&#x27;t really need a \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; coverage (I used Laura Bare Mineral and Mercier tinted moisturizure for a long time).  However, with a bit of setting powder, Missha BB cream lasts almost all day.  Plus of Missha BB cream, high SPF (maybe that why it seems more oily).&lt;br /&gt;In summary, for medium coverage Missha (if you don&#x27;t mind the fragrant), Etude House (if you don&#x27;t have dry skin).  For light coverage, Skin 79.  Tips: even though, BB creams are all in one products, always wear moisturizures (&#x3D;/- additional sun block) and setting powder.  Even though, you can build for more coverage, but I&#x27;d not recommended b/c it will look very heavy.  Also, buy from a reputable Ebay sellers.  It is cheaper than amazon, around $11-13.  Beware, fake products are out there (I do not understand this either b/c it&#x27;s not every expensive, why do people make/sell fake products).  I suspect that these products are \\&quot;drug-store\\&quot; brands in Korea.  But since we can&#x27;t get our hands on, we are paying a bit more.  Next, I want to try Tony Molly CC cream.&lt;br /&gt;As for American brands, Smash Box is heavy, almost like foundation.  Dior BB creams are more of yellow tone and dark.  Tarte is too powdery for my liking.  Boscia is water base so it&#x27;s nice; however, it&#x27;s one shade and not recommended for darker than NC-35.  Too Face gives a dewy/sheer/natural look and good for yellow tone skin.&lt;br /&gt;Hope you will find a right products.</li>
            <li> The product was way too thick and greasy. It also did not match my skin tone. I also found it to be a bit uncomfortable when placing it on my skin.</li>
            <li> i ordered one in march last year, when i order another one in korea last week, i find out the one i bought in amazon is a fake one!!!</li>
            <li> I love the coverage and the natural look, it does not feel like having foundation on your face at all. The sunscreen is an added bonus!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the quickness &amp; smooth transaction and shipping. The product quality itself is very nice. It comes on sort of thick at first, but when you apply it to your face it does smoothe out and leave a nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I really like the consistency and coverage.  I use this as a tinted sunscreen after moisturizing and before putting a mineral powder on to finish.  I will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using Missha BB cream for a few weeks. We have brown skin and we used NO. 23 and it blends in with our complexion. For me, my big pores have been minimized and I have softer skin. For my daughter, she claims she has fewer pimples/spots on her forehead. Her skin is less oily now too.  We will continue using it to see if our skin improves more.</li>
            <li> If you see Korean girls near you, you can find most of them have really great skin. No akne, no hyperpigmentation, even tone, ect. But when I saw their bare skin, I thought that there were some seceret. One of my Korean friend recommended this product, and I started to use. This is the BEST foundation that I&#x27;ve ever used so far. Like the other reviewers, it coveraged well and very light in order to look natural. If you wear some foundation, you can see that in your pore which I hate to see. But this one is different! I used Dior Nude foundation, Channel Solid Foundation, Estee lauder Double wear, Armarni Foundation which costs almost twice(or three thimes)than this, but comparing to price this is the best one. I would like to use this forever!!    NOTE: IF you want to look more natural and shinny, you need to put missha BB Boomer before this. I highly recommended it!</li>
            <li> I love the make up really perfect for my skin tone... the shipment was really good... good quality.. till next transactions with you guys...</li>
            <li> I had heard about this product from various YouTube makeup gurus, and finally decided to try it earlier this year. It was my holy grail product of Spring/Summer 2011! This BB Cream (which I purchased in the darkest color) is easy to apply, long-lasting, a great sunscreen, and an overall fantastic product. I found that I could go for quite a while without reapplying, and it looked great even after sweat and salty air at the beach. 90°, 70°, it looked great all the time. I have problem skin, and the coverage is fantastic. It didn&#x27;t look clumpy or cakey, it kept a natural, dewey finish on my skin. It was the only makeup product I used on my face over the summer, besides the occasional concealer (when I didn&#x27;t want full makeup), and Maybelline&#x27;s \\&quot;FIT\\&quot; foundation (which was a MISTAKE for me personally). Writing this review and thinking about how good the product was makes me want to get another tube! The only thing that has been keeping me from using my current tube of the Perfect Cover is the fact that it is clearly too dark for my current winter skin. I need a shade lighter! :)  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product. Still getting used to it. Although it is lighter weight than makeup, it gives more coverage than light powder or tinted moisturizer and I&#x27;m still getting used to how even toned my skin is. I don&#x27;t have perfect skin either, so it really covers well. Less is best, I use less than a full pump when I apply and still get good coverage. I was also surprised how fragrant it is. A little too perfumy for my taste, but the smell isn&#x27;t bad. I also have dry skin and usually have to moisturize in layers, but with this product I only need it. Maybe a little extra moisturizer before I apply on really dry days. My color tends to range in the Fair to Light, depending on the time of the year and how much sun I get. Some of the comments said the color was on the light side and to order up, but I found the #23 too dark and am going to order the #21. I didn&#x27;t notice the ashy hue that some people did, but maybe because I&#x27;m not using as much product as recommended so more of my skin tone comes through. Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought the Missha B.B. Cream because of all the good reviews given to this product and how Korean actresses used this product to perfect their skin. I bought it and loved it the first time I tried it. It&#x27;s almost like a tinted moisturizer, but better. It gives great coverage, especially for those with acne-prone skin like mine, who are looking for a lightweight product, but yet still gives great coverage. The coverage is definitely buildable as I use this as a concealer and foundation. It hasn&#x27;t made me break out which is a plus. The only thing that&#x27;s a bit iffy is that it does oxidize a bit throughout the day, meaning that it changes color and can sweat off, but this is no longer a problem for me as I set it with a light dusting of powder. The changing of color is also not big of a problem because I have it in shade #23 which is still a bit too light for me, but it&#x27;s perfect as the day goes on. Overall, a great B.B. cream to try for the price and definitely will repurchase.</li>
            <li> when i first put this on, i didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference. yes, it&#x27;s lighter than my regular foundation. however, it wasn&#x27;t until a week into this routine that i noticed much difference. the coverage isn&#x27;t great. i have gto use concealer still. the smell is bearable. my forehead gets shiny before the end of the day and bb cream doesn&#x27;t really help this. it was kind of a disappointment after reading all the raves about this. the good thing is that you only need a small amount, which means my little 20ml bottle will last me a while. however, i would search other products before coming back to missha.</li>
            <li> Missha M Perfect Cover BB Cream is just what it says, perfect cover. I also bought the Super Plush Balm Triple Functions and find I like this one better. Although, both are fine. This one seems to cover the imperfections better such as discolorations. For wrinkles it covers the fine lines well. I use moisturizer underneath as my skin is on the dry side. I like the fact that it comes in a tube you can squeeze and do not have to contaminate it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I will definitely repurchase this product.It works best if you are looking for a foundation with light coverage. I&#x27;ve used this product for almost a year now, and I can see the changes in my complexion. My skin is brighter and more even now. Also, a plus is that I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting on sunscreen on my face anymore. Like other reviewers, I agree that this product does not have a wide range of options for everyone&#x27;s skin tone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit on the oily side.  I have dry skin, so it works fine with me.  If you have oily skin, I wouldn&#x27;t use this!  I would only apply this with a brush to get the even color tone.    I am tan, got yellow undertone.  This product brighten my skin and gives pretty good coverage for my minor acne scars.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says it is! pump needs a few pumps before it works!</li>
            <li> Missha&#x27;s Perfect Cover BB cream is the only thing that I&#x27;ll use for foundation.  It seriously is a MIRACLE CREAM.  It definitely decreases the appearance of pores, and I am always complimented on how flawless my skin is... even when it isn&#x27;t so flawless underneath.  It&#x27;s on par with what professionals use, but at a fraction of the price.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this B.B cream for a long time and still this brand is the best! The color is not too bright like other product which makes me look like wearing a ghost mask. Plus, smell is pretty good. Honestly, I got so sensitive skin that I can&#x27;t normally put on anything over my face but this is the only product I can wear 24/7...It even makes my facial skin smoother! And also, I checked the manufacture date in case they got me the expired one from Korea.(I&#x27;m a picky online shopper!) It&#x27;s 4/22/2011. Great! &#x3D;) However, I took off a star just because of the box was kind of opened and damaged...Hope they double check before shipping from now... Other than that, it&#x27;s a very good product I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended! I decided to give this a try because my old foundation (Estee Lauder Double Wear) was too dry for me, especially in the winter season. I had bad experiences with BB creams in the past (mostly that they seem to be for people with ghostly white skin), but I saw that Missha&#x27;s BB cream came in a slightly darker shade. Since it was pretty cheap (&lt;$20), I gave it a try... I love it!! Matches my skin color well, isn&#x27;t too drying but doesn&#x27;t leave an oily finish, reduces the look of fine lines, reduced the appearance of my acne scars (even just after a week of use!!) - basically, it does everything it says it does. I am hooked and am a bit sad I didn&#x27;t find this earlier.</li>
            <li> This BB cream gives me good and natural coverage and its great for my skin! It doesn&#x27;t make me breakout like with other foundations and it covers up my blemishes. I kind of have light tan skin with yellow undertones and so I decided to try the NO 23 color because I thought the NO 21 would be to light for me.   This bb cream appears to be a greyish tan color at first but once you apply it on your face and smooth it out, it actually has some pretty nice coverage! I only use a little bit, like one tiny fingertip size and that&#x27;s enough to cover my whole face. Sometimes, I just dab it on blemishes and thats all I need!   It kinda smells like baby powder/ foundation.</li>
            <li> As far as the seller is concerned, they were awesome (and I loved the pink package!), the product came wrapped in bubble wrap and right within the time they said. As for the product, I am IN LOVE! IN LOVE I SAY!! Seriously, compared to this stuff, foundation is crap. I&#x27;ve never found a product that has matched my skin so well, and still offered this great of coverage. I have some old acne marks that I have to cover up, and it does a wonderful job without looking like I&#x27;m wearing makeup at all, it&#x27;s incredible! The product says it&#x27;s supposed to be healthy for the skin, and I definitely believe it, my skin hasn&#x27;t reacted to the bb cream at all, and I love that the ingredients are natural and gentle (I&#x27;m definitely not up for putting formaldahyde on my face, which can actually be found in lots of foundations...eww). Now, it&#x27;s hard for me to say whether this product is delivering results as far as whitening and anti-aging, as I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet and I&#x27;m using a couple of products that could also contribute to the skin brightening process, but it hasn&#x27;t hurt! Especially since it has sunscreen built in (with my combination skin, it&#x27;s hard to find a good sunscreen that won&#x27;t make me shiny or oily.) I loveeeee ^^ Seriously, I&#x27;m never buying foundation again, bb creams have changed me ^^</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t bother to write reviews for products, but this one I simply could not pass up. I have combination skin that gets really dry and really oily in some parts. This means I usually have dry flaky skin on my cheek area, and acne on my forehead. It&#x27;s extremely difficult finding foundation that can accommodate both these issues. I&#x27;ve tried a whole range of types of foundation, from compact foundation to liquid, from mineral to tinted moisturizers. Always the same problems: my forehead and nose would be oily by the end of the day, and I would regularly get acne. When I heard about BB creams, I was intrigued.     This was the first BB cream I ever bought and I don&#x27;t plan on changing anytime soon. The coverage is amazing and the consistency is perfect for blending. This product will last you a very long time because you need very little to cover the problem areas. The cream really brightens up the dark circles under my eyes. I no longer have issues finding a good coverup because this BB cream IS my coverup (and my foundation!). I no longer have oily skin at the end of the day, and my complexion has evened out considerably. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my complexion and skin (which was entirely unheard of 6 months ago when I started using this)! I am able to use less and less over time because my skin really is getting that much better.    If I sound like I&#x27;m raving, it&#x27;s because I really do feel that strongly about this product.     One last note, I have medium toned Asian skin color, and the No.23 suits my skin well, especially once it oxidizes. I think the No.21 would be too light for me but I honestly haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li> Ive only been using this product a few weeks after reading reviews about it. Wow my forty eight year old skin looks amazing..It seems to not only look better with this on it but without makeup my skin is glowing. It seems as if Ive lost ten years somewhere along the line with this stuff. I shouldnt even say nice things about it. The more people that buy it the more it might drive up the price. But people with problem skin or old tired out looking skin really should know about this and give it a try.</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup. Love it!</li>
            <li> -waterproof  -perfect cover my pores  -can be used in either summer or winter. moisturized in summer and not dry at all in winter!  -easily to put up!!!can be applied to the whole face evenly and easily!  -the best fundamental cream among all I used  -easily to  remove. not pore-clogged  -my pores gradually become invisible after using it as make-up foundation for almost two years!!! AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Everyone should make sure this is authentic bb cream. On the Missha website these go for about $30 and when there&#x27;s a sale, it&#x27;s about $22-23...just a heads up! :]</li>
            <li> I use a different one before, but this is one is Amazing! I used it after I received it, and my skin become perfect, It covered my acne scars, and I look brighter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie so when I found out about BB Cream, of course I had to try it.  I&#x27;m Asian and I wasn&#x27;t sure which color to get but settled on the darker of the two.  I think I made the right choice.  I love that this cream has a lot of things we women look for:  anti-wrinkle, spf, acne treatment, etc.  What I love about it is how it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have anything on.  I use it like a tinted moisturizer and even wear it to the gym.  I also like the fact that you can layer it on to give more coverage.  It says you don&#x27;t need concealer but I do use one for my eyes.  After using Armani, Bobbi Brown and Laura Mercier for a long time, I think I&#x27;m a fan of BB Cream and will stay so.  I also love the price point.  Compared to my Armani, I can get 3 tubes of the BB Cream for the same price.  Definitely try it out.  Although the color limitation will be a bummer for some.  Hopefully, they will come out w/ more color choices.</li>
            <li> Goodness, I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t use this product even earlier! This amazingly light weighted foundation (BB Cream) is fabulous! It&#x27;s light, but still has medium coverage, and it hasn&#x27;t broke me out yet which is great. Some people might be bothered by smell if you are very sensitive, but I like the smell :) Kinda like rose-ish smell adds feminine sense to it...! It&#x27;s not designed for all day wear, so if you have oily skin or combination skin like I do, use powder with it. I&#x27;m definitely purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I got this BB cream today. On the top back of the container, there is a date reading \\&quot;2011 03 03\\&quot;. Can you tell me what that means? I hope it&#x27;s not the expiration date, otherwise, it&#x27;s already EIGHT months ago!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try a BB cream for a while now and after doing alot of online research I decided to try the Missha M Perfect BB cream.  A couple reasons I chose this one, 1. it had mostly good reviews, 2. I read in another review that the No. 23 was good for someone who was a MAC NC 25.  I am an NC 30, so I decided to try it.  Most of the other BB creams I looked at did not have many color options and most people that reviewed them were very fair.  I got this BB cream and immediately loved it.  As soon as I put it on I thought it looked great as is.  I was planning to use it as a base, and then apply foundation over it but I don&#x27;t have too.  It is more coverage than other tinted moisturizers I have tried but lighter than a full face of foundation (which in summer can get messy).  So now I am using this and layering it with powder.  I couple times I have stippled some foundation over the BB cream to give it more coverage. The color has been good for me, I think there is some lee-way with it so if you are in the NC25-35 range I think it would work.  FYI, I have oily skin and while it isn&#x27;t extremely mattifying it certainly doesn&#x27;t exacerbate the oiliness during the day.  Overall, so glad I bought it and will probably order again unless I happen to come across one that convinces me it is better.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Missha BB Cream in number 23. THIS IS NOT THE REAL PRODUCT.!! I have been using Missha bb cream for over a year now and ran out. Decided to order some from amazon with this seller. Figured I could get a discount versus buying it for the original price at $30 realizing it being the holidays and I have a tight budget.  First thing I noticed was the that the cosmetic bottle was bloated. You could then twist off the cap. You cannot do that with the original bottle! The bb cream was way lighter than the original #23. The smell was too fragrant versus the original! I know this because I am using the authentic one (which I had bought from Misshaus.com website) and compared it..   The seller sold a false missha bb cream product with me being uptight having no idea what the hell the seller has decided to throw inside the bottle. Very disappointing. If you are planning to order from here please be aware or do not order any at all would be my advice!!  VERY DISAPPOINTING!</li>
            <li> First off, i don&#x27;t lower product ratings because of things like late shipping and ect.  the product, i love it. it doesn&#x27;t have a perfect coverage so some marks will show but i still love it. it doesn&#x27;t feel or look like im wearing any make up. its not itchy, cakey, and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin. i honestly love it.  BUT the seller, I DO NOT LIKE. it took my order NINE days to get here whi;e others said it was very quick for them. and second, the BB cream&#x27;s pump doesn&#x27;t work. im pretty pissed off. i don&#x27;t really feel like sending it back and getting a new since i love it and don&#x27;t feel like waiting another week for it to get here and ect. so i&#x27;ll keep it and see if i&#x27;ll ever order from this seller again...  anyways, product&#x3D; AMAZING  seller&#x3D; \\&quot;/</li>
            <li> Came very quick; in about 15 days! all the way from Korea~ coverage is very good, it suits my skin type well. When you first apply it, make sure you dont put on moisturizer otherwise it gets too... well i suppose \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; is a good word. you dont really need powder unless you sweat a lot. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Saw all the good reviews and had to try this.  I have medium, yellowish asian skin and this is a very light beige color and because of the high spf, dries my skin. I use it now for the tops of my hands, and it&#x27;s very waterproof. When I wash my hands the water beads and rolls off my skin!  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Light and dewey look.  I need to order a different  shade for better coverage however for my asian skin tone.  Ordered medium, should have gone a shade darker.  Will do that next time.</li>
            <li> My aunt introduced me to BB cream about two years ago with this bottle/tube, and I have not gone back to regular foundation ever since. The coverage is excellent, and you can also use this as concealer. It stays very fresh looking all day and doesn&#x27;t cake up; in fact it looks quite natural because it is so moisturised. And because it&#x27;s relatively thick, you only need to use a little bit and one tube goes a long way (I still haven&#x27;t finished it, and I use it almost every day).  When I used to have acne, this product was really good at covering it up, and it did not block pores or make me break out. However, I found it didn&#x27;t control oil that much - I still get oily on my nose - but that&#x27;s a minor point when the overall coverage is so smooth and even. This #23 shade comes out lighter than my natural tone at first but it blends in perfectly after a few minutes.  I have light skin so I did not notice if the cream was whitening or not. I also can&#x27;t comment on whether it helps wrinkles (maybe in another few years...). I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Got the BB cream in two shades, No.21 and No.23. I&#x27;m a Mac NC25, MUF #5 and the No.23 is perfect shade to go on but does get darker over time. No.21 is a bit white when first applied, but when oxidized it&#x27;s matching perfectly.</li>
            <li> First time using a BB Cream and ordering from Seouleglamour.  I really like this BB Cream!  Have not tried any other brands. But, do not need to.  Missha M Perfect cover BB cream No.23 blends into my skin naturally, covers scars and pores, and most importantly, does not make me break out or clog my pores.  So, I will keep buying this product.  I just need to find a good setting powder to use on top of it.  I will keep purchasing it from Seouleglamour.  The shipping and service was great!</li>
            <li> I love, love love this cream! My skin type is combination/oily, and it&#x27;s prone to breakouts every now and then. When a particularly bad breakout occurred recently, I decided to change my make-up and came across this on Amazon.  Saw the reviews and decided to give it a try. When I first applied it, the shade appeared a little too light (I purchased the darker 23 shade), but it took only a few minutes to oxidize on my skin, and after it did, it looked really natural, like I didn&#x27;t have much make-up on. I set it with a little loose powder because it gets shiny if I don&#x27;t. There is a very light scent that comes with it, which I don&#x27;t much care for, but it goes away quickly.  True to its name, it provides good coverage, something that I always look for in a foundation. Even with my loose powder on, it provides a dewy finish which isn&#x27;t greasy to the touch...a big plus in my book. With this, I save time in the mornings before work. All I do now is apply serum under it, when before, I had to apply moisturizer and sunblock before finally finishing with foundation. I also dislike the heavily made-up look, so this cream is perfect for me. It feels light on my skin, and hasn&#x27;t seemed to cause any irritation to my usually sensitive skin.  Just prior to this, I was using a drugstore brand which for some reason became flaky after I topped it off with loose powder, but not with this bb cream. I&#x27;d recommend this, would be even better if they came in more variety of shades to cater to a bigger market of consumers.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly well. I was worried that the color would be wrong for my skin tone because although I have light skin, I am olive toned. When I got it, I was no less worried. The color of the product was sort of grayish when I put it onto my skin. However, after about 5 min, it looks entirely natural. It has definitely improved the look of my skin because it is moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I wouldn&#x27;t say it works miracles, but I have gotten so many compliments on my face saying that I look naturally radiant. The product is light but provides enough coverage that I don&#x27;t have to use anything but it and some powder. It&#x27;s perfect for every day makeup!</li>
            <li> I got the product and tried it.  I liked it the first day, then on second day, I want to use it again, somehow, I could not get anything out of the tube. Apparently, the tube was stuck or mis-functioned.  I tried all sorts of ways to squeeze (even tried to unblock it with a needle, there was just no cream coming out of the tube.  I am trying to return the product to Pink Gelee that&#x27;s where I got it from.  Hopefully, they would let me returned and get my money back</li>
            <li> Well, I have mixed feelings about this product.  First off is the color..when you 1st put it on, the color is totally off. I don&#x27;t think anyone is of this color.  It comes off greyish and i don&#x27;t know anyone that has a greyish complexion. Although, it does blend in somewhat after 30min - 1 hr. 2nd is the texture..I am reading the other reviews that said this this product is very moisturizing and looks dewey. for some weird reason, i have just the opposite effect. When you apply it, it goes on easily but as it gets absored into the skin, it becomes harder to work into the skin as it becomes matt/powderly like. I end up having to put on alot of moisturizer before i use thsi product just so i can blend it in. I also find that if I don&#x27;t use moisturizer with extra around my eyes before using this product, the matte/powerdery effect emphasizes the lines under my eyes....I think this product is good for spot coverage insteaed of entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an update to my review...&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s been about 2 weeks since i&#x27;ve had this product. I wasn&#x27;t using it every day, maybe every other day. BAD NEWS....I started breaking out and getting pimples. I haven&#x27;t had a breakout in 1-2 years!  Perhaps my skin was not use to having a liquid smeared on it since i&#x27;ve been using bare escential for about 8 yeras. or maybe it&#x27;s due to the estee lauder idealist pore minimizer that i started using at around the same time as the bb cream. Eitherway, i have stopped the use of all these products to give me skin a break and to allow it to heal. I will reintroduce the bb cream again later and see if i break out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another update...It is  now Sept. 2011 and I just simply LOVE LOVE this product.  Yes, when you first put it on, it gives you a mask of a strange color. However, after the \\&quot;oxidation\\&quot;, the color blends into your natural skin tone and, at least for me, it is a perfect and natural match.  Also, i was never a sun screen wearer but with this product, it kills 2 birds with 1 stone...great coverage + SPF 42 protection!  This is product has now become part of my daily routine and a tiny amount goes a long way... And no break outs!!  So now, i am revising my rating from 3 to 5!coverage + SPF 42 protection!  This is product has now become part of my daily routine and a tiny amount goes a long way... And no break outs!!  So now, i am revising my rating from 3 to 5!</li>
            <li> I absolutely swear by this stuff. Not only is it cost efficient, but it works amazingly. It covers most blemishes perfectly, almost so well that I feel as though I could go without concealer and foundation (coming from someone who has dark acne scars). I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great coverage. It has some odor but I love this product! Great service and fast shipping. :)  It&#x27;s a product that is well worth it&#x27;s price and I&#x27;m glad I ordered!</li>
            <li> Love the coverage but giving me bad acne and redness... :((</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too &#x27;&#x27;heavy&#x27;&#x27; and too dark for my skin. I don&#x27;t really like this shade, it looks greyish and kinda gives effect of dirty skin. Maybe if I had chosen lighter shade it would look much better on my face. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shade for ladies who have fair skin. The good thing is that you need very little amount of it and it gives your skin a good coverage.</li>
            <li> Love this BB cream.... the real deal not fake American copies... Does wonders for my skin, love love this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first BB cream. I absolutely love this product. It works like a foundation but it&#x27;s actually a skin care product. It&#x27;s greyish when you first apply it, shortly after it matches my skin tone perfectly. I&#x27;m NC25 and the color of this product on me is just perfect. It does not settle in fine line and it makes skin look very soft and smooth. The best thing is that it has SPF in it which is why I initially wanted to try BB cream. I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;ll be my favorite for the summer.</li>
            <li> i bought the number 23 in hopes that once it oxidized that i would suit my shade (i have a medium-olived tone skin, ie bare mineral golden medium, MUFE 123)and it was still too light for me. i bought the number 31 in another site and that was too dark. it was more of a tan shade. bummer because i love the texture and coverage it provided without the need of wearing foundation to school.</li>
            <li> good for fast whiteing &amp; cover , this will make your skin 2 shades light,   i would say this is medium cover.  note: use moisturizer with (optional:primer) for best results</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this BB cream. It&#x27;s one of the only products I run out of and buy again. This is my third tube, and I love it just as much as I did the first time I bought it. It blends and builds nicely, gives my skin an amazing glow, and I appreciate that it has such high SPF, as I am a fair-skinned redhead. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again (and again)!</li>
            <li> Great BB Cream! I ordered a lot for my mom as well because she loves that the SPF is so high! I also like that, and noticed that my acne has subsided ever since I&#x27;ve used this BB cream. The only down side is I am getting darker, so the cream doesn&#x27;t completely match my skin color. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m unable to find a darker shade under Missha on Amazon. Still a great buy, and the coverage is fairly good (but will not hide everything)!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what to say about this product. Um, I have dry flaky forehead but oily nose. and then normal cheeks. this bb cream covers well on my normal and oily skin area...but for my forehead i find it actually accentuates the flakiness on my acne...and scars. so i decided to use my favorite moisturizer First Aid beauty and then applied this bb&lt;br /&gt;cream after...guess what? the freaking bb cream slipped off. i was blending it into my skin and it came off like eraser shavings, just smearing off.&lt;br /&gt;I thought the problem was because i didn&#x27;t let my moisturizer fully absorb. so i tried again the next day...and waited this time.but same thing happened.&lt;br /&gt;I tried a different moisturizer this time, a day CREAm so it was less oily but everything was in vain. I recommend this cream for kinda dry to normal and oily skin, but&lt;br /&gt;definitely not pretty dry skin because it WILL dry and accentuate your flaky skin! it&#x27;s terrible! but for normal to oily skin, i think it works great. Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;dewy glow. so i only use this product on my face except my forehead :(</li>
            <li> The cream is really good,has a good texture,smell and lovely covering effect,makes your skin soft and natural but the problem is that i picked the wrong color..i bought number 23 natural beige and it was too dark for my skin,i&#x27;m a Mediterranean girl with not so white skin but this cream made my skin darker so i&#x27;m gonna try lighter shades.&lt;br /&gt;it arrived two weeks earlier than expected and was perfectly wrapped.</li>
            <li> To begin with, I don&#x27;t usually wear any makeup or foundation. I have dry to normal skin, and I don&#x27;t have many pimples either. I am Asian, and my skin isn&#x27;t very pale but I am not super tan either so the No. 23 worked perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really pleased with this product because it has so many benefits. It is a moisturizer, it has SPF, and it evens out my skin tone since my jaw is slightly pink. It has anti aging benefits as well and prevents acne but I can&#x27;t say that it works for me since I am 17 and I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles or anything along those lines yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great too. It&#x27;s hard to explain since it isn&#x27;t like a floral scent; it just smells like a rich cream. When I apply it to my face, it mixes perfectly with my skin tone. I don&#x27;t need a lot either just a few pea sizes and it covers my entire face. Also it feels great; it isn&#x27;t thick or heavy, it just feels light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product. I can&#x27;t say it reduces acne or dark spots as I have none. But if you are buying this product as a moisturizer, for SPF, and a light foundation that really covers your skin well, then this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;And price wise it isn&#x27;t much. When I first heard about BB cream I thought it was going to be expensive but $18 isn&#x27;t&#x27; much at all if you take into account all that is inside the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is the best product I have bought to date.</li>
            <li> It is amazing product.  It covers my pores really good, but not the dark circle eyes.  My coworker even said my skin is so good, and she didn&#x27;t know anything about bb cream.</li>
            <li> this bbcream was not real. the color and the feel of mterial is completely different from the one i bought at the department store in korea. I&#x27;m very shocked too to see the color is not well blended and could see the brown paste among beige. Also the smell is different from the real one. i&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Provides good coverage without looking cakey.  Matches my blonde hair, light skin complexion nicely, and blends great.  Does not irritate my skin- No rashes, no breakouts...I have reordered once already and will continue to get more!</li>
            <li> I been doing research on BB cream for a while and this one met the needs. I know the color selections are limited but the one thing I found out that BB cream sort of oxide to match the skin color like the Almay foundations. The reason I puchase this to help improve my skin, I have acne prone skin and the medication I put on dries my skin. This BB cream add the moisture back since it contains jojoba oil which will not clog pores and I have not broke out from it since using it. Its hygienic, smell great, and I will defiantly purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li> This should have been my correct shade of BB cream. The initial color matched great but once it was on my face it gave me a very pale cast. I do like the texture off the cream so will be trying in a different shade.</li>
            <li> I have spent an embarrassing amount of money on foundations in the past. I&#x27;ve tried all the major high-end brands, some drug store brands and I&#x27;ve never found a tinted moisturizer or foundation that seemed to work with my combination skin. But, this Missha BB Cream in #23 has made a devout follower of me. I apply it with my foundation brush to my entire face. It brightens my eyelids, covers the light circles under my eyes, and smooths and evens my skin. It stays on all day, blends to the perfect color once oxidized, and keeps my oily parts matte and my dry parts moisturized. I couldn&#x27;t love it more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every bb cream out there and for me this is the holy grail.  First of all, the color is a perfect match.  It&#x27;s similar to the cho bo yang (missha) cream in cool beige but I find this  more moisturizing.  It&#x27;s a tinted moisturizer on steroids.  The perfect kind of foundation--natural but with great coverage.</li>
            <li> Having bought this from the website and in-store, I can confirm that this product is a fake. The actual product is lighter in body, and more moisturizing, with a dewey finish. Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, buy the real thing.</li>
            <li> It has some weird &amp;#34;grey clay&amp;#34; look/color. At least when I wear it, it makes me look like a clay-zombie.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a true light olive skin toned (Korean/Caucasian) who has struggled to find a medium to full coverage foundation base to cover my acne marks and skin discolorations.  After doing extensive research and pouring over multiple reviews of this product I ordered both this and the Missha M Signature Real Complete BB Cream No. 23.  While the other is lighter and thinner (great for summer time), I like this product for not only matching my yellow undertones during the winter months, but also it&#x27;s nice to sometimes wear something with a matte finish.  (Since I do tan easily in the summer months, I have found the other BB cream to be a better match color wise when my skin darkens.)  The product does not look dry after application and the high SPF is a great bonus as I am using multiple topical medications and must be very cautious with my sun exposure.  It provides a much fuller coverage than my other BB cream, but I just use less when necessary (opting for 1/2 a pump rather than a full pump.)  I have already ordered my second bottle to ensure I do not run out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried another BB by Missha and it was good, but this one is better. A better texture and a smoother cover.</li>
            <li> Lovely product, gave me great converge.  Over time the BB cream does match your skin tone (about one hour) but i find that the \\&quot;natural beige\\&quot; isn&#x27;t the right match for my Caucasian skin. Will buy the No. 21 next time!</li>
            <li> Works as described. Met my wife&#x27;s expectation and I love the way she looks when she does the make up.</li>
            <li> Alrighty!! Thx to the seller she got my msg. and reply back right away!! Very nice service there!! So yep I got the product about 3days ago and I did tried it. It works great! Although the coverage its not work very well but it did makes my face look more better and this product is smell nice I actually couldn&#x27;t even bear a sunscreen that has SPF30 (my skin its just way too sensitive) But when I put this on it doesn&#x27;t feel anything and it with SPF42 which is way stronger than my regular sunscreen lol And yet my face feel just great. I SO in love with this product!!</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  Everyone comments that my skin looks great - very even toned.  It&#x27;s light and blends in easily.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be able to go without BB cream now.</li>
            <li> This makeup has lasted me a long time, it works better than any other BB cream I have tried yet( I am an avid sephora &amp; ulta shopper). I will re order for sure. The color is perfect for my skin tone, and the matte finish is exactly what I look for. Currently My skin tone is fairly light in Bare minerals matte foundation.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four stars was because it took forever and a day later to come in!! But it I absolutely love this bb cream it&#x27;s moisturizing and I have dry and oily skin and seems to soothe that for me. It has a medium coverage but still I do need concealer though but I can deal with that!!</li>
            <li> This is similar quality as the Light Beige.  I use this for a slightly more colourful base. It suits my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was interested to see a Korean documentary about a shopping center in Seoul. There was a very nice view of the Missha store in the main area and it looked very modern and chic.  I was quite surprised when my order arrived by airmail and it took two days from Seoul S.Korea.</li>
            <li> Just some background on my skin tone and products I&#x27;m comparing this BB cream to ...  I&#x27;m asian with fairly light skin tone in my early 30&#x27;s. My favorite coverage is shisheido compressed powder #21 (which is now discontinued - hence i&#x27;m trying out different products). I love the shisheido compressed power because it had really great coverage, great match to my complexion, and priced reasonably.  I&#x27;ve also tried several drugstore and department store powders and foundation - but I havent found one that is reasonably priced, provides great coverage, fairly good match to my skin tone, last thru most of the day, great packaging, feels good on my skin (doesnt make it oily or dry - I have combination skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit this is the first BB cream I ever purchased/tried.  I&#x27;ve purchased three of these now.  My first one was #21.  My first impression was wow!  I can&#x27;t believe how cheap this product is for the coverage that it provides.  It lasted thru most of the day (unlike my powder) and it hid all my imperfections (little freckles on my cheeks).  I use a beauty blender (pink egg sponge) to apply this and it goes on really well.  I really like the packaging - how it&#x27;s in a pump and not exposed to air (that&#x27;s a must for any product that I put on my face) - serum, moisturizer, foundation, etc. I read somewhere it preseves it and doesn&#x27;t contaminate the remaining product with germs.  After using #21 for while, I started realizing how grayish yellow/brown it is and after seeing a few pictures of myself, it doesn&#x27;t really match my neck very well.  I started applying this to my neck as welll to smooth out the look.  Besides the color match, I loved this product so I decided to purchase a #23 (darker shade).  It&#x27;s a better match to my skin tone but it still has a bit of a grayish tone to it.  But since I like the product so much, I just apply my shisheido power over it  (which is use sparingly since the reserves are running low) and it gives a very natural looking finish.  It&#x27;s better than a concealer (prior to this my favorite concealer was eve pearl - salmon) - which has a tendancy to dry out my skin.  I still use a moisturizer under it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if they can just improve on the color match - I would have given them 5 star.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the type of girls that could spend an hour in morning putting on the make up.  I need something quick, easy to apply and make me look natural.  This cream meets these expectations.  Every morning I just put on a moisturizer and then this cream and off I go.  It makes my skin look almost flawless and natural.  It stays almost the whole day too so that is another plus.  I will give it 5 stars if it erases my wrinkles as it claims.  So far I haven&#x27;t noticed this effect yet and I have been using it for 2 months.  Nevertheless, I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I think is a good product with a good coverage for a BB Cream, it will last all day long in my combination skin. After a few hours it looks a little shine but not really bad. People said my skin looks very glowing. This color is perfect for my complexion, it&#x27;s seems a little grayish when you first applying but it blends very well.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this BB cream when I first started using it. It oxidized perfectly to my skintone and had a nice, build-able coverage. However - about two weeks into using this product, I began to notice a few small pimples on my chin and jaw. Not a big deal, I thought, since it was that time of the month. However, after a couple weeks more had passed, I noticed that there were even more pimples and they were getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so you know - I&#x27;ve always had really good, clear skin; a bit dry, if anything, and I have never (even throughout puberty) experienced a bad breakout. However, this BB cream caused me to have the worst breakout of my life. I stopped using it, and surely enough, the pimples stopped forming. I&#x27;m still trying to get my skin back into decent shape. I&#x27;m utterly disappointed and honestly kinda distressed about how disgusting this makeup made my skin look. I would not and will never recommend this product to anyone else.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I use it as my foundation and it has great coverage! I have even seen an improvement in my skin. Also seems to control oil which is awesome! This was a great purchase!</li>
            <li> The product provides great coverage and stays on despite my having a very oily T-zone. It&#x27;s thicker and more matte than other BB creams I&#x27;ve tried so I guess that&#x27;s why it works with my skin type. I only wish they had a more yellow-based color - but that seems to be a universal issue with make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as I don&#x27;t breakout, I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;ve found my BB cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Seoulglamour is fantastic too... Delivery was about 2 weeks ahead of schedule &amp; they included a little freebie! (^-^)</li>
            <li> I bought this on the Missha website just because everyone online was raving about how GREAT it is. Well, i tryed it and it DID NOT CHANGE MY LIFE.   Pros  -the skin colors offered are pretty natural  -neat bottle  Cons  -i found the particles of this foundation were a too big. After i put it on, i could see the particles. And yes, i primed my face.  -little coverage  Save your money and please buy a real foundation, like make up forever. Don&#x27;t believe the hype!!! Its not the holy grail people claim it to be! If you must know, get it for yourself, but i warned you. You won&#x27;t be impressed.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream. I use it under a moisturizer.  I can tell my skin looks much nicer. My sister noticed the difference in my skin and wanted me to order her one too.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my wife.  It is very effective.  It blends with her skin tone. So we highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Have been using this cream for over 2 years now, and finally decided to submit a review.  It goes on as easy as sunscreen and offers just the right amount of coverage for me.  Doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy and I love that it has the high SPF.  For the price, I don&#x27;t think you can do better for a BB cream.</li>
            <li> I love it! You only need a pea size drop on your hand to cover your whole face. I really like it because it covers all of my blemishes in pictures and the fact that it has sunblock protection in it too. Definitely recommend it! C:</li>
            <li> I am all about BB creams and haven&#x27;t really used one I don&#x27;t like, but this one is tops for me.  It is a bit ashy when you put it on, but it goes on very smooth and offers surprising coverage and blends wonderfully.  I have combination skin, and occasionally suffer from rosacea that flares up during allergy season.  I sometimes have redness of my face and dark circles under my eyes... This has never irritated my skin, and gives me a bit of a dewey look for the first couple of hours after application.  It camouflages a lot of my redness- usually I put on a light moisturizer after cleansing, let it sit for a half hour, and then dab and blend MISSHA.  I touch up lightly with some mineral powder (Lancôme is my fave) and some bronzer.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is important to bear in mind that it is only medium-light coverage due to the fact that it is labeled \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; not necessarily foundation. So basically it makes your good-looking skin look great, and your blemishes only somewhat covered, so when I use it I often still have to use cover-up and powder. I like the fact that it includes sunscreen. I do feel like after long-term use it has really balanced out my skin and helped to heal any scars/dark spots. The texture is thick and creamy and I will sometimes put on another moisturizer on immediately before application in order to allow for smoother application of the BB Cream. The coloring is a bit strange at first (as everyone says, rather grey) but once I rub it in and some time passes it looks completely natural (for your average white girl). Sometimes my nose and forhead are a bit oily so I use a bit of powder, but often I just put on BB Cream and I&#x27;m ready to face the day. Since it is a moisturizer, it has been great for my combination skin; not too oily for the oily bits and greatly helping out the dry spots. I also like the scent, which is pleasant and not too strong. I don&#x27;t even use a full pump for my face, so I&#x27;ve been using it for at least six months and it shows no immediate signs of running out. If only I had it earlier!</li>
            <li> Covers well. The cream looks dark coming out from its container, but blends in nicely and does not change the tone of my skin.  I&#x27;ve recommended this item to friends and relatives.</li>
            <li> For me, this bb cream is just so so. it doesnt provide full coverage and the color and product does wear off in a short while. i dont think its the best for combination skin. my favorite is definitely dr jarts silver label, which stays on alot longer and provides full coverage with just some mineral powder on top. this one i just now use on my neck and chest for the spf and blending, but definitely not as good as dr jarts.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t write a long review because there are many reviews here already.  I just wanted to share that I had originally purchased the No. 21 BB cream and it was way too light.  I am caucasian, but with olive skin tones.  It&#x27;s the end of the summer, and I have a pretty good tan (one that was gained with sunscreen, so I&#x27;m not that dark), and this color is perfect for my summer skin tone.  It goes on with a slight grey hue, but blends with my skin tone soon after application.  Provides good coverage!  I am very happy overall!  I think the No. 21 will be good in the dead of winter when I&#x27;m much paler.</li>
            <li> Very nice and light on your face. Haven&#x27;t used it in a while since I stopped wearing so much make-up. But definitely great product.</li>
            <li> I have tried only one other BB cream before which was by Skin79. I found that product to be great, but when I ran out, I decided to try something new. MISSHA M Perfect Cover BB Cream is my new favorite!!! It has very good coverage for a BB cream and does not break me out at all, which is the main reason I use these creams instead of foundations. I also feel that it is improving the texture of my skin and whitening my post-acne spots, as it claims to do. Overall, this is a fabulous BB cream and I encourage any BB cream beginners to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it is natural on the skin and has a good coverage, quilidade is far superior to other bb cream I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> It is a good product to use for daily quick make up. I have ordered 3 times so far. It is a bit shiny by itself so I always use some powder over it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, it dries out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have combine type of skin. and even in oily areas it dries it out.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say anything special about it. I tried better products of Korean brands</li>
            <li> i love it! reached on time </li>
            <li> I take good care of my skin. I&#x27;m 53 but am told I look like I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s.  Products like this help a lot.  The color is true (I&#x27;m a light/medium complected Caucasian woman) and looks natural. I love the SPF.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent product from missa...</li>
            <li> I loved the product. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it, was the expiration date, It is just 3 months before it expirates and I bought 2 of then, that means I&#x27;m gonna lose one of them for sure. For future purchases, I would like you send them with a long expiration date.</li>
            <li> It came very quickly, so it was good. I am Asian and not so tanned, but this product is too pale for my skin. Cream is thick and hard to smooth evenly on skin. I feel this is too heavy to wear.</li>
            <li> Very kind service of you and thanks for sending variety of bb cream samples. Although it wasn&#x27;t pleasant at first order but will be keep looking forward to make different order in future. The cream is a great product for coverage of all skin types. I only try couple times but still awaiting to see the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This is my second BB cream. I started out with skin79&#x27;s pink label, but this one is a lot better. The coverage and oil control is excellent. I have combination skin, and this keeps my face from getting oily all through the day.</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail today in no. 23 and so far I can&#x27;t complain. I have very oily skin, but after showering and washing my face it can be pretty dry because I use benzoyl peroxide for my acne. My acne isn&#x27;t really horrible although I would call it moderate to severe. I usually have at least one zit on my face which is really annoying. Anyway, I wanted an SPF because I live in Hawaii and most tinted moisturizers are SPF15 or have no SPF at all. So I really like how this product is SPF42. Awesome. Also, it has really good coverage and covers my blemishes and acne scars well. It&#x27;s surprisingly light too, and isn&#x27;t oily like most SPFs. It smells amazing too! It goes on real smooth and is moisturizing and clean. It blends really well too. The shade is light but absorbs quickly in the skin. I really can think of no cons. I have yet to see if it improves my skin and gets rid of spots. If this breaks me out, I&#x27;ll be pretty sad, but as of now I&#x27;m seriously in love.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this :)))) it covers so well!! and I have combination skin and In mac im color NC40 and it blends in very nicely!!! yeah at first it is a bit gray but later on it blends in within 3-4 hours :))) definitively buying again soon!!! and more quantities!!! I love it!!!! and fast shipping. THANK YOU!:D</li>
            <li> My sister was raving about bb creams and made me order this. I normally use the bare minerals line or the smashbox mineral \\&quot;foundation\\&quot; because I tend to find regular foundation too time consuming to choose (the right color). Lo and behold, this Missha foundation comes in only two colors, so my chances were 50/50. I found the Natural Beige to be the perfect shade for my medium-toned Asian skin. Like others have mentioned, a little bit of this product goes a looooooooong way, so the price is extremely reasonable considering how other liquid foundations don&#x27;t cover as well as this bb cream, or offer as many benefits as the Missha, either!  I read someone&#x27;s comment about their receiving a knockoff version or something, but I believe the product I received to be 100% genuine.  Love, Love, LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever tried!!! It blends with my skin perfectly, and after couple of uses I feel like my skin looks healthier. I do need to use a cream or lotion before applying BB cream, but that&#x27;s because my skin is really dry. Also, I&#x27;m pretty pale and I have red spots on my face and this shade gave me a perfect coverage. Shipping was super fast too. I highly recommend this! Its amazing!</li>
            <li> This is a good bb cream...but not my fav...it ranks #2 next to Skin79 triple BB cream in the hot pink can.  It is definitely very spreadable and can be thinned out with moisturizer if needed (depending upon your personal choice of texture).  It provides medium coverage and a matte finish.  WARNING!  It does come out gray and your face will look very pale when first applied...relax...it ends up blending right in with your skin.  The only reason I prefer the skin79 one over this is because I feel this has more pink tones in it and skin79 has the yellow tone I need.</li>
            <li> Missha BB cream, not my favorite.  I liked the Laneige BB cream over this one.  I still want to try the BRTC BB cream which I am buying today.</li>
            <li> MISSHA BB cream does everything it advertises.  It actually does improve skin tone-- I have splotchy, reddish skin that is very sensitive, and it was visibly improved after a week.  Moisturized without making me break out, and the suscreen works well all day.  Coverage is excellent-- it evens out skin tone but isn&#x27;t the slightest bit thick or cakey.  I set this with a light powder and wear it as my make-up, and it lasts all day.  Worth every penny.  I just wish I had discovered it sooner!!</li>
            <li> this product is amazing!  i will start off by saying that i never write reviews but i think this product is worthy of my time.  i am a makeup junkie and i have been on the search for an amazing foundation...my skin is not perfect, i have blemishes from time to time, acne scarring and i have combo skin (very oily in t-zone but extremely dry in the cheeks).  i have tried everything from drugstore foundations to the high end lancome foundations and they just didn&#x27;t do the trick...they either didn&#x27;t cover enough or were slipping off my face within a few hours...not to mention some of them made me oilier or made me break out more...well, this product has really changed my skin for the better!  the formula isn&#x27;t as light as a tinted moisturizer but more of a medium coverage foundation...it covers amazing and really helps keep my skin matte for hours!  i used to have to blot within 2 hours of wearing my other foundations but with this one, i dont have to really blot at all...the bb cream lasts all day and is absolutely life-changing! i love love love love this product!!!</li>
            <li> My Mother&#x27;s makeup looked flawless and I had to ask what new product she was using. She gave me her partially used 50ml No. 23 Natural Beige tube. Since then, I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with the result.     Easy to apply. A small amount goes a long way and gives a smooth finish. It does a great job covering my blemishes that darkened after my pregnancies.  Minimizes the look of pores too.    I have combination skin so I use Olay Regenerist serum, followed by Obagi Sun Screen, then the Missha M Perfect Cover BB Cream. The make up stays put, all day. It feels like it has a primer in it so now I don&#x27;t have to spend another $40 on primer. A light dusting of loose facial powder and it&#x27;s done.     Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I always hear about BB creams everywhere, so I&#x27;ve recently decided to see what all this hype is about. I did alot of research, and found the MISSA perfect cover bb cream to have one of the highest ratings. I decided to buy it, but without much hope as I&#x27;ve bought countless skin products that have disappointed me. However, this bb cream worked wonders. I have oily skin with mild acne, and this cream not only controlled the oil really well but also covered up my blemishes as well as lightened up my whole face. With my normal foundation I would&#x27;ve started to become oily in one or two hours. But this product stays fresh on my face for the longest time. It is also looks as if I have no makeup on my face! I strongly suggest this bb cream to those who have oily/mild acne skin like me, as it does not harm the skin. The only problem for me was that I am very tanned, so even number 23 was a bit light for me. But when I put it on my face, it blends right into my skin after about 10 mins! Therefore, I give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother. She received the indication from a friend and fortunately I found it in Amazon site, It was delivered in time and my mother loved it. Misha&#x27;s product are very good and we will certainly buy more in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> This is the best &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever used. The color isn&#x27;t perfect, and it looks like this brand just doesn&#x27;t have my actual color, but its close enough and no one notices. It&#x27;s a bit too &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m a very pale warm/olive toned person. (not common)</li>
            <li> I Was nervous about buying this because I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but I absouletly love this product and will be buying more of this when it runs out! I have a lot of scars from acne but the foundation covers it pretty well, along with other blemishes on my face. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it has helped the scars lessen but it has definitely whitened my skin out and wen I wear it my face looks skittle lighter so I use Bronzer but nevertheless love it !</li>
            <li> Buyers beware! I bought this product (No 23) from JUSAZ and it was not real.  The color is off when comparing with my original Missha, and printing on the tub is very different.  The product was shipped from China, and after filing a complaint seller agreed to provide RMA number and return label.  But it costs me $12.75 USD to ship back, so I decided not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am curious as to how many person has bought this product and encountered the same problem when trying to return the product.  Meanwhile this seller is selling fake products without the need to refund the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a lesson learned for me, I wish I know how to tell where the seller was or where the product was shipping from prior to purchasing the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For future reference, do any of you know how to find out where the product was coming or shipping from?</li>
            <li> Good product and it has light coverage but unfortunatly I ordered # 23 and it is darker than my skin tone.T_T</li>
            <li> I love BB cream in general and this BB cream is great for starter or younger teenager to try it.</li>
            <li> If you can find the correct shade match, this is a wonderful product. I find it to be thorough, buildable coverage. It does not make me break out but there are some oils in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Both my friends and I have used this before and it works pretty well. It will make your face look very different</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big foundation user nor high maintenance person but I love this stuff.  I&#x27;m lucky in that I managed to buy the exact shade for my skin the first time.  It covers, goes on smooth as silk and lasts all day.  It seems to be absorbed by the skin in a matter of mintutes and stays put.  I have been using it for a month and feel it has helped to moisterize my skin and maybe the wrinkles around my eyes are better... too soon to see a lot of improvement but I swear I see some!  It has also helped even my skin tone, which is important to us middle aged women.  I also feel good about using it because of the SPF42.  I loved it so much I ordered a second tube within two weeks of using the first one, just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Searched and searched for a BB cream that would not look or feel to heavy for my skin type(oily). Was a bit leary about the color of the product when i first put it on, appeared dark. as i applied it, matched my skin perfectly. Will definately buy again. now waiting to see if my laugh lines and crows feet will slowly disappear.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s very easy to apply compared to some concealers and liquid foundations. It goes on very smoothly. My skin feels soft afterwords and not sticky. The only problem I had with this product was the color. In all the reviews I read, everyone said that both of the shades are very, very light. But when I ordered the No. 23 (natural beige) it wasn&#x27;t light at all! It was noticeably darker than my skin tone. So I decided to order No. 21 (Light Beige) also and see how that one turns out. So just be careful when you order that if you have a Caucasian skin tone (if you&#x27;re white without a very dark tan), do not order No. 23! It&#x27;s not super dark, but you can still notice the difference and you&#x27;ll spend time blending out the color to make the rest of your skin look darker.</li>
            <li> Would you douse your face in perfume? Well, wearing this is equivalent. I was so excited to get this product and applied it to my face. The first time I applied it, I used it around my eyes and face because some reviews said it worked as a great concealer too. Within a couple of minutes my eyes were so irritated, I had to wash it off. Later, I decided to try it again. This time I avoided the eye area completely. I still couldn&#x27;t tolerate it. This is such a shame because my skin looked good with it but I couldn&#x27;t hardly breathe because of the perfume. I can not believe there aren&#x27;t more comments on this...maybe I am hyper-sensitvie. Is there a BB cream out there that does not have perfume in it?</li>
            <li> This is the first foundation, bb cream, whatever you want to call it that I have fell in love with. You can&#x27;t see it close up, it&#x27;s my Cakey, looks so flawless and natural, but has GREAT coverage. It&#x27;s a grey tan instead of making you orange which greyish tint doesn&#x27;t sound good but it looks beyond amazing. The smell is good too. I love using it! So great!</li>
            <li> I have acne skin so I have to use foundation to cover all the redness.&lt;br /&gt;Creamy coverage,Best worn at night or evening.....thick coverage</li>
            <li> I like it except the fact that it was a lot lighter than expected. It&#x27;s a good primer for me to use. I have to put powder on top of it but it has good coverage for being a bb cream.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s like wearing a lotion but it&#x27;s like foundation as well. I love this product and I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> It came super fast and packaging was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Asian-American so finding a good foundation (light/medium with yellow undertone skin)was really hard. I&#x27;m 30 and suffer from cystic acne, hyperpigmentation (dark splotches), oily-combination, and general redness. I used to take acne antibiotics but eventually that even stopped working so I was pretty much resigned to terrible skin for the rest of my life. Since I&#x27;ve been using BB Cream ( I started with Cliniques, it was okish) I only get a pimple once in a while and the condition minus makeup is superb. With the cream, I look flawless. I haven&#x27;t looked this good since before having children!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight perfume smell (I like it) that quickly dissolves and I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s really matte. I have a super oily T zone but not when using this. I don&#x27;t even need the oil papers as much and I hardly need powder. In fact, I sometimes need an extra moisturizer because it zaps oil so much (at least for me). This color is a little weird until I rub into my skin and it may be slightly too pale for me so I may go to the next level but that&#x27;s my error not the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really satisfied. It breaths well and I never feel like rushing to wash it off, actually, I quite forget that it&#x27;s there. Worth a try. Definitely better than other foundations.</li>
            <li> This BB cream was recommended by my cousin who&#x27;s been to Korea. It&#x27;s her &amp; her mom&#x27;s (my aunt&#x27;s) beauty secret. At first I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work for me because I have a different skin type from them, but my cousin said it should be alright. So I did gave it a try and wow I&#x27;m amazed on how well it goes on my face. It&#x27;s light, blendable and isn&#x27;t sticky at all. It feels as if I&#x27;m not wearing anything. It didn&#x27;t cause any break outs on me considering that my skin is sensitive and usually acne prone (easily breaks out with new products). I have oily/combination skin by the way. It didn&#x27;t make my face look oily at all. It just gives my skin a natural look. I love how light it feels and that it has SPF 42. This one tube goes a long way too. I only use a tiny amount of this BB cream. For me, I just squeeze the pump half way then I make tiny dots in different parts of my face using that small amount, then I spread &amp; blend it all over. You can build it up a bit more but i think it wouldn&#x27;t really cover dark scars or big blemishes alone. You might need a concealer for those still. But all in all, I just love this product! :)</li>
            <li> It looked a little more lighter than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product several times before and every time it&#x27;s slightly different. It seemed greasier and thinner at first which meant it didn&#x27;t cover as well. But after a couple of days it seemed to thicken up and coveres very well. The fragrance is slightly stronger but I like that. That&#x27;s one of the reasons I like this product so much.</li>
            <li> They are ok but nothing special. They are as good as any other similar product you buy at the drugstore</li>
            <li> This is a staple for me.  This BB cream works best during the cooler season.  It&#x27;s non-comodogenic, so it won&#x27;t clog your pores.  It has SPF for sun coverage.  It moisturizes also, but best if used with your daily facial moisturizer if you have dry skin like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY it now!  You won&#x27;t regret it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: shipping was fairly fast</li>
            <li> It works ok - however, I find it does make my wrinkles around my eyes more apparent. I prefer the revision spf 45 which is just amazing, however a bit more pricey.</li>
            <li> the color make you look like a zombie at first, then quite dark after if you are not a very dark asian don&#x27;t buy it, and don&#x27;t put a lot on</li>
            <li> I ordered it with excitement based on the good reviews.  I was very disappointed when I got it.  It feels heavy and oily -- cheap type of ingredients.</li>
            <li> I received on 9/30/13 a cream that expired on 4/10/2013. The seller argues that is the manufacturing date instead of the expiration date but I have pictures to prove with other creams in the same brand, that this is NOT the manufacturing date. This IS the expiration date so same as other BB cream sellers, they advertise to sell the &amp;#34;2013 latest products&amp;#34; and they are expired.</li>
            <li> This cream got good reviews, which is why I tried it.  However, the very strong (old-fashioned powdery) smell wasn&#x27;t mentioned in the reviews I read.  The cream performs well; however, the smell would prevent me from using it again.  I gave the cream to my mother who doesn&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Same as usual. Does it&#x27;s job the way it&#x27;s supposed to. A little goes a long way so it&#x27;s gonna take a while before I order my third tube.</li>
            <li> I purchased this BB creme in No.21 - Light Beige. It looked shiny on my skin, and I started breaking out after using it a few days (and I rarely break out anymore).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is why: the fifth ingredient is MINERAL OIL!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mineral oil is well known to clog pores, and most good companies do not use mineral oil as one of their main ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this if I knew the ingredients before I bought it. I won&#x27;t buy products over the internet if I can&#x27;t find out what it contains. Lesson learned :(</li>
            <li> Having read so many rave reviews about this product, I decided to try it.  I myself am someone who wears makeup once in a blue moon, so I really wanted something that I could feel comfortable in.  By all means, it is very light and fairly sheer and has a nice smell.  It is pretty comfortable to wear.    Upon initial application, the color is not the best match for my complexion, but after maybe 30 min. - 1 hour, it oxidizes and matches the skin fairly well.  One thing worth mentioning is that, I am indeed Asian, which this product is often geared towards, but my skin has a more olive-yellow undertone to it, and it&#x27;s not the perfect match with Missha No. 23.  This shade has a hint of a pinker-undertone, so hopefully that helps you figure out if this suits you.    I get oily skin pretty quickly, even after powdering with this product on, but what I do like about it is that it is very breathable.  Much of the time after I wear makeup, my skin feels like it is dying because it can&#x27;t breath (clogged pores).  I often end up breaking out in acne after wearing makeup (foundation), but with this product, I never have that issue.  It is very easy to wash off (whether it is on your hands on or on your face), and I definitely like that.  Makes the makeup removal process that much simpler, and it is certainly better for the skin.  I never break out after wearing it, so that is a major plus.  Overall, I&#x27;d say that this is a pretty good product.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other BB creams before in the past, and this one blends the easiest and is a pretty good match after it oxidizes.  The pump is pretty nice too and keeps the product pretty clean and neat in its container.</li>
            <li> I do not have oily skin at all but this product sure made my skin look and feel oily! The coverage is great - no need for concealer but I was shocked to discover a shiny/oily face by mid afternoon the first day I used this product. It also seemed to clog my pores a bit. Now, whenever I decide to use this product I first use a primer and pore filler. That combination of products seem to combat the oiliness a bit better. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to most people, after all I have never had an issue with oily skin until using this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bb cream and boomer and arrived early than i expected, and very happy and i loved it.. will purchase from this seller again..</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thicker and provides more coverage than I expected, so I used too much the first few times after switching from Maybelline. The colors run a tiny bit lighter than I expected, but that&#x27;s a risk factor buying on line vs. in person purchasing. If you keep that in mind when you order, you&#x27;ll get the right shade. Gives enough coverage to be considered a light foundation in my book, if you issues about not wearing anything, but need sunscreen and just a bit of balancing.</li>
            <li> Seems bit watery and the color is slightly lighter compared to the same product that I got in Korea. Still the coverage is great and it lasts all day. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my granddaughter. She loves it. It was about 6 months past it&#x27;s &#x27;sale by&#x27; date but was still good. Will order it again when she is ready for more.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what this is made of but im pretty sure its not meant to be on the face it will completely break your face out with white heads and boils. it has a very strong perfume smell and comes out a grey color and stays that way you will look green with in the sun light.</li>
            <li> I love this missha m perfect cover bb cream in #23...it&#x27;s a little too pale when you first applied to your face but once you used a loose powder that match your skin tone it&#x27;s all set....and after less than one hour it really blend into your skin...i love it..and it last long too!!!</li>
            <li> Color is good and great coverage for the face. Customer service is good. I have a problem, but customer service answered my questions right away.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a year now, and i like it... but notice how i didn&#x27;t say LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;This product is great IF you don&#x27;t have oily skin.  It is smooth and creamy, and it soaks into the skin instantly... but over time it made my skin a bit oilier than usual.  So if you have dry skin, great product; if you don&#x27;t, try it or look for something else.&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck</li>
            <li> I am new to BB creams so I have initially bought 2, The Missha 23 and The pink Skin 79. This BB cream has much better coverage than my other BB cream and lasts for the entire day without feeling oily or anything!(My other one did as well, the only thing I have a problem with it the color is a little light and the coverage) I&#x27;m rating this a four since I just started using this product, but I already love the results. Also when I got it, The bottle looked a little flat to me, so I&#x27;m think how long this bottle will last me? In the future, I will probably test out many other bb creams but buy this product again since I already know it works for me. I am never going back to foundation!</li>
            <li> I am a bit obsessed with BB creams. As someone with red flushes and splotches for no apparent reason as well as the occasional blemish, BB creams are a godsend. No matter what the coverage, whether it&#x27;s on the lighter more sheer side or thicker more makeup-y side, they all seem to do a fabulous job in evening out skin tone and brightening up the skin. I am very fair with a smattering of freckles and red hair (technically it&#x27;s not my real hair color but my coloring is so close to that of a real red head that no one believes that I wasn&#x27;t born that way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the pros and cons as I see them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- I love the pump as it is way more hygienic that way&lt;br /&gt;-- Pink undertones - surprisingly this works for me but it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone&lt;br /&gt;-- Very high SPF for a BB cream&lt;br /&gt;-- On the thin side and very easy to blend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- It looks great when first put on but after oxidating for a couple of hours, it starts to have a bit of a grey tint to it. On some people this will be a really negative thing for their skin tone. For me, it&#x27;s not the most appealing look but it&#x27;s also not horrible. If I don&#x27;t have time to reapply, touching up with a bit of blush or bronzer or even just some powder helps a ton. I think if I got the number 21 instead of 23, this wouldn&#x27;t even be an issue at all so when this is gone, I&#x27;m going to try that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- It&#x27;s a medium coverage BB cream which means that it work well for evening out skin tone but you&#x27;ll have to do multiple layers if you&#x27;re hiding blemishes or dark circles under your eyes. Because it tends to get greyer later on when thicker, multiple layers isn&#x27;t a great idea so I use another BB cream to compliment it. Makes me wonder why I&#x27;m even using this one in the first place! Again, this is probably just because I got the wrong one for my skintone so this might not have an effect on you at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last note: it&#x27;s more for people with dry skin because it has a lot more oil in it than other BB creams I have and use. If you already have oily skin, this will be an issue for you. I have normal skin with a slightly oily t-zone and have not had an issue at all but I do use a primer before putting a BB cream on and the primer helps to control oil so it may be because of this (the primer I use is [[ASIN:B000UGUB1W Smashbox Photo Finish Oil Free Primer 1oz/30ml]])has a lot more oil in it than other BB creams I have and use. If you already have oily skin, this will be an issue for you. I have normal skin with a slightly oily t-zone and have not had an issue at all but I do use a primer before putting a BB cream on and the primer helps to control oil so it may be because of this (the primer I use is [[ASIN:B000UGUB1W Smashbox Photo Finish Oil Free Primer 1oz/30ml]])</li>
            <li> I have some hyperpigmentation on my face (melmasma from pregnancy) and I can never find anything that will cover without looking cakey.  This BB cream covers so nice and it&#x27;s buildable without being cakey or noticable.  I set it with a translucent powder and I&#x27;m good for the day.  I bought #23 and was worried because it has a grey color to it but it adjusted to my skin tone perfect.</li>
            <li> Must buy! With this product you do not need anything else. No concealer, no foundation. Nothing but this awesome cream!</li>
            <li> The cream was very thick and I had to mix with other face lotion to make a little lighter. Because of all the good reviews and high recommendations, I was willing to keep trying it because sometime you will see the difference after using it for awhile. However, the pump stopped working properly after 1.5~2 weeks and I ended up to return this product. Besides the container issue, the cream itself was not my favorite, either.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin look. It makes me feel like I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup, but on top of that,  it evens my skin tone and gives me a dewy complexion. With this product,  a little goes a long way! One tiny pump is all it takes.  It&#x27;s amazing. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to foundation.</li>
            <li> It came and was made in Korea, only have used it a couple of times, kind of afraid of using it.</li>
            <li> I read about BB creams before purchasing this one. It was everything I expected it to be. The coverage is great and it doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy feeling on my face. Will continue using BB cream. Price was good also.</li>
            <li> I am asian with light brown tone, i was skeptical when i first used it bcuz its kind of a little light on my skin i just mixed it a littl e of mac foundation with my tone , i tell you just like this foundation product its light and smooth it gives my skin a good coverage it make my facial skins looks so glowy and seems so natural looks like and i notices it makes my facial skins nice and smooth, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Missha BB cream is a good product, a smooth and perfect match for Asian skin stone with high protection of SPF 42 it&#x27;s helps to cover your skin all day. I will recommend to my friends and order more for myself in a future.</li>
            <li> Love it so far. It tightens skin and makes the skin tone look better. #23 looks natural on Asian beige skin.</li>
            <li> Best product I have found to date. Looks natural, color is perfect, evens my skin tone, is light, and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> it is the best BB cream ever, with SPF, smells like baby lotion, but it goes on sheer and if you want more coverage it makes it thicker but not caker...I love it. I actually use this in the winter than the summer more often because it does a good job of hydrating my skin.</li>
            <li> When it comes to bb creams, this is the best brand ever among those with a better price (you can probably find a better chanel one). But I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results. It has a perfect feel, and does a great job covering skin imperfections.</li>
            <li> After countless trips and dollars spent at Sephora on many expensive brands, this one is by far the best. Price aside, it lasts all day in the hot weather and driest winter. I am a middle aged woman with oily skin and this does not let a lot of shine through. Just enough so you have that glow, but not greasy at all after working all day. Plus it has sun protection. The tint covers my sun spots, blemishes, and broken capillaries. It lasts a long time too! I use it almost daily. Just give yourself enough time in advance to allow for the longer delivery time. Totally worth the wait!</li>
            <li> Best product of this kind I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous BB cream - it goes on smoothly and covers up my imperfections like hyper-pigmentation and other blemishes.  I get a lot of compliments on my skin when I wear this and best of all, it has a high SPF which was really important to me.  This is a perfect final step in my Korean skincare routine!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this 3 times now and getting ready to order more.  It last a long time and seems to be the best one I have tried.  The ones at CVS or Target dont seem to even compare.  For the price, I think this is the best out there.</li>
            <li> Love this product, goes on creamy and light, works wells.</li>
            <li> My application in the morning at 6:00 AM lasts me the whole day.  I have a T zone skin type  so after a few hours, I just blot the oil out with a paper absorbent towel.  There is no need to reapply.  I love the coverage and the glow!</li>
            <li> Gone through 3+ tubes of this product throughout the years. Lovely, silky, spf + coverage that you can build up from little to heavy. Versatile product. Recommend shade 21 even if you&#x27;re pale (13 is too washed out and will make anyone look like a ghost). Also I have neutral undertones but it&#x27;s great for all undertones (pink, yellow, and neutral).</li>
            <li> Perfect for my face color. Fast shipping. It&#x27;s better than the old version one. Satisfied and recommend it for you to try it</li>
            <li> This is the third tube of Missha M Perfect Cover Cream that I&#x27;ve ordered. Since I&#x27;m Asian, the creams available at retail don&#x27;t match my skin tone. However, this foundation blends well with my skin color and I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.  Hands down, this is THE best BB cream.  I have extremely sensitive skin and this is non-irritating.  This gives such great coverage that I use it as my &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; now.  Just set with some translucent powder.  I have pretty fair skin and use the No.23.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before, and this one has the same perfect effect as my previous one bought from other places.</li>
            <li> I have broken capillaries on my cheeks and have a difficult time covering them up with concealer and foundation.  Missha BB Cream is amazing at the coverage I need as well as making my skin feel soft!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it, I will buy this again. I have oily skin so this works perfect for me as it keeps my skin looking like I had put on make up.  I use it as the foundation and skip the rest of the garbage I used to put in my face. I love it!</li>
            <li> this is the best bb cream I&#x27;ve ever used! it actually has coverage unlike most bb creams ! total re order!</li>
            <li> Was doubtful initially but this is way better than Lancôme and makes skin look dewy and natural. Love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE! I ordered 2 of these and received a package with only 1 in it. I contacted the seller and got a refund for half of what I paid. The one I did receive...  was shipped from CHINA not KOREA. The pump did not work because the tube was 25% full. The letters on the back were faded like it was USED. I ordered this on November 9th and the expiration date was in SEPTEMBER. BUYER BEWARE! I GOT MINE USED, EXPIRED, AND ALMOST EMPTY. This isn&#x27;t even worth spending any money on. I got this for my mom for Christmas hoping she would love it, but I got this and was really upset.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this BB Cream is still available via Amazon.  I&#x27;m almost out of my current tube and couldn&#x27;t go long without it!  I have tried several other BB Creams (Skin 79 - various types) and I always go back to this one.  The consistency is smoother, the application is ideal (with my clean hands), and the coverage is sheer to medium.  The color is perfect for me...however, do note you need to let it oxidize for a wee bit...but once it does - great color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this everyday (i.e. to the office) but on weekends, and when I&#x27;m just running errands, and on some work days where I&#x27;m short on time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t make sure the product is genuine. Because it is not the same as I brought in Korea, however the price is cheap.</li>
            <li> When I put this product on my face first time, looks like it&#x27;s darker than my skin. But it will adjust the color it self within 30 sec.  Great coverage.  I don&#x27;t need to use a foundation with this product.</li>
            <li> The package came sooner than expected, so I really trust Seoul Glamour.&lt;br /&gt;The product does go on gray, but after a while it will oxidize and blend in better. The coverage was perfect and it did not make me breakout. This is only the third BB cream I&#x27;ve used but I would recommend it. This shade is darker than normal BB cream so it doesn&#x27;t make you look really white.</li>
            <li> I felt the quality is different from what i ordered last time. This is a little bit out of my expectation.</li>
            <li> I want tell you information between real and fake of this BB.&lt;br /&gt;The fake one, you can open the product but the real one you can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;please try open it and tell us.&lt;br /&gt;check this video for more information.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this BB in any way. The color has an odd gray cast to it which washed me out and created a weird tone to my face. The consistency is also extremely thick which made it both difficult to blend and made my skin feel heavy while wearing it. The smell is the typical lotiony makeup scent but it is very heavy. It also made me break out in little irritation pimples which might have been due to how thick it is</li>
            <li> I order #27 regularly, but that product was out of stock, so I tried this one. It is kind of a grayish color. It works just as well, and blends good, but I still prefer the other, as it is brighter. Missha BB cream is a great product!</li>
            <li> Before purchased I read and read thoroughly the product.  The box and bottle looks sophisticated but no clear instructions as how and what to do to pump the fluids out.  Think I pumped 20x ...&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I need to adjust the way I put it on my face.  After my facial routine, I put the bb cream and then I just pat some powder in my face.&lt;br /&gt;Few hours later I perspire and my face getting shiny and oily.  And with that, I have pimple breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Very and a bit depressed coz it was my 1st BB cream product and I don&#x27;t know if I should give it a second try or chance on this bb cream from Korea.&lt;br /&gt;Or maybe I should change my face powder .... Well well well .....</li>
            <li> Nice texture, decent coverage and feels moisturizing. Only problem is that it got greasy and wore off on my greasy skin.</li>
            <li> This is a product I will never stop buying and using. Started using it over 8 years ago before all the BB Creams started showing up in every store in the U.S. I&#x27;ve never broken out. I use a makeup sponge and this blends so well. It has SPF so it&#x27;s an added bonus. I only use 1 small pump and a tube lasts me about 4 months and I wear it almost everyday. In the summer I go 1 shade darker, to 23. In the winter I stick with my usual No 21. Shipping is fast and it&#x27;s genuine from Korea. Awesome product and my daughters use it and are fans too.</li>
            <li> This was my second time buy things from the same seller. They re wrapped really carefully and nice. The product is very good too. You gave will looks so natural when u putting on and it won&#x27;t make ur skin looks dry. Smell is okay. I&#x27;d say. This is really good item. She shipment is kinda longer but still worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product I use! I live in the desert so the SPF is a must! It goes on light but gets darker as you wear it. I sweat a lot since I&#x27;m always moving and when I wipe my forehead some does come off but when I look in the mirror it looks perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooooo in love with this cream, I highly recommend it &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42 years old and spanish with light to medium skin color, this product bb cream #23 is perfect, very good cover for my ages spots and discoloration areas, not heavy cream, very very light scent, and excelent sun protection. I like to use over the prime cream and works perfect and keeps my skin silky soft, fresh and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sister who has darker skin that me.  She loves this product and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Love love this product, the color suits my asian type of skin, and very moisturizing and smooth to be applied. It&#x27;s even beat the other Korean brand and other US big brands, but white people may like darker skin and I&#x27;m not sure if they have different shades. I usually apply this after my moisturizer and no more else, it has SPF 42 in, very convenient! I will keep using this BB cream.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage (medium). The BB cream has a strong fragrance,  which I love and it has a creamy (moist) consistancy, excellent for combination and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Too dark and made me look weirdly gray faced</li>
            <li> I do love this product... it&#x27;s light and it&#x27;s also wearable. it does build well too for the parts that need extra coverage.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is very sticky and thick. It showed red brown on my face like wearing mask.&lt;br /&gt;It did not give me any benefit of BB cream.</li>
            <li> I just  love it. Looks and feels great. Very natural feeling and great coverage at the same time. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> keep using missha BB cream for 3years.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cream I&#x27;ve been using for over 6 months and am re-ordering. It feels natural, provides nice coverage over my spots, not too thin nor heavy.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best BB creams in the market. Great coverage and goes on smoothly. Last all day and has the highest protection agains the sun. Also smells great and not like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream. I found out about Missha BB cream through a youtube vlog and wanted to try it out. I am glad I did. The coverage is excellent. Granted, I don&#x27;t really have any blemishes on my face. Missha does a good job at even-ing out my skin and it lasts all day. I live in the humid Virginia state and the BB cream does very well in the summer. I bought both 23 and 27 and use 27 during the summer months. I use 23 to cover my dark under-eye circles. I even got my sister and my mom hook on the BB cream. I love the fact that this BB cream is so affordable. I used to spend $50+ on my Dior foundation. No more!!!</li>
            <li> It provides WonDeRfuL coverage, the color is way to light for my golden olive skin, and my skin broke out like a teenager.  I&#x27;m now dealing with the breack outs hoping I don&#x27;t gettoo many scars.</li>
            <li> Firstly, my skin tone is pretty much spot on with anything that is named &amp;#34;beige&amp;#34;. I am Vietnamese-American. I can get dark in the summer, but this would be only for winter coverage (when I&#x27;m at my lightest). Even then, this BB Cream is a tad bit too light for me. I even ordered the darker shade. You kind of have to be white/fair-skinned for this BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is smooth and a touch grainy (like many BB creams I&#x27;ve seen). It comes out a little grey at first so it can color correct and try to match to your skin color. It is easy to apply and re-layer. I have oily skin so I only place 1-2 layers. It does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> The 3 stars is for the surprisingly fast delivery.  The BB cream does not cover much of my blemishes from what it promises.  The color actually makes my face look dull.  I should try a few more times to see if my skin actually &amp;#34;adapts&amp;#34; to this BB cream, but this is truly not the one I expected.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.  She said just be sure you choose the right shade number for your complexion.</li>
            <li> THE BEST BB Cream out there. Color is perfect, I am fair. I am 64 and when wearing this bb cream people comment on my skin, even asking me if I have had something &amp;#34;done&amp;#34;. Foundation was making my skin look much older, so glad I found BB Cream, and this is the best by far. I finish it with rice powder, also bought on Amazon and it is beautiful.</li>
            <li> First of all, the product I&#x27;ve received has a defective pump. No big deal, I thought I would just open the top to use it. The top came off by twisting, not good. I happen to remember that the previous ones I&#x27;ve ordered (from other sellers) would not allow you to twist it open. The texture of this cream is extremely watery and I realized that this is NOT the legit Missha cream. DO NOT ORDER!!!</li>
            <li> It covers perfectly. The color match the way I want it. It also does not make my face oily and shiny like other BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;Love it. Will order another one.</li>
            <li> This gives a very nice look to my skin and it matches perfectly. The shipping was fast and price was good. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a bb cream to hide imperfections.</li>
            <li> Great coverage! Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Saranghae Missha BB cream! I will only use this BB cream because it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy like the other one&#x27;s I have tried. It&#x27;s great for my 50 yr old American white girl complexion. Kamsamhabnida!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about things i buy online and I was even more so on this since the result that vary enormously depending on your skin. I&#x27;ve been cursed with acne and acne scars ever since I was little and there are still some areas with hyperpigmentation that I am always trying to cover up- with little luck and more white heads in the end.   Well, after reading the reviews about this little BB cream, I decided to give it a try. The coverage is amazing and it does not leave your face looking like a pale ghost. The color sets in very naturally and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation to my sensitive skin so that&#x27;s a huge plus. I even tried a few different things to create a \\&quot;natural glow\\&quot; that really makes my slightly bumpy skin look really smooth (and I&#x27;ve received lots of compliments):  - Cleanse  - Kiehl&#x27;s Cucumber Toner  - MAC Strobe Cream  - Missha BB Cream  - Facial mist (either MyChelle&#x27;s Fruit Enzyme Mist or Clinique&#x27;s Thirsty Skin Relief)  - Brush light powder    This gives the skin a really nice glow and doesn&#x27;t look heavy or thick.</li>
            <li> This cream is a miracle cream. Gives me a super clean and fresh look. It is not heavy at all. And you really need to use very little.  I don&#x27;t ever wear any sort of foundation but this stuff is great because it does smooth my skin out and provides the sun protection. There is no mention of mattifying but it does control my oil too.</li>
            <li> My Giorgio Armani foundation is running out and even though it covers great and last forever, I&#x27;m ready to try something else. Especially since the SPF20 is a little low in the summer. I heard about Missha BB cream but was a little skeptical since I tried some unknown brand of BB cream from a Korean supermarket a while ago and I looked like with a white mask on. This product arrived fast and was packed very well. I had a little trouble at the beginning trying to get the product out: I thought it was a tube design that you squeeze the tube part but nothing came out of the spout. Then finally I turned it upside down and pressed the spout and the cream came out. It goes on smoothly and evenly and my skin tone is even and glowing. Also feels good about the high SPF in the summer. I can&#x27;t be happier and will keep using this product! Not sure how it will hold on in the dryer winter. Will wait and see. But right now I will not go back to any traditional foundation!</li>
            <li> This gave me huge cystic acne. I have semi-sensitive skin, but nothing has broken me out like this and I&#x27;ve use all brands and types of makeup Also, I&#x27;m not smell-sensitive but this smell is just awful. Really smells like an old woman&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product--surface of skin looks almost flawless...I wasn&#x27;t sure abt shade but it&#x27;s a great match. SPF 42 is a nice compliment combo in cream!!! I&#x27;ve used this with &amp; without primer--looks great either way. I&#x27;ve applied with fingers &amp; w/brush and looks beautiful either way!!! Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. It offers a nice finished look, and wears well throughout the day.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> My wife says she doesn&#x27;t like the shade.</li>
            <li> The colour is a little bit grey but mixed with my Physician Formula BB cream it&#x27;s perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;I really love this BBcream I really recommend it :D</li>
            <li> OH MY holy bb cream this is by far the best asian bb cream I&#x27;ve tried, it smoothes out skin, GREAT coverage and it feels so light. The problems I have is smell, and it gave me two small pimples. The smell isn&#x27;t THAT bad but its summer where I live and I can&#x27;t stand any type of fragrance really but it kind of fades away so thats good, and I really hope that it was something else that caused my pimples because I just love the finish and the coverage of this bb cream too much. Compared to its good qualities the issue I have with its fragrance is minusculed.</li>
            <li> I love it!. Perfect shade and great coverage for my skin type.I don&#x27;t have fine pores. Most foundation I purchase leave a residue on my face, not this one.</li>
            <li> Best bb cream ever! Doesn&#x27;t make my face oily and itchy. Love it!</li>
            <li> I just used it, I like.it ,I try to blend with my Missha 21 and it blend well, with the color of my complexion. I change my mind I don&#x27;t need to exchange the color to 21,  I&#x27;m just going to used both. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great coverage and sun protection</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this BB cream for several years. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found. Sometimes, if I&#x27;m in a hurry, I use it without my powder foundation. The coverage is that good. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all and washes off easily with mild face soap.</li>
            <li> Wow! I just checked the expired date on this product and notice that it already expired on 10-10-2012. Not good at all and I purchased it just last month.</li>
            <li> I did not enjoy using this product at all, it felt heavy and irritated my skin. I would advise against making a purchase for this product unless you want full coverage, complete with new breakouts. Yuck!</li>
            <li> This is my third tube of MISSHA BB Cream No. 23. I took it along on a business trip because I expected my old tube to run out. The color is MUCH lighter than my other two tubes of No. 23--to the point that I looked sickly pale. Sadly, I did not pack the old tube, so I just looked washed out the whole trip--NOT fun! If I can, I will post the photo I took of the two identical-appearing tubes with the makeup shades, so you can see how dramatic the difference is. I don&#x27;t know that this is the seller&#x27;s fault--perhaps more likely a mistake at the factory. But it took me so long before needing to open this tube that I don&#x27;t believe I can return it. Next time I will check immediately upon receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stand by my original review of this excellent product WHEN the right shade is packed in the tube.</li>
            <li> I tried several BB creams when I switched and this one is the clear winner. It gives a fresh dewy finish, has good coverage, looks natural, has great spf protection,  and fixes wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I like it. It fits perfect for my combination skin. I do not feel it on my skin. I will definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and how light this bb cream feels however i fell that this bb cream has a grey-ish hue to it even though i purchased it in a darker/ warmer shade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been long time I used that product it helps for sun protection..</li>
            <li> I have tried many other BB creams and nothing compares to the Missha.  Its not heavy but a lot of coverage and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;My face looks flawless with this product.</li>
            <li> This product contains mineral oil that actually causes pimples. Sure enough after a couple uses, I had a break out. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have been hearing all kinds of good reviews from using BB cream, so I decided to give it a try. The delivery was extremely fast (got them in just a week), the BB cream were nicely packaged. The best part about Missha&#x27;s BB cream is that it works GREAT even on sensitive skin. I have very sensitive skin, but with Missha&#x27;s BB cream, it does not only moisturize my skin during the day, it also provides great natural coverage over my face.I have been using 3 various foundations, but Missha&#x27;s BB cream is the best!!! I just love it! I am going to recommend the product to all of my friends because it does the magic!</li>
            <li> This would be a top contender except that the smell to me is strong its a like an old person perfume smell and its kind of strong when you first out it on. It can make you wanna gag and if you have an aversion to flowery smells its pretty gross. Overall great coverage medium...lasts long good SPF and great price for the amount you get because you only need a little to do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently heard of Bb creams and cc creams. I began to try over the counter brands recently with not much success. They were ok, but nothing to rave about. I&#x27;m a makeup artist myself, so I&#x27;m constantly in the lookout for great products that actually do what they say. A customer told me about this and I fell in love! I was unsure of the color so I purchase both natural and honey beige. natural beige is fairly light so I can use in the winter months, the honey beige was perfect for summer when I had slightly more color. I&#x27;m a fair skinned half Filipino/white mix. Anyhow...this product is amazing. You can apply with a beauty blender for a light natural coverage or with your fingers or a brush for heavier coverage. Anytime I wear this I get compliments in how fabulous my skin looks and I&#x27;m asked what product I use. I&#x27;m so thrilled with my purchase I will be buying more! Excellent used on it&#x27;s own or as a base.. I&#x27;ve done both. I always set my face with translucent powder and spray Model in A Bottle matte setting spray. It&#x27;s the perfect combination! Must check it out!</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, and seeing this type of product recommended on tv, I was excited to try.  However, my husband even commented, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t like your new foundation\\&quot;.  I can see a clear line between my face and neck when I wear the cream.  I am relatively fair complected and caucasian, with some natural pink to my cheeks.  While the cream felt great, and smelled nice, it just never looked natural.  In fact, it seemed to take all of the natural \\&quot;life\\&quot; out of my face.  While it did cover some blotches, to me, it covered too much.  And, again, it did not match my skin tone.  I looked like I was wearing make-up, which is not what I wanted.  Additionally, after several days of wearing and hoping that I could make it work, my skin has become irritated and is breaking out.  I don&#x27;t have unusually sensitive skin, so this surprised me.  However, I haven&#x27;t read any other reviews with this issue, so maybe it is just me.  Overall I am disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> First of all, it took quite awhile to come. The fragrance is extremely strong, unlike the real product. The pump also comes off which you can&#x27;t do with the real product. My pump didn&#x27;t even work when I got it. It broke. Nothing comes out. Don&#x27;t buy this product!!!!</li>
            <li> SKIN TYPE: COMBO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Sticks onto dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Does not make your skin oily later (especially that T-Zone area)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;VERY pale&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a grey cast on skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I GOT AN EXPIRED PRODUCT... After googling Missha information on how to tell if it&#x27;s fake or not, I found the area for an expiration date and realized I received an expired BB cream. It still worked okay, but sadly I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable to continue using it after a while...</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s my favorite BB cream. I really like how it goes on and I use it as my main foundation.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s been some internet buzz about \\&quot;BB Creams\\&quot; (Blemish Creams) that are supposed to be really good for your skin, while making it look totally flawless, and being lighter than a foundation. The MISSHA M PERFECT COVER BB CREAM #23 does a really good job at coverage and doesn&#x27;t have a heavy feeling, but the colors are limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium-light olive skin (MAC shade NC 40/42) and the MISHA BB CREAM #23 is a tad too light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I can only apply a teeny-tiny amount, like the size of a number 2 pencil eraser on the back of my hand and use that as a palette to smooth on my entire face. Believe me this little amount covers. If I use it like a normal sized amount, like the size of a quarter, it gives my face a ashen/corpse like color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to use a moisturizer before applying the MISHA BB CREAM, also, because it has very matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once on, the cream does cover remarkably well and seems to last all day, without causing my face to become an oil slick and shiny. And so far, I haven&#x27;t broken out or had any irritation. There is mineral oil listed in the ingredients, however, so that might be a problem for acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether  or not it&#x27;s actually good for the skin remains to be seen. I think it&#x27;s just a lighter foundation that&#x27;s really opaque. The product is made in Korea, where the \\&quot;BB Cream\\&quot; is very hot, and so you buy from a third party seller here on Amazon or maybe find it in Asian stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully MISHA BB CREAM will come out in other shades so that more people can try this super product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re undecided on which \\&quot;BB Cream\\&quot; to chose and can&#x27;t test it in a store, go to youtube. There&#x27;s a very good video on BB Cream reviews on youtube and I&#x27;ll post the link below in the discussion area.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using BB cream and i must say that im very impressed! light on your skin, perfect coverage, dont make your face oily, and i have acne prone skin so far its actually help with to clear my acne. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! a must have for me daily from now on!</li>
            <li> At first i thought it would be too light for my skin, but it looks super natural on my skin after i apply.   it last very long and my skin is getting lighter and lighter now.   i&#x27;ll definitely repurchase this again!   ps.shipping was fast too!!</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and loved it. #23 matches my skin tone perfectly. After using for a week, I&#x27;ve noticed a general improvement in skin tone. I can&#x27;t speak for everyone but this is the perfect product for me.</li>
            <li> My favorite BB cream!!! I love it!</li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream, but wish it was made without parabens. Have since replaced this with the Misha Complete BB.</li>
            <li> My daughter told me about this product and first got it for me as a gift.  Now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> For the first week it worked well but after that--i noticed i started getting itchy redness around my mouth and nose.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel very light and refreshed. Gives a natural &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; look. Wish they made shades for warmer undertones. This washed me out.</li>
            <li> BEWARE! This is NOT the Missha product that is the same when ordered directly from Missha. Even though I ordered the same No. 23, it is not the same color. Oh and p.s., the  pump that exudes the cream does not work after the first application. I tried to return it via Amazon but there is a message that says it&#x27;s too late for returns even though I ordered it within the last few months.</li>
            <li> I love this BB Cream.  It has great coverage, it&#x27;s smooth and does&#x27;t cake. I found it in our local Asian Market in town, but then reordered it through Amazon. It lasts forever too. One bottle lasts about 10 months and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> This product, in the correct color, is great.  However, this #23 is not &amp;#34;Natural Beige&amp;#34;, it is really light beige and is for fair to light skin. I bought it to be a shade lower than the #27 that I normally wear and it was way too light, even the package say &amp;#34;light beige&amp;#34;.  I had to return it to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like the product, although the perfumes are a little much for me.  The color was much lighter than I thought it would be.  I would call this more of an ivory than a natural beige.  If the color had been better I would have given this product a better review.  My advice is to spend some extra time looking at shades to make sure you get the right one.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream! It goes on smoothly without the cakey look i&#x27;ve encountered with some other brands. It dries quickly and I love the availability of various colors. I&#x27;m asian and I don&#x27;t have too many blemishes so it&#x27;s prefect to just cover everything. I&#x27;m not sure how much coverage it offers for someone who needs more coverage.</li>
            <li> The colour I chose was not a perfect match for my skin tone but using the product sparingly and blending carefully, it made for a seamless cover up. You don&#x27;t need a lot or else you&#x27;ll end up with a thick and artificial look. At first, I thought it didn&#x27;t blend as well as my Origins tinted moisturizer but after I saw myself in the mirror a few hours later my skin looked amazing and it didn&#x27;t look like I was wearing make-up! So it takes some time to settle but it&#x27;s worth it! There is a slight perfume scent, when I first applied it but disappeared soon after. Also, it didn&#x27;t cover up the one rather dark spot on my face so I&#x27;ll need concealer for that but it did cover lighter pigmentation. I like the results of the BB cream much more than regular liquid foundation and mineral make-up and it lasted all day.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this long craved BB Cream after hearing so many good things about it. I&#x27;m not sure if it did anything to my skin (probably because I&#x27;m horrible at telling differences), but after applying it for a while, I noticed my skin started to break out in tiny areas, especially on my forehead. I&#x27;m disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work out for me, but I&#x27;ll try it for a little longer to see if it was just a fluke?</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product. Had major problems with rash and broken blood vessels on my chest. Cleared it up dramatically. Impressed!</li>
            <li> I love missha I bought 3 tubes already they last long time it stays on your face all day I don&#x27;t need to use a concealer with this either I&#x27;ve already recommended this I will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> Good BB cream, will uy it again! good cover</li>
            <li> This provides great coverage even when it is a BB cream; however, it can swim all over your face if you don&#x27;t set with powder so be careful.</li>
            <li> My favorite BB creme hands down. Great price, matches my skin tone best works as a primer for makeup. I&#x27;m on my 3 or 4 bottle.</li>
            <li> This provides great coverage and I love the fact that it has such high SPF.  No extra sunscreen needed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light-complexioned person and wasn&#x27;t sure what color would look best on me. So I got No. 21 &amp; 23. I figured I could wear the 23 in the summer and 21 in the winter. I like it a lot. It&#x27;s not necessarily silky feeling going on, but after it&#x27;s on for about 15-20 minutes, I like the results. I&#x27;m in my late 60s and it makes me look younger . It doesn&#x27;t look all caked like other cover-ups. Lipstick, blush, powder, etc. all look better when applied after putting on BB cream. I usually use a cream moisturize under it. I have had problems with SPF in facial creams in the past. I sweat a lot and it would run in my eyes and sting. But so far, haven&#x27;t had this problem with BB Cream.  I still have wrinkles of course but I really believe I look younger with it on.</li>
            <li> I actually only need to apply this product once and i&#x27;m set for the day! I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have oily combination skin, this product works and smells good, light on face  but it doesn&#x27;t really give me the coverage I&#x27;m expecting</li>
            <li> I ordered this and the Skin79 BB cream (pink bottle) and this is the perfect match for my skin tone.  I typically use Bobbi Brown Sand Beige or Mac NC30.  Goes on evenly using brush or fingers and smells great.</li>
            <li> Coverage is good, feels fresh and clean. But a little too dark a shade for me so I mix it with shade 21. Stays about 5 hours then I have to touch up after work. All in all a good bb cream.</li>
            <li> This is my favourite BB cream compared to some of the brands I&#x27;ve tried like The Face Shop and Skin79. The consistency is smooth and not thick, yet full coverage can be achieved. The colour is also not so greying on my skin, which is a big bonus. It&#x27;s great for the winter/fall months which may make your skin dry and dull.</li>
            <li> I love it the color match my skin. I will buy more I just wish I knew about this cream before.</li>
            <li> my skin looks younger and softer when I use this make up. After trying this one I got a lot of compliments for my skin. I only use this one and I will keep bying this product . is great and affordable 5 stars from me</li>
            <li> It has good coverage, it offers sun protection, you don&#x27;t really need concealer after using this. The problem is that this BB Cream is very smelly! It has a very strong smell and I wouldn&#x27;t call it a pleasant one. It also finished very fast, at least 2 times faster than other foundations I had.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the better BB Creams that are on the more affordable end of the spectrum. its a thicker consistency than some others, which is good for me because i need more coverage to cover my blemishes. I also love how it has SPF.</li>
            <li> This BB cream has a greyish cast that didn&#x27;t really fit my yellowish skin tone. It does look semi natural and gives you that dewy glow, but if you apply more than one layer, it starts to look cakey. The coverage is about a medium, and wear time is about 4-5 hours before you have to start blotting. I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it becouse the colore is gray.&lt;br /&gt;I use it many times with many powder but the color still gray.&lt;br /&gt;save your money</li>
            <li> I loveeee mishha bb cream! It is the real deal! Not those fake ones used for marketing approaches just because they have a big name! Buy these!</li>
            <li> This is my to go to makeup product, I depend on this bb cream and I recommend it to everyone ! I found results and I received a lot of compliments about my skin and how I rarely have wrinkles. I have a normal to dry skin (unfortunately). This bb cream feels like a thick moisturizer , it has a light to medium coverage so don&#x27;t expect it to hide all of your imperfections (pimples and scars). I also notice that the coverage is similar to my foundations . I don&#x27;t break out often so I prefer a light to medium coverage. I use a concealer before this product and my skin looks flawless. My skin has gotten a little brighter as well and my wrinkles are slowly fading away. I apply this on my fingers (2 small pumps) and then I would rub my fingers together and then apply it from the inner part of my face (Nose and out) to the out and then I would spread it everywhere else. Im a natural beige and the color matches me perfectly. It lasts forever during the day.  I will definitely be repurchasing this when I run out.</li>
            <li> Ordered this item in June and I just received it. I realized it&#x27;s coming from across the Pacific, so I wasn&#x27;t too impatient. In fact, I was so not impatient that I forgot I ordered it until the package arrived!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this product arrived, I bought a BB cream from Clinique and the BB cream from Garnier. I loved the Clinique product (good coverage, not greasy, didn&#x27;t make me break out, perfect shade). I hate the Garnier (hardly any coverage, smelled icky, color had a weird pink undertone, consistency was watery). I was quite content with the Clinique product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT! When I tried the Missha product for the first time, I was quite astounded. The texture was so smooth. Just think enough to provide coverage but light enough to just feel like face cream. It spread out pretty smoothly and uniformly. The color did have a \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; effect, but more of just adding a luminous glow to my face. It also had a perfume-y soap-y smell which I don&#x27;t love but can overlook. Just an amazing BB cream. I use it over a face serum and Clinique&#x27;s moisture surge moisturizer and it works great. Doesn&#x27;t streak. Doesn&#x27;t smear. Stays on for most of the day. It also works well with the Roth SPF powder brushed over it, if you need an SPF touch up. (And you do, after 2 hours.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still taking a point off for convenience since it did take FOREVER. But, like I said, worth the wait.</li>
            <li> The color tone was very wrong. Looks darker than my skin but when I apply it, it looks lighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this stuff</li>
            <li> it becomes grey quickly !</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I will never use anything else other than this product. The delivery came on time. The product itself smells great, it blends well and it&#x27;s very light on the skin. I would definitely recommend this  product.</li>
            <li> I think this is a quality product. Just not for me. I had originally ordered color21 and it was too light for my light skin tone and looked chalky. I never liked heavy foundations and never wanted to use them. I like the idea of a B&amp;B all in one cream and have used Garnier Miracle skin perfector. I love that product which gives light translucent cover with some sunscreen protection. Read reviews about the Missha product and decided to try it as it has much higher SPF and several other ingredients.  It just felt dry and harder to apply. One review said if u need moisture use that first then this product but that seems to defeat the convenience of using a B&amp;B cream. I have combination skin and don&#x27;t want too much oil but don&#x27;t like the chalky look I get with this product.  Like I said I think it&#x27;s a good cover and sunscreen with some great features just not for me.</li>
            <li> Great product!! I&#x27;m very  Happy with it :)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have an olive, acne-free skin. This cream is a very light alternative to foundation during the summer that helped to even out my skin color. I don&#x27;t know about the anti-aging benefits yet as I just started using it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for coverage if you have acne-prone skin as it doesn&#x27;t give enough coverage. Perfect for a dewy look.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I recieved the product within seven days after I ordered it. The product is very nice, I&#x27;ve been using it and it is just wonderful. Like everyone had said: a small amount goes a long way. Definitely will get another one once mine starts to run out. :)</li>
            <li> This review is not for the product itself (since I&#x27;ve yet to test it) but the physical packaging and container. I received the Missha BB Cream in the mail today and the padded envelope was torn. The hole was big enough for someone to take out the entire cream if they wanted to. Ok, so stuff happens in the mail and I understand that but once I opened the packaging and tried to pump out the cream, the pump didn&#x27;t work. Apparently, there was no tube inside the cream (the one that usually connects to the pump). It was totally missing. On top of it (and here&#x27;s where I may be kind of paranoid), the cream only filled 2/3 of the container. Seems like the container was not full. Something just seems a little off. Not sure if this has happened to anyone else? Anyhow, I will try the product itself and perhaps come back with an actual review on the performance of the cream. If the cream works well, next time I&#x27;m going to order it from the official Missha site.</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m giving this product an ok, is because I love this product, but the pump in this particular one did not work. I had to return it. I usually buy it from another website, and I probably will continue to buy it from there since this wasted my time. However it was very generous of amazon to give me a return slip for free, and didn&#x27;t take long to see my money back in my card.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry,so it was not creamy enough for me,the color was good! It went on dry and showed every line on my face!! :(</li>
            <li> I originally bought this a few months ago for my mom, but it was too light for her skin tone, so she gave it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried 5 BB creams so far, and Missha&#x27;s Perfect BB Cream ranks in at #2 (their Signature BB cream performed better for me).  You only need a little bit to cover your cheeks, a little more for the forehead and chin.  You can layer this up for more coverage, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it because it can look really cakey.  It has a faint fragrance, but nothing too jarring--and definitely not as strong as Garnier&#x27;s BB cream.  You can apply this with your hands, but make sure to warm it up first between your fingers, as this helps it spread better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coverage: I&#x27;d put this as light to medium coverage.  While it did a good job at covering my redness, it was not able to cover some acne scars on my chin and cheeks.  It seemed to somewhat cover my dark undereye circles.  The finish is natural -- matte and makes your skin look soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color: This is best for pale people.  I&#x27;m usually between NC20-25 with cool undertones and this color works perfectly.  However, it didn&#x27;t work for my mom, I&#x27;d say she&#x27;s around NC30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastability: If you don&#x27;t top this off with finishing powder, it won&#x27;t last very long.  I got 4-5 hours of wear with this cream before it started getting oily and revealing my patchy skintone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very good BB cream that looks best with pale skintones and offers a matte, clean finish.  However, it does not last long and can look oily after a while; it also does not cover blemishes well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the one product that I can never live without.  I&#x27;ve been using the Missha BB Cream No.23 now for almost 7 years and it&#x27;s never made me break out, gives me instant perfect complexion, doesn&#x27;t streak, and I always love the light fragrance of it.</li>
            <li> The color is much lighter than I expected.  I used a #27 this summer when I had a tan, and it was a perfect color for me, but it&#x27;s too dark now that it&#x27;s winter.  I opted for the #23, based on other user&#x27;s reviews and my own &amp;#34;guess&amp;#34; work.  There was much more of a difference from 27 to 23, and I have to send it back for, oh, maybe a 25?  Anyway, the product itself is really nice.  Easy to apply, great coverage and extremely natural looking. It&#x27;s a bit luminescent, so if you have oily skin, or prefer a matte finish, you may not like the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; of the makeup.  I have only worn Bare Minerals since 2000, so I&#x27;m getting used to a heavier makeup.  I think that it minimizes the appearance of my pores more than Bare Minerals does, but I still prefer the ease and lightness of Bare Minerals during the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a relatively medium tan asian (a bit on the light side) and I bought this bb cream because I don&#x27;t like heavy foundation. I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline/CG&#x27;s liquid foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to maybelline&#x27;s  bb cream, this BB cream is a bit thicker in consistency. It smells good and covers well.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, even on my relatively tan skin, the color is on the dark side, and it lacks in color - it&#x27;s more grey than beige.&lt;br /&gt;On the whole it&#x27;s fine, and it has great coverage, but the color is not suitable once again for rich or light skinned folk.</li>
            <li> I really like this Missha BB Cream. The color is very close to my own, but I use powder to blend it more. If you don&#x27;t use powder, it makes your skin look a little ashy, but I think this is because my skin tone is dark. It covers up most of my blemishes and makes my skin look great!</li>
            <li> This is not my favorite. It made me break out and I would not recommend it to anyone. So beware!</li>
            <li> This cream goes on a little off color but then blends to my skin in moments. Does not cake in lines and wrinkles. I will reorder this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It gives me a dewy, bright, youthful look that no other foundation gives me (I&#x27;m 35).  It also covers and conceals pretty well!  I have a few discolorations, and occasional cystic acne, and this really makes my skin look even and bright.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it is making any positive permanent changes to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the SKIN79 BB Cream, and, so far, I like them equally.  The SKIN79 product does seem to go a little farther, though.</li>
            <li> Love it! I dont regret buying this item!! I wear it every morning. This and my mascara is all I need now.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first but now i really love this product. Use this on most days and it has replaced the need for a sunscreen and foundation. Has more coverage than a tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li> This is a nice BB cream that is easily a good medium coverage foundation. My sister tried it and loved it as well.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite foundation. It last all day, looks natural and is in a convenient pump bottle. I only wish it was available at local drug stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one for unnatural heavy foundation and I&#x27;m so glad I found this! I&#x27;m currently on my second tube of this, the first last me over a year because I just use one pump to cover my whole face. I have the color #23 and at first I thought it was way too dark, but it blends like a dream into the skin and I just use my fingers, it&#x27;s awesome no dirty brushes! It gives just the right amount of coverage and still looks very natural, and it can be built up to full coverage. As for what it claims to do for the skin I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, but I didn&#x27;t get it for that, I&#x27;m just happy to use it in place of foundation, highly recommend for that!</li>
            <li> Feels like wearing no make-up!  Provides good coverage. Beware, goes on with a whitish look but quickly assimilates to your skin color.&lt;br /&gt;Would order again.</li>
            <li> The best BB cream for those with olive undertones in their skin.</li>
            <li> it feels very oily and makes me break out. I don&#x27;t recommend it if you have acne prone skin. Don&#x27;t buy it if you have acne problem.</li>
            <li> Nice coverage and a great delivery system.</li>
            <li> I purchased the wrong color but nonetheless, I&#x27;m giving this five stars. It isn&#x27;t their fault that I bought the wrong color. I can use it in the winter when my skin is paler and I truly can tell a difference in how it evens out my skin tone (and that is after I&#x27;ve taken the make up or when I wake up in the morning). I find it a little heavier than I&#x27;m used to but I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Covers up blemishes well with the natural skin tone shading.  However, it can cause some skin irritation for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased the one listed for $15.99 in March.  It was perfect.  Color was great and product packaging held up.  I November I purchased two of these...color is way different than the other and I do not like.  The pump quit working and it is all messy. I purchased two and am stuck to throw away.  I am going to throw these out and go back to the one for $15.99 and hope I get the product I purchased the first time.  I love love love that product.  I have very fair complexion and am in my late sixties.</li>
            <li> It has great coverage, but my skin is a bit too oily for this formula. Give it a try though,</li>
            <li> I purchased this BB cream on the impulse and due to a low price and lots of reviews. I don&#x27;t regret it even ignoring the fact that I can&#x27;t read what&#x27;s in it. If you have imperfections that are to be covered well but look natural, this is it. It goes on a little oily, especially if you apply it on top of a moisturizer, like I do. But it absorbs fast and ends up rather velvety and not shiny. After just one layer my skin looks almost flawless. Now I see what the whole BB cream hype is all about. Love it.</li>
            <li> Simply...I love it.&lt;br /&gt;One day while reading a magazine I found. In a review of several BB creams Missha someone commented on. Do not need more, I ordered. I received it a few days later. Certainly, their coverage and sunscreen last all day and feel comfortable. I love it!</li>
            <li> I thought I would try a BB Cream after reading articles in fashion mag. how they are almost magic.  Tried a drug store brand and was very disappointed, but then ordered Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream, great product.</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast and was in brand new box wrapped as well...was a little light for me but i made it work for me</li>
            <li> I ordered this hearing so many rave reviews about BB Creams. After research, this particular brand seemed to be the favorite and also do what it claims. I have hyper pigmentation from acne scarring and this has seem to help with evening out my skin tone and works well as a tinted moisturizer. A little heavy so a little dab will do ya! Smells nice. Light-Medium Coverage.</li>
            <li> Background: I have a bit of a tan and I&#x27;m Asian, and this BB cream, though it had a great consistency (not too thin but not creamy thick) and smells nice, is very desaturated in color. It&#x27;s not exactly really light - it&#x27;s just very desaturated, so it doesn&#x27;t have a sunny warm look, more of a cold, pale look. On my tanned Asian skin it looks like I&#x27;m wearing a death mask. Maybe I just picked the wrong color, but I&#x27;d want to know for sure this is the right color match before shelling out an amount of money for something that doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> I love this product, gives me a nice dewy finish but could be matted with a bit of powder. It hardly looks like I have makeup on and it evens out my skin tone. I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since, I&#x27;m not switching back to regular ol&#x27; foundation.</li>
            <li> I must say that I like the color of this more than the Etude House BB cream. And it does give that flawless skin look. However, it is a little too heavy for me and caused me to break out. If you want the perfect flawless look, I&#x27;d go for this. As for a natural glowing look, I would personally go for the Etude House BB cream.</li>
            <li> This is a really good BB cream. It provides almost full coverage, but even after letting it oxidize and adjust to my skin tone, it is still a little pink/gray for my neutral (leaning slightly yellow) skin tone. It is really creamy and easy to apply with your fingers, although I prefer a beauty blender. If I have a really pigmented blemish/pimple, etc. It will still show through a bit, but I shouldn&#x27;t expect completely full coverage from a BB cream, but it does make my skin look really smooth and helps blur my pores. This is definitely more coverage than most American BB creams, which I like, so if you have mild to moderate discolorations on your face, this will make your face look flawless. While probably not necessary, I do set it with a powder, although it dries pretty well - I just get really oily during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought from Beauty Best and it appears to be an authentic product.</li>
            <li> this product is a good product if you&#x27;re looking for great coverage. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s considering buying this.</li>
            <li> Covers everything without looking plastered on. The fact it is so good for your skin is also a bonus. Definately would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I ran out of this (which I bought for $50 at a Korean store) -- i was worried because some reviewers said it was fake, but it&#x27;s definitely exactly the same as the one I bought from the store only way more affordable!</li>
            <li> I use this almost on a daily basis. I really like it. It blends well and looks like your skin only better. Not sure if it improves skins condition any but still a good product. Much better than an BB cream I have purchased at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Have been obsessed with trying different BB creams since I&#x27;ve heard of it this year.  Went through 3 different ones from cheap (Garnier) to expensive (Clinique).  Was content with Clinique until I found this one...it absorbs into your skin giving you almost flawless natural coverage...others sit on top of your skin like an extra layer.  Lasts all day.  Mom asked me what I was using as my skin looked beautiful &amp; she is my worst critic.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Caused me to have pimples</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and goes on smoothly. However, I&#x27;ve been getting a couple pimples here and there when I use this. Not sure if it&#x27;s caused by this though.</li>
            <li> Color was pasty, there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> NIce BB cream, does good job smoothing out and covering up age spots and other imperfections.  Easy to apply, not too thin so it doesn&#x27;t do good coverage but also not too thick and clunky (like some other BB creams).  Great price.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because one of the ingredients on the box label is talc, which is not something I prefer to be applying daily.  Granted I don&#x27;t know if other BB creams also typically have talc or not.</li>
            <li> It came in two different colors.  There was no mention of that in the ad.  I had to reorder for my mother for mothers day</li>
            <li> It gives skin a nice glowy/smooth look, although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you are looking for full coverage for things like dark circles and so on.</li>
            <li> Very soft to skin, doesn&#x27;t look so cake like other bb cream ive tried, very light, but very perfect coverage! This shade 23, is perfect for my shade!! Is very not hi cost, will buy forever, my skin is very oily, and feel very confortable!!&lt;br /&gt;Loved it!!</li>
            <li> There is a definite reason that Missha BB creams are so highly regarded - it really does work. I find the coverage on this to be extremely sufficient for redness and discoloration. It goes on the skin very smoothly, and unlike some other BB creams that I&#x27;ve tried, does give that ashy complexion after a while. The result is natural and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> provides way less coverage then implicated. Is greasy and makes me very oily prone. Is way dark on me and im fair liek asian pale.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. Have been using for the last year and have gotten many compliments on my skin. Excellent price point. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing, it really hides blemishes well and lightens skin tone. I feel it might have a smoother texture after applying and leaving it for a while (it also leaves a grayish tint if you put too much on) but overall it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I have acne and combination skin. I am a medium beige. This natural beige is VERY light and has a tint of grey. It looks alot better on when you have it blended in after its oxidized a little bit. Using it alone I would look like I belong in a morgue but I add a little bit of bronzer on my cheek bones and forehead and its all good. It feels nice throughout the day doesn&#x27;t feel like I am wearing makeup. I have not been using it long enough to know if it really whitens and that it does not break me out. If it does I will update the review but if no update then its all good. I would give it 5 stars but I am not because I wish there was more moisturizing if you put this on and your skin is dry it does not look good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bb cream twice and really love it. I only put a small dot on each cheek and it blends into my skin. I have found that using it without moisturizer is best for me now that the weather is hot. My skin look flawless with this product and natural not like I am wearing makeup. I will reorder this product again. Both of the vendors I purchased from where  great one of my bb creams came from Seoul korea it came in a timely fashion and in very good shape.</li>
            <li> I originally left a bad review because the pump would not work, had I contacted the seller I would have had a better idea of how to work it and they were also willing to exchange it for a better one or refund my money.  I&#x27;m now sorry I didn&#x27;t contact them, they wrote me and asked if I could hold it upside down and pump it to see if that worked and it did work much to my shame.  It&#x27;s a very good product, it goes on smooth and is my skin color and I like that it has spf., so higher kudos for this company and it&#x27;s product!</li>
            <li> It worsen my acne, but my sister loves it because of its good coverage.</li>
            <li> So so...not that great as I expected...</li>
            <li> I got this product from a friend and it is by far the best BB cream ive ever used. Pigmented, long wearing, large color selection. Just all around amazing, and totallt worth it. Better than any high end ive tried, and i normally wouldnt say that :)</li>
            <li> It is thick, yet it blends well. It covers my redness and blemishes well, I only use a bit of concealer with it. I will certainly buy this again!</li>
            <li> I will never tell my friends I use this, but when I don&#x27;t use it, everyone tells me I look &amp;#34;ill&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works great for me. It&#x27;s not a full coverup, but I prefer that because I don&#x27;t want anything too heavy. It does start out a little gray but blends well. Definitely liked the product!</li>
            <li> Shade is perfect for fair complexions. Oxidizes without any noted ash discoloration. Skin tone is evened out with use. Lovely product, will purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> This was the first BB cream I tried and I have not had a reason to switch. It covers my dark spots and bumps very well without feeling to heavy and it evens out my skin tone super well. The only con to this product is that it leaves a greyish cast when you first put it on and its more notiecable the more you layer on. In order to decrease the greyish tint I simply mix in some of my foundation that has a yellow tint. I have noticed that even when I don&#x27;t do this the BB cream oxidizes and matches my skinetone better after a few hours. It also shows up very white in pictures because of the SPF. I&#x27;d rather use this BB cream with high SPF than any other suncreens however as most tend to be too greasy or they break me out. I really recommend this product especially if you&#x27;ve never tried a BB crema before.</li>
            <li> I ordered this without reading the ratings and it is different from the normal product i usually get. Don&#x27;t Buy</li>
            <li> This cream is for normal to dry skin. It´s a bit light but the finish in your skin looks super.</li>
            <li> I mix it with No27 which I purchased from the same company.  It is a bit too paled for me while using it alone.  It has good coverage and feels great on my skin.  It lasts longer than bare mineral powder.  I wish Missha offer &amp;#34;No25&amp;#34;, so I don&#x27;t need to mix the two shades myself.</li>
            <li> This cream covers beautifully, however it is a little dark for my skin tone. I also found it rather dry.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the new Olay BB (called CC) cream and was disgusted to learn from the clerk at the Beauty boutique that Olay just took a poorly selling BB product and placed a CC sticker over it. Voila! Corrective Cream! NOT. And the price tag was hefty compared to other brands (Garnier and L&#x27;Oreal). I am so pleased the clerk also told me that the concept of BB creams originated with the Asian gals and their products are more effective often containing high SPF&#x27;s. The issue she warned me was matching tone. So - with much research I settled on the MISSHA because, as a caucasian with light to med skin, not all brands would have a pigment dark enough. MISSHA No. 23 Naural Beige is perfect. Coverage is more than expected for such a sheer and light seeming cream. As others have commented, not much is needed and if you have a small blemish, another thin layer will suffice. I used a light mineral powdewr over to set and my face looks really great after a long day at the office. The first thing I noticed was that it really did diminish the appearance of my fairly large pores. Pretty cool. I have been a foundation junkie for years having used everything from Chanel to Laura Mercier. Wish I&#x27;d discovered this product sooner. I&#x27;m a fan and look forward to the other benefits over time.</li>
            <li> Doesnt match, not smooth, its not oil free I lost my money. Its the worst product I&#x27;ve ever had .</li>
            <li> This is a counterfeit product. FAKE FAKE FAKE! And I am wondering what these people have put in this makeup that I gave put on my face because it is NOT Missha. Probably made in China - not Korea.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago. The quality of this product was high and incredible. I recommend this product to you.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, not as it claims. I suggest you purchase&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline unwind age renewal foundation! Sooo much better.&lt;br /&gt;As I don&#x27;t wear foundation due to heaviness, I love this maybelline&lt;br /&gt;Product instead</li>
            <li> After reading good reviews, my wife decided to purchase this product. She tried it on her hand first to check the color and it was a perfect match. It blended really well. Unfortunately, after a closer inspection of the label, it&#x27;s expired (date on it was 20130121)... Needless to say, she was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I loved this prodect so much that I bought a second tube before the first one was gone. It has definitely improved the overall texture and tone of my skin. I love how it makes your skin look great but doesn&#x27;t look like you have make-up on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good product. One of the few bb creams that doesn&#x27;t cause me to have break outs. The shipping wasn&#x27;t particularly fast or anything, but it arrived around the time it said it would.</li>
            <li> I was surprised, they sent from Korea, they mail on 11/3/14 then I received on 12/2/14. good cosmetic came with box.</li>
            <li> Great product and delivery!  I can now look at my girlfriends face with joy!  ;-)</li>
            <li> Love this BB cream.  I originally received it in my Glossybox and found it here on Amazon with a great price and more colors to choose from.  It provides good coverage and isn&#x27;t too oily as some BB creams I have tried before.  I will continue to use this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an average beige complexion Asian woman and had been looking for a BB cream to use. I found this based on reviews on Amazon. It goes on a bit gray but blends in really well and hides imperfections. Got a number of compliments on how good my skin looked. As the instructions are in Korean, a bit worried if I should be using this cream while breast feeding (right now using vary sparingly).</li>
            <li> Great product. Covers very well and actually I think my skin is in better condition since using it. Long lasting. The only thing is, it seems to start drying right away so you have to blend it in quickly. Once on it won&#x27;t wipe off on a tissue like most bb creams. You need to wash your face to remove it.</li>
            <li> This was the first BB Cream that I purchased along with a BB Cream from Etude House, this BB cream worked so well that I did not even use the one from Etude House. It makes your skin beautiful literally at the end of the day when you wash it off your skin still looks flawless. It covers so much of my problem areas and does not cause me to break out I love this BB Cream and will never ever use another brands BB Cream as long as Missa makes BB Creams.</li>
            <li> I have the worst skin and I have been told I have beautiful skin when I wear this product! I apply it with a foundation brush and then pat with a sponge to remove any extra ! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical buying make-up online without being able to try it first.  I wore it the first day to a non-important event and before I could ask my friend how it looked, she mentioned that she loved whatever I was using, my skin looked radiant!  I&#x27;m very happy and love the SPF protection it offers as well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful BB cream!  Will order again!  Looks beautiful when used with primer.  Love how it makes my skin look, without being &amp;#34;made-up&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this product! Effective &amp; affordable. Evens skin tone without causing oilyness. Highly recomment</li>
            <li> i love this bb cream!! it doesnt have a nasty smell!</li>
            <li> ok, dont know if i would purchase again....prefer the Stila products.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with 3 other brands (of the same product - BB Cream). This came out the winner in terms of coverage. Only need to apply once.  Color is good for my skin (asian)tone.</li>
            <li> Love this BB cream. Once again, non-western BB Cream is where it&#x27;s at! The color was slightly grey and I used bronzing powder to fix that problem. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the CREAM is great. I just chose the wrong color.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product&lt;br /&gt;Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> My sister suggested that I purchase this due to the fact that she swears by this brand/cream. I bit the bullet and placed my order, and am happy to say that she is 100% correct in her love and admiration of such a cream. This BB has a light and lovely feel to it and it leaves my face feeling so perfect. At the risk of sounding like an egomaniac: my skin looks amazing! And, the 23 (color) is really a nice neutral that would go with many a complexion. I would recommend it anyone!</li>
            <li> Must we put another positive review for the MISSHA M PERFECT COVER BB Cream No. 23?  YES WE DO!  This is the 3rd bottle that I&#x27;ve purchased and I&#x27;m sooo scared to try anything else.  This isn&#x27;t heavy coverage, more medium coverage.  However, I love it because it makes my face look more natural instead of a caked on mask.  I love it so much!!!  It&#x27;s also soooooooo much cheaper to buy it from this seller than when I see it out in the stores!  Also, the delivery is very quick!  Good luck!</li>
            <li> The order came in two days.  I really like how it smell,look and feel on my face.  I love that fact that it looks very natural.  I would definity recommand this product.</li>
            <li> LIKE THIS VERY MUCH,,WHAT A DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN,,LOVE THE WAY IT COVERS THE FLAWS ON MY FACE,,IT IS VERY LIGHT AND NOT GREASY,,FEELS GOOD ON MY FACE</li>
            <li> I was looking for a BB Cream that would provide good coverage for my spots and unevenness.  This product did the trick.  My skin is dry with yellow undertones and this product blended well into my skin.  I have also bought the SKIN79 Super+ Beblesh Balm but find the shade of the MISSHA much more natural and warm and the coverage thicker and smoother.  I do wear a serum underneath and sometimes will wear a light moisturizer if my skin is extra dry.  Overall, I love this product and would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I just find this product too sticky and heavy. I had developed some pimples so I decided to stop using it. It just doesn&#x27;t fit my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can ever use a different product. Stays on almost all day. Is thick but feels light when you put it on.</li>
            <li> Really love this product. I bought this Misha BB cream in South Korea and still using it for over a year now. It covers my face really well.</li>
            <li> I have older oily skin and i live in the desert. i have to be careful to exfoiliate and find products that don&#x27;t clog my pores. I&#x27;m thrilled with this cream, it provides a lightweight, flexible coverage that seems to last all day. Coworkers have commented on how young my skin looks, and it has some very fine light-reflecting particles that make my dkin glow without being sparkly.&lt;br /&gt;Comments: i can&#x27;t really wear anything on top of it, like blusher, because it won&#x27;t blend well.  Also, the color I chose off the internet, #23, is a bit ashy, so I mix it equal parts with Clinique CC cream which is a bit warm for my complexion.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup.I have already had one a long time ago and I went to look for more on Amazon and found it I was glad I ordered more of it and I have to say it really is good makeup covers real good and good matte finish and the color is perfect does not make you break out either for the price its really good stuff its like really high end makeup. Try it you will love it just like I did.</li>
            <li> after trying it for quite some time, i&#x27;ve gotta say the coverage is GREAT (it&#x27;s really good for people with many imperfections) BUT! it does feel like the cream sort of cakes on. after a few hours of it applied, my skin (oily skin type) starts to shine like no other!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr - the imperfections get covered quite well, but it feels cakey</li>
            <li> This product has a VERY strong \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; scent that lingers for awhile; I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances, but this was so strong that it gave me a headache. It also made me breakout out in the spot where I tried it out after a single use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is much drier than the american BB creams that I have tried, so you may need several pumps to get enough product to cover your face. The coverage is good although it does make you look a bit paler than normal (I have light beige skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product would work well for someone who enjoys a perfumey scent and whose skin does not have sensitivity to fragrances; I would suggest applying a nice lotion before using this product.</li>
            <li> I love BB Creams vs Foundation, but with my skin type I found this particular BB Cream a bit too dewy looking for my face.&lt;br /&gt;I need more of a matte type..this made my face look very shiny.</li>
            <li> I LOVE BB CREAMS. I knew this one was a really popular one among American people so I went to a Missha shop here in Korea to test it out. The thing that made me not want to purchase it was the smell. I particularly don&#x27;t like things that have a scent and I felt like I wouldn&#x27;t enjoy the scent of this bb cream. It&#x27;s not super strong but quite potent enough to have a sniff. The consistency seemed a tiny bit dry and cakey but I think it would give great great coverage.  It also kind of showed up with a grey cast (initially) which kind of scares me a tiny bit. But of course it gets oxidized and changes color (not too much though..)^^. I&#x27;m not against trying it out but I personally didn&#x27;t pick it up simply because of small various factors. I own Etude House&#x27;s Bright Fit Mineral BB Cream in W13/Natural Beige and I really really love this one. It doesn&#x27;t have a grey cast and it gives you a very natural finish with very decent coverage (buildable). Most of the time I really can&#x27;t tell if I have anything on my face. It just looks soo natural. And I definitely don&#x27;t have great skin. I use it to cancel out my redness and blemishes. You can read my review on Amazon. This particular BB cream from Missha retails (in Korea) for 11,000  won which is around $10.40. $13.46 is really really reasonable but if you add the shipping your spending 8 more bucks which I guess isn&#x27;t incredibly bad considering your not buying it in Korea but just FYI on how much it&#x27;s actually worth :). One thing I forgot to mention is that it has great SPF (SPF 42 PA+++). All in all, I can&#x27;t give a true true review since I don&#x27;t use it on a regular basis but this was just my first impression and some of the reasons on why I didn&#x27;t purchase this!</li>
            <li> So i got this product few days ago.. right when i put this on, the color was much darker than what i expected. The coverage was great, but i looked like an oompa loompa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, i realized there&#x27;s only half of the product inside. I used it only 4 or 5 times and the product was already running out. I was really disappointed</li>
            <li> First of all, shipping was a day faster than promised! Then, I was really surprised that this cream really is what I hoped it would be.  I&#x27;d been using Bare Minerals for years, and to be honest, I&#x27;m getting tired of it, because during the day, I would see the \\&quot;shine\\&quot; in my face, and overall, just dying to find a different foundation product. This cream is very light to the feel, not cakey at all. It smoothens out my face nicely and looks natural.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup, and this is pretty much what I need for everyday use.  And the price isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> Missha BB Cream evens out your whole skin tone making your face a perfect palette with which to apply your makeup and look your best!  It also moisturizes (but is NOT greasy!) and has SPF 42...lots of benefits in one product...and very affordable.  I find that the Korean brands perform much better than their American counterparts.</li>
            <li> I have been using Skin 79 Oriental BB cream.  I started looking for something that has color choices that would better suit my skin color and my oily skin.  Missha M Perfect Cover BB Cream no. 23 is a true match for my skin color and oily skin.  I only use a little bit (about 3 little pumps), just enough to cover my face.  It doesn&#x27;t cover some skin discolorations, which I don&#x27;t really expect it to do.  I use Smashbox concealer to take care of that.  For my allergy eyes (they do get tired looking), I use Maybelline Dream Lumi Touch Radiant Highlighting Concealer in Ivory.  To set my &#x27;makeup&#x27;, I just use Maybelline Dream Matte Powder in Sandy Beige.  The result is even skin tone that lasts the whole day!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t going to use this under my makeup as I thought beige on beige would be too much, but it seems to tone in perfectly with my foundation creating a flawless finish.  I use Maybelline dream matt mousse medium beige over the top just for more coverage.  Makes my makeup last all day.  Really glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li> It was too white on my face and did not feel any moisture. It felt like white clay on my face.  But now I use it to cover up bruises.  Makes a good concealer. Very satisfied with the delivery service. Received it much sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Lighter texture than other BB creams, but too dark for me.  No 21 was too light.  I could use this in the summer.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. It didn&#x27;t make me break out. It covers well but i got the wrong color. I put this on and then a bronzer on top and it worked well. I want to get this in a darker shade.</li>
            <li> I order missha m for my 85 years old mother, after one use she was amazed how nicely covering all of imperfection on her face.</li>
            <li> Light coverage but even tone. Gives a natural yet clean look. Easy to remove. SPF is a plus. Convenient packaging.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this bb cream. The medium coverage is just enough to dull my blemishes and the super lightweight formula feels amazing on my skin. The #23 is slightly too cool for my summer tan skin tone, but this bb cream darkens a bit as it oxidizes and with just a little contouring looks natural and brightening. I would love to try the #27, but I&#x27;ve yet to find a great deal on it. I love how it evens my skin tone and texture without feeling heavy or like its just sitting on my skin and even better, little bit goes a long way. I was able to make one 50ml tube last more than 3 months with daily wear. I&#x27;ve had my friends and a couple coworkers try this bb cream and every single one has loved it. This is my holy grail bb cream.</li>
            <li> Love this product and I will definitely buy it again, as soon as I finish the one that i just got.  Thanks you guys! :)</li>
            <li> I love this bb cream because the fact that it have high SPF. Also, it doesn&#x27;t make my face look cakey. To me it gives just enough coverage and a very natural looking, so bare in mind that this is not a full coverage what so ever. Compare to other bb cream that I&#x27;ve used this is one of the best bb cream out there.</li>
            <li> Does not meet my skin color gave me a grayish look.  Started to have pimples and dries my skin.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE PRODUCT  BUT THE COLOR  DID NOT MUCH  MY SKIN 15ML. BUT THE TUBE IS NOT FULL  VERY SLOW SHIPPMENT</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews. I&#x27;m glad I did. After a month of use I noticed my skin was very clear and even toned. My acne scars were all  gone.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff but it works.  I love that it is SPF 40 and protects my skin from future damage.  I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> This color is better for me than no. 21.(too light). Easy to apply. Lovely results. Covers wrinkles without looking made up. Even though I have light hair and blue eyes, my skin is not fair so this makeup is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> much thicker than i thought. didn&#x27;t make my skin feel moist. didn&#x27;t blend in that well. almost seemed like it had expired.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best make up products I have ever purchased ! Never mind the great price even with high shipping charges.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely look into more products by this company. SPF of 42, excellent, excellent coverage.</li>
            <li> As for this BB Cream, it&#x27;s my first one so I can&#x27;t really say how well it is compared to -blank-.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is really nice to put on, and blends in well after it finishes oxidizing. It certainly does moisturizes my skin (to be honest  though, I blend it in with a bit of moisturizer..:P).&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what to say about this because this is my first cream so I&#x27;m not entirely sure what to expect out of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this BB cream for two years now and love it. The 40 SPF is true, it offers great protection. I have dry 50 year old skin, so I usually wear a moisturizer under it, but often don&#x27;t need to in the summer. It&#x27;s a light to medium coverage, with a great finish. I tried another high end CC cream that supposedly offered a 50 SPF, but got a terrible sunburn and returned to the Missha. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Like it, but don&#x27;t know if SPF is good enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 years ago and I thought I&#x27;d make a review now. Lemme just tell you that I bought this 2 years ago- I bought 2 bottles...and I&#x27;m just beginning to use the 2nd bottle. It DOES make ur skin brighter, lighter, without looking cakey :) You only need a small amount too. Oh and I recommend using a foundation brush to spread out the entire product all over your face. It has spf 42 I believe (i dont have to use sunscreen anymore). It doesn&#x27;t fully cover my blemishes, so I do have to use my own concealer (I use sonia kashuk). I get a lot of compliments that my face is flawless LOL.</li>
            <li> I tried the sampler kit and this one gives the best coverage I do mix it with the skin79 super bb cream and this works for me . I&#x27;m 50 and have some sun spots and fine lines and am medium complected .</li>
            <li> Blends easily and covers nicely on the discoloration areas on my face.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this BB! It covers wonderfully and it just makes me feel beautiful when I put it on. I am definitely ordering more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> Its cover ability is very pefect. And give me a perfect appearance to show my confidence! I would like to continue use it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after reading many reviews. I was worried about it causing breakouts, since I have very sensitive acne prone skin. I am on week 3 of using this product and happy to report that I have yet to see a pimple!  This cream blends well with my skin tone, even though it goes on with a slight greyish hue, within a minute it is virtually invisible. It does a good job of covering my old acne scars, although I have to apply 2 coats over the darker marks to get good coverage. It isnt cakey and lasts for hours! Great product!!</li>
            <li> So far so good great in the natural color easy to apply great coverage.  Took a while to arrive 7 days ?</li>
            <li> My face in the summer is too oily for it.</li>
            <li> I just recieved this last week so i am not seen any changes of my skin yet.</li>
            <li> No 23 is a little too fair for my skin! I don&#x27;t think i like the fragrance, would prefer if is fragrance free! A little to pasty or thick than I compare with some other BB cream.</li>
            <li> Purchased this after reading reviews................I&#x27;m always looking for the Holy Grail.  this is it for me.  Not too greasy, the perfect shade, altho, I was skeptical when I first saw it.  Thought it much dark............surprise, it is great!  I would recommend it and will purchase again</li>
            <li> When I first heard of BB Cream on TV, I went to amazon.com to poke around and read the reviews. Then I went to Youtube to check out the videos.  There are a number that demonstrate the various kinds of BB cream but still difficult to decide what works for me.  Once I became aware of the types of BB creams and manufacturers, I went onto the manufacturer&#x27;s website to check out the ingredients, the color, and what type of skin the BB cream is good for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having bought 5 different kinds and receiving 2 from a friend in Asia and tried them all, the Missha M Perfect BB Cream #23 is the one - for me.  All of the rest are simply too light in color and the Missha M Perfect BB Cream #27 is more yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s about me. I have Asian skin. No tan. Not pale. Don&#x27;t wear makeup. Have some small freckles and small dark spots from the sun - nothing dramatic though. Skin toward sensitive and dry side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this BB Cream - M Perfect # 23:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s light and smooth when pumped out.&lt;br /&gt;2. It has a grey looking tone - don&#x27;t really like at first sight - and upon initially put on the face, the color looks lighter shade than my skin color.  But after 15 minutes, the grey tone goes away, the color shade blends well with my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;3. Here&#x27;s the best - it evens out my skin tone.  Red areas not as red, freckles not as obvious. It just produces an overall better and even looking face. Since I don&#x27;t wear makeup, I really am not looking for foundation stuff to cake up my face.&lt;br /&gt;4. It has 42 SPF.  If nothing at all, use it as sun screen because it is not oily like the typical sun screen.&lt;br /&gt;5. It lasts all day and does not irritate.&lt;br /&gt;6. I only use half a pump, if that much, and still have left over for the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this BB Cream #23 to my sister, sister-in-law, daughter and a friend.  They are all using this one now.  The only wish they have is that this BB cream is a tad darker.  But it&#x27;s still verygood as is.</li>
            <li> Blends in really well with my skin tone.  I would have given it 5 stars but I&#x27;m used to a product that lasts all day.  I find that I usually have to add a little powder later in the day.  Other than that, I&#x27;m thrilled with not having to use sunscreen, moisurizer and foundation separately.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is a true beauty balm.  With this BB cream I do not have to wear moisturizer underneath, or sunscreen.  It is moisturizing all on it&#x27;s own and has SPF protection built in.  It covers more like a foundation, but not quite as thick.  I like this color for winter, and the no. 27 for summer.  My skin is softer and my freckles have lightened while using this product.  My makeup does looks more natural and not cakey.</li>
            <li> good and even coverage. didn&#x27;t feel greasy. didn&#x27;t make my face too white. this was my first of two bb creams to try so far.  i will keep trying out other brands, but i have a hunch that i will go back to this one in the future.</li>
            <li> I like the color and coverage is very light.My problem with it is the high perfume odor.It is made in Korea and it did not contain instructions in English.I am allergic to many perfumed products for that reason I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This cream comes on smooth and smells pleasant.  It blends in perfectly with my skin tone and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all.</li>
            <li> It meets my expections because I serves many beneficial aspects for my face such as covering blemishes and dark spots, making my face look smoother and prettier.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this BB cream because of the SPF coverage, the reviews I&#x27;ve read, the comments I&#x27;ve heard from people about BB creams etc. I was insanely disapointed with this BB cream. Not only did this cream NOT give me much coverage, it smelled rancid of cheap perfume and left this shinny look to my face that I hated. It did NOT set smoothly at all either but left my face feeling overly heavy, oily, and super shiney. Just NO! This product only got 2 stars for 2 reasons- 1: fast shipping and 2: The bottle design is a great concept.</li>
            <li> MISSHA M Perfect Cover BB Cream is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect coverture and very easy to apply; I strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good BB Cream. Just not for those with acne like me cuz it may break you out.</li>
            <li> MIssha M perfect cover was not what I expected, but it&#x27;s alright. I&#x27;m going to try Garnier&#x27;s next hope it&#x27;s what I want.</li>
            <li> Not the best bb cream for oily skin or skin with blemish marcks but it works with a little ducting of poweder or the t-zone.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to give missha 23 a try.  Really the product. Very light on my skin and great coverage on my spotty skin. This is all I  wear now no more foundation.  And the SPF is high which is a plus.  Would recommend.  This is my part of my daily routine now.  Lots of compliments</li>
            <li> She hasnt said anything about it, so I believe shes happy with the purchase.  If she werent happy, shedve said so.</li>
            <li> odd color cast with a death mask look.  I&#x27;m sure it is great for some.  I will continue to use my Clarins tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this BB cream. It is a little light so mix it with No. 27 to get right shade. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> It is great for sensitive skin and I like how it naturalize skin color. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> The best cover up yet!</li>
            <li> This cream didn&#x27;t match my skin tone.  However, I had an easy time with the seller returning the product for a full refund.</li>
            <li> my first time using BB cream and I love it! It goes on a litttle shiny but I use finishing powder and it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. I kind of like the Maybelline BB a little better but either one is good. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Decently priced product here in amazon. I used this product for a couple of months now so I can sum up the pros and cons of this bb cream.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- this product will definitely last you a long time and the price is hard to beat&lt;br /&gt;- high SPF and lots of skin benefits&lt;br /&gt;- good for light and dry skinned people&lt;br /&gt;- it will oxidize to fit your skin tone&lt;br /&gt;- medium coverage and looks wonderful when it finally set on the skin&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- not for oily skin and it will look like you put petroleum jelly all over your face if you don&#x27;t set it with a powder&lt;br /&gt;- takes a long time to set and oxidize (30 min or more) and it will look a bit unnatural when worn the first couple of hours (2-3 hours) with a setting powder</li>
            <li> This is an okay product to use when you don&#x27;t want to put too much makeup. This does cover your light skin flaws. But the color is a little too light for me and the texture is thicker than expected.</li>
            <li> i love this product.. i can not say enough of this.. it is just perfect for my skin tone and give me good look with out liquid foundation or powder like cakey.. i am a fair skin asian so if you are, this is perfect for you...</li>
            <li> I like the coverage of this bb cream and the high SPF. However, it makes my skin very oily. I tried it with and without moisturizer underneath.</li>
            <li> I am olive toned.  I also have melasma on my cheeks, chin and around my mouth.  I have tried many different foundations and bb creams.  I purchased this along with the perfect concealer and I have to say, my face looks almost flawless and does not look like I have makeup on.  It also almost completely covers my melasma. I love it.  It goes on with a grey cast but blends in with my skin tone within secs. I have had so many compliments for my complexion since I have been using this. I am also pleased that both the bbcream and the concealer have a high SPF.  I am slightly dry, so I use moisturizer with SPF then apply the bbcream and concealer. Looks like I have a flawless skin tone when done.</li>
            <li> not the right color.........can&#x27;t return it can&#x27;t use it........waste of money and don&#x27;t require me to add more words to this surey as it is insult to injury</li>
            <li> A little thick but gives good coverage.</li>
            <li> The authenticity label is missing- so I wonder if the product is original or a conterfeit. Had to press it 30+ times for the pump to work</li>
            <li> When applied it seems to have a firming affect.  I thought that was a plus.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very prone to oil/ shine when I wear makeup even with oil free cosmetics...however when I apply this BBCream it controls my shine all day!! I wish I would have discovered this stuff before, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and don&#x27;t like using liquid foundation or any of the bb creams. I feel I like they just clog my pores and make me even oilier. But I am soooo happy I gave this a try! It&#x27;s amazing! It does not feel heavy and yet it does a full coverage. My face stays looking good all through out the day. Couldn&#x27;t be more happy. :)</li>
            <li> This really has reduced my blemishes overall, even during my cycle!  It has great coverage, and it&#x27;s not pink.  The yellow undertones work great for my Asian skin.</li>
            <li> Arrived on the day it was promised. This is the best B.B. cream I have ever used, and I have purchased dozens over the years. First it has a SPF of 42!! It is very moisturizing and offers full coverage. I used to use a separate product for sun protection, then yet another to moisturize and then to top if all off a foundation. Today I only use this one amazing product and my skin looks so good. I can&#x27;t believe the coverage this cream provides, it leaves my skin looking flawless.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It looks beautiful on the skin without looking fake. Love the spf in it! Pairing it with a darker foundation since this a tad light it looks great!</li>
            <li> A lovely BB Cream with great coverage and excellent wear. Slightly deeper and more yellow than #21, looks very nice on.</li>
            <li> I really like this bb cream is one of the best.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this BB Cream. It covers well and does not get greasy throughout the day. I will defiantly be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I really adore this BB cream. It does have a stronger scent, so if you are sensitive, look elsewhere. It also has a grey tone when you first apply, but it adjusts to your skin shortly after. I prefer using this in the colder months as it is hydrating and might look oily in the warm weather. Another con is that it only lasts for about 6 hours, but that is typical for a BB cream. Overall, I give this 4 stars because the coverage is really great and it has skincare benefits that I can safely say do help - it does not break me out or worsen my acne. Plus, it has one of the highest SPF&#x27;s in BB cream/foundations out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream for about a year and a half- or maybe two years. Ever since the first application, I&#x27;ve been in love. I sing high praises of it to every girl I know, and eventually converted most of my friends to fellow Perfect Cover BB Cream fans. It smells lovely, covers acne, acne marks, scars, enlarged pores, and leaves my skin looking and feeling fresh and dewy. On top of that, it&#x27;s not too pink and not too yellow. If you&#x27;re weighing your options with BB creams right now, look no further. It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and great on my skin.  I just got it a few days ago in the mail but I hope that after using it for a while, it will improve my skin.  I love how it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few BB creams in the last few months and this one is by far the BEST! The coverage is better than any other, a little goes a long way, it smells amazing and after applied, a little powder is all you need to set it.  Other BB creams have worn off by the end of the day or separated, this one doesn&#x27;t.  TRY IT!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried a LOT of BB creams but this one is definitely at the top of my list. I have combination skin with very large pores, uneven skin tone, and mild acne, and I would normally wear a primer, concealer, and Bare Minerals foundation. However I can wear Missha BB cream by itself and it looks great. When you first squeeze it out of the bottle the color may look somewhat &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; or grayish but as you rub it into your skin it actually looks incredible. It blends easily and lasts well throughout the day. Fabulous product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have heard about the good propties of BB creams.  I have light to medium skin and I usually wear a Clinique foundation in Natural so I orderd the Natrual Beige.  It was several shades lighter than my skin and in comparison to the Clinique foundation.  It gave me no color I looked very pale with it on.  I was very disappointed and I have gone back to my Clinique foundation.</li>
            <li> I usually never give reviews. However, I have to for this. I have never had such a slow delivery in my entire life. I ordered this product on the December 4. It was suppose to come sometime between December 6-11. However, it&#x27;s already the 14th and it still has not come yet. I am VERY disappointed in this company and will not be ordering anything else from them. EVER.</li>
            <li> Color is very good, covers well. Kind of hard to remove but I would buy it again. It will be a good cover for a rafting trip we are planning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure about this. I like it, but I have a hard time getting it to look right. I actually like to use a thin layer under foundation as kind of a primer. Then the slightly off gray color doesn&#x27;t matter, but I get the benefits.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom for a Christmas gift, and she says it is WONDERFUL. She uses it daily.</li>
            <li> do not buy this item; it&#x27;s january 2013, and i was sent an item that expired in october of 2012. very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I will try to another brand</li>
            <li> this is the 3rd time I am ordering and I can&#x27;t stop suing this!!!&lt;br /&gt;color is perfect with the spf 42. this bb cream is going to be my summer bb cream.</li>
            <li> i ordered it on March 21, and i received it in the mail in three days.. so thats sooner than the expected shipment date. This BB Cream is light weight, i suggest to shake the product first before using. Coverage is BUILDABLE and flawless!!! no joke.. lol i pumped out one tiny drop and started dotting around the center area of my face and blended it all over.. My face didnt have uneven yellow undertones, and my eye bags disappeared. My pores on my nose were gone too! for once, i didnt have to work hard on my foundation routine. it feels like you&#x27;re just putting on moisturizer. It may look darker than your skin tone, but after you dot it and blend it out all over your face, it will oxidize and blend with your natural skin tone.. BUT also enhance it more !</li>
            <li> I hardly used it but when I did it worked ok. It&#x27;s nothing that I couldn&#x27;t live without.. but it&#x27;s ok. I didn&#x27;t see what the big hype about this product was all about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this BB creme for 2 years, and can&#x27;t bring myself to even try any others. It covers without looking cakey, and still feels light. I don&#x27;t even use concealer! It&#x27;s light in color, but with a little bronzer on top, the look is very natural. It&#x27;s a Korean product, so I was thrilled to see it here on amazon!</li>
            <li> I have acne scars.  I am self conscious about them, but I feel like this product covers them well.  It is not oily or cakey like many products.  I don&#x27;t feel like I can&#x27;t wait to wash my face with a lot of products.  I have tried many kinds of foundation, including the  spray on product and powdered minerals, which I loved.  But they would show the fine lines around my eyes.  This product does not.  I like this better</li>
            <li> This bb cream blends with your skin color so easy but it&#x27;s not my favorite color to wear all the time, so I usually use it when I need to wear sunblock since normal sunblock will turn oily on my face, but this one sits dewey and just perfect.&lt;br /&gt; It covers all the red quite well and I don&#x27;t need to apply powder or anything else so it&#x27;s the fastest way to putting my face on.&lt;br /&gt; It doesn&#x27;t make me break out, doesn&#x27;t make me oily and comes off easier than other makeup I use and lasts almost all day.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!  The product works well, but doesn&#x27;t help much with my oily skin.  It&#x27;s very lightweight and easy to apply with hands or with a brush.</li>
            <li> This product lasts all day. I&#x27;ve tried Loreal and Maybelline BB creams, and this product is definitely of a much higher quality. A little goes a long way! The coverage is light/medium but it reduces redness on my skin. I use it mostly during the cooler fall/winter months when my skin has a lighter shade.</li>
