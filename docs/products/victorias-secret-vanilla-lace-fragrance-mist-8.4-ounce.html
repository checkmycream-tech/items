            <li>This might be good for some people and it&#x27;s definitely not a bad smelling spray.</li>
            <li>very light scent.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as sweet and nice as warm vanilla sugar from Bath and Body Works.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for sure, but the vanilla isn&#x27;t as strong as Body Fantasies.</li>
            <li>I love that fragrance, additionally moisturizes and nourishes the skin.</li>
            <li>I will for sure order more from this company.   </li>
            <li>u dnt hve to keep spraying this on u it lasts and it smells delicious especially if you love the smell of vanilla</li>
            <li>I know a lot of people love this scent</li>
            <li>After a while, it starts to smell more like alcohol and Vanilla.</li>
            <li>Even my toddlers like when i wear this:)</li>
            <li>I think this is my favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Besides, i have received lots of compliments since i started using it, i love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this fragrance-not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I love the vanilla smell and this is what I was looking for</li>
            <li>This scent is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This is a better version of body fantasy&#x27;s vanilla fantasy.</li>
            <li>Its okay.</li>
            <li>The scent is very strong and sweet, and quite frankly too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for summer, but I use it all year long!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light and sweet.</li>
            <li>My husband loves the scent and sometimes other comment on how wonderful it smells.  </li>
            <li>It wears off easily</li>
            <li>Having had only great experiences with Amazon purchases, I bought it thru Amazon without even looking to see what others were charging.  </li>
            <li>This is a light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>But not too sweet or strong.</li>
            <li>Everything from the sprayer to the design of the bottle is user friendly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Buying scented stuff without being able to smell it first is a gamble, as I&#x27;ve found out with some stuff.</li>
            <li>all Victoria Secret refreshing body exquisite strike me</li>
            <li>Although I was told Vanilla Lace is one of VS&#x27;s most popular fragrances, for the second time VS has decided to discontinue offering it, so I am stocking up wherever I can find it.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the kind of scent you&#x27;ll wear everyday, more like the one you&#x27;ll use when you run out of your favorite one.</li>
            <li>For anyone who likes sweet, musky scents, this is for you.</li>
            <li>My biggest issue with this scent is that it&#x27;s SO sweet.  </li>
            <li>Light, fresh and warm...like cookies.</li>
            <li>Shipping was moderate, but considering it came all the way from America to Asia, it was good.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been searching for something to replace the warm, soft, NATURAL vanilla scent that I love.  </li>
            <li>Such a sweet warm smell, everyone should have a bottle of this.</li>
            <li>Its not too strong and it really smells like vanilla.</li>
            <li>Seems like the nice elegant scents like these are being replaced with the pungent \\&quot;seductive\\&quot; scents destroying the air I breathe.</li>
            <li>Happened to pass one of their stores on my on my rare trips to a mall and went in to see if they were carrying it again.  </li>
            <li>I was almost nauseous just catching the occasional scent of it on me through-out the day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s currently sitting on my dresser more than 2/3 full, because i don&#x27;t use it and will never use it again.</li>
            <li>loveeee this very much</li>
            <li>It certainly lacks a natural vanilla scent and there&#x27;s nothing soft and warm about it.</li>
            <li>u will go back for the otion because iys so goo youll love this</li>
            <li>Lo and behold, Amazon came up as one of the first source listed.  </li>
            <li>But VS got so many complaints, that they had to bring it back.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The longevity of this scent is too short, a good fragrance should last all day.</li>
            <li>responsible.</li>
            <li>Victoria Secret Vanilla Lace is truly refreshing and sexy.</li>
            <li>It has kind of a strong smell of a stale vanilla in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Actually, I think I smell like a fresh baked sugar cookie.  </li>
            <li>This is the last fragrance i&#x27;ll buy from their garden collection, next time i&#x27;ll be sure to stick with the PINK and Beauty Rush items.</li>
            <li>Personally, it&#x27;s a very subtle scent, very aromatic, and it&#x27;s my favorite that she wears.  </li>
            <li>But if you like classy, subtle scents with light notes, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>I often found myself spraying large amounts, because the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Nearly anyone who has an &#x27;annoyance&#x27; to strong scents would find it difficult to complain about someone using this.  </li>

            <li> This is a wonderful deal.  I ordered it Mon.night and just received it today, Wed.  I will for sure order more from this company.   Thank you for the great service and price.</li>
            <li> Victoria Secret Vanilla Lace is truly refreshing and sexy. My husband loves the scent and sometimes other comment on how wonderful it smells.  The only down fall is that it is over priced.  I guess this price is based on the discontinuation of sale at  Victoria Secrets.</li>

            <li> Since Victoria&#x27;s Secret quit carrying this product several years ago, my wife missed this distinctive scent.  Happened to pass one of their stores on my on my rare trips to a mall and went in to see if they were carrying it again.  Being told no, I decided to do a Google search for the item when I got home.  Lo and behold, Amazon came up as one of the first source listed.  Having had only great experiences with Amazon purchases, I bought it thru Amazon without even looking to see what others were charging.  And --- my wife&#x27;s now happy with me so what could possibly be a downside to this?!?!?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing vanilla body oil for years and the company discontinued it.  So I&#x27;ve been searching for something to replace the warm, soft, NATURAL vanilla scent that I love.  This ain&#x27;t it.  My biggest issue with this scent is that it&#x27;s SO sweet.  I was almost nauseous just catching the occasional scent of it on me through-out the day.  It certainly lacks a natural vanilla scent and there&#x27;s nothing soft and warm about it.</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people love this scent but I just can&#x27;t see why.  It doesn&#x27;t smell as sweet and nice as warm vanilla sugar from Bath and Body Works.  It has kind of a strong smell of a stale vanilla in my opinion.  I only use it when I don&#x27;t have anything else left now.  It wears off easily and I just don&#x27;t think it is a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> After a while, it starts to smell more like alcohol and Vanilla. The formula smells watered down.</li>
            <li> Such a sweet warm smell, everyone should have a bottle of this. Even my toddlers like when i wear this:)</li>
            <li> I think this is my favorite fragrance.  I bought some for my GF and she loves it and has been getting compliments on it.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect vanilla body spray. Its not too strong and it really smells like vanilla. Light, fresh and warm...like cookies. But not too sweet or strong. You just smell good.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend the product, the scent is great, great price (because it is for 2 units) and arrived  on time.Besides, i have received lots of compliments since i started using it, i love it.</li>
            <li> Delightful scent, very fresh, I would suggest you give it a try if you haven&#x27;t already.</li>
            <li> I loved it. I plan on ordering more! It smells wonderful and it worth the price. I got the lotion with it as well. My boyfriend also liked it too!</li>
            <li> horrible experience ever...had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!!!! Shipping was moderate, but considering it came all the way from America to Asia, it was good. The outside of the package seemed as if it were in a damp area? But in the inside, nothing was wet.</li>
            <li> This is a light fragrance.  Nearly anyone who has an &#x27;annoyance&#x27; to strong scents would find it difficult to complain about someone using this.  Actually, I think I smell like a fresh baked sugar cookie.  &amp;#60;grin&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using VS&#x27;s Vanilla Lace Body products for about 5 years now.  I absolutely love this fragrance-not too overpowering.  Although I was told Vanilla Lace is one of VS&#x27;s most popular fragrances, for the second time VS has decided to discontinue offering it, so I am stocking up wherever I can find it. Hopefully they will bring it back again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of vanilla smells. But not overpowering. My wife had a bottle of this, and used it sparingly over years because VS had discontinued it. But VS got so many complaints, that they had to bring it back. Personally, it&#x27;s a very subtle scent, very aromatic, and it&#x27;s my favorite that she wears.  I bought several bottles in case they decide to discontinue it again. Seems like the nice elegant scents like these are being replaced with the pungent \\&quot;seductive\\&quot; scents destroying the air I breathe. I hope VS keeps this one around now.</li>
            <li> loveeee this very much</li>
            <li> This is the best Victoria&#x27;s body mist. If you want to be noticed wherever you go, this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing! I love the vanilla smell and this is what I was looking for I am so happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> I just love this nice light and pleasant fragrance!!  Everything from the sprayer to the design of the bottle is user friendly.  It is perfect for summer, but I use it all year long!  A vanity must-have.</li>
            <li> Excelente fragancia. Lleg&amp;oacute; tal cual es mostrada en la foto. En un tiempo prudente. Recomiendo este producto al 100%. El aroma de vainilla es muy agradable.</li>
            <li> This scent is my favorite.  It is not over powering, but leaves a pleasant scent!</li>
            <li> The fragance is good, but it&#x27;s not may prefer. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. I used it on my bedroom.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and I really hated it when you had trouble getting it at Victoria Secret  stores at times and was really happy to find it on line.  I like because its a nice scent for work, not over powering and I always received compliments on it.</li>
            <li> very light scent. I don&#x27;t know if I will order anymore of this the product,  Thats about all i chose to day at this time</li>
            <li> I ran out of my Body Fantasies Vanilla that I usually get from Walgreens. Amazon had it but it wasn&#x27;t eligible for Prime. I had heard a ton about Victoria&#x27;s Secret body spray so I tried it. It&#x27;s nice for sure, but the vanilla isn&#x27;t as strong as Body Fantasies. This might be good for some people and it&#x27;s definitely not a bad smelling spray. It&#x27;s nice and light and sweet. I like a muskier vanilla like Body Fantasies though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying scented stuff without being able to smell it first is a gamble, as I&#x27;ve found out with some stuff. At least I didn&#x27;t have to throw this out like I did with some body butter once. ;)</li>
            <li> This is a better version of body fantasy&#x27;s vanilla fantasy. It&#x27;s not as overpowering. I bought it because my boyfriend likes vanilla fantasy</li>
            <li> excellent. responsible. 100% recommend</li>
            <li> Its okay. Was not overly impressed.</li>
            <li> excellent used for all occasions</li>
            <li> exquisita fragancia, recomendada</li>
            <li> Smells like the store product I have been buying for years. Happy.</li>
            <li> great, quick transaction!</li>
