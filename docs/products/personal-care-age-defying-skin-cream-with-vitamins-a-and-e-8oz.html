            <li> Vitamins A &amp; E are far down the list of ingredients.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients of the pink cap and those of the blue cap are the same also.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are not listed on website before buying because most of them are chemicals that are  bad for you, and you would not buy them if you knew what they were.  </li>
            <li> BUT seriously, don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> It has at least 2 parabens which are TOXIC</li>
            <li> No more reptile scales for me!</li>
            <li> So instead of trying just one jar, you have been suckered into buying three worthless junk and spending nearly 20 dollars for shipping and handling.  </li>
            <li> What a rip-off.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> say about it. i will be ordering again very soon, i should have ordered two instead of one.  thanks again.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review because my Mother LOVES this stuff and swears by it.  I tried it but turned out to be allergic.  So this review is based on my Mother&#x27;s response.  If you can use it you will probably like it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic deal&lt;br /&gt;Deliver the shipment on time&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to cooperate with you again&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
            <li> It is not too much affect with my problem.so, it is not just which i used it before,it is okay</li>
            <li> causes me to break out</li>
            <li> this product pretty good. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer and makes my skin younger.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised that this relatively inexpensive cream works so well. I use it daily for arms, neck, decolletage, legs. It has a great consistency and is quickly absorbed. It also smells wonderful. Try it and compare to the more expensive brands -- you will love it!</li>
            <li> PERSONAL CARE products are horrid.  It&#x27;s oily, with GLYCERIN and WATER making up the bulk.  Vitamins A &amp; E are far down the list of ingredients.  The only thing that makes it &amp;#34;age defying&amp;#34; is the acne is causes!  BUT seriously, don&#x27;t waste your money.  Get QUALITY skin cream to start with, if you truly want positive results.</li>
            <li> No wonder the ingredients did not show up on this product.  It has at least 2 parabens which are TOXIC&lt;br /&gt;to the skin and health...even though the product may do what it says it does... No wonder it&#x27;s being sold so cheap!&lt;br /&gt;Most of this container will go in the trash...</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel as soft as silk, and keeps it looking fresh and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;  Love this cream!</li>
            <li> It is garbage 0 start</li>
            <li> When I received the product and opened the package it came in, the product had spilled into the package. It was as if the product was not closed before packaging. If I had not already open the package, I would have refused the package.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way that it was shipped to me. One of the caps came unscrewed a bit and I had lotion all inside of the packaging. Besides that, it&#x27;s a great product. Keeps my skin amazingly soft</li>
            <li> Everything is better with cream on it, but this one is great. I use it every night after I wash my face, and I wake up in the morning feeling soft to the touch. No more reptile scales for me!</li>
            <li> I love this skin cream and I love the pretty pink lid.  I wish this product were easier to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant and effective. Absorbs fast, works well, smells nice, very inexpensive. What&#x27;s not to like?? Why spend $20+ for the same stuff in a pretty package?</li>
            <li> This is one off brand product worth trying. I prefer it over everything else. I use it as an all over body lotion as well. The low price makes it easy to use very liberally. Great ingredients too with vitamins A&amp;E plus collagen.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for some time and do hope I can keep ordering it. Comes packaged well and shipped on time.</li>
            <li> this one is great works well does what it says</li>
            <li> you can get this product at the 99cent store.&lt;br /&gt;not really good , but it also depends on your skin my grandmother&lt;br /&gt;doesnt look like she age at all.</li>
            <li> So far so good I suppose. I use this twice daily. My skin feels smoother and more cleansed. It has a creamy texture.</li>
            <li> Personal Care Age Defying Skin Cream with Vitamin A &amp; E makes your skin feel soft and smooth. I like it.</li>
            <li> Even smells the same.  The kind your grandmother used to use to remove makeup.  The ingredients are not listed on website before buying because most of them are chemicals that are  bad for you, and you would not buy them if you knew what they were.  You would be better off using shortening! Very greasy.  What a rip-off.  Notice the low price for the products and $15 for shipping 3 jars, you can&#x27;t even return them to get your money back!  Two of the jars look exactly the same.  Another gimmick to get you to buy 3 instead of 2.  The ingredients of the pink cap and those of the blue cap are the same also.  So instead of trying just one jar, you have been suckered into buying three worthless junk and spending nearly 20 dollars for shipping and handling.  What a bunch of crooks!</li>
