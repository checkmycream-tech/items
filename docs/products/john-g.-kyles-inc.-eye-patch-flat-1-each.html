            <li>I needed an eye patch and Amazon suggested a trio of patches, so I bought all three to choose the best patch.</li>

            <li>Perfect eye patch.</li>
            <li>This is perfect!</li>
            <li>so you can wear it and still see out of the good eye.  </li>
            <li>It has a reinforced edge which sets it apart from the cheapest patches, however this is more of a Halloween pirate eye patch to me.</li>
            <li>I could have made a better one for about twenty cents.</li>
            <li>It does not look like the one on the front of the box, which has an oval on the top side also.  </li>
            <li>The stitching is ok.</li>

            <li>The lady that uses them loves that they are flat and fit perfectly under her glasses.</li>
            <li>Most important it goes under your glasses</li>
            <li>I think that would make it more comfortable for longer wear.</li>
            <li>Straps fit more comfortably on face.</li>
            <li>it was works fine either way</li>
            <li>What it is guys you just need to find you&#x27;re comfortable angle.</li>
            <li>This eyepatch is cheaply made and overpriced.</li>
            <li>The patch is cheap and feels like paper.  </li>
            <li>I had to get an eye patch that would fit under my glasses.</li>
            <li>he said it wasn&#x27;t too comfortable as it was &amp;#34;scratching&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This one is pretty close but more cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The one I received is a straight top and the sewing is quite &amp;#34;second class&amp;#34; (cheap).  </li>
            <li>Wasnt exactly what i was looking for but it does work, Its as comfortable as these things get and does serve its purpose.</li>
            <li>Not even worth one star.</li>
            <li>and i can fairly see the reason why this has to be a half circle.</li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to and was easy for my young son to use.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because it would be nice if it were a little more supple or soft for longer.</li>
            <li>The flat eye patch idea is great, but the strap stretched out and broke within a week.</li>
            <li>The patch is not rounded as pictured, but is flat on the top, a half-circle.</li>
            <li>I did NOT receive a large.</li>
            <li>The eye patch is very flimsy, doesn&#x27;t stay in place and flips up when placed over the eye.</li>
            <li>The elastic band was also rather short and didn&#x27;t fit the head.  </li>
            <li>I had to do extra stitching to the band to secure it.  </li>
            <li>Was expecting a legitimate piece of very flexible cloth AND a substantial tie to hold in place.  </li>
            <li>Fast service</li>
            <li>The patch itself is more like an oval that has been cut in half.</li>
            <li>I have found these this eyepatch to be particularly well-suited for a person that wears glasses.  </li>
            <li>Fits a little better than the concave eye patch.  </li>
            <li>We couldn&#x27;t find this in the stores, but someone suggested we look on the internet, and you had just what we wanted and the price was right, but thought the postage was too high for something so small and light.</li>
            <li>We had only been able to find the patches with the peak in the center.  </li>
            <li>on the downside, i can feel my eyelashes rubbing against the inside of the patch, but being able to wear my glasses while wearing this eye patch, to me, outweighs that small nuisance.</li>
            <li>The concave patches were pushing the lenses too far from the eye to maintain corrected vision.  </li>
            <li>The horizontal edge on the top , for me at least, gives the necessary pressure straight along on your eyelid.</li>
            <li>Completely covers eye and blocks all glare.  </li>
            <li>This eye patch looks cheaply made and small.</li>
            <li>The color is navy blue, not black.  </li>
            <li>Only positive for me is it fits under my eye glasses, but not comfortable.</li>

            <li> This patch was flat, but it looked nothing like the picture, and was smaller than the concave patch we had already tried.  </li>
            <li> the eye patch work because it is flat and can be wore with sunglasses or regular glasses.</li>

            <li> I just tied a little knot in it to make it smaller</li>
            <li> It was what I expected</li>
            <li> The patch itself seemed a bit flimsy so that was a minus.</li>
            <li> Says large but is very tiny and appears to be made of very thin felt.</li>
            <li> Cheap and uncomfortable to wear!</li>
            <li> I am extremely dissapointed by this product.  </li>
            <li> The strap could be a little wide and patch stiffer after a week</li>
            <li> but was to small did not fit over his eye properly.</li>
            <li> it looks like a half moon.</li>
            <li> It is half moon shaped but still serves its purpose.</li>

            <li> The eyepatch is too stiff - not comfortable.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The eye patch is very flimsy, doesn&#x27;t stay in place and flips up when placed over the eye.</li>
            <li> We took a chance on this as we needed a patch that could be worn under a pair of glasses.  The concave patches were pushing the lenses too far from the eye to maintain corrected vision.  This patch was flat, but it looked nothing like the picture, and was smaller than the concave patch we had already tried.  The elastic band was also rather short and didn&#x27;t fit the head.  We are looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I needed an eye patch and Amazon suggested a trio of patches, so I bought all three to choose the best patch. This is the flimsiest of all three. The elastic strap is the thinnest. The patch itself is more like an oval that has been cut in half. It has a reinforced edge which sets it apart from the cheapest patches, however this is more of a Halloween pirate eye patch to me.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected</li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t find this in the stores, but someone suggested we look on the internet, and you had just what we wanted and the price was right, but thought the postage was too high for something so small and light.</li>
            <li> Not even worth one star.</li>
            <li> I am extremely dissapointed by this product.  The shape, color and overall design are not what the picture in the ad and on the box lead one to believe.  The patch is not rounded as pictured, but is flat on the top, a half-circle. The color is navy blue, not black.  Furthermore, the elastic band is attached at points which pull the patch off-center from the eye.  The quality of construction appears shoddy in my opinion.  The functional and cosmetic quality is very poor.</li>
            <li> Did not like the quality of this item...it was poorly made...I had to do extra stitching to the band to secure it.  Will not purchase them again.</li>
            <li> What it is guys you just need to find you&#x27;re comfortable angle. and i can fairly see the reason why this has to be a half circle. The horizontal edge on the top , for me at least, gives the necessary pressure straight along on your eyelid.</li>
            <li> the eye patch work because it is flat and can be wore with sunglasses or regular glasses.The strap could be a little wide and patch stiffer after a week or so it tends to fold in the middle. needs a adjustable thing on strap after a period of time the strap stretches . I just tied a little knot in it to make it smaller</li>
            <li> its not the same one as shown on the box. it looks like a half moon.</li>
            <li> I thought they said there was 6 of these in a pack...but I only got one, when I went back and check the order it did say one only. However, I still believe the ad said 6 to a pack...</li>
            <li> Was expecting a legitimate piece of very flexible cloth AND a substantial tie to hold in place.  The elastic strip to hold the patch in place constantly slipped requiring adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed!!</li>
            <li> This eyepatch is cheaply made and overpriced. Headband is flimsy and thin. I could have made a better one for about twenty cents. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> The patch in the box does not match the picture on the box.  The patch is cheap and feels like paper.  It probably is paper.  It does not cover eye area correctly, nor does it work under glasses.</li>
            <li> Cheap and uncomfortable to wear!</li>
            <li> I found it uncomfortable and scratchy around the edges</li>
            <li> Not a cloth eyepatch, it&#x27;s a piece of cardboard with material sewn on it.  Is shield shaped, not the shape shown on the box.  I&#x27;ve thrown it in the bin because it is completely useless for the purpose, i.e. covering my eye since an episode Bell&#x27;s Palsy came on a couple of weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as nice or quality as the one given to me by the eye surgeon, which I have misplaced somewhere.  This one will suffice for the few times I have to wear it.  It does not look like the one on the front of the box, which has an oval on the top side also.  The one I received is a straight top and the sewing is quite &amp;#34;second class&amp;#34; (cheap).  It will do the job but I believe it&#x27;s overpriced.</li>
            <li> Not a cloth eye patch. Just a cloth covered piece of cardboard with a flimsy elastic strap. Absolutely worthless junk.</li>
            <li> The flat eye patch idea is great, but the strap stretched out and broke within a week. probably made in China.</li>
            <li> While it did mention a size, large, this is only for a small child. I did NOT receive a large.</li>
            <li> I order these as I can not find them in stores any where. The lady that uses them loves that they are flat and fit perfectly under her glasses. The contoured ones do not. These work great!</li>
            <li> Says large but is very tiny and appears to be made of very thin felt.</li>
            <li> Looked all over locally for an eye patch similar to the one given my son during an extended hospital stay. Flat, thin cloth with an elastic band. Even the hospital staff couldn&#x27;t find another one. This one is pretty close but more cheaply made. We have already had to repair the stitching where the elastic attaches to the patch. As stated in other reviews it is not the same shape as the photo on the box. It is half moon shaped but still serves its purpose. My son likes it.</li>
            <li> I have found these this eyepatch to be particularly well-suited for a person that wears glasses.  You can wear an audience side or the outside it was works fine either way</li>
            <li> This patch fits in your pocket or glasses case.  Most important it goes under your glasses so you can wear it and still see out of the good eye.  The stitching is ok.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to and was easy for my young son to use.</li>
            <li> This eye patch looks cheaply made and small. Fits too close to the eye. I think I prefer the concave made ones.</li>
            <li> The fabric was too stiff and was not comfortable to wear.  I would not buy it again and would have returned it if it would not have been so stiff</li>
            <li> The eyepatch is too stiff - not comfortable. 12 more words required. 12 more words required. 12 more words required.</li>
            <li> I had to get an eye patch that would fit under my glasses. This one does the trick since it&#x27;s flat. on the downside, i can feel my eyelashes rubbing against the inside of the patch, but being able to wear my glasses while wearing this eye patch, to me, outweighs that small nuisance. I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because it would be nice if it were a little more supple or soft for longer. I think that would make it more comfortable for longer wear.</li>
            <li> Wasnt exactly what i was looking for but it does work, Its as comfortable as these things get and does serve its purpose.</li>
            <li> You were the only people who had access to a flat patch, a definite plus.  The patch itself seemed a bit flimsy so that was a minus.</li>
            <li> my husband had to wear an eye patch for a while so i purchased this....he said it wasn&#x27;t too comfortable as it was &amp;#34;scratching&amp;#34; his face.....served its purpose though.  Rita, Orlando, Fl.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. Is not the same patch you can see in the picture, blue when I was asking for black. My son can do better in art class.&lt;br /&gt;Next return this joke of products.</li>
            <li> Fast service but was to small did not fit over his eye properly.</li>
            <li> Fits a little better than the concave eye patch.  Completely covers eye and blocks all glare.  Straps fit more comfortably on face.</li>
            <li> So so. Elastic loosens after a while.</li>
            <li> Perfect eye patch. We had only been able to find the patches with the peak in the center.  This is perfect!</li>
            <li> Not as pictured. Too small and flimsy. Only positive for me is it fits under my eye glasses, but not comfortable.</li>
