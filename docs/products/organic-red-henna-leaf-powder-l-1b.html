            <li>Wonderful henna!</li>
            <li>Perfect for body art!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent.</li>
            <li>I am fairly happy with the results!</li>
            <li>Great deal!</li>
            <li>great quality product!</li>
            <li>the powder/lime/water mixture sit for over 24hours for best texture</li>
            <li>In addition to coloring, I find it has excellent conditioning and strengthening qualities.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using henna for 35 years and this is about the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Very good henna.</li>

            <li>Good shipping, great product.</li>
            <li>I guess I can continue using it for its strengthening properties as henna is known to impart good strength and health to your hair.</li>
            <li>Good dye release and conditioning.</li>
            <li>specifications for good henna:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>Good quality vs price.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>

            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Warmly recommended.</li>
            <li>Awesome all natural product!</li>
            <li>:) You can&#x27;t get better than organic henna!</li>
            <li>Amazing quality henna with an authentic smell.</li>
            <li>I did not have to sift as it was very finely ground and didn&#x27;t clog at all.</li>
            <li>It came to a nice, smooth consistency like cake batter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Don&#x27;t let sit out for more than a week or it will get moldy</li>
            <li>I love the ease of putting it on my locs.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Im buying more.</li>
            <li>It reallly makes you hair stonger and shinnier :-)</li>
            <li>beautiful natural looking hair color that lasts for months!</li>
            <li>I want to get the very best quality as I have learned how important it is in the lasting conditioning and coloring effects.  </li>
            <li>I love that it gives good coverage even on my very graying hair.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with lemon juice and lavender for a tattoo paste and got very good results in consistency, color and application.</li>
            <li>Great dye release and gave a lovely red tint to my hair.</li>
            <li>Yeah i want the color to be strong.</li>
            <li>strong stuff.</li>
            <li>I used this finely sifted henna to do a hair treatment.</li>
            <li>There was also a lot of particulate matter that even a fine mesh sieve couldn&#x27;t remove.</li>
            <li>It is ground to a fine powder and makes  a smooth paste.</li>
            <li>Has no particulate matter for a smooth, clog-free application of henna.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I bought this henna to use for body art, and it is FABULOUS.</li>
            <li>My wife got fantastic dye release.</li>
            <li>It is marked usda organic, and is good quality.</li>
            <li>It also dyed my hair a gorgeous reddish brown and gave it a great bounce and shine for at least a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of playing with henna tattoos as well, even though I originally bought this just to stain my hair.  </li>
            <li>I only use natural products on my hair and this has proven to be an excellent alternative for covering up my gray.  </li>
            <li>Has a very bright green color (also denoting freshness)&lt;br</li>
            <li>During that time, it always turned my hair bright, screaming red.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this henna and will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>The color looks healthy and real, and it gently fades over 3-6 months as your hair grows out...</li>
            <li>Like fresh cut grass.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice deeper shade of copper red without any unwanted undertones.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s rare to find anything that works so well on gray hair</li>
            <li>I got a nice dark stain on skin in a couple hours, and it easily dyed my friend&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>It washed off right away.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this also gave it a little more body, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li>Mixed well, great color, no big pieces to filter out.</li>
            <li>My hair was excessively dry at first, but keep conditioning and it will feel amazing in the end.  </li>
            <li>I am, again, very very displeased by this product and will not recommend to anyone, for body art or for hair dyeing.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this brand</li>
            <li>I did my first henna design and learned a lot through research.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if left over night it would be a deeper color.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for henna tattoos!!</li>
            <li>Still have more left.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Unlike harsh dyes, henna is actually good for  your hair.  </li>
            <li>My natural colour is light brown/dark blonde and it turned a very rich, natural ginger.  </li>
            <li>Left it in my hair for about 6hours, and it washed out easily.</li>
            <li>Seems to be pure Henna.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>After I left the henna on for 6 hours and scraped it off it was a light orange, then it darkened overnight to a brown/orange.</li>
            <li>This product is pre-sifted which was a very welcomed surprise.</li>
            <li>Just before rinsing, I added more conditioner to it to get my hair extra soft.</li>
            <li>My hair, normally ash blonde fading to brown, came out a bright orange-red and then gently faded to a more solid reddish hue over a few days.  </li>
            <li>It would likely work quite nicely for hair henna, but if you want guaranteed high quality products, I would advise a different product.</li>
            <li>My hair was colored better than with any other brand of henna that I have used.</li>
            <li>and this didn&#x27;t really leave a vibrant color</li>
            <li>My hair smells like henna, but with none of the pretty red to make it worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Very new to henna....</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was keeping the dried henna from falling off, other than that, it was great!</li>
            <li>I find the price amazing as I have been paying at least 3 times this much.</li>
            <li>I love the deep red undertones in my hair.</li>
            <li>Not even a particularly shiny brown.</li>
            <li>in all, the only thing still convincing me that this actually is henna is the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using henna now for 2.5 years and highly recommend it to all naturals.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how this product has such good reviews.</li>
            <li>when mixed, is stringy with a distinct odor (signifying its freshness)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>So clearly I was hoping for a high lawsonia content and didn&#x27;t get that.</li>
            <li>This Henna is excellent quality, and the quantity that I had to use was far less than other brands that I&#x27;ve tried, maybe about half.  </li>
            <li>I use this for my 3c natural hair.</li>
            <li>The quality seems to vary wildly.</li>
            <li>However, the benefits far outweigh the negatives.  </li>
            <li>It mixed wonderfully, very stringy.</li>
            <li>Thus far.</li>
            <li>It is naturally a dark brown, and the first few days it was an orangey-auburn color that softened to a more natural-looking, deep reddish auburn shade by about a week after coloring.</li>
            <li>To be absolutely clear: I have been using henna on my hair since I was old enough to spell.</li>
            <li>It is worth less than one star.</li>
            <li>I spent way too much time soaking and applying it, just to get no results.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping but the henna was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to mix and rinse from the hair which is usually the most difficult part of the process.  </li>
            <li>A family member bought from this exact link last year, and received high-quality henna that she is still using for extremely long-lasting body art.</li>
            <li>family member had great results a year ago from the same link that I bought from, and I am quite disappointed by what I received.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty long, about 1/3 of the way down my back, and I only needed about 150-200g to cover all of it.</li>

            <li> family member had great results a year ago from the same link that I bought from, and I am quite disappointed by what I received.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty long, about 1/3 of the way down my back, and I only needed about 150-200g to cover all of it.</li>
            <li> The result was a very natural &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; of coppery red, and the color slowly faded over 14 days.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an organic, pure henna to utilize that didn&#x27;t cost a ridiculous amount of money.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never felt stronger and it is now growing above the average 6 inches a year.  </li>
            <li> I just mix with boiling water and leave on my roots for 3 hours and work through the rest of my hair for the last half hour.</li>
            <li> I opened the bag, the henna was a very dark green, nothing like the previous bag that had a much brighter tint.</li>
            <li> Used a little sugar, lemon juice and essential oil.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my hair like the other hennas I&#x27;ve used and it adds a lot of body and shine.</li>
            <li> like I woukd have expected.  </li>
            <li> It is a big waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Similarly, there was no overwhelming odor like there should have been.</li>
            <li> Despite the other reviews, my package of henna had the organic label.</li>
            <li> Did several tattoos at a party; the tattoos came out very dark, even if the paste was washed off after just a few hours.</li>

            <li> I know it would take a lot less time if I weren&#x27;t so gray</li>

            <li> My mixture includes green tea, honey, and a few oils.</li>
            <li> There are a few cons:  time consuming, messy</li>

            <li> imagine my surprise, imagine my disappointment, and subsequently, my rage, when I mix this henna as always, apply it as always, and sit with it on my head, wrapped up, for five hours, as always, and then go through the usual</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not organic. There is no label of USDA or organic on the package. I can not believe this company why they do like that!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not organic. There is no label of USDA or organic on the package. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I used this to color my hair. It is naturally a dark brown, and the first few days it was an orangey-auburn color that softened to a more natural-looking, deep reddish auburn shade by about a week after coloring. I left it on for about 4 hours and that was enough. My hair is pretty long, about 1/3 of the way down my back, and I only needed about 150-200g to cover all of it. I still have plenty left over for future colorings. Awesome all natural product!</li>
            <li> Thought I could use for tattoo, could not...kept clumping up</li>
            <li> Wonderful henna! I mixed mine with sugar and lemon juice and left it out for about a day until dye release had occurred. I got a nice dark stain on skin in a couple hours, and it easily dyed my friend&#x27;s hair. I had no issues with clumping either, and I didn&#x27;t even have to sift the powder. Love it!</li>
            <li> Not sure how this product has such good reviews. I don&#x27;t think this matches the quality of henna guys. I spent way too much time soaking and applying it, just to get no results.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed by the quality of this henna powder. I have been using henna to dye my hair for years, and recently had to switch brands. This brand is grainy, clumpy and did not release its color properly! Therefore, after struggling and gritting my teeth applying the mixture, the henna didn&#x27;t even dye my hair! At all! I am, again, very very displeased by this product and will not recommend to anyone, for body art or for hair dyeing.</li>
            <li> I purchased and received 1 lb of USDA certified organic henna from India. I have to state these are the facts as labelled on the resealable silver mylar package. I used this finely sifted henna to do a hair treatment. This is my first time using this brand but I&#x27;ve been using henna in my hair for well over a year now. This henna provided the least color transfer I&#x27;ve ever gotten from any of my treatments.  So clearly I was hoping for a high lawsonia content and didn&#x27;t get that. I guess I can continue using it for its strengthening properties as henna is known to impart good strength and health to your hair. I will need to buy anotherbrand of henna and do another treatment since I&#x27;ll still need to cover my grays.</li>
            <li> I use this for my 3c natural hair. Very good henna. It is marked usda organic, and is good quality. My mixture includes green tea, honey, and a few oils. It came to a nice, smooth consistency like cake batter. Left it in my hair for about 6hours, and it washed out easily. Good dye release and conditioning. Prefer this brand over jamila.</li>
            <li> doesnt work... maybe im just bad at it</li>
            <li> I did my first henna design and learned a lot through research. Myst measure  henna and lemon juice correctly for optimal results and must let henna clay sit for 24 hours to set prior to application</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. I&#x27;m Very new to henna.... As you can see by my practice design. This photo shows the henna after sitting for 5 hrs. I&#x27;m sure if left over night it would be a deeper color. Perfect for body art!!</li>
            <li> A family member bought from this exact link last year, and received high-quality henna that she is still using for extremely long-lasting body art. I bought from the same company, but I was very disappointed by the quality. I was hoping to use this for body henna, but that is simply not possible. To qualify all my statements, see below.&lt;br /&gt;My specifications for good henna:&lt;br /&gt;1. when mixed, is stringy with a distinct odor (signifying its freshness)&lt;br /&gt;2. Has a very bright green color (also denoting freshness)&lt;br /&gt;3. Has no particulate matter for a smooth, clog-free application of henna.&lt;br /&gt;My experience:&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the bag, the henna was a very dark green, nothing like the previous bag that had a much brighter tint. Similarly, there was no overwhelming odor like there should have been. There was also a lot of particulate matter that even a fine mesh sieve couldn&#x27;t remove. I figured I should give the product the benefit of the doubt and try it for some body art, though. It was terribly difficult to apply, and the tip kept clogging up literally every cm as I worked on my arm. I took it off after 4-5 hrs (which created a 2wk-long tattoo from my family member&#x27;s bag),  and the tattoo was very weakly colored and washed off in a couple days. I applied it on my hand and forearm to give it the thickest skin to absorb into, but it was not what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;My family member had great results a year ago from the same link that I bought from, and I am quite disappointed by what I received. It would likely work quite nicely for hair henna, but if you want guaranteed high quality products, I would advise a different product. The quality seems to vary wildly.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping but the henna was not what I expected.  I have been usingbhenna for years and this didn&#x27;t really leave a vibrant color like I woukd have expected.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for use on hair because you will be left disappointed</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stain the hair.  Waist of time and money.</li>
            <li> This Henna is excellent quality, and the quantity that I had to use was far less than other brands that I&#x27;ve tried, maybe about half.  My hair, normally ash blonde fading to brown, came out a bright orange-red and then gently faded to a more solid reddish hue over a few days.  My family put the extra in ziplock bags, cut a tiny hole in the corner, and used it for drawing on one another!  It&#x27;s excellent.</li>
            <li> Despite the other reviews, my package of henna had the organic label. (See the picture I uploaded) I used the &amp;#34;KISS&amp;#34; recipe on the &amp;#34;Henna Caravan&amp;#34; website. The only problem I had was keeping the dried henna from falling off, other than that, it was great! After I left the henna on for 6 hours and scraped it off it was a light orange, then it darkened overnight to a brown/orange. I am fairly happy with the results!</li>
            <li> THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT USDA ORGANIC, or even organic. The texture and consistency are even different, once mixed with water; the paste has a sandy feel. There is an additive here.</li>
            <li> This product is pre-sifted which was a very welcomed surprise. I mixed it with lemon juice and lavender for a tattoo paste and got very good results in consistency, color and application. The designs applied have averaged 10-14 days.</li>
            <li> No color. Used for the hair with Amla powder. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great dye release and gave a lovely red tint to my hair. Great deal!</li>
            <li> great quality product! love it!</li>
            <li> Good quality vs price.&lt;br /&gt;my only notes:&lt;br /&gt;-Let the powder/lime/water mixture sit for over 24hours for best texture (tattoo purposes)&lt;br /&gt;-keep in non-humid place&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t let sit out for more than a week or it will get moldy</li>
            <li> I bought this henna to use for body art, and it is FABULOUS. I had great results with my designs. For grins, I also experimented with it on my hair. I mixed the paste with hair conditioner and applied it to my hair when it was still a bit damp from the shower. I left it on for about 30 minutes. Just before rinsing, I added more conditioner to it to get my hair extra soft. The result was a very natural &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; of coppery red, and the color slowly faded over 14 days. :) You can&#x27;t get better than organic henna!</li>
            <li> Loved this henna.  It was easy to mix and rinse from the hair which is usually the most difficult part of the process.  I want to get the very best quality as I have learned how important it is in the lasting conditioning and coloring effects.  I only use natural products on my hair and this has proven to be an excellent alternative for covering up my gray.  In addition to coloring, I find it has excellent conditioning and strengthening qualities.  My hair has never felt stronger and it is now growing above the average 6 inches a year.  I&#x27;ve been using henna now for 2.5 years and highly recommend it to all naturals.  There are a few cons:  time consuming, messy and you must play with the mix to get it just right.  However, the benefits far outweigh the negatives.  I love the deep red undertones in my hair.</li>
            <li> Looks like henna. Smells like henna. But it dyes like a box dye. A pricey, stinky, five-hour box dye. A chestnut brown box dye. To be absolutely clear: I have been using henna on my hair since I was old enough to spell. During that time, it always turned my hair bright, screaming red. I&#x27;m talking Mary Jane Watson. I&#x27;m talking turn-heads, stop-traffic, can&#x27;t-lose-me-in-a-store-even-though-I&#x27;m-five-foot-four, RED. I&#x27;m talking Jessica Rabbit levels here.&lt;br /&gt;So imagine my surprise, imagine my disappointment, and subsequently, my rage, when I mix this henna as always, apply it as always, and sit with it on my head, wrapped up, for five hours, as always, and then go through the usual hell rinsing it out, only to be left with...brown. A reddish brown, I grant, but brown. Just brown. Not even a particularly shiny brown. Not even a brown that covers my dirty-blond roots. They&#x27;re still dirty blond, just now with a slight auburn tint. For the record, the bag says &amp;#34;RED&amp;#34; henna.&lt;br /&gt;Now, if I were a newbie to henna and didn&#x27;t know what to expect, I might just be mildly disappointed. But I&#x27;m not a stranger to henna. I know what henna is supposed to look like. I know what my hair looks like after five hours steeping in this mud. This? This isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the only thing still convincing me that this actually is henna is the smell. My hair smells like henna, but with none of the pretty red to make it worth it. In short, don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> beautiful natural looking hair color that lasts for months! Unlike harsh dyes, henna is actually good for  your hair.  The color looks healthy and real, and it gently fades over 3-6 months as your hair grows out...so there is no &#x27;dye line&#x27; to have to keep up with.</li>
            <li> I got this henna for body art. It mixed wonderfully, very stringy. Used a little sugar, lemon juice and essential oil. I did not have to sift as it was very finely ground and didn&#x27;t clog at all. Did several tattoos at a party; the tattoos came out very dark, even if the paste was washed off after just a few hours. I am in love with this henna and will definitely be purchasing more. It is cheaper on Starwest Botanicals website, but not sure if shipping will change that. Highly recommend it for henna tattoos!!</li>
            <li> used as hair tint and work great</li>
            <li> This henna is the BOMB!!! I love the ease of putting it on my locs. I use Coconut oil Aragon oil &amp; lemon infused organic green teas bags( about 6). Yeah i want the color to be strong. This henna is so very ease to wash out &amp; call me crazy...I love the smell. Like fresh cut grass. Im buying more. Thus far. I have applied it twice within a month apart. Still have more left. The picture shows the brownish red color.</li>
            <li> Good shipping, great product. I am a happy customer. Seems to be pure Henna. My wife got fantastic dye release. Her hair looks great. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is worth less than one star. This is the worst henna I have ever bought. It feels as if it&#x27;s mixed with dirth or sand. I does NOT apply wbell the the hair as it is clumpy. It does NOT color the hair. It is a big waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an organic, pure henna to utilize that didn&#x27;t cost a ridiculous amount of money.  A little bit goes a long way.  As this is body quality henna I&#x27;m thinking of playing with henna tattoos as well, even though I originally bought this just to stain my hair.  Supposedly, you can make gold henna paste by mixing turmeric into it.  My natural colour is light brown/dark blonde and it turned a very rich, natural ginger.  My hair feels great and the colour is phenomenal and mufti-dimensional.  My hair was excessively dry at first, but keep conditioning and it will feel amazing in the end.  I have very fine hair and this also gave it a little more body, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna for 35 years and this is about the best I&#x27;ve found. I love that it gives good coverage even on my very graying hair. It&#x27;s a nice deeper shade of copper red without any unwanted undertones. I just mix with boiling water and leave on my roots for 3 hours and work through the rest of my hair for the last half hour. I know it would take a lot less time if I weren&#x27;t so gray but it&#x27;s rare to find anything that works so well on gray hair so I don&#x27;t mind. I find the price amazing as I have been paying at least 3 times this much. It didn&#x27;t dry out my hair like the other hennas I&#x27;ve used and it adds a lot of body and shine.</li>
            <li> This henna sucked? It washed off right away. I was really disappointed</li>
            <li> strong stuff. good dye release.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality henna with an authentic smell. It did not cause any irritation of my scalp. It also dyed my hair a gorgeous reddish brown and gave it a great bounce and shine for at least a week.</li>
            <li> this is a great product. It is ground to a fine powder and makes  a smooth paste. My hair was colored better than with any other brand of henna that I have used. Warmly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great henna, best I&#x27;ve used so far. It reallly makes you hair stonger and shinnier :-)</li>
            <li> Mixed well, great color, no big pieces to filter out.</li>
            <li> I agree with some other reviewers - there is no label of USDA or  even the word &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; on the package! I will not purchase again.</li>
