            <li>They would make an excellent gift but they would be very hard to give away after one use.</li>
            <li>These nail files are very cute and blingy too, they&#x27;re adorned with colored rhinestones that are not only pretty but help with the grip as well.</li>
            <li>These nail files are very effective with little effort.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was super fast too!</li>
            <li>I have used other glass files that wasn&#x27;t good quality, these are.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for your purse .</li>
            <li>So they are not only pretty and effective but also hygienic.</li>
            <li>It is very stylish and small, I can fit in my purse and carry it everywhere.</li>
            <li>came very fast on the mail</li>
            <li>I really recommended !</li>
            <li>and I really like this!</li>
            <li>First order was defective but was replaced by seller.</li>
            <li>It was my first time with glass nail files</li>
            <li>They do a much better job than the regular nail files - since these are made with glass, they don&#x27;t leave jagged edges.  </li>
            <li>The file itself is way better than a regular file.</li>
            <li>These files came in a really cute red case and were wrapped separately.</li>
            <li>I received the item pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Really practice and pretty.</li>
            <li>Each nail file is only about 3.5 nches long, shorter than I expected but the perfect length for a purse or glasses case.  </li>
            <li>They look amazing with the red and blue gemed handles and the frosted look of the glass.</li>
            <li>my nails stay so much</li>
            <li>I find it doesn&#x27;t really file well.  </li>
            <li>but they are very brittle.</li>
            <li>An avid Amazon shopper who relies on online reviews for my own shopping decisions, I do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.  </li>
            <li>As I stated earlier, I&#x27;m used to only getting a limited amount of uses out of nail files so this is great to me!&lt;br</li>
            <li>feel these glass nail files are better then any other nail file out there !</li>
            <li>These glass files produce a more even, less raggedy feel.</li>
            <li>she works in a high end beauty salon and does nails.</li>
            <li>nail files are cute, compact and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Since it is glass it is pretty durable and I expect they will last much longer than metal files or emery boards.</li>
            <li>It comes in a pretty case, which is good to keep it inside my purse and it prevents from getting dirty.</li>
            <li>It may not be as gritty as some others, but what I love is the fact that these last much longer than any other nail file I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>not big enough and lost abrasiveness quickly</li>
            <li>I purchased them for my 16 year old daughter and she loves them.</li>
            <li>so I always have one near.</li>
            <li>but I was very happily surprised</li>
            <li>They chip and break easily  and are therefore difficult to file to a smooth edge with a standard emery board.  </li>
            <li>This will make a very pretty (albeit slightly used) stocking stuffer for my granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>and it also has a little red bag, very useful to keep it at your bag .</li>
            <li>Inside the extremely soft, red gift bag are two sparkly glass crystal nail files.  </li>
            <li>They are not rough but they do get the job done.</li>
            <li>they left no sharp edges.</li>

            <li> Since it is glass it is pretty durable and I expect they will last much longer than metal files or emery boards.</li>
            <li> It comes in a pretty case, which is good to keep it inside my purse and it prevents from getting dirty.</li>
            <li> It may not be as gritty as some others, but what I love is the fact that these last much longer than any other nail file I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> not big enough and lost abrasiveness quickly</li>
            <li> I purchased them for my 16 year old daughter and she loves them.</li>
            <li> so I always have one near.</li>
            <li> but I was very happily surprised</li>
            <li> They chip and break easily  and are therefore difficult to file to a smooth edge with a standard emery board.  </li>
            <li> This will make a very pretty (albeit slightly used) stocking stuffer for my granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> and it also has a little red bag, very useful to keep it at your bag .</li>
            <li> Inside the extremely soft, red gift bag are two sparkly glass crystal nail files.  </li>
            <li> They are not rough but they do get the job done.</li>
            <li> they left no sharp edges.</li>
            <li> not only did I not mess the shape of them like I&#x27;ve done in the past</li>
            <li> They have lasted longer than any other I&#x27;ve owned and are still being used on a daily basis by both my daughter and I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> these are made from glass and you should have these for a very long time !&lt;</li>
            <li> A short distance drop on to a table and the files broke in half.  </li>
            <li> Also, it does not make a mess like the regular nail file.</li>
            <li> I have always used traditional nail files that you could only get a few uses out of before they are worn down to practically nothing.</li>
            <li> It is a very hygienic with a non-porous glass surface which prevents the growth of unhealthy bacteria and fungus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really expected these to work like all the other files I&#x27;ve tried,</li>
            <li> and then it fades into color at the other end.</li>
            <li> Other nail files don&#x27;t even compare to this nail file , I keep one in my purse</li>
            <li> I will not use any other nail file again .I</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small, about three inches long and a half inch wide.</li>
            <li> It is durable and wear resistant and will not rust, tear or corrode unlike typical metal files and emery boards.</li>
            <li> With the glass mail files the job took half the effort and less time.</li>
            <li> did a little reshaping of nails</li>
            <li> I got it a few days ago</li>
            <li> I am very OCD about my nails, if I have a small burr or break it will drive me crazy until I fix it.</li>
            <li> These are so small that they just don&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li> Hardly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is a delicate mini nail file, you can use to style your nails.</li>
            <li> A bit too delicate to be practical.</li>
            <li> Fellow psoriasis-sufferers will know what I mean.</li>
            <li> However,  I was disappointed that they were only about 3&amp;#34; in length.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve also used a lot worse.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I hate when my nails have a ragged edge.</li>

            <li> Good quality, great price, and the colors are very pretty. I purchased them for my 16 year old daughter and she loves them. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have had these type files before but these just don&#x27;t seem to file as good.</li>
            <li> My fingernails and toenails are affected by psoriasis. They chip and break easily  and are therefore difficult to file to a smooth edge with a standard emery board.  And they need daily attention. Fellow psoriasis-sufferers will know what I mean. These glass files produce a more even, less raggedy feel. The fact that they are easy to clean with just warm water is an added plus.  And what you see depicted online is just what you get--two pretty files enclosed in a handy storage bag!</li>
            <li> Very good quality and very practical. It comes in a cute pouch great to keep in my purse. Also great that is a two pack cause I can keep one in my bag and one at home.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was super fast too!</li>
            <li> Really good and cute! Love it</li>
            <li> The best nails files I ever had.. Both Colors are so cute and the size fits perfectly anywhere. I really recommended !</li>
            <li> They are really nice and super cute!&lt;br /&gt;I reall like the glass think, I am used to the plastic ones and I really like this!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, very accurate! It is a delicate mini nail file, you can use to style your nails. Like it!</li>
            <li> Strictly for polishing. Outstanding quality.</li>
            <li> I have always used traditional nail files that you could only get a few uses out of before they are worn down to practically nothing. When I came across these glass nail files I knew I had to try them.&lt;br /&gt;They came in a velvet drawstring bag, with protective individual sleeves. They&#x27;re small, about three inches long and a half inch wide. They are two toned with the tip being white and then it fades into color at the other end. These nail files are very cute and blingy too, they&#x27;re adorned with colored rhinestones that are not only pretty but help with the grip as well. When it comes to how well it performs , I&#x27;ve used better but I&#x27;ve also used a lot worse. It may not be as gritty as some others, but what I love is the fact that these last much longer than any other nail file I&#x27;ve owned. As I stated earlier, I&#x27;m used to only getting a limited amount of uses out of nail files so this is great to me!&lt;br /&gt;These nail files are cute, compact and long lasting. They would be great for adults and older children alike. They have lasted longer than any other I&#x27;ve owned and are still being used on a daily basis by both my daughter and I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review and opinions.</li>
            <li> This will make a very pretty (albeit slightly used) stocking stuffer for my granddaughter.  Inside the extremely soft, red gift bag are two sparkly glass crystal nail files.  Each nail file is only about 3.5 nches long, shorter than I expected but the perfect length for a purse or glasses case.  Since the files are made out of glass, I didn&#x27;t have the splintering of my nails when I tried them out.  The nail files also didn&#x27;t shed that dusty gunk all over me like those cheap emery boards do.  I am very pleased, and if my nails were longer, I would be inclined to keep these for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special note:  I am often provided a sample for an unbiased review and testing at a discounted or free price.  I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. An avid Amazon shopper who relies on online reviews for my own shopping decisions, I do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.  Have a Blessed Day!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is very stylish and small, I can fit in my purse and carry it everywhere. Also, it does not make a mess like the regular nail file. Because it is cristal, it shape my nails without that white powder everywhere. Hardly recommended.</li>
            <li> These are positively the best nail files.These are easy to use and gentle on your nails, file your nails with a lighter touch, in any direction, without damaging your nail.It is durable and wear resistant and will not rust, tear or corrode unlike typical metal files and emery boards.It is a very hygienic with a non-porous glass surface which prevents the growth of unhealthy bacteria and fungus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow I am so impressed with this glass nail file, it files so perfectly and with just a light touch.I am very OCD about my nails, if I have a small burr or break it will drive me crazy until I fix it.Other nail files don&#x27;t even compare to this nail file , I keep one in my purse so it is always with me and one on my nightstand so it&#x27;s always there.I will not use any other nail file again .I have thrown out all others that I had , I really don&#x27;t know how I have gotten by without this kind of file.It is also so beautiful and it will never wear out so you will have it forever .Think about how much money you can save , I truly truly love this nail file .Also in this your will not only receive one but 2 of these amazing glass nail files, plus a fabulous gift bag which I use to keep a file in.This is such a fabulous deal , when you are getting 2 of these great files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this amazing glass nail file,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> The crystal nail files came promptly.  However,  I was disappointed that they were only about 3&amp;#34; in length.  I looked for a physical description of the length on the web site,  but there was none.  I had hoped for 5&#x27; to 6&amp;#34; crystal nail files.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I&#x27;ve ordered others &amp; have given some as gifts. They are not rough but they do get the job done.</li>
            <li> First order was defective but was replaced by seller. These files are good quality.</li>
            <li> I love my new files, it works great and has made my nails extremely fine. The little cute fabric bag they come with is excellent for a gift if you want to give them away. I can recommend them to all girls who are looking for a nail file. This price is incredible ++++++</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived on time and in perfect condition! I would buy again!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;Now my nails stay so much better!&lt;br /&gt;The selles is so good and atencious too!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend for everyone!</li>
            <li> Glides smoothly, love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good file &amp; I found it . Love my files I just purchased. I have used other glass files that wasn&#x27;t good quality, these are. Just the right size for your purse .</li>
            <li> I got it a few days ago and I loved it! It&#x27;s very easy to use  and I also loved the design.&lt;br /&gt;It came very fast on the mail and it also has a little red bag, very useful to keep it at your bag .</li>
            <li> I Love it! It was my first time with glass nail files and I don&#x27;t think I will go back to the regular ones. They are gorgeous and don&#x27;t make all that nail dust!</li>
            <li> These are so small that they just don&#x27;t do the job.  Also, don&#x27;t like the feel of the file area.  I find it doesn&#x27;t really file well.  I am disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally impressed with these glass nail files!&lt;br /&gt;when they come to you&#x27;ll  find a really nice felt case&lt;br /&gt;to keep your files in !  Once you open the case there&lt;br /&gt;is 2 glass files inside the felt case !&lt;br /&gt;Each of these files are in another case which made plastic&lt;br /&gt;there is one red and one blue file !&lt;br /&gt;These nails are nice for filing your nails and they work really well !&lt;br /&gt;I feel these glass nail files are better then any other nail file out there !&lt;br /&gt;Because these are made from glass and you should have these for a very long time !&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend getting these glass nail files and try these amazing nail files for your self !&lt;br /&gt;If your someone who likes to have your nails looking nice at all times , Rather you  go to&lt;br /&gt;Salon or  do your own manicure  these glass nail files for the best !&lt;br /&gt;Yes I have used on my own nails after I had done my own manicure !&lt;br /&gt;I  did a little reshaping of nails an these truly did an awesome job  yes these well be&lt;br /&gt;the nail file I&#x27;ll be using from now on on my nails !&lt;br /&gt;Because these glass nail files just that awesome to use on your nails!&lt;br /&gt;These are my own words&lt;br /&gt;Received this as  a promotion&lt;br /&gt;In return for my honest review</li>
            <li> These nail files are very effective with little effort. I have gel nails and between fills I have to reshape them often. With the glass mail files the job took half the effort and less time. You can file your nails in any direction without damaging the gel. I love the fact that the glass does not hold or grow bacteria. So they are not only pretty and effective but also hygienic. They look amazing with the red and blue gemed handles and the frosted look of the glass. Since it comes with two I have one iny bag and another iny home so I always have one near. I hate when my nails have a ragged edge. They come with a protective cover for each and in a cute velvet gift bag. They would make an excellent gift but they would be very hard to give away after one use. Since it is glass it is pretty durable and I expect they will last much longer than metal files or emery boards. I received this at a discounted price for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> These nail files are very cute and sparkly and come in a nice velour pouch.  They do a much better job than the regular nail files - since these are made with glass, they don&#x27;t leave jagged edges.  They are the perfect size to carry in your purse or throw in a makeup bag, very small and compact.  Seller was great - I got the order super quick.</li>
            <li> The files are great! They fit on my bag nd I can take anywhere I go. Quick delivery and a great quality product. I would recomend them.</li>
            <li> I received the item pretty fast. (i chose 7-10 day shipping but ended up getting it 2 days later). It comes in a pretty case, which is good to keep it inside my purse and it prevents from getting dirty. The file itself is way better than a regular file. I&#x27;ve never tried the glass file before and it&#x27;s definitely better. It doesn&#x27;t cut my skin, like i have experienced before. anyways, i&#x27;d definitely recommend it! :) Love how cute and practical it is. I keep one in my purse and one in my nail kit. thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Very nice product! I also love the free gift bag.</li>
            <li> A bit smaller than I like but still work great!</li>
            <li> not big enough and lost abrasiveness quickly</li>
            <li> Purchased this for the wife because she heard glass files worked better on nails than emery boards.  They don&#x27;t seem to work any better filing nails but they are very brittle. A short distance drop on to a table and the files broke in half.  A bit too delicate to be practical.</li>
            <li> These files came in a really cute red case and were wrapped separately. I love the sparkly colors it makes them easy to find in my handbag, and with there being two I can keep one at home and take one along with me.  I have gel nails and I really expected these to work like all the other files I&#x27;ve tried, but I was very happily surprised not only did I not mess the shape of them like I&#x27;ve done in the past they left no sharp edges. Perfect and smooth!!!! My daughter was here when I received them she works in a high end beauty salon and does nails. She tried them out and was trying to walk out the door with them. She was impressed with how small but yet how great they worked. I highly recommend these to all you girls that have gel nails and have not been able to find a file that works between visits to you nail salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with it. Really practice and pretty. Very satisfied ! My nails now are better. Also there is a exclusive free bag.</li>
