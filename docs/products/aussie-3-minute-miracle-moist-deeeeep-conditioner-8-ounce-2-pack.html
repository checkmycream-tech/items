    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was as impressed with this product as others wrote -</li>
            <li>This is the best conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>One of the best purchases I have made for the money.</li>
            <li>But maybe it works great for others.</li>
            <li>GREAT STUFF.</li>
            <li>Love it, been using it for years, best value!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get out all the tangles and doesn&#x27;t smell amazing.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought my straw-like hair was just an undeniable fact of life until I bought this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aussie 3 minute did a really nice job on her hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it all the time, but it is a nice treat when I do.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I like Healthy Sexy</li>
            <li>Soy tri-wheat leave-in conditioner a lot better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, just not miraculous.  </li>
            <li>I love how this product softens my hair.</li>
            <li>I followed the direction perfectly, and all I got was a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>It helps make my hair feel soft, looking healthy, and smells great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells quite nice but isn&#x27;t a super strong smell that sticks to you all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love Aussie products and the price is right too. :-)</li>
            <li>but honestly there are far better products out there.</li>
            <li>I love this product, you don&#x27;t have to use a huge quantity because it&#x27;s concentrated, and then it can last for more time.</li>
            <li>I was recommended this conditioner by a friend because I was going to bleach my hair and needed a deep conditioner that would help my hair heal and let me tell you I fell in love with this conditioner!</li>
            <li>As far as moisturer/conditioner, the best I&#x27;ve found are in those little tubes that come in hair coloring boxes.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner works well, leaving my hair more soft.  </li>
            <li>My holy grail to help revive my hair from the heat from using hot tools.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s not something I would use all the time as it doesn&#x27;t appear to be doing much.</li>
            <li>When I use it, it makes my hair feel much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>will feel smooth hair instantly after drying it.</li>
            <li>I now always keep at least two extra&#x27;s on hand - just to be on the safe side :-)</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My hair is untreated, old, and very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks, and it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>Makes my natural 4b hair immediately soft after a was and using this.</li>
            <li>My thin, frizzy hair has never felt better</li>
    </ol>

            <li> As far as moisturer/conditioner, the best I&#x27;ve found are in those little tubes that come in hair coloring boxes.  Those I consider a 5-Star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping the The Aussie 3 Minute Miracle would come close.  But meh.  It&#x27;s okay, just not miraculous.  Now, both my daughter and I tried this product.  She&#x27;s a teen and has very short  dyed hair.  My hair is untreated, old, and very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aussie 3 minute did a really nice job on her hair.  My hair still needed a serious detangler and it was a bit fly-away.  So it&#x27;s not something I would use all the time as it doesn&#x27;t appear to be doing much.</li>

            <li> I was recommended this conditioner by a friend because I was going to bleach my hair and needed a deep conditioner that would help my hair heal and let me tell you I fell in love with this conditioner! When I use it, it makes my hair feel much smoother and softer. It&#x27;s definitely a 3-Minute Miracle like the name suggests.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 this time not to run out in the middle of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will feel smooth hair instantly after drying it. Love Aussie products and the price is right too. :-)</li>
            <li> GREAT STUFF. My thin, frizzy hair has never felt better</li>
            <li> I have dry, over processed hair.  This conditioner works well, leaving my hair more soft.  One of the best purchases I have made for the money.</li>
            <li> I love this! My holy grail to help revive my hair from the heat from using hot tools. It helps make my hair feel soft, looking healthy, and smells great. You can find it at Walmart, Target, and here.</li>
            <li> I love this product, you don&#x27;t have to use a huge quantity because it&#x27;s concentrated, and then it can last for more time. I like the smell and the effect it causes on my hair!</li>
            <li> Makes my natural 4b hair immediately soft after a was and using this. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a miracle.  I followed the direction perfectly, and all I got was a regular conditioner.</li>
