            <li>and I are happy.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>Was not too happy about that either.</li>
            <li>Oh well, we can&#x27;t win them all can we?</li>
            <li>and I still feel that it a great value.  </li>
            <li>, I still thought it looked great</li>
            <li>It feels flimsy but seems to work great.</li>
            <li>it stores very nicely away</li>
            <li>Sets up in seconds, easy to sit under, temp control is perfect.</li>
            <li>It was so good that I refuse to buy another.</li>
            <li>Yep, it&#x27;s just that good.</li>
            <li>Really good, and I like the adjustable features of the dryer.</li>
            <li>the dryer arrived quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>the Connair HH400 which I love!</li>
            <li>Great heat settings, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>What I liked:  </li>
            <li>It would have been nice to know this in advance.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it heats nicely and evenly and the Ion feature leaves my hair shiny.</li>
            <li>It takes a minute to warm up on medium heat.</li>
            <li>I LOVE HOT TOOLS, THE BEST MADE BRAND!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It sure beats holding on to my hand held hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I also love the way it folds up.</li>
            <li>and I sure wish I had thought of purchasing this hair dryer before going in to get it cut here and there.</li>
            <li>but if she&#x27;s reading, the longer the better.</li>
            <li>ever happened to making products that satisfied the customers?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying the use of this product.</li>
            <li>However, the \\&quot;arch\\&quot; of the hood allows me to prop the dryer up on my dresser, sit in an office chair and still able to read while sitting backwards.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Very happy with my new hair dryer- great for easy drying natural curls.  </li>
            <li>I love how light weight it is, because I can hold it in my lap while I either work on the computer or watch TV.</li>
            <li>It is easy to carry and easy to store.</li>
            <li>-It has a lot of holes in the hood so it drys your hair very quickly.    </li>
            <li>This one is easy to use and fits well on over your head.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping and good pricing for hot tools!!</li>
            <li>This dryer is quick, dries evenly, is expremely lightweight and most importantly...</li>
            <li>and all I do is wash my hair, put in a great deep hair conditioner and put on a plastic cap and sit underneath the hair dryer for up to 30 minutes once a week</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the item</li>
            <li>I know it was a cheap dryer</li>
            <li>The dome doesn&#x27;t fit around your head (or my head) like it does at the salon.</li>
            <li>Made of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>It dries her hair quickly and evenly, is easy to set up, and folds away just as easily.</li>
            <li>Very noisy!!!</li>
            <li>Works great, a little too noisy but ok.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the way it works, it does not get too hot on my head when I  have it turned on high.</li>
            <li>Im sure that&#x27;ll help me to get my whole head in.</li>
            <li>i love being able to just sit under the dryer and read while i deep condition my hair.</li>
            <li>It would be helpful if the advertizing text stated how high the top of the inside of the hood was from the surface on which the dryer rested.</li>
            <li>-It has two settings; the low is nice and cool and the high is warm but not too hot.</li>
            <li>This is fine for what I use it for most of the time: deep conditions.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>but so far, I am completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The box was damaged in several spots, but fortunately the product was OK.</li>
            <li>It never worked right.</li>
            <li>and it accomplished exactly what I hoped it would......dryed my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>Next time I will go for a hood dryer with a more circular design, instead of the cone style that this one has,</li>
            <li>I received this hair dryer yesterday and used it today for the first time...    </li>
            <li>When I first came across this product I thought this looked gfeat</li>
            <li>The case itself at the top left corner of my phone comes apart sometimes</li>
            <li>It has air holes all over the inside and works great for her thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my aging Hot Tools dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased overall.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Hot Tools Professional 1061 Hard Hat works great and it helps me save a lot of $ per week</li>
            <li>( I don&#x27;t want the perm in my hair anymore, I want to wear it straight)</li>
            <li>I set my hair in medium sized rollers and I found that I couldn&#x27;t fit my entire head under the dryer.</li>
            <li>-I was really drawn to the price</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as fast as a hand held dryer</li>
            <li>Does not have much drying power.</li>
            <li>This dryer works very well.</li>
            <li>on.she really needs it.</li>
            <li>well it is very satisfactory</li>
            <li>Now, how do I really feel?</li>
            <li>It is all plastic and very lightweight.</li>
            <li>The front would get scalding hot and the back would stay cool</li>
            <li>This Hot Tools Pro 1061 is so light weight and cheaply made it hardly stays on the table.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I liked about this dryer was the fact that it had hot pink in it.</li>
            <li>Needless to say I was not too happy about the situation and have  spent lots of  $ on so many hair condtoining products and shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that is below my ears but not to my shoulders in length and was able to dry my hair in about 10 minutes on the high setting.....</li>
            <li>The dryer&#x27;s heated air is mainly on top, the sides have less air coming out.</li>
            <li>The vents were only on the top so the top of your head would dry while the bottom was still wet.</li>
            <li>This allows her to read, enjoy a snack and blow dry her hair all at once.  </li>
            <li>It dries faster and does a better job than the previous 2.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural curly girl and though this dryer is great for getting the top of my head dry, the air holes don&#x27;t go down far enough in the back for the heat to be distributed evenly there.</li>
            <li>Hard to adjust on my own, had to have my husband fix it for me.</li>
            <li>I liked the dryer, I have thick hair</li>
            <li>if i clip my long hair on top of my head, it can dry my whole head in about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-the hat is actually too small to fit a whole head, even with medium-small rollers, so the back and sides of my head fall outside of the area of coverage; after 45 minutes i ended with top scalp burned and bottom still wet.&lt;br /&gt;-it heats soo very hot, even on the lowest of two settings, that it burns the scalp; the ionic button does not make a difference;&lt;br /&gt;-the arm does not adjust to different length/height, so I had to use two cushions to lift me high enough to receive any hot air, and the hat does not tilt worth</li>
            <li>We all live and learn.</li>
            <li>If I can get rid of this dryer I will, but if not I will live with it.</li>
            <li>I love how the heat distrubes throughout the whole Hard Hat.</li>
            <li>and it was very loud.</li>
            <li>not too hot, and it covers my entire head.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re short like me (5&#x27;2&amp;#34;), you can&#x27;t just put in on the dining room table and use one of its chairs.  </li>
            <li>The seller lists this dryer as \\&quot;professional salon\\&quot; dryer which it is not!  </li>
            <li>I am a natural African American women and I purchased this to set my deep conditioners and planned to use it at most, once a week.</li>
            <li>I chose this dryer because it wasn&#x27;t too cheap and wasn&#x27;t terribly expensive and because other people who had purchased this dryer had specifically reviewed it as \\&quot;good for naturally curly hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I have short hair and believe it may give my hair a little more body.</li>
            <li>When I wash my hair the next morning, after blow drying it and to make my hair straight</li>
            <li>my hair comes out soft and shinny with no tangles or hair falling out of my head.</li>
            <li>I recommend this hair dryer to anyone who wants to do a deep conditioning on their hair or just to style your hair.</li>
            <li>AND it was incredibly loud.</li>
            <li>-It&#x27;s not as loud as I thought it would be.    </li>
            <li>the was 30 to 40 years old.</li>
            <li>I like how it covers my whole head, but if i want to get under it or out i have to kinda limbo into it since the hood doesn&#x27;t easily go back.</li>
            <li>However, it did not cost what a professional salon dryer costs either</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mom because her old hair dryer broke.</li>
            <li>i have long, thick curly hair and absolutely LOVE this hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>The noise was unbearable on the high setting and the low was loud as well.</li>
            <li>I must say that I like the fact that the dryer got hot enough to dry my hair (that could fit in), but not hot enough to cause damage.</li>
            <li>It still looks brand new, but its just a giant paper weight now.</li>
            <li>The Hot Tools Salon Dryer does not have enough power to actually dry your hair.  </li>
            <li>In order to get back of my hair some air time, I had to turn facing the dryer and tilt my head down, obviously that wasn&#x27;t too comfortable.</li>
            <li>The product is fine, but it is shipped in the manufacturer&#x27;s box which is flimsy to say the least.</li>
            <li>However, if I&#x27;m doing a twist out or some other style that needs drying, the top of my hair usually gets dry first while the back is still pretty wet.</li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder length now and with no rollers in my hair, it does not dry the ends.</li>
            <li>The air flow is weak, it doesn&#x27;t get very hot, and there aren&#x27;t any vents near the nape of my neck, so the back of my hair is never dry.</li>
            <li>The only two settings are HIGH (which almost burns your scalp) and LOW (which takes way too long to dry your hair).  </li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re short like me (5&#x27;2&amp;#34;), you can&#x27;t just put in on the dining room table and use one of its chairs.  </li>
            <li> The seller lists this dryer as \\&quot;professional salon\\&quot; dryer which it is not!  </li>
            <li> I am a natural African American women and I purchased this to set my deep conditioners and planned to use it at most, once a week.</li>
            <li> I chose this dryer because it wasn&#x27;t too cheap and wasn&#x27;t terribly expensive and because other people who had purchased this dryer had specifically reviewed it as \\&quot;good for naturally curly hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have short hair and believe it may give my hair a little more body.</li>
            <li> When I wash my hair the next morning, after blow drying it and to make my hair straight</li>
            <li> my hair comes out soft and shinny with no tangles or hair falling out of my head.</li>
            <li> I recommend this hair dryer to anyone who wants to do a deep conditioning on their hair or just to style your hair.</li>
            <li> AND it was incredibly loud.</li>
            <li> -It&#x27;s not as loud as I thought it would be.    </li>
            <li> the was 30 to 40 years old.</li>
            <li> I like how it covers my whole head, but if i want to get under it or out i have to kinda limbo into it since the hood doesn&#x27;t easily go back.</li>
            <li> However, it did not cost what a professional salon dryer costs either</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom because her old hair dryer broke.</li>
            <li> i have long, thick curly hair and absolutely LOVE this hair dryer!  </li>
            <li> The noise was unbearable on the high setting and the low was loud as well.</li>
            <li> I must say that I like the fact that the dryer got hot enough to dry my hair (that could fit in), but not hot enough to cause damage.</li>
            <li> It still looks brand new, but its just a giant paper weight now.</li>
            <li> The Hot Tools Salon Dryer does not have enough power to actually dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> In order to get back of my hair some air time, I had to turn facing the dryer and tilt my head down, obviously that wasn&#x27;t too comfortable.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but it is shipped in the manufacturer&#x27;s box which is flimsy to say the least.</li>
            <li> However, if I&#x27;m doing a twist out or some other style that needs drying, the top of my hair usually gets dry first while the back is still pretty wet.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length now and with no rollers in my hair, it does not dry the ends.</li>
            <li> The air flow is weak, it doesn&#x27;t get very hot, and there aren&#x27;t any vents near the nape of my neck, so the back of my hair is never dry.</li>
            <li> The only two settings are HIGH (which almost burns your scalp) and LOW (which takes way too long to dry your hair).  </li>
            <li> I had a little difficulty finding a surface to put it on that would match up with a seat that I had to be high enough up into the hood.  </li>
            <li> I can set this dryer on her head, she can utilize her laptop at the same time and 15 minutes later, dry hair.</li>
            <li> I was using it on my mom (81 years old) and it fell down twice and made her nose bleed.</li>
            <li> It is hard to adjust and very noisy.  </li>
            <li> This product works well but has one major flaw the hood part of it falls down.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this product,  I would have long peices of hair fall out into my comb and everywhere else.</li>
            <li> After I blow dry a bit with a diffuser, and finish getting dressed, I find I need about 10 more minutes of drying before I face a cold NY winter morning.</li>
            <li> she has had several strokes and she cant hold a blow dryer for long because her arm gives out.i am not willing to buy another one .</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually dry in 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> in five minutes, my scalp is completely dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;limited air from the air holes at the rear of the bonnet,&lt;br /&gt;which took extended time to dry hair.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars as I don&#x27;t expect it to last as long as the previous 2.</li>
            <li> To fix this, I sit facing the unit (yes backwards) at some points to make sure the heat gets to the back of my head, very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I like this because I try to use as little heat as possible.  </li>
            <li> For the amount of $$ spent she</li>
            <li> you going to pay for it due to you</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t like and might also bother other users:  </li>
            <li> I bought this because of the other reviewers who need additional drying for their curly girl regime.</li>
            <li> It was a little difficult trying to find a place to set it and a chair that was just the right height.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is a bit noisy</li>
            <li> so it usually takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> I have been using hard bonnet dryers for years, and the HOT TOOLS Professional Hard Hat 1860 Watt Hair Dryer is the absolute worst product ever.</li>
            <li> My 12 yr old daughter has long, very thick hair and her arms get tired when she blow dries it.</li>
            <li> My hair use to be way past my shoulders and had to keep getting it cut due to the perm</li>
            <li> The ends of her hair that stick out of the bottom take a little longer but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too loud and takes too long to try very thin hair!</li>
            <li> Blow drying resulted in 20 minutes of &amp;#34;your pulling my hair&amp;#34; and crying.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is extremely loud and uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> but it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable to sit under.</li>
            <li> I used it maybe three times, four at the most and hated it.</li>
            <li> a damn;&lt;br /&gt;-it is poorly constructed of thin plastic, and terribly designed not to fit a normal (even small) head; definitely not an improvement over previous models;&lt;br /&gt;-the beauty supply store where i purchased it does not accept returns, so like another reviewer here, now I have a $70 piece of garbage that i&#x27;ll never use again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Compared to the 2 previous hard hat dryers I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s very difficult to dry the lower back of the hair.  </li>
            <li> -I don&#x27;t use rollers, but for anyone who does, this hood might be a bit small.  </li>
            <li> This dryer can&#x27;t compare at all to past hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> Was given a perm this past late spring and it had gotten over processed.</li>
            <li> It took me a few attempts to finally find a way to sit under this dryer without it knocking out my rollers or making me sit in very uncomfortable positions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hard hood hair dryers since the 1960s.  </li>
            <li> , I wish the hard hat could be used to lower the dryer rather than the arm its attached to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a Hard Hat dryer for a while.  </li>
            <li> Of course, this positioning is still very annoying and limiting even though it&#x27;s not the most uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> It also has a weird smell...not too bad.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s disappointing.</li>
            <li> Waste of time !!!!!</li>
            <li> Made very poorly !</li>
            <li> It also makes you sit with your face away from the body of the dryer, so it&#x27;s impossible to work or write while using it.</li>
            <li> The combination of the size of the device as well as the lack of heat that it blows out, make this a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I purchased this for my 9 yr old daughter who has very curly, thick hair. Blow drying resulted in 20 minutes of &amp;#34;your pulling my hair&amp;#34; and crying. Air drying left big, poufy hair. I can set this dryer on her head, she can utilize her laptop at the same time and 15 minutes later, dry hair. The dryer&#x27;s heated air is mainly on top, the sides have less air coming out. For the amount of $$ spent she and I are happy. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this for myself but for a child...yes.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works great. I love how the heat distrubes throughout the whole Hard Hat. I purchased this item for only one reason and that is to do deep conditioning for my hair. Was given a perm this past late spring and it had gotten over processed. Needless to say I was not too happy about the situation and have  spent lots of  $ on so many hair condtoining products and shampoos. I was recommended to go in and get a deep hair conditioning by the cosmitologist who did perm my hair and to come in once a week for the deep hair conditioning. I asked her \\&quot;Are you going to pay for it due to you are the one who over processed my hair to begin with?\\&quot;. She never said a word to me. The \\&quot;Hot Tools Professional 1061 Hard Hat works great and it helps me save a lot of $ per week and all I do is wash my hair, put in a great deep hair conditioner and put on a plastic cap and sit underneath the hair dryer for up to 30 minutes once a week and then I leave the conditioner in my hair over night. When I wash my hair the next morning, after blow drying it and to make my hair straight ( I don&#x27;t want the perm in my hair anymore, I want to wear it straight) my hair comes out soft and shinny with no tangles or hair falling out of my head. Before I purchased this product,  I would have long peices of hair fall out into my comb and everywhere else. I was wearing the loss hair on my clothing, YUK!!. Needless to say, I was not too pleased with that issue so after I purchased this item and have used it twice already, it has already done wonders for my hair. I am very pleased with the way it works, it does not get too hot on my head when I  have it turned on high. Noisey yes. But all hair dryers are noisy. I sit and read a book or a magazine while sitting underneath the hair dryer. It sure beats holding on to my hand held hair dryer. I also love the way it folds up. It is easy to carry and easy to store. I recommend this hair dryer to anyone who wants to do a deep conditioning on their hair or just to style your hair. My hair is shoulder length now and with no rollers in my hair, it does not dry the ends. My hair use to be way past my shoulders and had to keep getting it cut due to the perm and I sure wish I had thought of purchasing this hair dryer before going in to get it cut here and there. Was not too happy about that either. Oh well, we can&#x27;t win them all can we? We all live and learn.</li>
            <li> I used this product once and I want to take it back. I set my hair in medium sized rollers and I found that I couldn&#x27;t fit my entire head under the dryer. AND it was incredibly loud. I must say that I like the fact that the dryer got hot enough to dry my hair (that could fit in), but not hot enough to cause damage. In order to get back of my hair some air time, I had to turn facing the dryer and tilt my head down, obviously that wasn&#x27;t too comfortable. If I can get rid of this dryer I will, but if not I will live with it. Next time I will go for a hood dryer with a more circular design, instead of the cone style that this one has, Im sure that&#x27;ll help me to get my whole head in.</li>
            <li> I received this hair dryer yesterday and used it today for the first time...    What I liked:  -I was really drawn to the price and I still feel that it a great value.  -It has two settings; the low is nice and cool and the high is warm but not too hot. I like this because I try to use as little heat as possible.  -It has a lot of holes in the hood so it drys your hair very quickly.    -It&#x27;s not as loud as I thought it would be.    What I didn&#x27;t like and might also bother other users:  -I don&#x27;t use rollers, but for anyone who does, this hood might be a bit small.  -I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 10\\&quot; and the height is perfect for me, so if you are shorter that might be an issue. I used it at my kitchen table.  -There aren&#x27;t enough holes around the back so about 3/4 way through you have to turn around with your body facing the machine. That&#x27;s ultimately my biggest dislike about the machine.    Overall I&#x27;m happy with the item and I&#x27;d order it again. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is extremely loud and uncomfortable to use. It also makes you sit with your face away from the body of the dryer, so it&#x27;s impossible to work or write while using it. It would have been nice to know this in advance.  All in all It&#x27;s terrible</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hard hood hair dryers since the 1960s.  This Hot Tools Pro 1061 is so light weight and cheaply made it hardly stays on the table.  The only two settings are HIGH (which almost burns your scalp) and LOW (which takes way too long to dry your hair).  Also it&#x27;s very difficult to dry the lower back of the hair.  I feel it&#x27;s disappointing.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone. I am a natural African American women and I purchased this to set my deep conditioners and planned to use it at most, once a week. The only thing I liked about this dryer was the fact that it had hot pink in it. This dryer was sooooo noisy. The noise was unbearable on the high setting and the low was loud as well. The vents were only on the top so the top of your head would dry while the bottom was still wet. I know it was a cheap dryer but it was a waste of money. I ended up returning it and buying a cheaper one the Connair HH400 which I love!</li>
            <li> This dryer can&#x27;t compare at all to past hair dryers.  It is hard to adjust and very noisy.  It took me a few attempts to finally find a way to sit under this dryer without it knocking out my rollers or making me sit in very uncomfortable positions.  Hard to adjust on my own, had to have my husband fix it for me.</li>
            <li> This dryer has given me good hair days every day!  Even with a diffuser on my hand held, I would wind up with a head of frizz.  This dryer is quick, dries evenly, is expremely lightweight and most importantly...I have no frizz!! I am ever so grateful to my stylist for suggensting it to me.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my new hair dryer- great for easy drying natural curls.  the dryer arrived quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I liked the dryer, I have thick hair so it usually takes forever to dry.  The only complaint I have, I wish the hard hat could be used to lower the dryer rather than the arm its attached to.</li>
            <li> When I first came across this product I thought this looked gfeat and I wanted buy it. Whwn I received it in the mail, I still thought it looked great but it could definifintely use some improving. The case itself at the top left corner of my phone comes apart sometimes and I havent even dropped my phone!!!</li>
            <li> I was in need of a hooded hairdryer and decided to give this one a try. It arrived on time and the packaging was intact. My only complaint is that it is a bit noisy but it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> My 12 yr old daughter has long, very thick hair and her arms get tired when she blow dries it. This allows her to read, enjoy a snack and blow dry her hair all at once.  It isn&#x27;t as fast as a hand held dryer but if she&#x27;s reading, the longer the better. It has air holes all over the inside and works great for her thick hair.  The ends of her hair that stick out of the bottom take a little longer but it&#x27;s worth it.  I&#x27;m thinking of trying it out... It was a little difficult trying to find a place to set it and a chair that was just the right height. She just keeps it set up all the time and it&#x27;s become a permanent fixture in her room. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Works great, a little too noisy but ok.</li>
            <li> The Hot Tools Salon Dryer does not have enough power to actually dry your hair.  The dome doesn&#x27;t fit around your head (or my head) like it does at the salon. The combination of the size of the device as well as the lack of heat that it blows out, make this a bad purchase. I do not recommend and I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> I have been using hard bonnet dryers for years, and the HOT TOOLS Professional Hard Hat 1860 Watt Hair Dryer is the absolute worst product ever. Just bought it today and to my horror:&lt;br /&gt;-the hat is actually too small to fit a whole head, even with medium-small rollers, so the back and sides of my head fall outside of the area of coverage; after 45 minutes i ended with top scalp burned and bottom still wet.&lt;br /&gt;-it heats soo very hot, even on the lowest of two settings, that it burns the scalp; the ionic button does not make a difference;&lt;br /&gt;-the arm does not adjust to different length/height, so I had to use two cushions to lift me high enough to receive any hot air, and the hat does not tilt worth a damn;&lt;br /&gt;-it is poorly constructed of thin plastic, and terribly designed not to fit a normal (even small) head; definitely not an improvement over previous models;&lt;br /&gt;-the beauty supply store where i purchased it does not accept returns, so like another reviewer here, now I have a $70 piece of garbage that i&#x27;ll never use again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What ever happened to making products that satisfied the customers? Do not buy this product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying the use of this product. It heats well and I&#x27;m usually dry in 30 minutes. I love how light weight it is, because I can hold it in my lap while I either work on the computer or watch TV.</li>
            <li> Great heat settings, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality. Purchased for my elderly Mother.  Does not have much drying power. Made of cheap plastic. Parts fell off the dryer when I tried to adjust it.</li>
            <li> An excellent product. Sets up in seconds, easy to sit under, temp control is perfect. I LOVE HOT TOOLS, THE BEST MADE BRAND!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for 2 ½ years. The latch that keeps the hood upright has finally warped and doesn&#x27;t stand open. Otherwise, it heats nicely and evenly and the Ion feature leaves my hair shiny. It was so good that I refuse to buy another. I just rigged it with some flexi-rods to get the hood to stay open and upright. Yep, it&#x27;s just that good.</li>
            <li> Made very poorly ! It&#x27;s too loud and takes too long to try very thin hair! Waste of time !!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my aging Hot Tools dryer. The air flow is weak, it doesn&#x27;t get very hot, and there aren&#x27;t any vents near the nape of my neck, so the back of my hair is never dry. I would return it if I still had the box.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is not adjustable and does not have enough heating power</li>
            <li> This product works well but has one major flaw the hood part of it falls down. I was using it on my mom (81 years old) and it fell down twice and made her nose bleed. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> i love being able to just sit under the dryer and read while i deep condition my hair. not too hot, and it covers my entire head. fast shipping and good pricing for hot tools!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so durable I haven&#x27;t had any problems!</li>
            <li> i have long, thick curly hair and absolutely LOVE this hair dryer!  in five minutes, my scalp is completely dry.  if i clip my long hair on top of my head, it can dry my whole head in about 10 minutes.  BUY THIS DRYER!</li>
            <li> Really good, and I like the adjustable features of the dryer. I&#x27;m pleased overall. I&#x27;d buy if I were you.</li>
            <li> This dryer works well for drying my hair type.  It adjusts perfectly when sitting and it stores very nicely away</li>
            <li> The air did not circulate effectively.&lt;br /&gt;As a matter of fact, there was extremely&lt;br /&gt;limited air from the air holes at the rear of the bonnet,&lt;br /&gt;which took extended time to dry hair.</li>
            <li> I received this hair dryer in December of 2012, tried to use it in January of 2013, lifted the hood and a piece snapped off. Now my hair dryer hood does not stay in place. I cannot use this item and do not recommend it because it is not durable.</li>
            <li> Very noisy!!! Not comfortable to sit under. Was trying to replace one the was 30 to 40 years old. We all know they dont make things like they use to.</li>
            <li> This dryer works very well. It takes a minute to warm up on medium heat. On low heat it feels like nothing&#x27;s happening unless you start on medium. I like how it covers my whole head, but if i want to get under it or out i have to kinda limbo into it since the hood doesn&#x27;t easily go back. It also has a weird smell...not too bad. I would recommend this to anyone not using big rollers or give this as a gift</li>
            <li> I had a little difficulty finding a surface to put it on that would match up with a seat that I had to be high enough up into the hood.  If you&#x27;re short like me (5&#x27;2&amp;#34;), you can&#x27;t just put in on the dining room table and use one of its chairs.  It would be helpful if the advertizing text stated how high the top of the inside of the hood was from the surface on which the dryer rested.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a Hard Hat dryer for a while.  This one is easy to use and fits well on over your head.  Folds up  and fits in the closet.</li>
            <li> my mother was given this for christmas, after finally getting her to use it ,this spring, it broke, after the 4th use, wont even turn on.she really needs it. she has had several strokes and she cant hold a blow dryer for long because her arm gives out.i am not willing to buy another one .</li>
            <li> I paid around 68 bucks for this a year ago. It never worked right. The front would get scalding hot and the back would stay cool and it was very loud. I used it maybe three times, four at the most and hated it. The fourth or fifth time I went to use it, it made a pop noise and then nothing. It never worked again. I cannot find anyone to fix it or replace it.  Of course, it crapped out after the warranty expired. DO NOT BUY THIS DRYER! It is a total hunk of junk. It still looks brand new, but its just a giant paper weight now.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the other reviewers who need additional drying for their curly girl regime. The bonnet fits my head perfectly without squashing my curls. After I blow dry a bit with a diffuser, and finish getting dressed, I find I need about 10 more minutes of drying before I face a cold NY winter morning. This is the perfect answer.</li>
            <li> Except not drying at back of head well it is very satisfactory</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural curly girl and though this dryer is great for getting the top of my head dry, the air holes don&#x27;t go down far enough in the back for the heat to be distributed evenly there. This is fine for what I use it for most of the time: deep conditions. However, if I&#x27;m doing a twist out or some other style that needs drying, the top of my hair usually gets dry first while the back is still pretty wet. To fix this, I sit facing the unit (yes backwards) at some points to make sure the heat gets to the back of my head, very disappointing. However, the \\&quot;arch\\&quot; of the hood allows me to prop the dryer up on my dresser, sit in an office chair and still able to read while sitting backwards. Of course, this positioning is still very annoying and limiting even though it&#x27;s not the most uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I chose this dryer because it wasn&#x27;t too cheap and wasn&#x27;t terribly expensive and because other people who had purchased this dryer had specifically reviewed it as \\&quot;good for naturally curly hair\\&quot;.  I have naturally curly hair that is below my ears but not to my shoulders in length and was able to dry my hair in about 10 minutes on the high setting.....wonderful!  The seller lists this dryer as \\&quot;professional salon\\&quot; dryer which it is not!  However, it did not cost what a professional salon dryer costs either and it accomplished exactly what I hoped it would......dryed my hair quickly.  I&#x27;ve only had this dryer for a week but so far, I am completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Compared to the 2 previous hard hat dryers I&#x27;ve owned I gave it 3 stars as I don&#x27;t expect it to last as long as the previous 2. Now, how do I really feel? It dries faster and does a better job than the previous 2. I have short hair and believe it may give my hair a little more body. Satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom because her old hair dryer broke. She loves it. It dries her hair quickly and evenly, is easy to set up, and folds away just as easily. It is all plastic and very lightweight. It feels flimsy but seems to work great.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but it is shipped in the manufacturer&#x27;s box which is flimsy to say the least. The box was damaged in several spots, but fortunately the product was OK. I also have shipments sent to my office, since I not home during the day, and it is embarrassing to have this sitting at the receptionist&#x27;s desk all day. Just beware when ordering!</li>
