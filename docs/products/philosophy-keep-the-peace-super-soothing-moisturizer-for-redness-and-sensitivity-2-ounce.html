            <li>this is one of the best moisturizers i have purchased in a while.</li>
            <li>great product!</li>
            <li>It is indeed a fragrance-free moisturizer and will make your skin happy!</li>
            <li>, I must tell you, today I shaved after using this product for three days and the difference I noticed is incredible.  </li>
            <li>Great for over 50 skin.</li>
            <li>Happy to have found this again.</li>
            <li>Friends have great experience with Philosophy products</li>
            <li>And it did not feel good.  </li>
            <li>I have used philosophy products for many years with great results.  </li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>Philosophy&#x27;s Keep the Peace works amazingly well...</li>
            <li>No fragrance either which is nice.</li>
            <li>Zero stars is more accurate but Amazon won&#x27;t allow that!!  </li>
            <li>This product may be great for people who get a fresh batch, but all I can rate is the product I received, which was unusable.  </li>
            <li>most if not all were unusable, exasperating the problem.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I opened the container I was hit it in the face with an overwhelming smell of mildew.  </li>
            <li>Love this face lotion.  </li>
            <li>- I am so glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Okay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still shopping around for something better....</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this feels great on my face.  </li>
            <li>Love every thing about these products, they may cast a little more the drug store stuff, but my completion is the best it has been in years.</li>
            <li>Keep the Peace works best of all of the sensitive skin products I&#x27;ve used (MD Skincare, Clinique, Aveeno, First Aid Beauty).</li>
            <li>Works great on my skin, very light, not greasy, and penetrates instantly.</li>
            <li>What I love about Philosophy is that it made my skin so smooth and comfortable after using it for just a couple of days.</li>
            <li>My skin felt like I had a perpetual sunburn and most creams felt like I was applying even more heat to my skin; I could feel KTP cooling my skin right away.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer definitely feels great on my skin, but I truly don&#x27;t see any improvement in the redness in my skin.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin also, this product should be a good one fr you.</li>
            <li>this moisturizer has helped significantly.</li>
            <li>It did an OK job but not as good as other Philosophy products.</li>
            <li>My face always turns bright red when I apply any type of cream.  </li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, keep your skin moisturized and looking vibrant and healthy.</li>
            <li>First makeup combo that has truly worked for my skin!</li>
            <li>this is a super great product especially for red sensitive skin, its hard to find was happy to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Hard to find product that works great.</li>
            <li>I was a bit turned off by the brownish color at first, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all anymore.</li>
            <li>From the first use of these products the itchiness abated.  </li>
            <li>Upon the first application, I felt there was a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on my face.  </li>
            <li>If it would be a consistent part of the product line, I&#x27;d have no problem giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m here on Amazon looking for upgrading from my sample size to LARGE quantities.  </li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive and very prone to redness.</li>
            <li>When I apply it at night, I wake up with skin feeling and looking so much healthier and smoother.</li>
            <li>This time of year I often face very itchy skin on my neck...</li>
            <li>I do not notice the redness nearly as much with this product.</li>
            <li>Philosophy products seem to do very well helping people with irritable skin.</li>
            <li>this works really well if you use it at night in the morning</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m familiar with this product as my sister has used it for years and it definitely shouldn&#x27;t look or smell like what I received.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels more comfortable, smoother and less red.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Philosophy, for caring about those of us with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and its pretty large, so it will last me well after winter.</li>
            <li>I conveyed that I thought they would be more concerned since it is a product that goes on peoples faces, and it is not cheap, and there is no expiration dates on the jar, and also that I had the old jar in case they wanted to check batch numbers.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I totally agree with the first poster.  </li>
            <li>I first got a sample of this moisturizer at Sephora and they were out of it when I went back to purchase.  </li>
            <li>The lady at Bare Minerals saw that my cheeks poke through my makeup almost instantly so she changed my color to more of a yellow to counterbalance all that red puffiness.</li>
            <li>a clear day\\&quot; kit by philosophy.</li>
            <li>I, too, have tried ALL sensitive skin solutions ...</li>
            <li>Helps my skin stay soft</li>
            <li>Feels and looks heavy but goes on light.</li>
            <li>I used this during a desert trip to keep my sensitive skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and the redness did not seem to be soothed.</li>
            <li>I am over 50, and didn&#x27;t expect to see a 20 year old after using it, but I do see healthier skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination, acne prone skin and this product does not cause breakouts or redness.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The main reason I use this moisturizer, is because it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, when it&#x27;s on my face.</li>
            <li>I have no way of knowing how old the cream is but it certainly was not new!!  </li>
            <li>I used a gentle facial cleanser to wash the product off my face, but for the rest of the day (and the next, as well)</li>
            <li>This keeps my skin soft and keeps it from getting red and splotchy.</li>
            <li>As a male with sensitive skin I can only shave about once every 5 days or so</li>
            <li>agree with the other reviews and now ready to buy my second container.  </li>
            <li>it issued me a full refund with no hassle, at least.</li>

            <li> the readiness is gone and the outbreaks less frequent.</li>
            <li> After a long stressful day, my skin sometimes ends up looking red, blotchy and dry.</li>

            <li> I would have never guessed that some ugly yellow would look ok on my skin</li>

            <li> this has already helped, my skin is less red after shaving and miraculously I could even apply it after shaving (normally a no-no for at least a day) -</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this in trial size for the past three days</li>
            <li> I received my 40.00 jar of keep the peace moisturizer and it was dark brown and smelled rancid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sensitive even the wrong water can break me out.  </li>
            <li> I use this product year round after my cleanser and toner in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Money wasted!  </li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;m beet-red from shaving for at least two to three days ...</li>
            <li> This product works so well for skin types that have hard to please skin.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for cream for your sensitive, acne-prone, and oily skin, buy this one, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have had progressively worse skin since the birth of my kids.</li>
            <li> At my age I should probably be using something richer but hate that tacky feel left on my skin.</li>
            <li> Sad it&#x27;s being discontinued.</li>
            <li> It was dark brown in color and smelled disgusting.  </li>
            <li> I have oil skin that also flakes in the cold weather and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to use it again.  </li>
            <li> It was really disgusting.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I received my 40.00 jar of keep the peace moisturizer and it was dark brown and smelled rancid. I bought another jar and it was white/tan with no odor. I emailed my concerns to Philosophy customer service and was told the color is tan in some jars from the ingredients and that I should buy my Philosophy from one of their sellers not Amazon.I emailed back that Amazon sent both products from one of their (philosophy)&lt;br /&gt;trusted sellers and I know the difference between brown and tan, and a rancid smell. I conveyed that I thought they would be more concerned since it is a product that goes on peoples faces, and it is not cheap, and there is no expiration dates on the jar, and also that I had the old jar in case they wanted to check batch numbers. They emailed back and asked for code number. I have not heard back which is not a surprise...their &amp;#34;philosophy&amp;#34; for customer satisfaction and service and quality control and followup is to provide none...</li>
            <li> I totally agree with the first poster.  Yes, this works and works wonders.  I, too, have tried ALL sensitive skin solutions ... most if not all were unusable, exasperating the problem.  I&#x27;m so sensitive even the wrong water can break me out.  I have only used this in trial size for the past three days and I am amazed.  My skin feels more comfortable, smoother and less red.  It soaks into into the skin without burning or leaving it feeling filmed over (which doesn&#x27;t let the skin breathe).  As a male with sensitive skin I can only shave about once every 5 days or so, I must tell you, today I shaved after using this product for three days and the difference I noticed is incredible.  Usually I&#x27;m beet-red from shaving for at least two to three days ... this has already helped, my skin is less red after shaving and miraculously I could even apply it after shaving (normally a no-no for at least a day) - I&#x27;m here on Amazon looking for upgrading from my sample size to LARGE quantities.  Thank you, Philosophy!  It works!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is everything I was looking for. I have acne prone skin and I treat it with the \\&quot;on a clear day\\&quot; kit by philosophy. After a long stressful day, my skin sometimes ends up looking red, blotchy and dry. This moisturizer is the treat my skin craves then. When I apply it at night, I wake up with skin feeling and looking so much healthier and smoother. I just love it! I was a bit turned off by the brownish color at first, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all anymore. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Helps my skin stay soft</li>
            <li> Feels and looks heavy but goes on light. I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> Worked well to relieve redness on cheeks</li>
            <li> Zero stars is more accurate but Amazon won&#x27;t allow that!!  As soon as I opened the container I was hit it in the face with an overwhelming smell of mildew.  I have no way of knowing how old the cream is but it certainly was not new!!  It was really disgusting.</li>
            <li> The main reason I use this moisturizer, is because it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, when it&#x27;s on my face. Alot of moisturizers burn my eyes, when it&#x27;s on my face.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Sad it&#x27;s being discontinued.</li>
            <li> I have had progressively worse skin since the birth of my kids. Even Roseca which has been a challenge. The lady at Bare Minerals saw that my cheeks poke through my makeup almost instantly so she changed my color to more of a yellow to counterbalance all that red puffiness. I would have never guessed that some ugly yellow would look ok on my skin but it does. As soon as I bought Keep The Peace, I noticed a difference. Even when I was having that &#x27;blushing breakout&#x27; that lots of people suffer from, I went into the bathroom at work and saw NO red! No cheeks poking through the makeup. The color and the creaminess keeps all that puff and red at bay! First makeup combo that has truly worked for my skin!</li>
            <li> I have used philosophy products for many years with great results.  This product did no work we&#x27;ll for me.  Will not order again.</li>
            <li> I used this during a desert trip to keep my sensitive skin hydrated. It did an OK job but not as good as other Philosophy products. I have sensitive skin and the redness did not seem to be soothed. About the same. Not greasy though. No fragrance either which is nice.</li>
            <li> Love this face lotion.  I have acne prone,  combination skin and this is the only thing that works!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is the best. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months with the serum and I&#x27;ll definitely continue using this. My skin is super sensitive and very prone to redness. This keeps my skin soft and keeps it from getting red and splotchy. Keep the Peace works best of all of the sensitive skin products I&#x27;ve used (MD Skincare, Clinique, Aveeno, First Aid Beauty).</li>
            <li> Love every thing about these products, they may cast a little more the drug store stuff, but my completion is the best it has been in years. Great for over 50 skin. This does help maintain the redness.</li>
            <li> Happy to have found this again. Works great on my skin, very light, not greasy, and penetrates instantly. At my age I should probably be using something richer but hate that tacky feel left on my skin.</li>
            <li> I first got a sample of this moisturizer at Sephora and they were out of it when I went back to purchase.  I have oil skin that also flakes in the cold weather and this moisturizer has helped significantly.</li>
            <li> this is a super great product especially for red sensitive skin, its hard to find was happy to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I received a jar which had &amp;#34;gone bad&amp;#34; somehow.  It was dark brown in color and smelled disgusting.  I&#x27;m familiar with this product as my sister has used it for years and it definitely shouldn&#x27;t look or smell like what I received.  This product may be great for people who get a fresh batch, but all I can rate is the product I received, which was unusable.  The company who sold/shipped it issued me a full refund with no hassle, at least.</li>
            <li> This time of year I often face very itchy skin on my neck...but, it started a few weeks early this year and with a vengeance.  Friends have great experience with Philosophy products so I checked out Keep the Peace - I am so glad that I did.  From the first use of these products the itchiness abated.  Thanks, Philosophy, for caring about those of us with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer!  A little goes a long way.  I have very sensitive skin, and this feels great on my face.  I do not notice the redness nearly as much with this product.</li>
            <li> My face always turns bright red when I apply any type of cream.  So I was looking for the one cream that wouldn&#x27;t, this is that cream!  I am over 50, and didn&#x27;t expect to see a 20 year old after using it, but I do see healthier skin. I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> Love this product. On jar number three.</li>
            <li> This product works so well for skin types that have hard to please skin. If you have sensitive skin also, this product should be a good one fr you. Philosophy products seem to do very well helping people with irritable skin. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever tried. I have sensitive, combination, acne prone skin and this product does not cause breakouts or redness. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, keep your skin moisturized and looking vibrant and healthy. I use this product year round after my cleanser and toner in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin.  But I thought, well, during the winter perhaps this cream might provide some relief from the dry air of the season, for my face.  Upon the first application, I felt there was a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on my face.  Okay.  Maybe that&#x27;s the way it is.  Later, in the day my face felt irritated.  I looked in the mirror and saw that my face was pinkish.  And it did not feel good.  I used a gentle facial cleanser to wash the product off my face, but for the rest of the day (and the next, as well) my face looked and felt irritated.  I&#x27;m afraid to use it again.  Money wasted!  As the container was opened and some of the contents used.</li>
            <li> agree with the other reviews and now ready to buy my second container.  the readiness is gone and the outbreaks less frequent.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best moisturizers i have purchased in a while. it actually helps my redness. now that its colder i need a moisturizer that keeps my skin from flaking by the middle of the day. i have combination skin, not as oily so i dont consider my skin oily. this works really well if you use it at night in the morning i wake up and even some of my acne spots are gone. and its pretty large, so it will last me well after winter. great product!</li>
            <li> The product speaks for itself. It is indeed a fragrance-free moisturizer and will make your skin happy! What I love about Philosophy is that it made my skin so smooth and comfortable after using it for just a couple of days. I have an acne prone face, and I have tried different variety of facial moisturizers before, but only Philosophy worked for my face. If you are looking for cream for your sensitive, acne-prone, and oily skin, buy this one, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this face cream about 9 months ago on the advice of an esthetician. I have lupus and my skin reacts to EVERYTHING! Philosophy&#x27;s Keep the Peace works amazingly well...started reducing redness about an hour after I used it. My skin felt like I had a perpetual sunburn and most creams felt like I was applying even more heat to my skin; I could feel KTP cooling my skin right away. The only reason for the 4-star rating is that I know that this is a cream from a discontinued product line and I have no idea when they&#x27;ll stop carrying it. If it would be a consistent part of the product line, I&#x27;d have no problem giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Been using for over a month. Haven&#x27;t noticed any change to the redness. Will finish using it but doubt I will buy again</li>
            <li> This moisturizer definitely feels great on my skin, but I truly don&#x27;t see any improvement in the redness in my skin. I&#x27;m still shopping around for something better....</li>
            <li> Hard to find product that works great.</li>
            <li> works for me, reduces redness.</li>
    </ol>
