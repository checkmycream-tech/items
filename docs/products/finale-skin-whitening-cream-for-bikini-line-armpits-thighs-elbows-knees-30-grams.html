            <li>Good and fast service.</li>
            <li>Didnt see an improvement; was really hoping for some good results too</li>
            <li>I like the smell and texture of this product not to greasy, and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Still using it, have not seen the perfect result until after a while but its working for the few days</li>
            <li>I wasted my money on this hoping i would get great result</li>
            <li>There are much better American products that can be trusted.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It really works, it takes time</li>
            <li>but It didnt work at all, I&#x27;m really pissed.</li>
            <li>I have seen some progress, and will continue, thanks</li>
            <li>They should not be selling OLD stuff!!</li>
            <li>On to something new</li>
            <li>and it took forever to arrive, but it fades discoloration and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my (sensitive) skin.</li>
