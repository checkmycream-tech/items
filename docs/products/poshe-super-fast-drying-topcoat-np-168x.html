            <li>Shine is nice</li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t even get me started on how nice my cheapo NYC polishes look with this</li>
            <li>Absolute best, bar none for Acrylics!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this top coat!</li>
            <li>My favorite top coat!</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own gelish nails with tips for 5 years and love this top coat</li>
            <li>This is by far the best and fastest drying top cost I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t believe how fast it dries and how quick you&#x27;ll be out the door!!!!</li>
            <li>While most nail polish lovers rant &amp; rave about Seche Vite</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve finished off too many bottles to count</li>
            <li>I ran out of my favorite top coat and didn&#x27;t have any money</li>
            <li>love this tip coat</li>
            <li>I will order more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is Definitely my favorite topcoat I&#x27;ve ever gotten.  </li>
            <li>either way, I still love it.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that when it&#x27;s time to remove my polish, I can actually peel this polish off neatly!</li>
            <li>, I love, I love</li>
            <li>I know peeling is an issue with some top coats.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave even hold up more than a couple days.</li>
            <li>Oh lord were have I been looking all this time, this top coat does what it says.</li>
            <li>bought one just to try and then ordered 2 more...</li>
            <li>I started looking for alternatives, and I have to say I think I have found a better alternative in Poshe.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Posh√©</li>
            <li>but I used so many others and didn&#x27;t get the results I wanted</li>
            <li>Absolutely love being able to do just about anything after painting nails without worring about ruining the design and having to redo them.  </li>
            <li>Love this one and Rock 5.</li>
            <li>THEN this top coat</li>
            <li>OPI works much better for me.</li>
            <li>Maybe it will get thicker by the time, but all top coats do.</li>
            <li>Way better than seche Vite and dries faster too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Its 3 Free!.</li>
            <li>the pros outweighs the cons. :)</li>
            <li>Seche Vite is much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Plus I feel safe using it since it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>4-free. :)</li>
            <li>Very shiny, I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>This top coat does what it says.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone I know who I have turned on to the product love it as well.</li>
            <li>I love to cook and therefore wash my hands a lot, and the polish lasted.</li>
            <li>All in all, I have never had any top coat</li>
            <li>but you can get even better finish with durability in another product easily.</li>
            <li>I can get a good week-long mani out of this, while before my polish was only good for about 3 days without noticeable tip-wear or chips.</li>
            <li>It seems like so many people have had a good experience, so who knows if my nails are &amp;#34;special.&amp;#34; It is super shiny and dries quickly -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other top coats, but this one works the best for me.</li>
            <li>Top coat goes on smooth and leaves nails shiny.  </li>
            <li>I read in a magazine that this nail polish was a great top coat that makes polish last for 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have used Poshe Top Coat only on acrylic nails and it is the absolute best!  </li>
            <li>It certainly smells much better!  </li>
            <li>Great top coat that helps level off nail polish and does not thicken over time like some other top coats.</li>
            <li>My nails were totally dry in about 1 minute, and had an incredible amount of shine and reflection after the fact.</li>
            <li>The box it came in when I got it was a little beat up, but the polish was in perfect condition and that&#x27;s all the mattered!</li>
            <li>this stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It even made one of my polishes that never had a very shiny appearance (not matte, but kind of dulled, I guess?)</li>
            <li>a shiny, smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome, my nails dry super quick and</li>
            <li>Compared to my previous top coats, a fast drying revlon and Essie good to go, this this by far the best.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite top coat for my regular manicures, but it also is a great substitute for my Gelous when I want to do nail art</li>
            <li>It does dry fast and leaves a great shine!  </li>
            <li>Its amazing, does what it says, dries fast and is super shiny.</li>
            <li>My nail polish chipped in one day - significantly faster than when I did not use any topic coat (chipped in 4 days).</li>
            <li>Worth it!  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with Poshe from the first manicure I did with</li>
            <li>Specially when you have kids</li>
            <li>It dries hard in literally 5 minutes and shines beautifully :)</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t make since to keep buying a topcoat that needed to be thinned out when I can make things easier on myself &amp; just buy a topcoat that&#x27;s good to the last drop!</li>
            <li>I never had a top coat that dries this fast, it makes manicures a lot faster and fun!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>because it drys within a minute, lasts for week  or more and very shiny almost like a gel.</li>
            <li>I just kept hoping I would fall in love with as much as everyone else seemed to, but I never did.</li>
            <li>They look like way better quality than they really</li>
            <li>So far as I can tell, any kind of lacquer thinner will work with Poshe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, it goes on smooth and dries super fast, no smudging, will definitely stick with this brand</li>
            <li>And if it DOES end up thickening at some point, you don&#x27;t have to buy a super special, and overpriced, thinner for it.</li>
            <li>It dries super quick and doesn&#x27;t smear my polish whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I love this top coat, and I will be purchasing this again in the future.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and is sturdy and compliments whatever color it goes over.  </li>
            <li>I use a lot of top coat and now this will be the only top coat I purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a seche vite loyal user for 8 years.</li>
            <li>Quick dries your polish and protects your manicure for the week to come.  </li>
            <li>Super fast drying and SO SHINY!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast drying and keeps the polish looking great for twice as long.</li>
            <li>considering I&#x27;ve tried so many ( Seche Vite, Out The Door, Sally Hansen Insta- Dri Anti Chip Top Coat, Sally Hansen Mega Shine, Opi Rapid Dry,</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and recvd free gify.</li>
            <li>However, if you paint your nails 1/week or every few days, this product is great.</li>
            <li>Poshe works the best using thin coats.</li>
            <li>best one I&#x27;ve ever tired.</li>
            <li>thought I&#x27;d try something that may be worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend for doing your own nail tips.</li>
            <li>I cannot speak for natural nails and if it works any better</li>
            <li>but I would think that the oil in our natural nails will ruin any top coat sooner.  </li>
            <li>It dries super fast and the shine it gives your nails is unbeatable!</li>
            <li>seller sent this order quickly, and it was well-packaged not to break -- thanks!</li>
            <li>No weird smell like Seche and dries just as quickly.</li>
            <li>- it has a more normal polish smell and has many of the same benefits of Seche Vite (including the glassy shine) without the shrinkage.</li>
            <li>I just love this fast dry top coat.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to dry wet nail polish quickly and since I&#x27;m constantly changing my polish color, I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s inexpensive as well since I&#x27;m using it up pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I love this fast drying top coat however it does thicken up when the bottle is half way full</li>
            <li>My favorite top coat when I don&#x27;t need, or want, to use a thicker one, such as my other favorite, Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>I can recommend this topcoat without hesitation to anyone who expects excellent quality in a topcoat without the extra trouble or health concerns.</li>
            <li>Bought my own and I am very please with how it keeps my nail color last longer.</li>
            <li>It dries as quickly as Seche Vite; my manicure lasts longer; the edges don&#x27;t recede; and it does not get goopy as fast as SV.</li>
            <li>Truly SUPER FAST DRYING.</li>
            <li>Arrived in time, very shiny and quick drying just like S.V bit it peels in sheets ...</li>
            <li>It dries super fast and shiny.  </li>
            <li>, Poshe bottle is better than seche vite bottle because poshe bottle is narrower than seche vite; poshe is less prone to drying and becoming goopy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries very fast.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Fast drying &amp; no bubbles!</li>
            <li>it gives a great long lasting gloss!</li>
            <li>, I love, now I can finally put all these nail polishes I&#x27;ve got to use.</li>
            <li>They were not on top but underneath the polish, and on almost every nail, but occurred most prominently at the point where the nail bed ends and the white part extends past the fingertips.  </li>
            <li>overall its just okay.</li>
            <li>It also drys quickly, so would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The first time I layered it as the final top coat on top of 3 other layers.  </li>
            <li>I would use this as a back up if I ran out of my normal top coat,</li>
            <li>I took off one star because sometimes poshe makes certain polishes prone to peeling after a day or two.</li>
            <li>It dried very quickly and was glassy smooth.  </li>
            <li>Love this top&lt;br /&gt;coat, especially when chasing a 2.5 year old after painting my nails!</li>
            <li>Another thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the brush is kind of big and splayed out, which makes it less precise when applying.  </li>
            <li>The shine and gloss is very comparable to seche vite.</li>
            <li>Even after 10-15 minutes the polish was still very tacky.</li>
            <li>Improves the look of even the cheap dollar store polish, and makes it last.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I also think it dries much faster than Seche Vite.  </li>
            <li>i really like it  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Poshe indeed dries as fast as it claims.</li>
            <li>It dries as fast as Seche Vite, but it doesn&#x27;t shrink or peel like</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!</li>
            <li>hahaha.</li>
            <li>Dries really fast</li>
            <li>Dries fast, keeps my mani for close to a week</li>
            <li>Even the prices are very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really put it to the test.</li>
            <li>Tried all other popular ones and this wins for my personal nail chemistry.</li>
            <li>Other reviews stated that it&#x27;s a bit thick polish, yet I find it perfect.</li>
            <li>I will never wear any other brand of top coat again</li>
            <li>Other brands are better.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve tried other top coats then you know the benefits of them.  </li>
            <li>SV created a dark tinge vs Poshe created a nice clear shiny coat.</li>
            <li>I had used Seche Vite for a long time, but this is formaldehyde free if I&#x27;m not mistaken.  </li>
            <li>I was worried whether I would get a new formula!</li>
            <li>&amp; I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals plus it dries just as fast &amp; shiny as Seche Vite without the shrinkage.</li>
            <li>Within ten minutes, I was able to go back and continue what I was doing.  </li>
            <li>The second time I did not have time to do a full manicure, and instead used this Poshe on clean dry nails, with nothing else.  </li>
            <li>I used Seche Vite pretty much exclusively for the last 2-ish years because I kept hearing how it was the \\&quot;best\\&quot; fast drying top-coat.</li>
            <li>It really stretches out the lifespan of mani/pedis done at home and gives a professional salon finished look!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this polish.</li>
            <li>I took off one star because it does not give you high gloss shine like Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>: does not have a high gloss that you get with Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>Just hold over any light bulb &amp; completely dry in 30 seconds!</li>
            <li>Now it has been a week and one of my nail polish completely fell off and my nails look REALLY BAD.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal but</li>
            <li>I noticed that after I finished with both hands the poshe top coat had dried.</li>
            <li>Seche would shrink and wrinkle unless I practically soaked my nail in it while a normal coat of this is plenty to do the job.</li>
            <li>If anything, it doesn&#x27;t last as long because the top coat makes the polish peel off after a couple days.</li>
            <li>However, don&#x27;t confuse this for a long lasting top coat.</li>
            <li>Its kind of thick to put on but its not messy... really recommend</li>
            <li>You can go right back to whatever you were doing.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and stays on, protecting the polish and lasts longer than any other brand.</li>
            <li>Dries fast and hard and stays shiny longer than most others.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it does shrink the polish a bit when drying, but really does give a hard shiny finish within a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Use as a top coat and go about your day, being only minimally careful</li>
            <li>If they wanted to make any changes, the only thing would be to make the brush curved, but even with a standard blunt edge, it still applies smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I have used nail polishes all my life and this is the first time I have seen such a thing.  </li>
            <li>would suggest applying your usual top coat</li>
            <li>I had the same problem with seche vite as well as almost all the other fast-drying top coats.</li>
            <li>The super high gloss finish looks about the same and the price is similar.  </li>
            <li>After a minute of applying it, my nails are COMPLETELY DRY,  Amazing, and not only dry but glossy too,  </li>
            <li>I like that it has less chemicals, dries FAST, and is strong enough to hold my nail decorations (rhinestones and Glitter).  </li>
            <li>It dries so quick an stays on way longer than expected.</li>
            <li>I put this stuff on even over wet polish and it dries so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I always wanted a top coat that would last and correct little imperfections...</li>
            <li>It was a pain to work with, and while super shiny gave me abysmal results in nearly every other category.</li>
            <li>As someone who loves to maintain natural lengthy nails</li>
            <li>I read some people believe the cause is applying the top coat too late,</li>
            <li>Fast drying, not yellow and holding for ever!</li>
            <li>I have natural nails and this peels off within 2 days.</li>
            <li>Not only does it help set polish well, it is very shiny and stays that way for about 6 days.</li>
            <li>and she said she got nearly two weeks out of it before chipping or tip wear showed up.</li>
            <li>Love how it dries so glossy and thick, reminds me of a gel manicure.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until the next morning I noticed long white streaks down my nails, which you could see right through the clear top coat.  </li>
            <li>Does not turn goopy when the its half full.</li>
            <li>After 1 minute, you can carefully touch the polish without worrying about absolutely messing it up, and after 5 minutes, you&#x27;re all done!</li>
            <li>after the colour layers have completely dried, however in this case I used the top coat on clean dry nails and 1/10 peeled, so not sure what that says.  </li>
            <li>The Poshe had pulled so much moisture out, it left parts of the nail bed white!  </li>
            <li>My one complaint is that it smears polishes a bit more than SV does, so SV is still my nail art standby, but I prefer Posh√© for anything solid.</li>
            <li>Dried quickly just as described on the box.</li>
            <li>Definitely get the thinner as well because it will cloud quickly if using dark polishes.</li>
            <li>that not only dries polish completely</li>
            <li>Ever since my friend introduced me to this top coat, I&#x27;ve been addicted.</li>
            <li>True to its promise, in 60 seconds, my nails felt dry, and 5 minutes later, I did dishes without a single smudge or ding!!  </li>
            <li>I applied to my nails and it dried really fast!.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very glossy, and it is less smelly too.</li>

            <li> I may one day find a better top coat than Poshe or Seche Vite, but these are the best I&#x27;ve used for many years</li>
            <li> Well I have fallen in love!  </li>
            <li> If you havent tried this product, you must, I garantee you, you will fall in love!</li>

            <li> And don&#x27;t even get me started on how nice my cheapo NYC polishes look with this</li>
            <li> Absolute best, bar none for Acrylics!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this top coat!</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat!</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own gelish nails with tips for 5 years and love this top coat</li>
            <li> This is by far the best and fastest drying top cost I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t believe how fast it dries and how quick you&#x27;ll be out the door!!!!</li>
            <li> While most nail polish lovers rant &amp; rave about Seche Vite</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve finished off too many bottles to count</li>
            <li> I ran out of my favorite top coat and didn&#x27;t have any money</li>
            <li> love this tip coat</li>
            <li> I will order more.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This is Definitely my favorite topcoat I&#x27;ve ever gotten.  </li>
            <li> either way, I still love it.  </li>
            <li> The best part is that when it&#x27;s time to remove my polish, I can actually peel this polish off neatly!</li>
            <li> , I love, I love</li>
            <li> I know peeling is an issue with some top coats.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave even hold up more than a couple days.</li>
            <li> Oh lord were have I been looking all this time, this top coat does what it says.</li>
            <li> bought one just to try and then ordered 2 more...</li>
            <li> I started looking for alternatives, and I have to say I think I have found a better alternative in Poshe.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Posh√©</li>
            <li> but I used so many others and didn&#x27;t get the results I wanted</li>
            <li> Absolutely love being able to do just about anything after painting nails without worring about ruining the design and having to redo them.  </li>
            <li> Love this one and Rock 5.</li>
            <li> THEN this top coat</li>
            <li> OPI works much better for me.</li>
            <li> Maybe it will get thicker by the time, but all top coats do.</li>
            <li> Way better than seche Vite and dries faster too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Its 3 Free!.</li>
            <li> the pros outweighs the cons. :)</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Plus I feel safe using it since it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> 4-free. :)</li>
            <li> Very shiny, I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> This top coat does what it says.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone I know who I have turned on to the product love it as well.</li>
            <li> I love to cook and therefore wash my hands a lot, and the polish lasted.</li>
            <li> All in all, I have never had any top coat</li>
            <li> but you can get even better finish with durability in another product easily.</li>
            <li> I can get a good week-long mani out of this, while before my polish was only good for about 3 days without noticeable tip-wear or chips.</li>
            <li> It seems like so many people have had a good experience, so who knows if my nails are &amp;#34;special.&amp;#34; It is super shiny and dries quickly -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other top coats, but this one works the best for me.</li>
            <li> Top coat goes on smooth and leaves nails shiny.  </li>
            <li> I read in a magazine that this nail polish was a great top coat that makes polish last for 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used Poshe Top Coat only on acrylic nails and it is the absolute best!  </li>
            <li> It certainly smells much better!  </li>
            <li> Great top coat that helps level off nail polish and does not thicken over time like some other top coats.</li>
            <li> My nails were totally dry in about 1 minute, and had an incredible amount of shine and reflection after the fact.</li>
            <li> The box it came in when I got it was a little beat up, but the polish was in perfect condition and that&#x27;s all the mattered!</li>
            <li> this stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It even made one of my polishes that never had a very shiny appearance (not matte, but kind of dulled, I guess?)</li>
            <li> a shiny, smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, my nails dry super quick and</li>
            <li> Compared to my previous top coats, a fast drying revlon and Essie good to go, this this by far the best.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite top coat for my regular manicures, but it also is a great substitute for my Gelous when I want to do nail art</li>
            <li> It does dry fast and leaves a great shine!  </li>
            <li> Its amazing, does what it says, dries fast and is super shiny.</li>
            <li> My nail polish chipped in one day - significantly faster than when I did not use any topic coat (chipped in 4 days).</li>
            <li> Worth it!  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with Poshe from the first manicure I did with</li>
            <li> Specially when you have kids</li>
            <li> It dries hard in literally 5 minutes and shines beautifully :)</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t make since to keep buying a topcoat that needed to be thinned out when I can make things easier on myself &amp; just buy a topcoat that&#x27;s good to the last drop!</li>
            <li> I never had a top coat that dries this fast, it makes manicures a lot faster and fun!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> because it drys within a minute, lasts for week  or more and very shiny almost like a gel.</li>
            <li> I just kept hoping I would fall in love with as much as everyone else seemed to, but I never did.</li>
            <li> They look like way better quality than they really</li>
            <li> So far as I can tell, any kind of lacquer thinner will work with Poshe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, it goes on smooth and dries super fast, no smudging, will definitely stick with this brand</li>
            <li> And if it DOES end up thickening at some point, you don&#x27;t have to buy a super special, and overpriced, thinner for it.</li>
            <li> It dries super quick and doesn&#x27;t smear my polish whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat, and I will be purchasing this again in the future.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and is sturdy and compliments whatever color it goes over.  </li>
            <li> I use a lot of top coat and now this will be the only top coat I purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a seche vite loyal user for 8 years.</li>
            <li> Quick dries your polish and protects your manicure for the week to come.  </li>
            <li> Super fast drying and SO SHINY!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast drying and keeps the polish looking great for twice as long.</li>
            <li> considering I&#x27;ve tried so many ( Seche Vite, Out The Door, Sally Hansen Insta- Dri Anti Chip Top Coat, Sally Hansen Mega Shine, Opi Rapid Dry,</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and recvd free gify.</li>
            <li> However, if you paint your nails 1/week or every few days, this product is great.</li>
            <li> Poshe works the best using thin coats.</li>
            <li> best one I&#x27;ve ever tired.</li>
            <li> thought I&#x27;d try something that may be worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend for doing your own nail tips.</li>
            <li> I cannot speak for natural nails and if it works any better</li>
            <li> but I would think that the oil in our natural nails will ruin any top coat sooner.  </li>
            <li> It dries super fast and the shine it gives your nails is unbeatable!</li>
            <li> seller sent this order quickly, and it was well-packaged not to break -- thanks!</li>
            <li> No weird smell like Seche and dries just as quickly.</li>
            <li> - it has a more normal polish smell and has many of the same benefits of Seche Vite (including the glassy shine) without the shrinkage.</li>
            <li> I just love this fast dry top coat.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to dry wet nail polish quickly and since I&#x27;m constantly changing my polish color, I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s inexpensive as well since I&#x27;m using it up pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I love this fast drying top coat however it does thicken up when the bottle is half way full</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat when I don&#x27;t need, or want, to use a thicker one, such as my other favorite, Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> I can recommend this topcoat without hesitation to anyone who expects excellent quality in a topcoat without the extra trouble or health concerns.</li>
            <li> Bought my own and I am very please with how it keeps my nail color last longer.</li>
            <li> It dries as quickly as Seche Vite; my manicure lasts longer; the edges don&#x27;t recede; and it does not get goopy as fast as SV.</li>
            <li> Truly SUPER FAST DRYING.</li>
            <li> Arrived in time, very shiny and quick drying just like S.V bit it peels in sheets ...</li>
            <li> It dries super fast and shiny.  </li>
            <li> , Poshe bottle is better than seche vite bottle because poshe bottle is narrower than seche vite; poshe is less prone to drying and becoming goopy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries very fast.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Fast drying &amp; no bubbles!</li>
            <li> it gives a great long lasting gloss!</li>
            <li> , I love, now I can finally put all these nail polishes I&#x27;ve got to use.</li>
            <li> They were not on top but underneath the polish, and on almost every nail, but occurred most prominently at the point where the nail bed ends and the white part extends past the fingertips.  </li>
            <li> overall its just okay.</li>
            <li> It also drys quickly, so would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The first time I layered it as the final top coat on top of 3 other layers.  </li>
            <li> I would use this as a back up if I ran out of my normal top coat,</li>
            <li> I took off one star because sometimes poshe makes certain polishes prone to peeling after a day or two.</li>
            <li> It dried very quickly and was glassy smooth.  </li>
            <li> Love this top&lt;br /&gt;coat, especially when chasing a 2.5 year old after painting my nails!</li>
            <li> Another thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the brush is kind of big and splayed out, which makes it less precise when applying.  </li>
            <li> The shine and gloss is very comparable to seche vite.</li>
            <li> Even after 10-15 minutes the polish was still very tacky.</li>
            <li> Improves the look of even the cheap dollar store polish, and makes it last.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I also think it dries much faster than Seche Vite.  </li>
            <li> i really like it  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Poshe indeed dries as fast as it claims.</li>
            <li> It dries as fast as Seche Vite, but it doesn&#x27;t shrink or peel like</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!</li>
            <li> hahaha.</li>
            <li> Dries really fast</li>
            <li> Dries fast, keeps my mani for close to a week</li>
            <li> Even the prices are very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really put it to the test.</li>
            <li> Tried all other popular ones and this wins for my personal nail chemistry.</li>
            <li> Other reviews stated that it&#x27;s a bit thick polish, yet I find it perfect.</li>
            <li> I will never wear any other brand of top coat again</li>
            <li> Other brands are better.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried other top coats then you know the benefits of them.  </li>
            <li> SV created a dark tinge vs Poshe created a nice clear shiny coat.</li>
            <li> I had used Seche Vite for a long time, but this is formaldehyde free if I&#x27;m not mistaken.  </li>
            <li> I was worried whether I would get a new formula!</li>
            <li> &amp; I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals plus it dries just as fast &amp; shiny as Seche Vite without the shrinkage.</li>
            <li> Within ten minutes, I was able to go back and continue what I was doing.  </li>
            <li> The second time I did not have time to do a full manicure, and instead used this Poshe on clean dry nails, with nothing else.  </li>
            <li> I used Seche Vite pretty much exclusively for the last 2-ish years because I kept hearing how it was the \\&quot;best\\&quot; fast drying top-coat.</li>
            <li> It really stretches out the lifespan of mani/pedis done at home and gives a professional salon finished look!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this polish.</li>
            <li> I took off one star because it does not give you high gloss shine like Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> : does not have a high gloss that you get with Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> Just hold over any light bulb &amp; completely dry in 30 seconds!</li>
            <li> Now it has been a week and one of my nail polish completely fell off and my nails look REALLY BAD.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal but</li>
            <li> I noticed that after I finished with both hands the poshe top coat had dried.</li>
            <li> Seche would shrink and wrinkle unless I practically soaked my nail in it while a normal coat of this is plenty to do the job.</li>
            <li> If anything, it doesn&#x27;t last as long because the top coat makes the polish peel off after a couple days.</li>
            <li> However, don&#x27;t confuse this for a long lasting top coat.</li>
            <li> Its kind of thick to put on but its not messy... really recommend</li>
            <li> You can go right back to whatever you were doing.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and stays on, protecting the polish and lasts longer than any other brand.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and hard and stays shiny longer than most others.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it does shrink the polish a bit when drying, but really does give a hard shiny finish within a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> Use as a top coat and go about your day, being only minimally careful</li>
            <li> If they wanted to make any changes, the only thing would be to make the brush curved, but even with a standard blunt edge, it still applies smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I have used nail polishes all my life and this is the first time I have seen such a thing.  </li>
            <li> would suggest applying your usual top coat</li>
            <li> I had the same problem with seche vite as well as almost all the other fast-drying top coats.</li>
            <li> The super high gloss finish looks about the same and the price is similar.  </li>
            <li> After a minute of applying it, my nails are COMPLETELY DRY,  Amazing, and not only dry but glossy too,  </li>
            <li> I like that it has less chemicals, dries FAST, and is strong enough to hold my nail decorations (rhinestones and Glitter).  </li>
            <li> It dries so quick an stays on way longer than expected.</li>
            <li> I put this stuff on even over wet polish and it dries so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I always wanted a top coat that would last and correct little imperfections...</li>
            <li> It was a pain to work with, and while super shiny gave me abysmal results in nearly every other category.</li>
            <li> As someone who loves to maintain natural lengthy nails</li>
            <li> I read some people believe the cause is applying the top coat too late,</li>
            <li> Fast drying, not yellow and holding for ever!</li>
            <li> I have natural nails and this peels off within 2 days.</li>
            <li> Not only does it help set polish well, it is very shiny and stays that way for about 6 days.</li>
            <li> and she said she got nearly two weeks out of it before chipping or tip wear showed up.</li>
            <li> Love how it dries so glossy and thick, reminds me of a gel manicure.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until the next morning I noticed long white streaks down my nails, which you could see right through the clear top coat.  </li>
            <li> Does not turn goopy when the its half full.</li>
            <li> After 1 minute, you can carefully touch the polish without worrying about absolutely messing it up, and after 5 minutes, you&#x27;re all done!</li>
            <li> after the colour layers have completely dried, however in this case I used the top coat on clean dry nails and 1/10 peeled, so not sure what that says.  </li>
            <li> The Poshe had pulled so much moisture out, it left parts of the nail bed white!  </li>
            <li> My one complaint is that it smears polishes a bit more than SV does, so SV is still my nail art standby, but I prefer Posh√© for anything solid.</li>
            <li> Dried quickly just as described on the box.</li>
            <li> Definitely get the thinner as well because it will cloud quickly if using dark polishes.</li>
            <li> that not only dries polish completely</li>
            <li> Ever since my friend introduced me to this top coat, I&#x27;ve been addicted.</li>
            <li> True to its promise, in 60 seconds, my nails felt dry, and 5 minutes later, I did dishes without a single smudge or ding!!  </li>
            <li> I applied to my nails and it dried really fast!.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very glossy, and it is less smelly too.</li>
            <li> Another issue was that one of the nails started lifting and peeling, and when I tugged on it, it came off in one clean, thin, sheet.  </li>
            <li> In addition, seche vite has a very strong, weird odor that I&#x27;ve never gotten from any other polishes.</li>
            <li> But given that it contains toluene (I know it may take copious amounts of exposure for it to pose a serious threat to your health, why push it, right?)</li>
            <li> last as long as Poshe does on my acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> Not only does this dry your nails within minutes, it gives your nails</li>
            <li> And amazingly, especially in the dead of winter in the Northeast, a week later, my $1.99 nail polish on my highly-prone-to-peeling nails have only minor wear at the tips- not a single chip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can never hold still long enough after painting my nails to let them dry correctly.  </li>
            <li> It is crystal clear, as I have to be careful to not tint it with other colors.</li>
            <li> Poshe dries as fast, finishes as glossily, and gets as hard as seche vite.</li>
            <li> I do not think it extends your mani/pedi as long as sechevite</li>
            <li> Due to a skin condition, I always keep my nails painted, and I thought I&#x27;d found a keeper when I stumbled upon Borghese&#x27;s fast-dry topcoat several years ago, but this blows Borghese&#x27;s version out of the water!  </li>
            <li> and you just don&#x27;t have the time to wait for your nail to dry...</li>
            <li> Your nails will be completely dry within a minute.</li>
            <li> Within 1 minute my nails were dry and the polish had set.</li>
            <li> They were not tacky or mushy, but actually dry.</li>
            <li> Helps increase the dry time of the polish i put on too!  </li>
            <li> (i forgot about it), it was totally dry!</li>
            <li> However, the drying time is not fast drying to me.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use the restore the product would be a total waste.</li>
            <li> It is harder to find in stores, so I order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> No mid-bottle goopyness and minimal edge-shrinkage.</li>
            <li> so I was curious.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about being careful with your nails afterwards or fear smudging.</li>
            <li> Based on my experience I can base an honest opinion on this product.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not completely uniform when it dries.  </li>
            <li> and it was dark.  </li>
            <li> Seche, I&#x27;ve never gotten any awful shrinkage from this, unless I&#x27;ve managed to miss a good sized part of my nail when I apply it.</li>
            <li> I also had to purchase the Seche Restore to thin it out halfway through every bottle which never really brought it back to the consistency you buy it in.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this makes my manicures last over a week, sometimes 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> No more waiting hours and hours for your nail polish to be completely dry!</li>
            <li> This topcoat is underrated and less well-known.</li>
            <li> This works quickly, but my bottle has also gotten increasingly thick since I bought it, even though I&#x27;m less than half way through, which is slightly disappointing.</li>
            <li> will switch to another brand with less harsh ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t do any heavy activities.</li>
            <li> No chipping either after a few days</li>
            <li> It is about $3.00 less expensive buying it through Amazon versus the local C.V.S..</li>
            <li> Also unlike Seche, Poshe doesn&#x27;t seem to get thick and gloopy after you use a quarter of the bottle, or even after using half the bottle.</li>
            <li> It lasts for about 5-6 days before it really starts chipping/peeling which isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> I had been using Seche Vite for the longest time and swore by it as I am very impatient when it comes to waiting for nail polish to detail.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed in how long this polish last.</li>
            <li> Although I paint my nails at least once per week, I am very impatient and have a hard time waiting for my nails to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My color was protected for at least a week and if I added another coat after 7 days, I got another week of protection.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the combo of it with my base coats (Orly Bonder or Nail Envy), but this stuff doesn&#x27;t chip or wear fast at all.</li>
            <li> My GF let me use her SV and it becomes goopy and thick.</li>
            <li> Now I find it here online for $5, unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> It is midway between thick (seche vite) and thin (out the door).</li>
            <li> This product allows you to paint your nails right before bed without getting annoying sheet marks on your painted nails!</li>

            <li> and you run little to no chance to messing up your nails with one wrong move!</li>
            <li> you cant go wrong with this poshe product</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I had stopped painting my nails because I hated having to be careful for 4+ hours so as not to ruin my manicure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I was really skeptical about this</li>
            <li> I have recommended this and the Poshe base coat to my friends.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best top coat you&#x27;ll ever find. It dries so quick an stays on way longer than expected.</li>
            <li> The shine and gloss is very comparable to seche vite. However, the drying time is not fast drying to me. I am a seche vite user and wanted to try this to see how it compared to seche vite. Even after 10-15 minutes the polish was still very tacky.</li>
            <li> While most nail polish lovers rant &amp; rave about Seche Vite I remain in the minority. I&#x27;ve used Poshe for years &amp; I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals plus it dries just as fast &amp; shiny as Seche Vite without the shrinkage. This is by far my favorite top coat for my regular manicures, but it also is a great substitute for my Gelous when I want to do nail art &amp; I&#x27;ve run out. Poshe works the best using thin coats. Another advantage for me is the price tag. Before I discovered  Poshe I used Seche Vite because of the hype. I also had to purchase the Seche Restore to thin it out halfway through every bottle which never really brought it back to the consistency you buy it in. If you don&#x27;t use the restore the product would be a total waste. It just didn&#x27;t make since to keep buying a topcoat that needed to be thinned out when I can make things easier on myself &amp; just buy a topcoat that&#x27;s good to the last drop! As someone who loves to maintain natural lengthy nails I go through a bottle of Poshe every 2 1/2 months. Over the years I&#x27;ve finished off too many bottles to count &amp; it&#x27;s the only topcoat for me. Based on my experience I can base an honest opinion on this product. I truly believe it&#x27;s the best topcoat out there considering I&#x27;ve tried so many ( Seche Vite, Out The Door, Sally Hansen Insta- Dri Anti Chip Top Coat, Sally Hansen Mega Shine, Opi Rapid Dry, Essie Good To Go &amp; D.Lippmann Addicted to Speed ). I can recommend this topcoat without hesitation to anyone who expects excellent quality in a topcoat without the extra trouble or health concerns.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my favorite top coat and didn&#x27;t have any money and I almost bought another brand but heard it smelled anyway I had my bing points and thought what do I have to lose well ladies I will never wear any other brand of top coat again boy  love this tip coat I have been doing my own gelish nails with tips for 5 years and love this top coat you cant go wrong with this poshe product</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and recvd free gify. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Awesome top coat.  Dries within five minutes.</li>
            <li> This works quickly, but my bottle has also gotten increasingly thick since I bought it, even though I&#x27;m less than half way through, which is slightly disappointing.</li>
            <li> The top coat is great!  I will order more.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t polish my nails without this stuff.  I can never hold still long enough after painting my nails to let them dry correctly.  I put this stuff on even over wet polish and it dries so quickly.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I read in a magazine that this nail polish was a great top coat that makes polish last for 1-2 weeks. Now I&#x27;m beginning to think that the magazine was messing with people. My nail polish chipped in one day - significantly faster than when I did not use any topic coat (chipped in 4 days).</li>
            <li> Lives up to its promise. It dries almost instantly! Helps my manicure last longer.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have ever tried. I love it! It dries super quick and doesn&#x27;t smear my polish whatsoever. The box it came in when I got it was a little beat up, but the polish was in perfect condition and that&#x27;s all the mattered! I love this top coat, and I will be purchasing this again in the future.</li>
            <li> this stuff is fantastic. Does exactly what it says. Super fast drying and SO SHINY!! Improves the look of even the cheap dollar store polish, and makes it last. I think it even brightens the color.</li>
            <li> Love it. My nail technician uses this on my nails. Bought my own and I am very please with how it keeps my nail color last longer. Had this within a week of ordering!!</li>
            <li> Great product; great customer service. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Fast drying &amp; no bubbles! Love this top&lt;br /&gt;coat, especially when chasing a 2.5 year old after painting my nails!</li>
            <li> This is Definitely my favorite topcoat I&#x27;ve ever gotten.  It dries quickly and is sturdy and compliments whatever color it goes over.  Worth it!  you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best top coats i&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s fast drying and keeps the polish looking great for twice as long. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just love this fast dry top coat.  I had used Seche Vite for a long time, but this is formaldehyde free if I&#x27;m not mistaken.  It certainly smells much better!  I also think it dries much faster than Seche Vite.  The super high gloss finish looks about the same and the price is similar.  It is harder to find in stores, so I order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this fast drying top coat however it does thicken up when the bottle is half way full but it&#x27;s still manageable.</li>
            <li> adds extra shine.  Helps increase the dry time of the polish i put on too!  It lasts for about 5-6 days before it really starts chipping/peeling which isn&#x27;t bad.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not completely uniform when it dries.  It can be perfect or flaky.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal but either way, I still love it.  The best part is that when it&#x27;s time to remove my polish, I can actually peel this polish off neatly!</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Just hold over any light bulb &amp; completely dry in 30 seconds! It is the best top coat ever that not only dries polish completely it gives a great long lasting gloss!</li>
            <li> very very good top coat.  best one I&#x27;ve ever tired. recommend</li>
            <li> This is by far the best and fastest drying top cost I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ll never use anything else!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, my nails dry super quick and there&#x27;s no need to blow. Which I knew about this before, I love, I love, I love, now I can finally put all these nail polishes I&#x27;ve got to use.</li>
            <li> I have used this two times.  The first time I layered it as the final top coat on top of 3 other layers.  It dried very quickly and was glassy smooth.  I thought it was great.  The second time I did not have time to do a full manicure, and instead used this Poshe on clean dry nails, with nothing else.  This was in the evening and it was dark.  It wasn&#x27;t until the next morning I noticed long white streaks down my nails, which you could see right through the clear top coat.  They were not on top but underneath the polish, and on almost every nail, but occurred most prominently at the point where the nail bed ends and the white part extends past the fingertips.  The Poshe had pulled so much moisture out, it left parts of the nail bed white!  I have used nail polishes all my life and this is the first time I have seen such a thing.  Another issue was that one of the nails started lifting and peeling, and when I tugged on it, it came off in one clean, thin, sheet.  I know peeling is an issue with some top coats.  I read some people believe the cause is applying the top coat too late, after the colour layers have completely dried, however in this case I used the top coat on clean dry nails and 1/10 peeled, so not sure what that says.  I&#x27;m throwing this out will switch to another brand with less harsh ingredients.  Another thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the brush is kind of big and splayed out, which makes it less precise when applying.  Other brands are better.</li>
            <li> Best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used! Incredible shine and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed in how long this polish last. It didn&#x27;t leave even hold up more than a couple days. Shine is nice but you can get even better finish with durability in another product easily.</li>
            <li> Oh lord were have I been looking all this time, this top coat does what it says. I noticed that after I finished with both hands the poshe top coat had dried. This thing does miracles oh yeah big time 5 stars. Specially when you have kids and you just don&#x27;t have the time to wait for your nail to dry...good job poshe</li>
            <li> I never had a top coat that dries this fast, it makes manicures a lot faster and fun!&lt;br /&gt;I bought one just to try and then ordered 2 more... i would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I had been using Seche Vite for the longest time and swore by it as I am very impatient when it comes to waiting for nail polish to detail. But given that it contains toluene (I know it may take copious amounts of exposure for it to pose a serious threat to your health, why push it, right?) I started looking for alternatives, and I have to say I think I have found a better alternative in Poshe. It dries as quickly as Seche Vite; my manicure lasts longer; the edges don&#x27;t recede; and it does not get goopy as fast as SV. As a nail polish/ nail art addict, I can tell you with confidence: you need this in your life (or nail art life)!</li>
            <li> Great top coat that helps level off nail polish and does not thicken over time like some other top coats.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Posh√© - it has a more normal polish smell and has many of the same benefits of Seche Vite (including the glassy shine) without the shrinkage. My one complaint is that it smears polishes a bit more than SV does, so SV is still my nail art standby, but I prefer Posh√© for anything solid.</li>
            <li> Dries nails in seconds</li>
            <li> I thought Seche Vite was the best top coat.  That is until I found Poshe!  This stuff is awesome!  It dries super fast and the shine it gives your nails is unbeatable! Considering I paint my nails about 2-3 times a week I use a lot of top coat and now this will be the only top coat I purchase.</li>
            <li> i really like it  because it drys within a minute, lasts for week  or more and very shiny almost like a gel.</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat when I don&#x27;t need, or want, to use a thicker one, such as my other favorite, Seche Vite. Goes on easily and evenly, &amp; leaves an excellent shine which doesn&#x27;t chip or peel. I may one day find a better top coat than Poshe or Seche Vite, but these are the best I&#x27;ve used for many years now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller sent this order quickly, and it was well-packaged not to break -- thanks!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this top coat! I&#x27;ve been using Seche Vite the last couple of years but after finding Poshe I&#x27;m definitely converted! No weird smell like Seche and dries just as quickly. No mid-bottle goopyness and minimal edge-shrinkage. Love how it dries so glossy and thick, reminds me of a gel manicure. If you&#x27;re on the fence about trying this top coat, definitely do it, it&#x27;s best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a seche vite loyal user for 8 years. The problem was that it lifted and my manicures never lasted. My aunt referred me to this as this is what she uses for her clients. She owns a salon on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. Seriously, this makes my manicures last over a week, sometimes 2 weeks! Never going back to seche vite, I told all my friends about poshe!</li>
            <li> The best thing i ever had. Fast drying, not yellow and holding for ever! Will recommend to anyone. Must have.</li>
            <li> This topcoat did it. I&#x27;m going to do my own manicures from now on! It dries hard in literally 5 minutes and shines beautifully :)</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat!</li>
            <li> I had stopped painting my nails because I hated having to be careful for 4+ hours so as not to ruin my manicure. And then a friend introduced me to Poshe -- this stuff is the best. Truly SUPER FAST DRYING. Use as a top coat and go about your day, being only minimally careful and you run little to no chance to messing up your nails with one wrong move! Paint your nails and go to bed - no problem! Yayyyyy</li>
            <li> I used Seche Vite pretty much exclusively for the last 2-ish years because I kept hearing how it was the \\&quot;best\\&quot; fast drying top-coat. I just kept hoping I would fall in love with as much as everyone else seemed to, but I never did. It was a pain to work with, and while super shiny gave me abysmal results in nearly every other category. I fell in love with Poshe from the first manicure I did with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poshe indeed dries as fast as it claims. My nails were totally dry in about 1 minute, and had an incredible amount of shine and reflection after the fact. It even made one of my polishes that never had a very shiny appearance (not matte, but kind of dulled, I guess?) look like a million bucks! And don&#x27;t even get me started on how nice my cheapo NYC polishes look with this (spoiler alert! They look like way better quality than they really are.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Seche, I&#x27;ve never gotten any awful shrinkage from this, unless I&#x27;ve managed to miss a good sized part of my nail when I apply it. Seche would shrink and wrinkle unless I practically soaked my nail in it while a normal coat of this is plenty to do the job. Also unlike Seche, Poshe doesn&#x27;t seem to get thick and gloopy after you use a quarter of the bottle, or even after using half the bottle. And if it DOES end up thickening at some point, you don&#x27;t have to buy a super special, and overpriced, thinner for it. So far as I can tell, any kind of lacquer thinner will work with Poshe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also gotta give a mention to the longevity of this stuff. Maybe it&#x27;s the combo of it with my base coats (Orly Bonder or Nail Envy), but this stuff doesn&#x27;t chip or wear fast at all. I can get a good week-long mani out of this, while before my polish was only good for about 3 days without noticeable tip-wear or chips.</li>
            <li> Ever since my friend introduced me to this top coat, I&#x27;ve been addicted. After 1 minute, you can carefully touch the polish without worrying about absolutely messing it up, and after 5 minutes, you&#x27;re all done! No more waiting hours and hours for your nail polish to be completely dry!</li>
            <li> Best top coat I&#x27;ve found in 15 years. Dries fast and hard and stays shiny longer than most others. Highly recommend this polish.</li>
            <li> I found this polish at a local beaty supply place, it cost $15 but I used so many others and didn&#x27;t get the results I wanted thought I&#x27;d try something that may be worth the money.  Then the store went out of business and needed to find it again.  Well I have fallen in love!  Now I find it here online for $5, unbelievable!  I do my nails every three days to match what I wear, and I also do designs and the designs take some time to do, so I always wanted a top coat that would last and correct little imperfections... YES..YES..YES.. this top coat is the best.  Absolutely love being able to do just about anything after painting nails without worring about ruining the design and having to redo them.  If you havent tried this product, you must, I garantee you, you will fall in love!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried other top coats then you know the benefits of them.  Posche is the very best.  Quick dries your polish and protects your manicure for the week to come.  Ladies, don&#x27;t miss out on this product.  It&#x27;s well worth the money.  You will have wished you tried it earlier in life.  You won&#x27;t believe how fast it dries and how quick you&#x27;ll be out the door!!!!</li>
            <li> It is crystal clear, as I have to be careful to not tint it with other colors. It is midway between thick (seche vite) and thin (out the door). I like that it has less chemicals, dries FAST, and is strong enough to hold my nail decorations (rhinestones and Glitter).  It is about $3.00 less expensive buying it through Amazon versus the local C.V.S..</li>
            <li> This topcoat is underrated and less well-known. It dries as fast as Seche Vite, but it doesn&#x27;t shrink or peel like Seche Vite does. It&#x27;s very glossy, and it is less smelly too. If you haven&#x27;t try this, give it a try! One of my all time favorite fast-dry topcoat!</li>
            <li> Top coat goes on smooth and leaves nails shiny.  It dries very fast.  Within ten minutes, I was able to go back and continue what I was doing.  Just don&#x27;t do any heavy activities.</li>
            <li> Love this one and Rock 5.</li>
            <li> Although I paint my nails at least once per week, I am very impatient and have a hard time waiting for my nails to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how I ever survived before I knew about this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swipe a coat of this over any nailpolish.  Not only does this dry your nails within minutes, it gives your nails a shiny, smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must buy!</li>
            <li> UPDATE (dec18,2014)&lt;br /&gt;I initially gave this 5 stars after using but my nails chipped after only 2-3 days! Now it has been a week and one of my nail polish completely fell off and my nails look REALLY BAD.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest applying your usual top coat THEN this top coat so it dries faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I was really skeptical about this but it actually worked!&lt;br /&gt;I applied at 3am and when I checked at 3:27 (i forgot about it), it was totally dry! It used to take me 1-2 hrs for my nails to set properly. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!</li>
            <li> I have natural nails and this peels off within 2 days. Saw a review in a magazine, decided to try it, but just doesn&#x27;t last! It seems like so many people have had a good experience, so who knows if my nails are &amp;#34;special.&amp;#34; It is super shiny and dries quickly - I hope it works for you. OPI works much better for me.</li>
            <li> Best top coat I have tried! At the begging I was a bit hesitant to buy since by googling I found that poashe used to be 2free and then the formula changed to 3free, so I was worried whether I would get a new formula! I did and I am very happy with the result. Other reviews stated that it&#x27;s a bit thick polish, yet I find it perfect. Maybe it will get thicker by the time, but all top coats do. Compared to my previous top coats, a fast drying revlon and Essie good to go, this this by far the best. I know may people recommend Seche, but toluene keeps me away from buying.</li>
            <li> This topcoat is great! Way better than seche Vite and dries faster too. I kept hearing about it on nail art blogs so I was curious. So happy I decided to try it. The product is great , the price is great and it arrived so fast and in good  shape. I&#x27;m one satisfied customer. Will recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Arrived in time, very shiny and quick drying just like S.V bit it peels in sheets ...</li>
            <li> How did I not know about this product sooner?!?  Due to a skin condition, I always keep my nails painted, and I thought I&#x27;d found a keeper when I stumbled upon Borghese&#x27;s fast-dry topcoat several years ago, but this blows Borghese&#x27;s version out of the water!  I applied my final coat of color to each nail and then started applying this over the still-drying color.  True to its promise, in 60 seconds, my nails felt dry, and 5 minutes later, I did dishes without a single smudge or ding!!  This stuff is incredible!  And amazingly, especially in the dead of winter in the Northeast, a week later, my $1.99 nail polish on my highly-prone-to-peeling nails have only minor wear at the tips- not a single chip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this highly enough.  If they wanted to make any changes, the only thing would be to make the brush curved, but even with a standard blunt edge, it still applies smoothly.  Please, Posh&amp;eacute;, don&#x27;t EVER stop making this incredible topcoat!</li>
            <li> This product allows you to paint your nails right before bed without getting annoying sheet marks on your painted nails! It does not make polish last longer. If anything, it doesn&#x27;t last as long because the top coat makes the polish peel off after a couple days. However, if you paint your nails 1/week or every few days, this product is great. Lots of shine too!</li>
            <li> Pros of Poshe- does not shrink like Seche Vite does. Its 3 Free!. Last longer on my nails than Seche Vite. Does not turn goopy when the its half full. Overall i like lit. I took off one star because it does not give you high gloss shine like Seche Vite. oh well lol. can&#x27;t have it all. hahaha. Still recommend,. the pros outweighs the cons. :)&lt;br /&gt;Cons: does not have a high gloss that you get with Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> I love this!! Every speaks of Seche Vite and how great it is, but I heard that SV causes your nail designs to shrink. SV has toulene!! I wouldn&#x27;t want that! My GF let me use her SV and it becomes goopy and thick. I&#x27;ve compared SV and Poshe side by side. SV created a dark tinge vs Poshe created a nice clear shiny coat. Dries really fast and it&#x27;s 3-Free! I couldn&#x27;t be happier!! I accidentally hit one of my nails but place a coat over it and you don&#x27;t see a flaw at all!! No chips, seals great!!  I get a lot of attention and compliments!! Package arrived with no damages at all.</li>
            <li> Not only does it help set polish well, it is very shiny and stays that way for about 6 days. Recommend.</li>
            <li> I was not too impressed. Seche Vite is much better in my opinion. I would use this as a back up if I ran out of my normal top coat, overall its just okay.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Dries fast, keeps my mani for close to a week (I have four kids, so that is a miracle in itself), and plenty of shine. I&#x27;ve done my sister&#x27;s nails with this topcoat and she said she got nearly two weeks out of it before chipping or tip wear showed up. Plus I feel safe using it since it&#x27;s 4-free. :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the best. this nail polish chipped and peeled off my nails in 2 days. i was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great finishing product for nail tips.  It does dry fast and leaves a great shine!  Would definitely recommend for doing your own nail tips.</li>
            <li> Good product,fast delivery, it met my expectations. I applied to my nails and it dried really fast!. Very shiny, I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Doesn&#x27;t contain Toluene AND doesn&#x27;t get gunky like Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> Works great and cheaper than store.</li>
            <li> Your nails will be completely dry within a minute. I don&#x27;t know how I did my nails at home before this product. You don&#x27;t have to worry about being careful with your nails afterwards or fear smudging. You can go right back to whatever you were doing. However, don&#x27;t confuse this for a long lasting top coat.</li>
            <li> Its amazing, does what it says, dries fast and is super shiny. Its kind of thick to put on but its not messy... really recommend</li>
            <li> It is basically same as seche vite. Poshe dries as fast, finishes as glossily, and gets as hard as seche vite. Even the prices are very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, seche vite contains toluene. Poshe doesn&#x27;t. To me, it makes a difference because I feel safer using poshe. In addition, seche vite has a very strong, weird odor that I&#x27;ve never gotten from any other polishes. Poshe just has that regular nail polish scent. No headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Poshe bottle is better than seche vite bottle because poshe bottle is narrower than seche vite; poshe is less prone to drying and becoming goopy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend poshe over seche vite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I took off one star because sometimes poshe makes certain polishes prone to peeling after a day or two. I had the same problem with seche vite as well as almost all the other fast-drying top coats.</li>
            <li> This top coat does what it says.  It dries super fast and shiny.  I do not think it extends your mani/pedi as long as sechevite but, I just put seche vite over it after a day or two.</li>
            <li> A JOY !!!  After a minute of applying it, my nails are COMPLETELY DRY,  Amazing, and not only dry but glossy too,  I love it, also great for those times you need to just touch up the polish in a hurry</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this product to enough people since I was introduced to it about a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone I know who I have turned on to the product love it as well. It really stretches out the lifespan of mani/pedis done at home and gives a professional salon finished look!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other top coats, but this one works the best for me. It goes on smoothly and stays on, protecting the polish and lasts longer than any other brand. It also drys quickly, so would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it does shrink the polish a bit when drying, but really does give a hard shiny finish within a couple of minutes. It&#x27;s great to dry wet nail polish quickly and since I&#x27;m constantly changing my polish color, I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s inexpensive as well since I&#x27;m using it up pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Dried quickly just as described on the box. Within 1 minute my nails were dry and the polish had set. They were not tacky or mushy, but actually dry. No chipping either after a few days and I really put it to the test. I love to cook and therefore wash my hands a lot, and the polish lasted. I have recommended this and the Poshe base coat to my friends.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t peel and dries like glass over OPI polishes. Tried all other popular ones and this wins for my personal nail chemistry. Definitely get the thinner as well because it will cloud quickly if using dark polishes. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have used Poshe Top Coat only on acrylic nails and it is the absolute best!  My color was protected for at least a week and if I added another coat after 7 days, I got another week of protection.  I cannot speak for natural nails and if it works any better but I would think that the oil in our natural nails will ruin any top coat sooner.  All in all, I have never had any top coat last as long as Poshe does on my acrylic nails. No peeling or chips.  Absolute best, bar none for Acrylics!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, it goes on smooth and dries super fast, no smudging, will definitely stick with this brand</li>
