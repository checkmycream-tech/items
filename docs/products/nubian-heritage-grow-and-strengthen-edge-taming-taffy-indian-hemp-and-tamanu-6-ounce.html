            <li>Love that it makes my edges look great while helping them strengthen and grow!</li>
            <li>Very good product , I love it</li>
            <li>However, it will leave your edges moist and smelling good.  </li>
            <li>and it has some good ingredients, so</li>
            <li>Had to order something else but at lease it smells good</li>
            <li>it smells really good</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is great for taming those edges when you need it most.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>and it lays my edges nicely with no problem.</li>
            <li>It is also a nice product for ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it also has a nice fragrance to it</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer, noticed some growth and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>This taffy has a really nice fragrance and texture that feels moisturizing and nourishing to my hair.</li>
            <li>and you will get nice edges</li>
            <li>The Tamanu Edge Taming Taffy has been the best so far.  </li>
            <li>For sure this product does the job for me.</li>
            <li>Plus I do not want to know what will happen if it does build up.. :-)  </li>
            <li>I believe this will keep your hairline moisturized and healthy, but is just too greasy and does not hold your style in the heat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a cream</li>
            <li>Love the product...</li>
            <li>That said, I LOVE the smell of the Nubian Heritage</li>
            <li>It works ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>more humidity</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m told this is a sign of healthy or sealed</li>
            <li>I cant&#x27; keep my fingers out of my hair :)  </li>
            <li>Touching them doesn&#x27;t disturb them now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using gels until I realized they weren&#x27;t doing anything to keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>Worked OK.</li>
            <li>I think I might be able to kick the gel habit and make this a staple for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am not in love with the price</li>
            <li>Its okay.</li>
            <li>Love that there&#x27;s no alcohol.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s work&#x27;s okay for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally,  I have also purchased and fell in love with the Nubian Heritage Coconut and Papaya Body Wash and Vetiver Body</li>
            <li>,  It made my Edge Grow,I love It.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Best when used on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>glad it is available for purchase...</li>
            <li>This product made my hair much softer and it also smells good.</li>
            <li>JBCO Shampoo, JBCO setting lotion, and Yucca and Babob thickening mist provided amazing results for my damaged hair after the first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it grows and strengthens my toddlers baby fine hair - I will post an update.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and easy and within minutes absorbs into my scalp and hair with no visible residue.  </li>
            <li>(I have fine hair so this is a plus for me).</li>
            <li>A wonderfully moisturizing product when used with a little water.</li>
            <li>Such a great product.  </li>
            <li>It is fantastic for my edges.</li>
            <li>My roots and edges were showing and the smooth refined look was of relaxed hair</li>
            <li>then tie a scarf around your head for 15-20 minutes &amp; you&#x27;ll get a smooth , non-drying hold .</li>
            <li>I also felt comfortable using the product in my hair knowing that it wouldn&#x27;t cause edge damage.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and easy, absorbs quickly and leaves no residue.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this as an alternative to using gel on my edges for a smooth look.  </li>
            <li>However, as far as styling is concerned, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>But overall still a good product to grease your scalp.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, and it works really well for smoothing hair edges.</li>
            <li>You will love the smoothing/taming action of this cream!!!  </li>
            <li>Also, it really doesn&#x27;t have a strong preservative (this is a plus for me because the more natural, the better), so it will mold.</li>
            <li>This product has helped tremendously with repairing the damage to my edges.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product - it is better than Jam.</li>
            <li>Works great with the Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil.</li>
            <li>do not recommend this product for people with fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing site to see, and clearly a big challenge.  </li>
            <li>I like the scent so much that I will just smooth some on my edges when my hair is down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is really good for natural hairâ€¦ it keeps my hair soft and no flakes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I tried it recently on freshly washed hair and used just a dallop to twist my hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every time</li>
            <li>I used this on freshly washed and conditioned hair and tied a scarf around it and went on with my business.  </li>
            <li>nothing major which is why I mostly use this product and lessen chemical usage.</li>
            <li>First time trying this product very light weight does not hold natural hair very well.</li>
            <li>Got my order fast love the product so far</li>
            <li>But I do like it very much.  </li>
            <li>It was well packaged and arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>Very smooth to the touch, I use this product to smooth down my edges and the results is great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Tamanu works great without the hard gel buildup</li>
            <li>I love using it with hair moisturizer by African Pride.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today and it did not work for me</li>
            <li>Its my first time using it</li>
            <li>The edge taming taffy was my first life saver.  </li>
            <li>I love the Nubian Heritage and Shea Moisture products I am currently using and would highly recommend them!!</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve obtained the BEST twist-out yet using this taffy and a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a couple days since I wrote the review and excited to say it is still working on my type 4 natural hair.</li>
            <li>The curls are super soft and uniform.  </li>
            <li>clean, natural, non-toxic hair product that works better than I expected on ethnic hair...</li>
            <li>fast  shipping.</li>
            <li>So much so that my hair dresser reminds each time I see her.  </li>
            <li>I really pray they do not stop making this product.</li>
            <li>I used some on damp very moisturized and detangled toddler 3c/4a hair, and it did what it says.  </li>
            <li>recommend using this for protective styling that you intend to stay in for a while, and for sealing over very well moisturized hair on wash day.  </li>
            <li>I wear my hair blown out and flat-ironed straight.</li>
            <li>it also doesn&#x27;t cause much build up .</li>
            <li>Works really well on taming my edges.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to be doing my edges justice by not drying them out as much as the gels..</li>
            <li>I agree it doesn&#x27;t take too much</li>
            <li>Very creamy.  </li>
            <li>I am glad to finally find a product that works and not harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li>I like it cause it&#x27;s healthy for your hair and doesn&#x27;t flake up like other edge controls do.</li>
            <li>I have used many &#x27;edge tamer&#x27;s in the past and thought that this one was worth trying.  </li>
            <li>Great product if you want to slick that hair back!</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, coarse hair with fine</li>
            <li>and so glad this product was not a let down...</li>
            <li>Nubian Heritage is much better than my previous product.</li>
            <li>I actually like it better than the design essential edge control.  </li>
            <li>Would not buy this particular product again because of the smell because it tames my edges.</li>
            <li>I use it for high buns and pony tails.</li>
            <li>The scent is okay, a little earthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say try it at least and make your own determination.</li>
            <li>I love my edge tame taffy...</li>
            <li>It also leaves my edges very soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My curls are soft and bouncy and even my colored ends which we&#x27;re brittle and dry are now moisturized and full of life,</li>
            <li>It saved my edges and now they are growing like wild fire!</li>
            <li>I now just use this to moisturize the hair, not tame the edges.</li>
            <li>It is very thick and aptly named (taffy)</li>
            <li>You only need a little of this cream, I like it better than the gels I have been using from the stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also use it on my daughters (8 years old) hair which is of finer texture (3c).</li>
            <li>This one, by the way does seem to strengthen my edges, but it&#x27;s too early to tell definitively.</li>
            <li>Its been over 3 months since I relaxed my hair and as I transition to my natural hair .  </li>
            <li>This stuff is not heavy</li>
            <li>she was surprised the sheen and natural texture of my hair .  </li>
            <li>By the end of the day, my edges were curled up again to its natural state.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed hair to natural.  </li>
            <li>and it makes my hair soft</li>
            <li>My hair is all natural, but this product makes my edges look permed</li>
            <li>It makes my edges soft and silky feeling.</li>
            <li>wow,</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I bought this at CVS originally and when I tell you that I used to think you needed heavy and drying gels to keep your edges together.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this cream in spite of all the other positive reviews</li>
            <li>I am African American with relaxed color treated fine damaged hair as a result of too tight braids, excess coloring and chemical processing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these products together for approximately one month with absolutely no adverse effects and more positive results after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually keep my hair damp and rub a dime size on my finger tips and smooth the front and my Kitchens (the back of my head).</li>
            <li>It keeps the hair soft but has enough hold to allow me to put my hair into a need pony tail or bun.</li>
            <li>The next day my braids were extremely soft.</li>
            <li>Now, I can control my White hair and the texture is so soft.</li>
            <li>But, after applying this cream to virgin hair roots and edges I can see my way to making the transition back to natural with a manicured look...</li>
            <li>If edge control pomade  usually flakes up your scalp, you may have a mild allergy too</li>
            <li>I use this product for edge of my natural coarse hair and it actually works .</li>
            <li>Works well on short hairstyle for general grooming.</li>
            <li>am African American with relaxed color treated fine hair that was damaged due to too tight braids, excess coloring and chemical relaxing.  </li>
            <li>I have 3C hair (I think) with a mixture of other textures--kinkier around the edges and straighter to the back and sides--and I was so hoping this taffy would have worked to give that nice soft hold that I get with CIAB, which is way too expensive if you ask me.</li>

            <li> I originally purchased this as an alternative to using gel on my edges for a smooth look.  </li>
            <li> However, as far as styling is concerned, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> But overall still a good product to grease your scalp.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, and it works really well for smoothing hair edges.</li>
            <li> You will love the smoothing/taming action of this cream!!!  </li>
            <li> Also, it really doesn&#x27;t have a strong preservative (this is a plus for me because the more natural, the better), so it will mold.</li>
            <li> This product has helped tremendously with repairing the damage to my edges.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product - it is better than Jam.</li>
            <li> Works great with the Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil.</li>
            <li> do not recommend this product for people with fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing site to see, and clearly a big challenge.  </li>
            <li> I like the scent so much that I will just smooth some on my edges when my hair is down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is really good for natural hairâ€¦ it keeps my hair soft and no flakes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I tried it recently on freshly washed hair and used just a dallop to twist my hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every time</li>
            <li> I used this on freshly washed and conditioned hair and tied a scarf around it and went on with my business.  </li>
            <li> nothing major which is why I mostly use this product and lessen chemical usage.</li>
            <li> First time trying this product very light weight does not hold natural hair very well.</li>
            <li> Got my order fast love the product so far</li>
            <li> But I do like it very much.  </li>
            <li> It was well packaged and arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> Very smooth to the touch, I use this product to smooth down my edges and the results is great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Tamanu works great without the hard gel buildup</li>
            <li> I love using it with hair moisturizer by African Pride.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and it did not work for me</li>
            <li> Its my first time using it</li>
            <li> The edge taming taffy was my first life saver.  </li>
            <li> I love the Nubian Heritage and Shea Moisture products I am currently using and would highly recommend them!!</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve obtained the BEST twist-out yet using this taffy and a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a couple days since I wrote the review and excited to say it is still working on my type 4 natural hair.</li>
            <li> The curls are super soft and uniform.  </li>
            <li> clean, natural, non-toxic hair product that works better than I expected on ethnic hair...</li>
            <li> fast  shipping.</li>
            <li> So much so that my hair dresser reminds each time I see her.  </li>
            <li> I really pray they do not stop making this product.</li>
            <li> I used some on damp very moisturized and detangled toddler 3c/4a hair, and it did what it says.  </li>
            <li> recommend using this for protective styling that you intend to stay in for a while, and for sealing over very well moisturized hair on wash day.  </li>
            <li> I wear my hair blown out and flat-ironed straight.</li>
            <li> it also doesn&#x27;t cause much build up .</li>
            <li> Works really well on taming my edges.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to be doing my edges justice by not drying them out as much as the gels..</li>
            <li> I agree it doesn&#x27;t take too much</li>
            <li> Very creamy.  </li>
            <li> I am glad to finally find a product that works and not harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li> I like it cause it&#x27;s healthy for your hair and doesn&#x27;t flake up like other edge controls do.</li>
            <li> I have used many &#x27;edge tamer&#x27;s in the past and thought that this one was worth trying.  </li>
            <li> Great product if you want to slick that hair back!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, coarse hair with fine</li>
            <li> and so glad this product was not a let down...</li>
            <li> Nubian Heritage is much better than my previous product.</li>
            <li> I actually like it better than the design essential edge control.  </li>
            <li> Would not buy this particular product again because of the smell because it tames my edges.</li>
            <li> I use it for high buns and pony tails.</li>
            <li> The scent is okay, a little earthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say try it at least and make your own determination.</li>
            <li> I love my edge tame taffy...</li>
            <li> It also leaves my edges very soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My curls are soft and bouncy and even my colored ends which we&#x27;re brittle and dry are now moisturized and full of life,</li>
            <li> It saved my edges and now they are growing like wild fire!</li>
            <li> I now just use this to moisturize the hair, not tame the edges.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and aptly named (taffy)</li>
            <li> You only need a little of this cream, I like it better than the gels I have been using from the stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use it on my daughters (8 years old) hair which is of finer texture (3c).</li>
            <li> This one, by the way does seem to strengthen my edges, but it&#x27;s too early to tell definitively.</li>
            <li> Its been over 3 months since I relaxed my hair and as I transition to my natural hair .  </li>
            <li> This stuff is not heavy</li>
            <li> she was surprised the sheen and natural texture of my hair .  </li>
            <li> By the end of the day, my edges were curled up again to its natural state.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed hair to natural.  </li>
            <li> and it makes my hair soft</li>
            <li> My hair is all natural, but this product makes my edges look permed</li>
            <li> It makes my edges soft and silky feeling.</li>
            <li> wow,</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this at CVS originally and when I tell you that I used to think you needed heavy and drying gels to keep your edges together.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this cream in spite of all the other positive reviews</li>
            <li> I am African American with relaxed color treated fine damaged hair as a result of too tight braids, excess coloring and chemical processing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these products together for approximately one month with absolutely no adverse effects and more positive results after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually keep my hair damp and rub a dime size on my finger tips and smooth the front and my Kitchens (the back of my head).</li>
            <li> It keeps the hair soft but has enough hold to allow me to put my hair into a need pony tail or bun.</li>
            <li> The next day my braids were extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Now, I can control my White hair and the texture is so soft.</li>
            <li> But, after applying this cream to virgin hair roots and edges I can see my way to making the transition back to natural with a manicured look...</li>
            <li> If edge control pomade  usually flakes up your scalp, you may have a mild allergy too</li>
            <li> I use this product for edge of my natural coarse hair and it actually works .</li>
            <li> Works well on short hairstyle for general grooming.</li>
            <li> am African American with relaxed color treated fine hair that was damaged due to too tight braids, excess coloring and chemical relaxing.  </li>
            <li> I have 3C hair (I think) with a mixture of other textures--kinkier around the edges and straighter to the back and sides--and I was so hoping this taffy would have worked to give that nice soft hold that I get with CIAB, which is way too expensive if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair flacky dose not last long</li>
            <li> I was surprised it had the ability to hold anything down</li>
            <li> But as far as keeping the edges down?</li>
            <li> but thankfully a small amount goes a long way and in the ends I don&#x27;t have to spend as much.  </li>
            <li> Just use a little on the front of your hair grab a soft brush</li>
            <li> and I it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my hair is too kinky but it doesn&#x27;t hold for too long.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and although the product is white,  it disappears once applied to hair and brushed in.</li>
            <li> leave-in next as I need a good protein leave-in and had to stop using the other one due to hair loss :(.  </li>
            <li> The use of other gels have  actually thinned my edges .</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts under my wigs and doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the same product buildup as gel or edge waxes but slicks edges down.</li>
            <li> it just looks naturally straight but not hard or fake like gelled down black gel.</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> - may be too heavy for daily use.  </li>
            <li> Not really.  </li>
            <li> I also like the fact its not too heavy and its non-greasy so it can double as pomade/selant after you put in a water-based moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and  a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I use small amount around the edge,tie scarf and next morning  </li>
            <li> am looking forward to trying other Nubian products --</li>
            <li> I used this along with other products and braided my hair.</li>
            <li> My edges broke off due to perming my hair for years</li>
            <li> Not what I expected!</li>
            <li> I put some on to slick back my whispy hairs before going to the gym.</li>
            <li> I read some of the other reviews and some say it made their edges grow</li>
            <li> and I went to use it the other day and there was black mold spores in it</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it slicks down my edges (4a) when I&#x27;m trying to lengthen the time between my texlax applications.</li>
            <li> but the product doesn&#x27;t hold my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> I believe it DOES revert the hair, which my edges do not stay laying down.</li>
            <li> guess I&#x27;ll keep looking for a product that lays my edges down without reverting my hair.</li>
            <li> Works well on my edges to keep them Down</li>
            <li> When I took the scarf down, this product worked almost as well as using a hair gel.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look greasy in the morning</li>
            <li> My fingers are crossed that this will become a routine must have for me and other 4d hair types!</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that I needed hair gels to slick down my kinky, dry, tangled-prone, porous hair.  </li>
            <li> It does lay down my edges, but after about a half an hour to an hour, my edges lift (maybe because it reverts the hair).</li>
            <li> so I just rubbed it through the half of her hair that was not yet styled.  </li>
            <li> like i anticipated , but it works well w/ black gel &amp; eco styler gel .</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t even used half of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very thin and highly porous.  </li>
            <li> Less harsh then gel.</li>
            <li> It may be a little too greasy for you.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My hair came out and what is left is extremely thin.</li>
            <li> Edges pop up again after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> You need a tiny, (and by this mean I mean miniscule) amount.  </li>
            <li> a little bit goes a looooong way!</li>
            <li> just a little goes a loooong way!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been so frustrating trying to find something to tame my edges, let alone a single blog or discussion online w/ product recommendations for this allergy!!</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thick and coily but this lays it down!</li>
            <li> oh and of course my edges are so slick.</li>
            <li> No more flaky hair gel for me.  </li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t slick my edges</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I tried this on my edges and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transitioning and it is difficult to find something that holds my edges down without puffing up in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> This was a hard to find item that works.</li>
            <li> --my flyaways were popping up like crazy before I even left the house</li>
            <li> This product has a thick creamy consistency..</li>
            <li> NO MORE BREAKAGE!</li>
            <li> I put down by her roots to give the base of her twists a neater less frizzy look.  </li>
            <li> My edges are slightly broken off but</li>
            <li> However, my edges are thin natually and I have not noticed any growth on my edges while using this product.</li>
            <li> It also leaves dusty look and it builds up on my hair.</li>
            <li> In addition, I have used the product now for approximately one month</li>
            <li> Jar is very small and you must use alot of the product to receive results!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two containers go bad before I realized I should keep it in the refrigerator.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love my edge tame taffy...whatever it&#x27;s called. It does sometimes leave a white residue. Nevertheless, it slicks down my edges (4a) when I&#x27;m trying to lengthen the time between my texlax applications. My edges are slightly broken off but nothing major which is why I mostly use this product and lessen chemical usage. For sure this product does the job for me. I also use it on my daughters (8 years old) hair which is of finer texture (3c). Smells great too...</li>
            <li> WOW!!!! A taffy (edge tamer), that actually softens your hair while you use it, without the build up harshness of it.  I only use it every couple of days because it keeps my edges tamed that entire time.  Plus I do not want to know what will happen if it does build up.. :-)  But I do like it very much.  I highly recommend this product - it is better than Jam.</li>
            <li> Grew my edges backs in weeks!</li>
            <li> Dries Afro am hair making it brittle and shedding</li>
            <li> This product is really good for natural hairâ€¦ it keeps my hair soft and no flakes. I love using it with hair moisturizer by African Pride. My only flaw is if I don&#x27;t let it settle my hair</li>
            <li> I use this product for edge of my natural coarse hair and it actually works . The use of other gels have  actually thinned my edges . I like the ingredients listed in this taffy. It&#x27;s been a couple days since I wrote the review and excited to say it is still working on my type 4 natural hair. I use small amount around the edge,tie scarf and next morning  hair looks great. I am glad to finally find a product that works and not harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li> I believe this will keep your hairline moisturized and healthy, but is just too greasy and does not hold your style in the heat.</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected.  It&#x27;s more of a cream then a &amp;#34;taffy&amp;#34;.  I have used many &#x27;edge tamer&#x27;s in the past and thought that this one was worth trying.  If you are looking for &amp;#34;control&amp;#34; this is not the product for that.  However, it will leave your edges moist and smelling good.  I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love the product... But has anyone else had the problem with mold growing in it ?? I&#x27;ve have been using the same container for almost a year and I went to use it the other day and there was black mold spores in it</li>
            <li> This product has a thick creamy consistency.. I was surprised it had the ability to hold anything down but it did for a short period of time. I like it cause it&#x27;s healthy for your hair and doesn&#x27;t flake up like other edge controls do. If you can be bothered with reapplication it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and it did not work for me--my flyaways were popping up like crazy before I even left the house and I had to dab on some of my regular edge tamer, which is Curls in a Bottle hair styling solution. I have 3C hair (I think) with a mixture of other textures--kinkier around the edges and straighter to the back and sides--and I was so hoping this taffy would have worked to give that nice soft hold that I get with CIAB, which is way too expensive if you ask me. That said, I LOVE the smell of the Nubian Heritage Grow And Strenthen Edge Taming Taffy and it has some good ingredients, so I&#x27;ll add it to my routine as a moisturizing hair dress and see how that goes.</li>
            <li> First time trying this product very light weight does not hold natural hair very well. But overall still a good product to grease your scalp.</li>
            <li> It works ok. It does not make your hair feel sticky,  which I like.</li>
            <li> Great product if you want to slick that hair back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transitioning and it is difficult to find something that holds my edges down without puffing up in a few minutes.  The Tamanu Edge Taming Taffy has been the best so far.  It keeps the hair soft but has enough hold to allow me to put my hair into a need pony tail or bun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the edge control for about a year. I have 4b hair and it lays my edges nicely with no problem. I like that it just looks naturally straight but not hard or fake like gelled down black gel. However, my edges are thin natually and I have not noticed any growth on my edges while using this product. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars but no growth for me.</li>
            <li> Over priced!  Jar is very small and you must use alot of the product to receive results!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> great product  would  buy  again!  fast  shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but the product doesn&#x27;t hold my hair down at all. Had to order something else but at lease it smells good</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well for edge control at all</li>
            <li> I have alot of hair.  So much so that my hair dresser reminds each time I see her.  It&#x27;s also very thin and highly porous.  A tiny bit of humidity and my curls expand;  more humidity and they consume my entire head.  It&#x27;s an amazing site to see, and clearly a big challenge.  Enter...this product... it helps to greatly seal the cuticles of my hair.  My curls stay in tact, curls are elongated, and my hair dries faster (I&#x27;m told this is a sign of healthy or sealed cuticles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took one star off because this product can be a bit perfumery.  It fades, but gradually.  I&#x27;d prefer a lighter smell...but the trade off it delivers in terms of rockin&#x27; curls is priceless.  I cant&#x27; keep my fingers out of my hair :)  The curls are super soft and uniform.  Touching them doesn&#x27;t disturb them now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to trying other Nubian products -- will try the EVOO and Moringa leave-in next as I need a good protein leave-in and had to stop using the other one due to hair loss :(.  This one, by the way does seem to strengthen my edges, but it&#x27;s too early to tell definitively.</li>
            <li> Love this! I&#x27;ve been using gels until I realized they weren&#x27;t doing anything to keep my hair healthy. My hair is extremely thick and coily but this lays it down! Amazing! Smells great, great price...a little bit goes a looooong way! Love that it makes my edges look great while helping them strengthen and grow! I do recommend using it in damp hair followed with a silk scarf and it works in no time!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this as an alternative to using gel on my edges for a smooth look.  This pomade works wonders. Best when used on wet hair.  I tried it recently on freshly washed hair and used just a dallop to twist my hair. I&#x27;ve obtained the BEST twist-out yet using this taffy and a little goes a very long way. My curls are soft and bouncy and even my colored ends which we&#x27;re brittle and dry are now moisturized and full of life, oh and of course my edges are so slick. And no fly-always or frizz.  So this is now my staple product. I really pray they do not stop making this product. I think I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Does NOT control edges on 4D hair! I was disappointed when I tried this on my edges and it did absolutely nothing. 4D ladies this is an excellent product for moisturizing! Its my first time using it and after I washed my hair with a clarifying shampoo my hair was stripped of oils. I used this along with other products and braided my hair. This product made my hair much softer and it also smells good.The next day my braids were extremely soft. I hope it lasts under my wigs and doesn&#x27;t dry out. I did seal my hair after I used this product. My fingers are crossed that this will become a routine must have for me and other 4d hair types!</li>
            <li> I bought this at CVS originally and when I tell you that I used to think you needed heavy and drying gels to keep your edges together. I am telling you this stuff has helped my hair line grow because the gel was drying and breaking my hair.  Its been over 3 months since I relaxed my hair and as I transition to my natural hair .  This stuff is not heavy it smells really good and  a little goes a long way. I usually keep my hair damp and rub a dime size on my finger tips and smooth the front and my Kitchens (the back of my head). Let me tell you my girlfriend kept on asking me if I got my hair relaxed  she was surprised the sheen and natural texture of my hair .  Definitely worth every time and I have bought it  6 months ago and I it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair came out and what is left is extremely thin.</li>
            <li> No more flaky hair gel for me.  The Tamanu works great without the hard gel buildup</li>
            <li> My edges broke off due to perming my hair for years and I use this product for about a month and noticed results. Now I have hair on my edges I no longer have bald spots. I also use this product to style and tam my edges.</li>
            <li> Such a great product.  I used some on damp very moisturized and detangled toddler 3c/4a hair, and it did what it says.  You need a tiny, (and by this mean I mean miniscule) amount.  I put down by her roots to give the base of her twists a neater less frizzy look.  Worked well.  I also ended up halfway through the process with a lot of it on my hands so I just rubbed it through the half of her hair that was not yet styled.  I noticed instant moisture and curl definition, plus shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using this for protective styling that you intend to stay in for a while, and for sealing over very well moisturized hair on wash day.  It is very thick and aptly named (taffy) so a little goes a long way - may be too heavy for daily use.  It is also a nice product for ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it grows and strengthens my toddlers baby fine hair - I will post an update.  However, as far as styling is concerned, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product did not deliver for my edges. I wear my hair blown out and flat-ironed straight. It does lay down my edges, but after about a half an hour to an hour, my edges lift (maybe because it reverts the hair). It also leaves dusty look and it builds up on my hair. I believe it DOES revert the hair, which my edges do not stay laying down. The scent is okay, a little earthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ll keep looking for a product that lays my edges down without reverting my hair.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, my edges were curled up again to its natural state.  Not what I expected!</li>
            <li> Very smooth to the touch, I use this product to smooth down my edges and the results is great.&lt;br /&gt; Now, I can control my White hair and the texture is so soft. Works great with the Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil.</li>
            <li> Works great! Isn&#x27;t perfect but no hair breakage ! I love it!</li>
            <li> A wonderfully moisturizing product when used with a little water. A little goes a long way and although the product is white,  it disappears once applied to hair and brushed in. Works well on short hairstyle for general grooming. Brings some order to unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I learned of this product on Amazon.  It is fantastic for my edges. Nubian Heritage is much better than my previous product. It moisturizes and controls my edges.  It was well packaged and arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> Works well on my edges to keep them Down and it doesn&#x27;t flake like gel and it also has a nice fragrance to it</li>
            <li> Very good product , I love it</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer, noticed some growth and I love the smell. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This Is REAL Good!!!  I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed hair to natural.  My roots and edges were showing and the smooth refined look was of relaxed hair was calling me back.  But, after applying this cream to virgin hair roots and edges I can see my way to making the transition back to natural with a manicured look...no naps, curl beads, or short dry-straw-fly-away strands.  This completely smoothed out all rough edges...softened and smoothed my virgin hair.  I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this cream in spite of all the other positive reviews but I&#x27;m really impressed and so glad this product was not a let down...glad it is available for purchase...clean, natural, non-toxic hair product that works better than I expected on ethnic hair...just a little goes a loooong way!  You will love the smoothing/taming action of this cream!!!  It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t slick my edges like i anticipated , but it works well w/ black gel &amp; eco styler gel . i suggest using this &amp; then putting the gel over it . then tie a scarf around your head for 15-20 minutes &amp; you&#x27;ll get a smooth , non-drying hold . it also doesn&#x27;t cause much build up .</li>
            <li> Worked OK. Less harsh then gel. After a month it stated to mold which I didn&#x27;t know would happen. Had to throw it away</li>
            <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t have the same product buildup as gel or edge waxes but slicks edges down.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that I needed hair gels to slick down my kinky, dry, tangled-prone, porous hair.  I used this on freshly washed and conditioned hair and tied a scarf around it and went on with my business.  When I took the scarf down, this product worked almost as well as using a hair gel.  I think I might be able to kick the gel habit and make this a staple for my hair.  I am not in love with the price but thankfully a small amount goes a long way and in the ends I don&#x27;t have to spend as much.  I am Team Nubian Heritage all the way.</li>
            <li> Its okay. Thats it. I did find that wetting my edges did help a lot. I put some on to slick back my whispy hairs before going to the gym. On my way there my roommate told me i had white stuff in my hair. It was the taffy. I did like that it did crunch my hair like gel. I also felt comfortable using the product in my hair knowing that it wouldn&#x27;t cause edge damage.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair flacky dose not last long</li>
            <li> Works really well on taming my edges. Great smell and feel. Love that there&#x27;s no alcohol.</li>
            <li> You only need a little of this cream, I like it better than the gels I have been using from the stores.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be doing my edges justice by not drying them out as much as the gels.. I use it in conjunction with the &amp;#34;Entwine butter cream&amp;#34;.... also purchased here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It smells out of date</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it for high buns and pony tails. I love the scent, and it works really well for smoothing hair edges. I like the scent so much that I will just smooth some on my edges when my hair is down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product for people with fine, straight hair. It may be a little too greasy for you. I have naturally curly, coarse hair with fine strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep this in the refrigerator because it contains hemp oil, which goes rancid. Also, it really doesn&#x27;t have a strong preservative (this is a plus for me because the more natural, the better), so it will mold. I&#x27;ve had two containers go bad before I realized I should keep it in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my hair is too kinky but it doesn&#x27;t hold for too long.  I do like the smell and it makes my hair soft so I&#x27;ll continue to use it. I actually like it better than the design essential edge control.  I read some of the other reviews and some say it made their edges grow but I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth.  I agree it doesn&#x27;t take too much and I&#x27;ve had mine now for over 2 months and I haven&#x27;t even used half of it. I&#x27;d say try it at least and make your own determination.</li>
            <li> May work for some but not for me. I did not care for this edge taming taffy. I am always trying something different in hopes it will do what I want it to do but this just wast not for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the TRUTH! It saved my edges and now they are growing like wild fire! NO MORE BREAKAGE! I also use it on my ends when I put my hair into twists or braid outs .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 3 b/c naturalista.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to propylene glycol, a chemical that&#x27;s found in all the edge controls I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s been so frustrating trying to find something to tame my edges, let alone a single blog or discussion online w/ product recommendations for this allergy!! This taffy has a really nice fragrance and texture that feels moisturizing and nourishing to my hair. AND no allergic reaction! If edge control pomade  usually flakes up your scalp, you may have a mild allergy too so this is the one to try. My hair is all natural, but this product makes my edges look permed +  there&#x27;s no residue.</li>
            <li> This it the best Grow Edge I ever used. LOVE IT !!!</li>
            <li> Kinda smells like relaxer. Would not buy this particular product again because of the smell because it tames my edges.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and a little goes a long way. Just use a little on the front of your hair grab a soft brush and you will get nice edges it doesn&#x27;t stay that way because it&#x27;s not gel but it makes your hair look beautiful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s work&#x27;s okay for me.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered in a timely fashion and packaged well.  In addition, I have used the product now for approximately one month and I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am African American with relaxed color treated fine hair that was damaged due to too tight braids, excess coloring and chemical relaxing.  This product has helped tremendously with repairing the damage to my edges.  It goes on smooth and easy and within minutes absorbs into my scalp and hair with no visible residue.  It also leaves my edges very soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, I have also purchased the Nubian Heritage Indian Hemp and Tamanu Grow and Strengthen Masque and Herbal Custard which&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was delivered in a timely fashion and well packaged.  I am African American with relaxed color treated fine damaged hair as a result of too tight braids, excess coloring and chemical processing.  The edge taming taffy was my first life saver.  It goes on smooth and easy, absorbs quickly and leaves no residue.  It makes my edges soft and silky feeling. This coupled with the Grow and Strengthen&lt;br /&gt;Masque, Herbal Custard, and Shea Moisture (Nubian Heritage sister company) JBCO Shampoo, JBCO setting lotion, and Yucca and Babob thickening mist provided amazing results for my damaged hair after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these products together for approximately one month with absolutely no adverse effects and more positive results after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally,  I have also purchased and fell in love with the Nubian Heritage Coconut and Papaya Body Wash and Vetiver Body Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I have finally found my one/two go to place for my hair care and body.  I love the Nubian Heritage and Shea Moisture products I am currently using and would highly recommend them!!</li>
            <li> This was a hard to find item that works. I was running low &amp; bought the two that they had.</li>
            <li> wow,Great product,  It made my Edge Grow,I love It.</li>
            <li> Got my order fast love the product so far</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff.  Very creamy.  It is very good for the hair.  But as far as keeping the edges down? Not really.  Edges pop up again after a few hours.  I now just use this to moisturize the hair, not tame the edges.</li>
            <li> This is great for taming those edges when you need it most. It works great and its a non-gel, its just like a cream. I also like the fact its not too heavy and its non-greasy so it can double as pomade/selant after you put in a water-based moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look greasy in the morning (I have fine hair so this is a plus for me). I use this at night before bed time. It works pretty well. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
