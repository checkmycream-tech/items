            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>Well, it does do a great job at smoothing and blurring -</li>
            <li>Does what it says and the price is great on Subscribe and Save.  </li>
            <li>do not like it , but love Garnier Ultra-Lift night creme, and the day cremes !!</li>
            <li>Powder and concealer apply very nicely over this.</li>
            <li>I bought this at a store (at a lower price), but I wanted to review it because this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really effective - minimizes the look of pores and give a beautiful matte finish.  </li>
            <li>Win Win :-)</li>
            <li>Skin feels good after putting this on.</li>
            <li>I use it as a moisturizer, it feels really good on the skin.</li>
            <li>Do I think this is a good buy?</li>

            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>love this !  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- When I first applied this, it does give me a blurring effect, which is very impressive.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing for people of any age.</li>
            <li>great product , smooth&#x27;s skin and minimizes pores</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t see it, it kind of melts into your pores, but doesn&#x27;t fill or clog them like spackle.</li>
            <li>Packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>and it gives really nice blurring.</li>
            <li>it was literally just my honest reaction...</li>
            <li>I am a fan of Mally primer from QVC and this is a cheaper but equally effective alternative</li>
            <li>I, too, bought this at CVS for a lower price - but if it becomes price effective through Amazon, I would re-order from here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any kind of &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>In addition, after trying to apply this after putting on moisturizer, it sloughed itself and/or the moisturizer off which was also kind of gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not Amazon&#x27;s fault but my own.  </li>
            <li>After putting this on, I use Garnier&#x27;s BB cream, which as it turned out, I liked way better than any of the others I tried.  </li>
            <li>much, much better.</li>
            <li>I admit I feel like I have to use a bit more than the dime size it recommends,  </li>
            <li>but they are much better</li>
            <li>and I am totally okay with that.</li>
            <li>It works just as promised and makes my skin smooth like silk!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>it just gives your face a smoother more even look to it...</li>
            <li>you will love this product too...</li>
            <li>hopefully you are able to see the difference in the picture...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and use it every time I put on makeup.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I used to love this stuff and would have given it five stars, because it made my face matte</li>
            <li>Just tried the sample and Love Love Love it.  </li>
            <li>the more I used it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Under the foundation doesn&#x27;t really do that, although it&#x27;s not that great either.</li>
            <li>It does somewhat minimize the look of my pores, but that comes with an even more oily face after 30 or so minutes of application..</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s more $$, but there are specials in the drugstores.</li>
            <li>Be sure to put this on AFTER your moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Need I say more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed that this is so inexpensive for the quality, and I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, makes your skin feel like silk.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used it in this capacity, but I&#x27;m confident it would work.</li>
            <li>Overall, an excellent makeup product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 48, and I&#x27;ve tried many creams, lotions, serums -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a cover-up, more of a skin smoother.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of smoothing out my skin and absorbing oil throughout the day.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d say this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>A better value than Porefessional, yet</li>
            <li>Love the blur with this skin conditioner.  </li>
            <li>At first I loved this stuff, but then I realized it was causing my makeup to break-up.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect lotion for women with fine lines and such.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth and silky it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I apply it after sunscreen and so far they go together great.  </li>
            <li>Just keep massaging it in and the crumbly bits will &amp;#34;soften&amp;#34; and smear on easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>I could see an immedieate difference in my pores and FINE lines.</li>
            <li>The Garnier Blur makes fine lines disappear.  </li>
            <li>the $$ those are just fine.</li>
            <li>I see no reason to pay a HUGE amt of $$ for POREfessional.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s hugely helpful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this, so I tried it out, and...</li>
            <li>but the end result is worth going through it a bit quicker :)</li>
            <li>The product is smooth to apply.</li>
            <li>My face feels so smooth and</li>
            <li>I believe that this product works by diffracting light that hits your skin.</li>
            <li>So smooth.</li>
            <li>Price wise, I&#x27;ve seen much lower than the A. price as it is right now.  </li>
            <li>et can be applied right over the top and will not affect the use of the product.  </li>
            <li>You will have high hopes I know, but I&#x27;m sure whatever primer you are using at home is much better than this.</li>
            <li>+, this is worth a try!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I have used many of the higher end brands and none work as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>My lines are barely visable now and it feels so good on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is a good smother, just not terrific  Easy to apply in the morning and fresh scent also.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like it would crumble right off my face!</li>
            <li>I use it on a clean face, squirt on fingertips and kind of mush it until it warms and softens then press it into my cheeks near my nose.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought a little sample of this from the drug store and when I realized how great it is</li>
            <li>The lotion is very smooth and it makes my face feel very soft.  </li>
            <li>When I apply it on my face, it will also make my dry patches visible, so it does not make my face a nice smooth surface to apply my foundation on.</li>
            <li>I have a very oily face with huge pores.</li>
            <li>Smooth and help under make up make skin like baby and ready for make up.</li>
            <li>I have really huge pores and this product covers them really well.</li>
            <li>It really does smooth my skin.</li>
            <li>well worth it for $12.99 (plus tax), but even worth it at Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>I like it better under my foundation, and the reason is because when I put it on TOP of my foundation, it feels super slippery, my dry spots would show, and it made my foundation SLIP/RUB OFF my face while I gently apply it on my t-zone.</li>
            <li>This is a superior product than the other Blurs on the market.  </li>
            <li>I actually does soften imperfections and also makes foundation application smooth and easy.  </li>
            <li>On top I use Bare Minerals Mineral Veil, then blush.  </li>
            <li>All 3 are good, so then it comes down to value because I see no difference at all in what they do as a</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and approaching 70 years old, so I appreciate all the help I can get.</li>
            <li>have fairly good, even skin with little discoloration.</li>
            <li>I use it every day  religiously and love the way my skin feels after applying.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am glad I tried this product and will buy again.</li>
            <li>After application leaves my skin smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>It keeps my face satiny and pretty from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm.</li>
            <li>Does not diminish pores as I expected, but nice feeling of smoothness and some coverage beneath foundation.</li>
            <li>I first tried a sample from People magazine, and went straight out to buy it.</li>
            <li>It also makes your dry patches noticeable, so make sure you exfoliate your face well.</li>
            <li>It certainly does the trick and makes my face feel like it used to.  </li>
            <li>I have oily, aging, acneic skin with large pores.</li>
            <li>I got the large tube from Amazon</li>
            <li>I have large pores in my T-zone.</li>
            <li>Ok...so..I&#x27;m writting my reviews...got to this product and immediately ran into the bathroom to put this on half my face to try and show you how amazing this product really is...</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, so I make sure to exfoliate my face before applying makeup and keep myself very moisturized before putting this stuff on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy and really cuts out a lot of effort in my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the price, but I went ahead and paid it because I did see it more expensive in CVS.</li>
            <li>Had I not broken out, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like wearing make up ...and with this stuff you can just put it on after your mosturizer and go...</li>
            <li>But haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference with the &amp;#34;blur effect&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and disappears instantly.</li>
            <li>This does work very well however there is a cheaper option that works just as well.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this product.</li>
            <li>It really does feel like silk across the skin and it made my foundation feel smoother too.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it quite as much as I anticipated,</li>
            <li>At the very end of the day, I did notice that I started to look shiny around my T-zone.</li>
            <li>I will be re-purchasing this product again in the full size and save it for days when I want to look extra pretty.</li>
            <li>Somehow, it manages to cling right on to your skin and feels really soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;blurs&amp;#34; and they work ok but nothing to write home about.  </li>
            <li>She said that it helped control the shine on her face much better than other products.</li>
            <li>I like it much better than the other primers I&#x27;ve tried under my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It seriously evens out even good skin.</li>
            <li>left my skin super greasy/oily.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I am 25, so the only &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; I have are tiny laugh lines, but I have big pores on my nose and upper cheek area, and this really honestly does look like you took the blur filter on Instagram straight to your face.</li>
            <li>you look a little more refreshed....</li>
            <li>I got a free sample in a magazine and was curious to try it out.</li>
            <li>But, for her, she has to brush on an additional layer of setting powder over the 5-second blur and that is enough in combination to keep her looking fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I was impressed at how much less obvious my fine lines and pores were after swiping some of this weird light pink stuff on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This not only made my face look smoother, it felt super soft like I had a spa treatment.</li>
            <li>the picture I only put it on the right side of my face...</li>
            <li>It may seem pricey, but compared to other primers it is relatively cheap.</li>
            <li>New product</li>
            <li>It does come out of the tube like no other cream or ointment I&#x27;ve used, but it glides on and spreads very evenly.  </li>
            <li>My sister, who has really oily skin, has major problems with shine.</li>
            <li>I would only use this as a base for very light makeup, also feels great alone with no makeup.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>When you first squeeze it out of the tube, it is opaque white and has this crumbly texture.</li>
            <li>I get the exact same results.  </li>
            <li>Garnier isn&#x27;t cheap, but it&#x27;s not super pricey and you get a LOT of product.  </li>
            <li>Not only could I not tell a difference in my skin but pretty much all of my makeup had smudged off within the next hour.</li>
            <li>I youtubed a review that said it instantly makes large pores disappear.  </li>
            <li>my face looks so clear without putting any cover up i look airbrushed ..happy with this</li>
            <li>also have 2 of the ELF primers (clear + purple) - for</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m now sensitive to dimethicone (silicone) products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 38 years old and have bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>(I am in my early 50s).  </li>
            <li>but when I use it my skin feels soft as silk.</li>
            <li>He told me wow</li>
            <li>And my skin feels butter soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, like another reviewer said it feels very waxy which is a gross feeling on the face.</li>
            <li>It definitely makes my face more oily than it already was, and my skin just feels heavy, like</li>
            <li>have tried a few other similar products and they worked good too.</li>
            <li>Smooth as silk, a little goes a long way, and creates a wonderful, smooth, silky base upon which to put other things.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the same &amp;#34;color/shade&amp;#34;, but it offers the exact same effect in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Hard to describe, but it&#x27;s very cool.  </li>
            <li>I usually use Prime Time by Bare Escentuals or Smashbox, but I saw someone on reddit trying out all the cheaper ones, so I gave this one a shot because I could see what a huge difference it made on the girl&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Holy cow - this stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>But the Garnier 5 Second Blur creates a lovely base for all this, and my skin has never looked smoother or better.  </li>
            <li>It does make my skin SLIGHTLY softer, but much more pale.</li>
            <li>BUT I only gave it 2 stars because I developed a couple of zits after using the Blue all day (morning till evening).</li>
            <li>This product really does make them less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Skin feels good after putting this on.</li>
            <li> I use it as a moisturizer, it feels really good on the skin.</li>
            <li> Do I think this is a good buy?</li>
            <li> Looks and feels good but made mascara smudge.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> love this !  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- When I first applied this, it does give me a blurring effect, which is very impressive.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing for people of any age.</li>
            <li> great product , smooth&#x27;s skin and minimizes pores</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see it, it kind of melts into your pores, but doesn&#x27;t fill or clog them like spackle.</li>
            <li> Packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> and it gives really nice blurring.</li>
            <li> it was literally just my honest reaction...</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Mally primer from QVC and this is a cheaper but equally effective alternative</li>
            <li> I, too, bought this at CVS for a lower price - but if it becomes price effective through Amazon, I would re-order from here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any kind of &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> In addition, after trying to apply this after putting on moisturizer, it sloughed itself and/or the moisturizer off which was also kind of gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not Amazon&#x27;s fault but my own.  </li>
            <li> After putting this on, I use Garnier&#x27;s BB cream, which as it turned out, I liked way better than any of the others I tried.  </li>
            <li> much, much better.</li>
            <li> I admit I feel like I have to use a bit more than the dime size it recommends,  </li>
            <li> but they are much better</li>
            <li> and I am totally okay with that.</li>
            <li> It works just as promised and makes my skin smooth like silk!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> it just gives your face a smoother more even look to it...</li>
            <li> you will love this product too...</li>
            <li> hopefully you are able to see the difference in the picture...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and use it every time I put on makeup.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I used to love this stuff and would have given it five stars, because it made my face matte</li>
            <li> Just tried the sample and Love Love Love it.  </li>
            <li> the more I used it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Under the foundation doesn&#x27;t really do that, although it&#x27;s not that great either.</li>
            <li> It does somewhat minimize the look of my pores, but that comes with an even more oily face after 30 or so minutes of application..</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s more $$, but there are specials in the drugstores.</li>
            <li> Be sure to put this on AFTER your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Need I say more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed that this is so inexpensive for the quality, and I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, makes your skin feel like silk.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used it in this capacity, but I&#x27;m confident it would work.</li>
            <li> Overall, an excellent makeup product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 48, and I&#x27;ve tried many creams, lotions, serums -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a cover-up, more of a skin smoother.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of smoothing out my skin and absorbing oil throughout the day.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d say this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> A better value than Porefessional, yet</li>
            <li> Love the blur with this skin conditioner.  </li>
            <li> At first I loved this stuff, but then I realized it was causing my makeup to break-up.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect lotion for women with fine lines and such.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth and silky it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I apply it after sunscreen and so far they go together great.  </li>
            <li> Just keep massaging it in and the crumbly bits will &amp;#34;soften&amp;#34; and smear on easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply</li>
            <li> I could see an immedieate difference in my pores and FINE lines.</li>
            <li> The Garnier Blur makes fine lines disappear.  </li>
            <li> the $$ those are just fine.</li>
            <li> I see no reason to pay a HUGE amt of $$ for POREfessional.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hugely helpful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this, so I tried it out, and...</li>
            <li> but the end result is worth going through it a bit quicker :)</li>
            <li> The product is smooth to apply.</li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth and</li>
            <li> I believe that this product works by diffracting light that hits your skin.</li>
            <li> So smooth.</li>
            <li> Price wise, I&#x27;ve seen much lower than the A. price as it is right now.  </li>
            <li> et can be applied right over the top and will not affect the use of the product.  </li>
            <li> You will have high hopes I know, but I&#x27;m sure whatever primer you are using at home is much better than this.</li>
            <li> +, this is worth a try!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have used many of the higher end brands and none work as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My lines are barely visable now and it feels so good on my skin.</li>
            <li> It is a good smother, just not terrific  Easy to apply in the morning and fresh scent also.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like it would crumble right off my face!</li>
            <li> I use it on a clean face, squirt on fingertips and kind of mush it until it warms and softens then press it into my cheeks near my nose.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought a little sample of this from the drug store and when I realized how great it is</li>
            <li> The lotion is very smooth and it makes my face feel very soft.  </li>
            <li> When I apply it on my face, it will also make my dry patches visible, so it does not make my face a nice smooth surface to apply my foundation on.</li>
            <li> I have a very oily face with huge pores.</li>
            <li> Smooth and help under make up make skin like baby and ready for make up.</li>
            <li> I have really huge pores and this product covers them really well.</li>
            <li> It really does smooth my skin.</li>
            <li> well worth it for $12.99 (plus tax), but even worth it at Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> I like it better under my foundation, and the reason is because when I put it on TOP of my foundation, it feels super slippery, my dry spots would show, and it made my foundation SLIP/RUB OFF my face while I gently apply it on my t-zone.</li>
            <li> This is a superior product than the other Blurs on the market.  </li>
            <li> I actually does soften imperfections and also makes foundation application smooth and easy.  </li>
            <li> On top I use Bare Minerals Mineral Veil, then blush.  </li>
            <li> All 3 are good, so then it comes down to value because I see no difference at all in what they do as a</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and approaching 70 years old, so I appreciate all the help I can get.</li>
            <li> have fairly good, even skin with little discoloration.</li>
            <li> I use it every day  religiously and love the way my skin feels after applying.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am glad I tried this product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> After application leaves my skin smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> It keeps my face satiny and pretty from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm.</li>
            <li> Does not diminish pores as I expected, but nice feeling of smoothness and some coverage beneath foundation.</li>
            <li> I first tried a sample from People magazine, and went straight out to buy it.</li>
            <li> It also makes your dry patches noticeable, so make sure you exfoliate your face well.</li>
            <li> It certainly does the trick and makes my face feel like it used to.  </li>
            <li> I have oily, aging, acneic skin with large pores.</li>
            <li> I got the large tube from Amazon</li>
            <li> I have large pores in my T-zone.</li>
            <li> Ok...so..I&#x27;m writting my reviews...got to this product and immediately ran into the bathroom to put this on half my face to try and show you how amazing this product really is...</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, so I make sure to exfoliate my face before applying makeup and keep myself very moisturized before putting this stuff on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy and really cuts out a lot of effort in my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the price, but I went ahead and paid it because I did see it more expensive in CVS.</li>
            <li> Had I not broken out, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like wearing make up ...and with this stuff you can just put it on after your mosturizer and go...</li>
            <li> But haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference with the &amp;#34;blur effect&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and disappears instantly.</li>
            <li> This does work very well however there is a cheaper option that works just as well.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product.</li>
            <li> It really does feel like silk across the skin and it made my foundation feel smoother too.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it quite as much as I anticipated,</li>
            <li> At the very end of the day, I did notice that I started to look shiny around my T-zone.</li>
            <li> I will be re-purchasing this product again in the full size and save it for days when I want to look extra pretty.</li>
            <li> Somehow, it manages to cling right on to your skin and feels really soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;blurs&amp;#34; and they work ok but nothing to write home about.  </li>
            <li> She said that it helped control the shine on her face much better than other products.</li>
            <li> I like it much better than the other primers I&#x27;ve tried under my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It seriously evens out even good skin.</li>
            <li> left my skin super greasy/oily.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am 25, so the only &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; I have are tiny laugh lines, but I have big pores on my nose and upper cheek area, and this really honestly does look like you took the blur filter on Instagram straight to your face.</li>
            <li> you look a little more refreshed....</li>
            <li> I got a free sample in a magazine and was curious to try it out.</li>
            <li> But, for her, she has to brush on an additional layer of setting powder over the 5-second blur and that is enough in combination to keep her looking fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I was impressed at how much less obvious my fine lines and pores were after swiping some of this weird light pink stuff on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This not only made my face look smoother, it felt super soft like I had a spa treatment.</li>
            <li> the picture I only put it on the right side of my face...</li>
            <li> It may seem pricey, but compared to other primers it is relatively cheap.</li>
            <li> New product</li>
            <li> It does come out of the tube like no other cream or ointment I&#x27;ve used, but it glides on and spreads very evenly.  </li>
            <li> My sister, who has really oily skin, has major problems with shine.</li>
            <li> I would only use this as a base for very light makeup, also feels great alone with no makeup.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> When you first squeeze it out of the tube, it is opaque white and has this crumbly texture.</li>
            <li> I get the exact same results.  </li>
            <li> Garnier isn&#x27;t cheap, but it&#x27;s not super pricey and you get a LOT of product.  </li>
            <li> Not only could I not tell a difference in my skin but pretty much all of my makeup had smudged off within the next hour.</li>
            <li> I youtubed a review that said it instantly makes large pores disappear.  </li>
            <li> my face looks so clear without putting any cover up i look airbrushed ..happy with this</li>
            <li> also have 2 of the ELF primers (clear + purple) - for</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m now sensitive to dimethicone (silicone) products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 38 years old and have bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> (I am in my early 50s).  </li>
            <li> but when I use it my skin feels soft as silk.</li>
            <li> He told me wow</li>
            <li> And my skin feels butter soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, like another reviewer said it feels very waxy which is a gross feeling on the face.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes my face more oily than it already was, and my skin just feels heavy, like</li>
            <li> have tried a few other similar products and they worked good too.</li>
            <li> Smooth as silk, a little goes a long way, and creates a wonderful, smooth, silky base upon which to put other things.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same &amp;#34;color/shade&amp;#34;, but it offers the exact same effect in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Hard to describe, but it&#x27;s very cool.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Prime Time by Bare Escentuals or Smashbox, but I saw someone on reddit trying out all the cheaper ones, so I gave this one a shot because I could see what a huge difference it made on the girl&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Holy cow - this stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> But the Garnier 5 Second Blur creates a lovely base for all this, and my skin has never looked smoother or better.  </li>
            <li> It does make my skin SLIGHTLY softer, but much more pale.</li>
            <li> BUT I only gave it 2 stars because I developed a couple of zits after using the Blue all day (morning till evening).</li>
            <li> This product really does make them less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It sounds strange but it contains the same ingredients as this and Smashbox for only $5.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes your pores look larger, and seems to bring out minor wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is pretty thick</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last for very long, unlike the competitor.  </li>
            <li> It does make wrinkles less noticeable, but it also leaves your skin extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use on a babies delicate skin👍</li>
            <li> I seriously doubted the quality of this stuff when I first touched it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also heard from other reviewers that this makes a great makeup base or primer.</li>
            <li> I think as long as you&#x27;re not expecting a miracle...</li>
            <li> Under and over liquid foundations: If you have any dry patches, this will make those dry spots visible (under and over foundation alike).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want it to highlight any of my dry patches.</li>
            <li> Lately though, it makes my face appear paler than normal</li>
            <li> Overall take home message, not worth it.</li>
            <li> Previously I was using and liking L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Miracle Blur, but that stuff is thick as can be, time consuming to smooth out and apply, and hard to get out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> and you only need a little amount.</li>
            <li> But if you are desperate to try something cheap to blur out your pores, I&#x27;d say go for it, and hopefully it works out for you.</li>
            <li> Tube lasts a long time as you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> It LOOKS like I didn&#x27;t apply any product at all, and it FEELS like all the product I DID apply is moving and slipping all over my face.</li>
            <li> I never really noticed a difference with primer before I tried this one.</li>
            <li> Similar, too, to the L&#x27;Oreal Magic Perfecting Base.  </li>
            <li> Due to the silky smooth consistency of the cream (not too thick, not too thin), it will obviously last a lot longer than the Miracle Blur, a lot of which got wasted because I could never get it out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> Basically it is just a primer similar to Smashbox but less than half the price.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Another bonus is a little bit of the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The only other pore reducing product I have used in the past was from Clinique, which was sort of chalky and needed to be blended a lot.</li>
            <li> However, I am not sure that results last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> found this through a youtube video by Hot and Flashy</li>
            <li> But it makes your face extremely oily and greasy after 30 mins.</li>
            <li> And while I do love Garnier products, I was disappointed with how this product clumps a bit --- almost leaving skid marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different primers over the past couple of years</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Walgreens for $16.99, minus my $2 coupon from People magazine, and less another $2 in reward</li>
            <li> and as I&#x27;ve aged a few spots here and there that (to me) jump off my skin and say &amp;#34;hi&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Also the tube is half air</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this in the mail and tried on half of my face to see if I could tell any difference.</li>
            <li> I think you can tell it&#x27;s smoother and less blotchy...</li>
            <li> Half of this bottle is air.</li>
            <li> But after 30mins or less, the product would be gone.</li>
            <li> I still can see my pores but they are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> My mother introduced this product to me and at first I thought she was crazy.</li>
            <li> Use just a little</li>
            <li> just a little help...</li>
            <li> If applying foundation it can look a little &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; and runny...</li>
            <li> And it does slip around a little as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does blur out your imperfections just a little.</li>
            <li> (Perhaps that person used it a little too liberally.)  </li>
            <li> I use it around my mouth and lower cheeks, a little on my forehead, and some on my neck.  </li>
            <li> and I have a few lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I got my people magazine sample late due to a postal handling issue.  </li>
            <li> Use a small amount at the end of your make -up routine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear anything but moisturizer</li>
            <li> , I do not love it.</li>
            <li> If you wear eyeliner on the bottom of your eye, this product does make your eyeliner smudge or run (at least on my eyeliner it did that).</li>
            <li> Another poster complained that this was waxy.  </li>
            <li> Research &amp;#34;Monistat anti-chafing gel as a primer&amp;#34; and see what I mean.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> so I may look a little crazy in the picture...</li>
            <li> This product dried my face out and highlighted my wrinkles :(</li>
            <li> sorry...</li>
            <li> I was not impressed by this product.</li>
            <li> You cannot see any pores or lines or faint acne scars.</li>
            <li> I hate when you buy something and don&#x27;t get what you expect...</li>
            <li> It made my makeup look awful</li>
            <li> It was horrible, haha.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was just a terrible consistency, and wasteful.  </li>
            <li> It feels almost greasy on the skin and my makeup smudged terribly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got a free sample of this, so I tried it out, and...Wow. It is GREAT. I am 25, so the only &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; I have are tiny laugh lines, but I have big pores on my nose and upper cheek area, and this really honestly does look like you took the blur filter on Instagram straight to your face. The only other pore reducing product I have used in the past was from Clinique, which was sort of chalky and needed to be blended a lot. I like the Garnier version much, much better. It even looked great underneath makeup, and made me look completely flawless. I will be re-purchasing this product again in the full size and save it for days when I want to look extra pretty.</li>
            <li> I bought this because a YouTuber recommend it. In my experience, both times that I tried it, it clogged my pores and caused me to break out. I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> Instantly provides a &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; look.  I could see an immedieate difference in my pores and FINE lines. However, I am not sure that results last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I bought this in a store, but wanted to review it as it is a great product! I love how smooth and silky it makes my skin feel. Definitely takes away the oily look on my forehead as well. I admit I feel like I have to use a bit more than the dime size it recommends,  but the end result is worth going through it a bit quicker :)</li>
            <li> Wont go without this.  I mix it with my crème tint foundation. Blurs wrinkles and pores. They aren&#x27;t 100% gone but they are much better and I am totally okay with that. Skin feels good after putting this on. Can use this alone or with foundation. Win Win :-)</li>
            <li> Holy cow - this stuff really works!  I use it on a clean face, squirt on fingertips and kind of mush it until it warms and softens then press it into my cheeks near my nose.  You can&#x27;t see it, it kind of melts into your pores, but doesn&#x27;t fill or clog them like spackle. Hard to describe, but it&#x27;s very cool.  Almost every product I try makes me break out, but after three weeks of using this - not one breakout and I&#x27;m shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this through a youtube video by Hot and Flashy - I was looking for makeup and skin care for 50+.</li>
            <li> This is a superior product than the other Blurs on the market.  It certainly does the trick and makes my face feel like it used to.  I use it every day  religiously and love the way my skin feels after applying.  Great product - does what it promises.</li>
            <li> I have oily, aging, acneic skin with large pores. The product does what it promises to do BUT I only gave it 2 stars because I developed a couple of zits after using the Blue all day (morning till evening). Had I not broken out, I would have given it 5 stars. I think I&#x27;m now sensitive to dimethicone (silicone) products.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast. Packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> It works just as promised and makes my skin smooth like silk! One of the best makeup buys I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> You want beautiful flawless skin...This is it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Use just a little and it gives really nice blurring. It can be used AFTER you&#x27;ve put on make up if you forget, which is a big bonus. Works as well as Loreal&#x27;s Miracle Blur in my opinion at about 60% of the price.</li>
            <li> love this !  my face looks so clear without putting any cover up i look airbrushed ..happy with this</li>
            <li> I put this on after my moisturizer and applied makeup. Not only could I not tell a difference in my skin but pretty much all of my makeup had smudged off within the next hour. Also the tube is half air so it looks like you are getting a lot of product but you aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this in the mail and tried on half of my face to see if I could tell any difference. The difference was noticeable to me, so I have been buying the stuff.</li>
            <li> Ok...so..I&#x27;m writting my reviews...got to this product and immediately ran into the bathroom to put this on half my face to try and show you how amazing this product really is...so I may look a little crazy in the picture...sorry...wasn&#x27;t prepared for a photo shoot this morning...it was literally just my honest reaction...I hate when you buy something and don&#x27;t get what you expect...I originally bought a little sample of this from the drug store and when I realized how great it is I got the large tube from Amazon...I don&#x27;t really like wearing make up ...and with this stuff you can just put it on after your mosturizer and go...it just gives your face a smoother more even look to it...you look a little more refreshed....I think as long as you&#x27;re not expecting a miracle...just a little help...you will love this product too...&lt;br /&gt;In the picture I only put it on the right side of my face...hopefully you are able to see the difference in the picture...I think you can tell it&#x27;s smoother and less blotchy...</li>
            <li> I use it as a moisturizer, it feels really good on the skin. A little bit goes a long way. But haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference with the &amp;#34;blur effect&amp;#34;. Powder and concealer apply very nicely over this. If applying foundation it can look a little &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; and runny...I would only use this as a base for very light makeup, also feels great alone with no makeup.</li>
            <li> Great product. I can see it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product quite some time now. The beat I have tried.</li>
            <li> I am 38 years old and have bags under my eyes.  My mother introduced this product to me and at first I thought she was crazy. Well, I was wrong ( probably the only time :) )  The product is smooth to apply. It immediately takes away all shine to the area applied, it fills the tiny cracks and lines.  Makeup, sunscreen, et can be applied right over the top and will not affect the use of the product.  It is now a daily item in my regimine - until I can afford eye surgery to remove the bags.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and use it every time I put on makeup.  It makes a big difference in shrinking my pores</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and disappears instantly. Leaves skin feeling like satin. Absorbs oil for hours. Tube lasts a long time as you only need a small amount. Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It may seem pricey, but compared to other primers it is relatively cheap. I am a fan of Mally primer from QVC and this is a cheaper but equally effective alternative</li>
            <li> left my skin super greasy/oily. won&#x27;t be using it anymore.</li>
            <li> I used to love this stuff and would have given it five stars, because it made my face matte and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about looking oily.  Lately though, it makes my face appear paler than normal so I can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I, too, bought this at CVS for a lower price - but if it becomes price effective through Amazon, I would re-order from here. I first tried a sample from People magazine, and went straight out to buy it. This not only made my face look smoother, it felt super soft like I had a spa treatment. If you&#x27;re 35+, this is worth a try!</li>
            <li> Half of this bottle is air. I bought this because of a sample I recieved in the mail awhile back, but it seemed as though the sample lasted longer!!</li>
            <li> Basically it is just a primer similar to Smashbox but less than half the price.  I received a sample in a magazine and as soon I as put it on it smelled just like all make-up primers that contain dimethicone.  This does work very well however there is a cheaper option that works just as well.  Research &amp;#34;Monistat anti-chafing gel as a primer&amp;#34; and see what I mean.  It sounds strange but it contains the same ingredients as this and Smashbox for only $5.</li>
            <li> I got my people magazine sample late due to a postal handling issue.  Just tried the sample and Love Love Love it.  (I am in my early 50s).  The product does Blur as described and feels wonderful.  Not greasy at all. I would describe it as silky (not butter).  Take a look at this youtube product review video.  [...]</li>
            <li> It is a good smother, just not terrific  Easy to apply in the morning and fresh scent also.  Just not the best I have tried.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this stuff, but then I realized it was causing my makeup to break-up.  It is pretty thick but I didn&#x27;t see that it blurred any imperfections or pores.  It made my makeup look awful the more I used it.</li>
            <li> Great product for smoothing out your skin. Makeup goes on evenly after applying.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product. It does make wrinkles less noticeable, but it also leaves your skin extremely soft. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I give this product a solid 5 stars. It really does feel like silk across the skin and it made my foundation feel smoother too. If you wear eyeliner on the bottom of your eye, this product does make your eyeliner smudge or run (at least on my eyeliner it did that). Another bonus is a little bit of the product goes a long way. Overall, I am glad I tried this product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have a very oily face with huge pores. I bought this to minimize the look of those gigantic holes. Lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- When I first applied this, it does give me a blurring effect, which is very impressive. But after 30mins or less, the product would be gone. It LOOKS like I didn&#x27;t apply any product at all, and it FEELS like all the product I DID apply is moving and slipping all over my face. It definitely makes my face more oily than it already was, and my skin just feels heavy, like I know I had put something on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Under and over liquid foundations: If you have any dry patches, this will make those dry spots visible (under and over foundation alike). I like it better under my foundation, and the reason is because when I put it on TOP of my foundation, it feels super slippery, my dry spots would show, and it made my foundation SLIP/RUB OFF my face while I gently apply it on my t-zone. It was horrible, haha.&lt;br /&gt;Under the foundation doesn&#x27;t really do that, although it&#x27;s not that great either. When I apply it on my face, it will also make my dry patches visible, so it does not make my face a nice smooth surface to apply my foundation on. It does somewhat minimize the look of my pores, but that comes with an even more oily face after 30 or so minutes of application.. And it does slip around a little as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - It does minimize the look of pores. It does blur out your imperfections just a little. But it makes your face extremely oily and greasy after 30 mins. It also makes your dry patches noticeable, so make sure you exfoliate your face well. It feels uncomfortable/heavy on the skin, and it slips around the face. Do I think this is a good buy? Eh. I think it&#x27;s way too overpriced for what it does. But if you are desperate to try something cheap to blur out your pores, I&#x27;d say go for it, and hopefully it works out for you. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;blurs&amp;#34; and they work ok but nothing to write home about.  I got a sample of this one in a woman&#x27;s magazine and I could tell a difference immediately.  I have very fair skin and as I&#x27;ve aged a few spots here and there that (to me) jump off my skin and say &amp;#34;hi&amp;#34;.  This stuff covers them up just a bit and blends an even skin tone as well as smoothing.  I apply it after sunscreen and so far they go together great.  I&#x27;m quite impressed with this and I&#x27;d definitely consider giving it a try.</li>
            <li> The concept is great but this one isn&#x27;t quite there yet. And while I do love Garnier products, I was disappointed with how this product clumps a bit --- almost leaving skid marks.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last for very long, unlike the competitor.  I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Unlike the picture in the magazine ad, that made me buy this product, I don&#x27;t see any visible affects after using this product.  You also are suppose to put it on after your daily moisturizer so it doesn&#x27;t fill that role.  So far I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Previously I was using and liking L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Miracle Blur, but that stuff is thick as can be, time consuming to smooth out and apply, and hard to get out of the tube.  Garnier&#x27;s 5 second blur is a gazillion times nicer.  Smooth as silk, a little goes a long way, and creates a wonderful, smooth, silky base upon which to put other things.  No irritation ever and I use it every day.  After putting this on, I use Garnier&#x27;s BB cream, which as it turned out, I liked way better than any of the others I tried.  For an evening out, I might use actual makeup instead of the BB cream. On top I use Bare Minerals Mineral Veil, then blush.  But the Garnier 5 Second Blur creates a lovely base for all this, and my skin has never looked smoother or better.  Due to the silky smooth consistency of the cream (not too thick, not too thin), it will obviously last a lot longer than the Miracle Blur, a lot of which got wasted because I could never get it out of the tube.  It was just a terrible consistency, and wasteful.  Price wise, I&#x27;ve seen much lower than the A. price as it is right now.  New product so it&#x27;s more $$, but there are specials in the drugstores.</li>
            <li> I saw this item on the TV show The Doctors, so I had to try it myself. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the price, but I went ahead and paid it because I did see it more expensive in CVS. This product doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me. It was supposed to blur my skin and reduce the appearance of blemishes and such. It does make my skin SLIGHTLY softer, but much more pale. It also makes my eyes burn and water, so keep it away from your eyes. Overall take home message, not worth it. You will have high hopes I know, but I&#x27;m sure whatever primer you are using at home is much better than this.</li>
            <li> Another poster complained that this was waxy.  I don&#x27;t find the consistency objectionable at all.  (Perhaps that person used it a little too liberally.)  It does come out of the tube like no other cream or ointment I&#x27;ve used, but it glides on and spreads very evenly.  I use it around my mouth and lower cheeks, a little on my forehead, and some on my neck.  I&#x27;m fair skinned and approaching 70 years old, so I appreciate all the help I can get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really effective - minimizes the look of pores and give a beautiful matte finish.  Be sure to put this on AFTER your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Now that I have found this product I will not be without it. I have used many of the higher end brands and none work as well. My face feels so smooth and my pores and lines are dramatically reduced. I have recommended to my friends and family!</li>
            <li> I was not impressed by this product. It feels almost greasy on the skin and my makeup smudged terribly. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you wear tinted moisturizer or foundation daily.</li>
            <li> Smooth and help under make up make skin like baby and ready for make up.</li>
            <li> The Garnier Blur makes fine lines disappear.  Need I say more.</li>
            <li> Wow! I never really noticed a difference with primer before I tried this one. I usually use Prime Time by Bare Escentuals or Smashbox, but I saw someone on reddit trying out all the cheaper ones, so I gave this one a shot because I could see what a huge difference it made on the girl&#x27;s skin. I&#x27;m amazed that this is so inexpensive for the quality, and I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Looks and feels good but made mascara smudge.</li>
            <li> I think this is one of if not the best product has put out. I have no idea what it&#x27;s for but when I use it my skin feels soft as silk. Absorbs into the skin. Gentle enough to use on a babies delicate skin👍</li>
            <li> I have really huge pores and this product covers them really well. I am on auto ship with this product so I will be repurchasing this again and again.</li>
            <li> Actually works! I have large pores in my T-zone. This product really does make them less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few other similar products and they worked good too. But for the price this one seems to be the&lt;br /&gt;best value.</li>
            <li> This is of course a temporary fix . Use a small amount at the end of your make -up routine. I only use it where lines are prominent.such as chin, nose and forehead. Age 67 years.</li>
            <li> Good product. After application leaves my skin smooth and clear. I don&#x27;t use it quite as much as I anticipated,</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, makes your skin feel like silk.  A great way to add powder makeup without it looking splotchy</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. I got a sample from a magazine and had to go out and buy it. What made me take the time to write a review was my husband&#x27;s comment to me. We were having a dinner party that evening and he asked if I had already put my makeup on? No I didn&#x27;t but I did moisturize and just put on my 5 second blur. He told me wow your skin looks beautiful. SOLD! I will never not use this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly good, even skin with little discoloration. I use this daily over my &lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Physicians-Formula-Healthy-Moisturizer-Natural/dp/B003FXG2OC/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1419292361&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;physicians+formula+tinted+moisturizer\\&quot;&gt;Physician&#x27;s Formula tinted moisturizer&lt;/a&gt; for a great all-day look. I believe that this product works by diffracting light that hits your skin. This diffraction &amp;#34;blurs&amp;#34; the skin like a Photoshop blur tool might. It seriously evens out even good skin. You cannot see any pores or lines or faint acne scars. It&#x27;s amazing for people of any age. My youngest sister all the way to my mother use this and it looks great on everyone. The finish is not quite matte, but not shiny or dewy. It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;satin&amp;#34; sort of finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a sample from CVS one weekend and decided to give it a chance. When you first squeeze it out of the tube, it is opaque white and has this crumbly texture. I seriously doubted the quality of this stuff when I first touched it. It seemed like it would crumble right off my face! But I rubbed it on anyway. Don&#x27;t worry, it totally sticks! Just keep massaging it in and the crumbly bits will &amp;#34;soften&amp;#34; and smear on easily. Somehow, it manages to cling right on to your skin and feels really soft and silky. Over the course of the day, it didn&#x27;t rub off at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I have dry skin, so I make sure to exfoliate my face before applying makeup and keep myself very moisturized before putting this stuff on. I don&#x27;t want it to highlight any of my dry patches. It keeps my face satiny and pretty from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. At the very end of the day, I did notice that I started to look shiny around my T-zone. My sister, who has really oily skin, has major problems with shine. She said that it helped control the shine on her face much better than other products. But, for her, she has to brush on an additional layer of setting powder over the 5-second blur and that is enough in combination to keep her looking fresh all day. I&#x27;ve yet to try this setting powder trick myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also heard from other reviewers that this makes a great makeup base or primer. I&#x27;ve never used it in this capacity, but I&#x27;m confident it would work. Overall, an excellent makeup product. I like it much better than the other primers I&#x27;ve tried under my moisturizer. It&#x27;s so easy and really cuts out a lot of effort in my daily routine. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Yes, it blurs. But my face felt and looked like I was a Madame Tussaud wax figure. I don&#x27;t usually wear anything but moisturizer so maybe that&#x27;s why.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a store (at a lower price), but I wanted to review it because this stuff is amazing! I&#x27;m 48, and I&#x27;ve tried many creams, lotions, serums - you name it. I&#x27;ve never had any kind of &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; reaction to any of them before this stuff. It feels different from anything else I&#x27;ve tried. It really does smooth my skin. And my skin feels butter soft.</li>
            <li> Makes skin silky but tends to look flakey by end of day</li>
            <li> great product , smooth&#x27;s skin and minimizes pores</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Walgreens for $16.99, minus my $2 coupon from People magazine, and less another $2 in reward points,....well worth it for $12.99 (plus tax), but even worth it at Amazon&#x27;s price. This is the perfect lotion for women with fine lines and such. It&#x27;s not a cover-up, more of a skin smoother. I apply it after my lotion with spf and before my makeup. Love it! Makes the skin feel like butter, totally incredible feeling.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the face and smooths wrinkles. Easy to apply and you only need a little amount. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Wegmans for a lower price, around 15.00$ It&#x27;s worth every penny! I just turned 40 and I have a few lines on my forehead. I was actually thinking of getting bangs to cover them up. This product fills them in so well that I will not be getting bangs. My lines are barely visable now and it feels so good on my skin. It even works well with foundation over it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  So smooth.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample in a magazine and was curious to try it out. Well, it does do a great job at smoothing and blurring - I was impressed at how much less obvious my fine lines and pores were after swiping some of this weird light pink stuff on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, like another reviewer said it feels very waxy which is a gross feeling on the face. In addition, after trying to apply this after putting on moisturizer, it sloughed itself and/or the moisturizer off which was also kind of gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the blurring effect, but would only get this on sale and wouldn&#x27;t wear it every day.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Does a great job of smoothing out my skin and absorbing oil throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different primers over the past couple of years and I&#x27;d say this is my favorite.  A better value than Porefessional, yet I get the exact same results.  Similar, too, to the L&#x27;Oreal Magic Perfecting Base.  All 3 are good, so then it comes down to value because I see no difference at all in what they do as a primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, this is a dup of The POREfessional.  It&#x27;s not the same &amp;#34;color/shade&amp;#34;, but it offers the exact same effect in my opinion.  I see no reason to pay a HUGE amt of $$ for POREfessional.  Garnier isn&#x27;t cheap, but it&#x27;s not super pricey and you get a LOT of product.  It&#x27;s a bit thicker than Pore...  And it helps prevent t-zone shine.  It doesn&#x27;t stop the shine all day (not for me anyway) but it&#x27;s hugely helpful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have 2 of the ELF primers (clear + purple) - for the $$ those are just fine.</li>
            <li> This product dried my face out and highlighted my wrinkles :(</li>
            <li> I wrote this review for Pore Vanisher but felt I need to write one here as well as I do use the two products together. I started to use Pore Vanisher and 5 Second Blur and they make difference in my pore size. I still can see my pores but they are much less noticeable. The lotion is very smooth and it makes my face feel very soft.  Overall I like it, I do not love it. I used to use Pore Minimizer by Mariqe (www.mariqe.com) but they are out of stock so that&#x27;s the reason I went to these two products as together they deliver what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> Love the blur with this skin conditioner.  I actually does soften imperfections and also makes foundation application smooth and easy.  Does what it says and the price is great on Subscribe and Save.  Will keep it on my list.</li>
            <li> slippery! foundation slides all over the place.</li>
            <li> Not Amazon&#x27;s fault but my own.  I youtubed a review that said it instantly makes large pores disappear.  It doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is the only product of Garnier ,that I do not like.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your pores look larger, and seems to bring out minor wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I do not like it , but love Garnier Ultra-Lift night creme, and the day cremes !!</li>
            <li> Does not diminish pores as I expected, but nice feeling of smoothness and some coverage beneath foundation.</li>
