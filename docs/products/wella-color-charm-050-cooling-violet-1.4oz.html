    <ol>
            <li>I use a couple of capfuls added to my toner and its perfect.</li>
            <li>The highlights are a beautiful ashy shimmery color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is great and never in stock at Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It feels good to be done with the brassiness.</li>
            <li>:) Hope my advice works for you, and good luck!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now, on my highlights with great success.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this color.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m okay.</li>
            <li>Wear coconut oil for 2 days then bleach more.</li>
            <li>PERFECT shade of blonde results, no brassiness!</li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>and i use this product to tone more and give it a gray tint.</li>
            <li>it did the job, for the most part, but it wasnt what i wanted.</li>
            <li>The product works great but people must make sure the hair is not yellow before applying otherwise</li>
            <li>it says light drabber</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a fantastic product for virgin hair</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t turn \\&quot;black\\&quot; while developing but did turn a light shade of purple.</li>
            <li>There was no blue tint on my hair afterwards, just a great ash color and</li>
            <li>Great product to reduce the red!</li>
            <li>The drabber is good for drabbing out red tones in tints also,but use sparingly.</li>
            <li>I rinse my hair in the sink and use a mild shampoo.  </li>
            <li>At first I was ecstatic at the cool ashy color I obtained after this process.</li>
            <li>a nice ash blonde color.</li>
            <li>The highlights are very nice, not brassy, not blue, not green...</li>
            <li>I didnt recieve the right product.</li>
            <li>The first time I rinsed it out to soon.</li>
            <li>Going silver this is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>This time I bought a more violet/grey toner and did a spot test on my scalp earlier</li>
            <li>Still I&#x27;d love to know why this Wella product essentially washed out.</li>
            <li>at first it comes out a periwinkle color, but two good shampooings later ive got a nice rich gray that i have only found one other product to produce a similar permanent/ semi permanant result in my hair, which has been gray for a year and three months</li>
            <li>It fades fast though with every washing.</li>
            <li>This really does work.</li>
            <li>and it seemed to really work getting</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now ordered the Wella White Lady toner to see if its more purple color (as opposed to the blue in this one) will cancel out the yellow better and longer.</li>
            <li>(When I do my roots next time, I will not be leaving the product on roots-only longer than that original 35 mins).</li>
            <li>The dye will look almost black, but it washes out very light.</li>
            <li>Amazon picture is of an older product and misleading.</li>
            <li>So I added two capsful to the L&#x27;Oreal extra light blonde tint/developer I buy at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>Actually, they both were, but the one I was referring to was stating that the product makes your hair blue, and it does(I tested a strand before dying my full head).</li>
            <li>While hair is still damp (I towel dry as much as possible), I apply this Wella Color Charm 050 Light Drabber, along with my 10% volume developer from Satin, to all of the hair, avoiding the roots.  </li>
            <li>My natural hair color came out silver.</li>
            <li>If your hair is turning blue your are using too much product.</li>
            <li>First, I want to say one of the previous reviews was VERY helpful.</li>
            <li>I applied to the roots first, left it on about 35 mins and then combed it through to the ends and left that on for another 20 mins.</li>
            <li>The end product is this very ethereal stormy grey blue color!</li>
            <li>I got very nervous as the product appeared very dark</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My hair has red lights that do not go with my complextion. I have used this product for years to tone down the red sucessfully. I use one part 20 vol developer and one part water to two parts of the drabber.</li>
            <li> I am a silver blonde.I use silver lady,but I want it a little smokier. I use a couple of capfuls added to my toner and its perfect. The drabber is good for drabbing out red tones in tints also,but use sparingly.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional and I did not follow the instructions. I used this 1:2 parts 10 volume developer for 30 min on my nearly white bleached hair. I got very nervous as the product appeared very dark ( I ignored it this time). The first time I rinsed it out to soon. The end product is this very ethereal stormy grey blue color! It looks just like storm clouds. I am in love with this color. I will update this in a couple weeks to let you know how it works out.</li>
            <li> Going silver this is exactly what I needed. My only complaint is it fades too fast. I need to touch up every two weeks but luckily it&#x27;s not super expensive so I&#x27;m okay. This is great and never in stock at Sally&#x27;s so having it delivered to my door for about the same price is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I did. Bleach the crap out of my hair. Wear coconut oil for 2 days then bleach more. Tone with a platinum then 2 weeks later bleach again. Get hair cut. Tone with manic panic virgin snow and then do 1 bottle of wella 050 with 2 bottles (I just refilled the wella bottle as its a 1:2 ratio) of 20 developer. Leave on for 20-30 minutes and rinse with cold water. I use purple shampoo and conditioner and use fanciful roux white minx to maintain. It fades fast though with every washing.</li>
            <li> I use half a bottle of this with Nordic Blonde Color and my cream lightener. PERFECT shade of blonde results, no brassiness!</li>
            <li> it says light drabber but they don&#x27;t tell you it has a blue acsent? yes it turn your hair a tint of blue.</li>
            <li> Just as described, works well on lightened hair. My hair is gray now!</li>
            <li> First, I want to say one of the previous reviews was VERY helpful. Actually, they both were, but the one I was referring to was stating that the product makes your hair blue, and it does(I tested a strand before dying my full head). What I did was mix one part this silver hair color, with one part 1001 Satin Blonde Wella Haircolor Gel, then 3 and 1/2 parts color developer. My natural hair color came out silver. The dye will look almost black, but it washes out very light. So don&#x27;t panic like I did :)    I will say though, it doesn&#x27;t work well on bleached hair. My lower tips are bleached, and the color didnt take to them at all. I will need to grow my hair out and try again later. But it&#x27;s a fantastic product for virgin hair and I&#x27;m going to buy it again. :) Hope my advice works for you, and good luck!</li>
            <li> Amazon picture is of an older product and misleading. The current one is only an additive to be used with other colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long had a problem with boxed hair coloring turning a brassy color and didn&#x27;t know what to do until discovering this product. This really does work. My hair will turn brassy with the ash blonde color I&#x27;ve been using. I mixed in a little of this to my normal product the next time I was doing my roots. Lo and behold, I&#x27;ve got the ash blonde hair I&#x27;ve been wanting. I used 1 part color, 1/2 part drabber and 3 parts developer- this worked for me. I applied to the roots first, left it on about 35 mins and then combed it through to the ends and left that on for another 20 mins. (When I do my roots next time, I will not be leaving the product on roots-only longer than that original 35 mins). It didn&#x27;t turn \\&quot;black\\&quot; while developing but did turn a light shade of purple. There was no blue tint on my hair afterwards, just a great ash color and the color is even throughout. It feels good to be done with the brassiness.</li>
            <li> I have used the product longer than I remember. I use two capfulls of this product in my blonde hair color. This stops the brazzy color. My hair has never turned blue. If your hair is turning blue your are using too much product.</li>
            <li> Great product to reduce the red!</li>
            <li> Uhh ya it sort of mellowed out the brassy tones in my brown hair, but it&#x27;s still brassy. Maybe it&#x27;s not meant for brunettes, but then again if you know you&#x27;re &amp;#34;color wheel&amp;#34; it should have worked. This time I bought a more violet/grey toner and did a spot test on my scalp earlier and it seemed to really work getting that ash brown I wanted. Not sure what number was on the box but it was the same Wella Color Charm stuff.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. The product works great but people must make sure the hair is not yellow before applying otherwise it turns green. Also leaves hair very dry.</li>
            <li> my hair is bleached and toned and i use this product to tone more and give it a gray tint. at first it comes out a periwinkle color, but two good shampooings later ive got a nice rich gray that i have only found one other product to produce a similar permanent/ semi permanant result in my hair, which has been gray for a year and three months</li>
            <li> I didnt recieve the right product. I got the additive, not the actually color. it did the job, for the most part, but it wasnt what i wanted.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews here I had high hopes that this product would mean the end to brass in my dyed blonde hair. So I added two capsful to the L&#x27;Oreal extra light blonde tint/developer I buy at the drugstore. At first I was ecstatic at the cool ashy color I obtained after this process. But one week and two shampoos later the brass has started to reassert itself.  What a disappointment! I&#x27;ve now ordered the Wella White Lady toner to see if its more purple color (as opposed to the blue in this one) will cancel out the yellow better and longer. Still I&#x27;d love to know why this Wella product essentially washed out. I did wait 48 hours before an initial shampoo.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product here, for the record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now, on my highlights with great success.  The highlights are a beautiful ashy shimmery color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dark brown, almost black. I do highlights using a cap, powder bleach from Satin, 20% developer from Salon Care.  I leave the bleach on until the hair rises above the orangey phase, about 30 minutes after applying.  I rinse my hair in the sink and use a mild shampoo.  While hair is still damp (I towel dry as much as possible), I apply this Wella Color Charm 050 Light Drabber, along with my 10% volume developer from Satin, to all of the hair, avoiding the roots.  I leave it in for 30 mins.  I shower and condition well afterward.  The highlights are very nice, not brassy, not blue, not green...a nice ash blonde color.</li>
