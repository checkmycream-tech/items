            <li>I am now extremely happy n have been telling everyone they worked to be sure I was satisfied 100%.</li>
            <li>Lots of thanks to both Sunvalleytek and USpicy to make a great birthday gift for my sister!</li>
            <li>Save your money and do your own nails with this dryer.</li>

            <li>This works within a nice amount of time if you follow directions.</li>

            <li>Its easy to use and love that I can do my feet to!</li>

            <li>I am glad I&#x27;ve made the right decision, cuz after my sister opened it, it had everything inside as shown in the pictures - beautiful package, the branded nail dryer, four bulbs, nicely-done user manual, and even the free gift of sanding file.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review when I have more.</li>
            <li>I love this machine but just wish it had a fan.</li>
            <li>I think it was the best Xmas present.</li>
            <li>It works ok..</li>
            <li>cuz I knew she would definitely love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>would love to know where to get replacement bulbs.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it came with the UV protecting gloves.</li>
            <li>I love getting gel manicures at the salon, but each one was costing me about $30.</li>
            <li>you enjoy doing your own nails</li>
            <li>you will love this lamp.</li>
            <li>* Apply your favorite color of Gelish Soak Off Gel Polish or your favorite brand of UV</li>
            <li>Top It</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I better get it ASAP.</li>
            <li>and I am really satisfied.</li>
            <li>This upgraded version with removable tray works better than my kidney-shaped LED dryer.</li>
            <li>I love how roomy the hand tray is.</li>
            <li>I am able to place all 5 fingers in at one time, so it decrease my time for doing my gel nails.</li>
            <li>This lamp seems to be good quality, it&#x27;s nice (with the pink logo on it), and it works great.</li>
            <li>* Admire your beautiful and stunning new nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>to my surprise I was not dealing with the best customer service as expected.</li>
            <li>I wanted a good quality and not very expensive UV lamp</li>
            <li>So I emailed SunValleyTec to see if they can replace it easily, otherwise I&#x27;ll return it, and start researching another nail dryer.  </li>
            <li>I found a tote bag to pack it and polish items so will be easy for travel.</li>
            <li>We found that all the items you need are available on Amazon at good prices and fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>* Sliding tray for easy cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One hand looks way better (I am right handed):)</li>
            <li>It shipped extremely quickly as well!  </li>
            <li>The light seems to be quality made for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>I invested some money into getting the Shellac system and of course you  need an UV light.</li>
            <li>and she didn&#x27;t really mention that she liked the gel polish and the UV curing process.  </li>
            <li>* 36 watt UV GEL light curing system with four bulbs.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>* Place hand into the USpicy UV light for 2 minutes for a light color and 3 minutes for darker colors</li>
            <li>* Place your hand into the USpicy UV light for 3 minutes.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I purchased this item after researching what type of UV Light I would need to gel nails.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This was very economical.</li>
            <li>My mother is so excited awaiting a UV light</li>
            <li>process, once you know what to buy, is fast, easy and safe to do.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m excited about my purchase.</li>
            <li>and I hope it is useful to you!  </li>
            <li>Originally purchased a Salon brand lamp, got it and it never worked -- not even once.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ok with this at first thinking they will rush me a working product..</li>
            <li>* Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using cotton ball.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well made product, easy to assemble, would buy more products from this vendor and would recommend highly.</li>
            <li>Love my nail dryer, worked very well on my 1st</li>
            <li>Cool operation.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I wish it had an true on and off switch, I have to unplug it to turn it off if its not set on the timer modes, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good product and produced professional results even for us amateurs the first time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good product and produced professional results even for us amateurs the first time.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, works perfectly, very fast during application.</li>
            <li>I find this nail light easy to use - I just push the button on the back and it turns on for the appropriate amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you SunValleyTec for replacing the defective product so quickly and easily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t get it in time for the party, but I really couldn&#x27;t ask for a more useful and hassle-free response than that.  </li>
            <li>It has also saved me a lot of money and it was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>* Small attractive package that is compact and easy</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such an amazing product, USpicy!</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, and is large enough to fit one hand in comfortably.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very sturdy unit and has a nice pink design on the top.  </li>
            <li>Looking at a wide variety of lamps available, I thought this seemed to be a good quality at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Though I am extremely happy with this product, I did notice that the timers were not accurate.  </li>
            <li>it is big love that both hands fit and</li>
            <li>I was unsatisfied with my first order with no hesitation new better lights were sent out to me.</li>
            <li>Other than that, good purchase.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my personal use and liked very much.  </li>
            <li>This is a choice, right?  </li>
            <li>and it was the right decision.  </li>
            <li>You have to cure it a little longer than 30 seconds each round, but still comes out great :) lots of ample room for hands and feet. :)</li>
            <li>For this reason, I gave it only 4 stars -- it&#x27;s just less than perfect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a dryer this size for such a great, low price.</li>
            <li>This is a professional Uv lamp, I strongly recomend those persons who wanna have their nail made at home.</li>
            <li>Thank u very much.</li>
            <li>The LED light did not come on near the time switch.  </li>
            <li>I just did my nails for the first time.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a all night thing because everyone else wants them done too!</li>
            <li>There are many brands of lamps to choose from, at diferent prices, but I doubt that buying a more expensive one I would have gotten something better than this lamp.  </li>
            <li>This USpicy dryer is exactly what I needed to shave time off my appointments.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>The supplies that you buy will last and allow you to do our nails many times.  </li>
            <li>However, be sure you have enough room to store it.</li>
            <li>It fits great at my work station, and the fact that I can now dry both hands at once, and quickly, is such a time saver.</li>
            <li>* Fast, easy and professional quality of results.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I am able to change my nail color to suit my mood, patch up little chips that happen along the way, and I can even fit my toes in there.</li>
            <li>I left town shortly after the last update, so I can&#x27;t attest to the speed, but I did return to a brand new replacement dryer that happily works!  </li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I never need to dry for longer than the 3 minute timer, but I love that I have the option to set it for 2 minutes or 5 minutes as well.</li>
            <li>* Suitable for professional and personal use.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Actually, if I had to buy a new one for me, I would buy this one for sure.  </li>
            <li>My hopes were so high!  </li>
            <li>I just turned the timer on again to finish the cycle, and used the on-off switch to turn it off when I was ready.</li>
            <li>It really dries your nails in 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Received promptly and was set up ready to go.</li>
            <li>Really like the 2 and 3min timing feature.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that for sure, but since it would be a birthday gift, I spent several dollars more and went with this USpicy USND-3601 36W Professional Nail Dryer.</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>This product works really well for gel nails.</li>
            <li>&gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface of the nail using Gelish Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only are the bulbs securely in place, but there are two timers in addition to the on/off switch.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to shove my whole hand in that giant slot.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t quite agree with the fact that she is so into this hobby, but I simply couldn&#x27;t find any other good birthday gift for her,</li>
            <li>* Push back cuticle and clean fingernail.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One thing I really love is that you can put your entire hand in this one unlike some of the smaller cheaper units I&#x27;ve purchased you have to do your thumbs seperate, which can add up to a lot of additional time.  </li>
            <li>Really, I just love this little lamp!</li>
            <li>we really didn&#x27;t know all the steps to get professional results.  </li>
            <li>&gt;* Gently remove the natural nail</li>
            <li>so I can only use the Right side.</li>
            <li>Within an hour I received an email from SunValleyTec stating that they will ship me a new dryer within twelve hours, and that once I test it and confirm it&#x27;s working, they will give me instructions to return the defective one.  </li>
            <li>Some places want to receive your return before they ship a new one.  </li>
            <li>* Being new to doing this at home we purchased a Gelish Basix Kit.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does the whole hand, unlike some I looked at where you couldn&#x27;t get the thumb at the same time as other nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Chinese lamp for about 3 months and it has been ok, but I didn&#x27;t want to give her a chinese present.  </li>
            <li>Left side does not get hot</li>
            <li>I thought I might get a non-working cheap looking unbranded dryer in a white box with no bonus nail file.  </li>
            <li>Splurging on a bigger lamp when I have other, more pressing, business expenses just seemed excessive to me, and the little lamps did the job I needed them to do, albeit not as timely as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I purchased them very close in time, so it was easy to be confused.)</li>
            <li>This being said I have been shipped a new UV lamp after 20 attempts to call both Uspicy and Sunvalley and this second product just arrived today!</li>
            <li>I am a professional nail tech with a small business and have been using 9 watt lamps that only fit four fingers because the cost of a 54 watt two hand lamp, or even just a 36 watt one hand lamp, was out of my price range.</li>
            <li>I spent a little bit more money than with the chinese one, but I would do it again.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s collected numerous types of nail polish and changes her nail colors quitely frequently.</li>
            <li>and now you can get the same professional results as going to the Nail Salon</li>
            <li>For a fraction of the cost you can get the same professional results, save money and tell your friends that you did it yourself.  </li>
            <li>the unit is much sturdier and heavier and larger than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Used to have the one for only one hand at a time-this one makes it almost 50% fast than the other dryer.  </li>
            <li>This little lamp has saved me so much hassle.</li>

            <li> I bought this lamp so that I could do my own Gelish nails at home to save money.  </li>
            <li> I am now extremely happy n have been telling everyone they worked to be sure I was satisfied 100%.</li>
            <li> Lots of thanks to both Sunvalleytek and USpicy to make a great birthday gift for my sister!</li>
            <li> Save your money and do your own nails with this dryer.</li>
            <li> Have been doing my own nails and</li>
            <li> This works within a nice amount of time if you follow directions.</li>
            <li> It is so nice to do my own nails and not have to pay a fortune to have them done.</li>
            <li> The machine is attractive and shiny and smooth, and the USpicy flower logo looks nice on the top.  </li>
            <li> As far as she&#x27;s happy, I am also happy.   </li>
            <li> it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use and love that I can do my feet to!</li>
            <li> It works great and cures nails fast!  </li>
            <li> I am glad I&#x27;ve made the right decision, cuz after my sister opened it, it had everything inside as shown in the pictures - beautiful package, the branded nail dryer, four bulbs, nicely-done user manual, and even the free gift of sanding file.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review when I have more.</li>
            <li> I love this machine but just wish it had a fan.</li>
            <li> I think it was the best Xmas present.</li>
            <li> It works ok..</li>
            <li> cuz I knew she would definitely love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> would love to know where to get replacement bulbs.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> and I love that it came with the UV protecting gloves.</li>
            <li> I love getting gel manicures at the salon, but each one was costing me about $30.</li>
            <li> you enjoy doing your own nails</li>
            <li> you will love this lamp.</li>
            <li> * Apply your favorite color of Gelish Soak Off Gel Polish or your favorite brand of UV</li>
            <li> Top It</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I better get it ASAP.</li>
            <li> and I am really satisfied.</li>
            <li> This upgraded version with removable tray works better than my kidney-shaped LED dryer.</li>
            <li> I love how roomy the hand tray is.</li>
            <li> I am able to place all 5 fingers in at one time, so it decrease my time for doing my gel nails.</li>
            <li> This lamp seems to be good quality, it&#x27;s nice (with the pink logo on it), and it works great.</li>
            <li> * Admire your beautiful and stunning new nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> to my surprise I was not dealing with the best customer service as expected.</li>
            <li> I wanted a good quality and not very expensive UV lamp</li>
            <li> So I emailed SunValleyTec to see if they can replace it easily, otherwise I&#x27;ll return it, and start researching another nail dryer.  </li>
            <li> I found a tote bag to pack it and polish items so will be easy for travel.</li>
            <li> We found that all the items you need are available on Amazon at good prices and fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> * Sliding tray for easy cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One hand looks way better (I am right handed):)</li>
            <li> It shipped extremely quickly as well!  </li>
            <li> The light seems to be quality made for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> I invested some money into getting the Shellac system and of course you  need an UV light.</li>
            <li> and she didn&#x27;t really mention that she liked the gel polish and the UV curing process.  </li>
            <li> * 36 watt UV GEL light curing system with four bulbs.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> * Place hand into the USpicy UV light for 2 minutes for a light color and 3 minutes for darker colors</li>
            <li> * Place your hand into the USpicy UV light for 3 minutes.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after researching what type of UV Light I would need to gel nails.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> This was very economical.</li>
            <li> My mother is so excited awaiting a UV light</li>
            <li> process, once you know what to buy, is fast, easy and safe to do.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m excited about my purchase.</li>
            <li> and I hope it is useful to you!  </li>
            <li> Originally purchased a Salon brand lamp, got it and it never worked -- not even once.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ok with this at first thinking they will rush me a working product..</li>
            <li> * Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using cotton ball.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well made product, easy to assemble, would buy more products from this vendor and would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Love my nail dryer, worked very well on my 1st</li>
            <li> Cool operation.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I wish it had an true on and off switch, I have to unplug it to turn it off if its not set on the timer modes, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good product and produced professional results even for us amateurs the first time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good product and produced professional results even for us amateurs the first time.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, works perfectly, very fast during application.</li>
            <li> I find this nail light easy to use - I just push the button on the back and it turns on for the appropriate amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you SunValleyTec for replacing the defective product so quickly and easily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t get it in time for the party, but I really couldn&#x27;t ask for a more useful and hassle-free response than that.  </li>
            <li> It has also saved me a lot of money and it was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> * Small attractive package that is compact and easy</li>
            <li> Thanks for making such an amazing product, USpicy!</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, and is large enough to fit one hand in comfortably.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very sturdy unit and has a nice pink design on the top.  </li>
            <li> Looking at a wide variety of lamps available, I thought this seemed to be a good quality at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Though I am extremely happy with this product, I did notice that the timers were not accurate.  </li>
            <li> it is big love that both hands fit and</li>
            <li> I was unsatisfied with my first order with no hesitation new better lights were sent out to me.</li>
            <li> Other than that, good purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my personal use and liked very much.  </li>
            <li> This is a choice, right?  </li>
            <li> and it was the right decision.  </li>
            <li> You have to cure it a little longer than 30 seconds each round, but still comes out great :) lots of ample room for hands and feet. :)</li>
            <li> For this reason, I gave it only 4 stars -- it&#x27;s just less than perfect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a dryer this size for such a great, low price.</li>
            <li> This is a professional Uv lamp, I strongly recomend those persons who wanna have their nail made at home.</li>
            <li> Thank u very much.</li>
            <li> The LED light did not come on near the time switch.  </li>
            <li> I just did my nails for the first time.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a all night thing because everyone else wants them done too!</li>
            <li> There are many brands of lamps to choose from, at diferent prices, but I doubt that buying a more expensive one I would have gotten something better than this lamp.  </li>
            <li> This USpicy dryer is exactly what I needed to shave time off my appointments.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> The supplies that you buy will last and allow you to do our nails many times.  </li>
            <li> However, be sure you have enough room to store it.</li>
            <li> It fits great at my work station, and the fact that I can now dry both hands at once, and quickly, is such a time saver.</li>
            <li> * Fast, easy and professional quality of results.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I am able to change my nail color to suit my mood, patch up little chips that happen along the way, and I can even fit my toes in there.</li>
            <li> I left town shortly after the last update, so I can&#x27;t attest to the speed, but I did return to a brand new replacement dryer that happily works!  </li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I never need to dry for longer than the 3 minute timer, but I love that I have the option to set it for 2 minutes or 5 minutes as well.</li>
            <li> * Suitable for professional and personal use.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Actually, if I had to buy a new one for me, I would buy this one for sure.  </li>
            <li> My hopes were so high!  </li>
            <li> I just turned the timer on again to finish the cycle, and used the on-off switch to turn it off when I was ready.</li>
            <li> It really dries your nails in 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Received promptly and was set up ready to go.</li>
            <li> Really like the 2 and 3min timing feature.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that for sure, but since it would be a birthday gift, I spent several dollars more and went with this USpicy USND-3601 36W Professional Nail Dryer.</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> This product works really well for gel nails.</li>
            <li> &gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface of the nail using Gelish Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only are the bulbs securely in place, but there are two timers in addition to the on/off switch.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to shove my whole hand in that giant slot.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quite agree with the fact that she is so into this hobby, but I simply couldn&#x27;t find any other good birthday gift for her,</li>
            <li> * Push back cuticle and clean fingernail.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing I really love is that you can put your entire hand in this one unlike some of the smaller cheaper units I&#x27;ve purchased you have to do your thumbs seperate, which can add up to a lot of additional time.  </li>
            <li> Really, I just love this little lamp!</li>
            <li> we really didn&#x27;t know all the steps to get professional results.  </li>
            <li> &gt;* Gently remove the natural nail</li>
            <li> so I can only use the Right side.</li>
            <li> Within an hour I received an email from SunValleyTec stating that they will ship me a new dryer within twelve hours, and that once I test it and confirm it&#x27;s working, they will give me instructions to return the defective one.  </li>
            <li> Some places want to receive your return before they ship a new one.  </li>
            <li> * Being new to doing this at home we purchased a Gelish Basix Kit.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does the whole hand, unlike some I looked at where you couldn&#x27;t get the thumb at the same time as other nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Chinese lamp for about 3 months and it has been ok, but I didn&#x27;t want to give her a chinese present.  </li>
            <li> Left side does not get hot</li>
            <li> I thought I might get a non-working cheap looking unbranded dryer in a white box with no bonus nail file.  </li>
            <li> Splurging on a bigger lamp when I have other, more pressing, business expenses just seemed excessive to me, and the little lamps did the job I needed them to do, albeit not as timely as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I purchased them very close in time, so it was easy to be confused.)</li>
            <li> This being said I have been shipped a new UV lamp after 20 attempts to call both Uspicy and Sunvalley and this second product just arrived today!</li>
            <li> I am a professional nail tech with a small business and have been using 9 watt lamps that only fit four fingers because the cost of a 54 watt two hand lamp, or even just a 36 watt one hand lamp, was out of my price range.</li>
            <li> I spent a little bit more money than with the chinese one, but I would do it again.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s collected numerous types of nail polish and changes her nail colors quitely frequently.</li>
            <li> and now you can get the same professional results as going to the Nail Salon</li>
            <li> For a fraction of the cost you can get the same professional results, save money and tell your friends that you did it yourself.  </li>
            <li> the unit is much sturdier and heavier and larger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Used to have the one for only one hand at a time-this one makes it almost 50% fast than the other dryer.  </li>
            <li> This little lamp has saved me so much hassle.</li>
            <li> 5 and even 10 min not enough to dry up nail polish  </li>
            <li> I think the size is standard in every 36w lamp (a little too big), but the smaller have lower voltage, so I prefer this one.</li>
            <li> It has an auto timer for 2 or 3 minutes, or you can time it yourself for as long as you want.</li>
            <li> They even expected me to pay UPS to ship the damaged goods back to them...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original Review: I was nervous when I ordered this dryer through Sunvalleytec, because the reviews for this and other USpicy dryers were mixed.  </li>
            <li> Waited too long and couldn&#x27;t return!</li>
            <li> Also I did see there are some other 36 nail dryers sold on Amazon, but from the pictures, they look quite generic - no brand logo on the surface of the dryer, no user manal, perhaps white-box package.</li>
            <li> (all other items off Amazon by different sellers).</li>
            <li> so it takes about 10 minutes to dry the nails&lt;</li>
            <li> I painted my grandmothers toes and just plugged this in on the floor to dry her toes and done.</li>
            <li> wraps around to dry the thumb and</li>
            <li> * Thoroughly wash and dry your hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The item was triple boxed--a Uspicy box inside a slightly bigger plain white box, inside a brown cardboard box</li>
            <li> I am no longer interested in playing the wait for another product game with them anymore..</li>
            <li> Previous reviews featured this item, not to mention it was the only one rated w 5 stars, so that sold me.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not very stong</li>
            <li> I have for several months and dropped it quite a few times and have not had any problems from it.</li>
            <li> There are 3 settings for timers: 120 sec, 180 sec and endless.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the gloves that have come with it are for individuals with long fingers which I don&#x27;t have</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have included the instructions we used and linked the products we purchased so you can look at the other items.  </li>
            <li> (I think I may have mixed up my reviews previously and given this one a bad review and the bad lamp a good review!  </li>
            <li> There is no bulb clips as the description stated and picture showed, that is the only negative.</li>
            <li> Curing time is down from 3 min.</li>
            <li> and she felt that the UV cured gel polish made her nails stronger and break less often.  </li>
            <li> I am seriously scared to try to purchase another one from a different company now.</li>
            <li> I knew when I left that it was not a good job.</li>
            <li> I was not going to go every two weeks where someone else can mess up my nails.</li>
            <li> But it is certainly not cheap looking or feeling.  </li>
            <li> So it gets a bit toasty in there after a few people.</li>
            <li> It came with bulbs installed and the bulb clip is holding bulbs firmly.</li>
            <li> Anxious to see if it lasts.</li>
            <li> Arrived with one broken lamp.</li>
            <li> She has thin nails</li>
            <li> guess I thought wrong.</li>
            <li> * Apply Gelish Foundation Gel or gel base coat in a thin coat to the nail and the nail tip edge and cure for 1 minute under UV light.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Going to have your nail done is expensive!</li>
            <li> Too bad I won&#x27;t have it in time for tomorrow&#x27;s party! :</li>
            <li> Use thin coats!!!!</li>

            <li> UPDATE: I left town shortly after the last update, so I can&#x27;t attest to the speed, but I did return to a brand new replacement dryer that happily works!  I&#x27;ve only used it once, for a friend&#x27;s nails, so I&#x27;ll return soon with a review of the results.  Thank you SunValleyTec for replacing the defective product so quickly and easily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Within an hour I received an email from SunValleyTec stating that they will ship me a new dryer within twelve hours, and that once I test it and confirm it&#x27;s working, they will give me instructions to return the defective one.  I won&#x27;t get it in time for the party, but I really couldn&#x27;t ask for a more useful and hassle-free response than that.  Some places want to receive your return before they ship a new one.  I&#x27;m going to hope that the replacement is good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review: I was nervous when I ordered this dryer through Sunvalleytec, because the reviews for this and other USpicy dryers were mixed.  I thought I might get a non-working cheap looking unbranded dryer in a white box with no bonus nail file.  But it was all there--the unit is much sturdier and heavier and larger than I expected.  My nail table can&#x27;t handle its footprint!  But it is certainly not cheap looking or feeling.  Even the buttons feel solid.  The machine is attractive and shiny and smooth, and the USpicy flower logo looks nice on the top.  The bulbs were already installed.  The item was triple boxed--a Uspicy box inside a slightly bigger plain white box, inside a brown cardboard box (I had another item in the brown box.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the dryer Friday night, and it arrived Monday morning.  My hopes were so high!  I was so excited to shove my whole hand in that giant slot.  But when I plugged it in--nothing.  The LED light did not come on near the time switch.  I toggled on/off, but nothing changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers said that SunValleyTec was nice and helpful; others said they were not.  Amazon will refund the item,but not replace it.  So I emailed SunValleyTec to see if they can replace it easily, otherwise I&#x27;ll return it, and start researching another nail dryer.  Too bad I won&#x27;t have it in time for tomorrow&#x27;s party! :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also--I saw somebody ask if this would work with regular nail polish and they were told no, it&#x27;s only for gel nails. But my plan was to use a UV topcoat over my regular polish and cure that.  This is a choice, right?  Or am I crazy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review when I have more.</li>
            <li> Love this lamp! If you&#x27;re doing your own nails, this is a must get! Can do both hands and feet in it. I&#x27;ve only had to use the 2 minute setting and my polish us cured. A must have!</li>
            <li> I bought this lamp so that I could do my own Gelish nails at home to save money.  Looking at a wide variety of lamps available, I thought this seemed to be a good quality at a reasonable price.  I just did my nails for the first time.  Although my technique needs some practice, the lamp worked great!  It has an auto timer for 2 or 3 minutes, or you can time it yourself for as long as you want. Easy to use and does the whole hand, unlike some I looked at where you couldn&#x27;t get the thumb at the same time as other nails.  I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Excellent seller fast shipping great prices love it</li>
            <li> I had each hand done and put under the lamp for an hour each and the nails were still sticky.</li>
            <li> I love this machine but just wish it had a fan. When I do nails it&#x27;s a all night thing because everyone else wants them done too! UGH. So it gets a bit toasty in there after a few people. All in all it&#x27;s a great product. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time, and in excellent protective packaging.  It is very easy to use, and is large enough to fit one hand in comfortably.  There are 3 settings for timers: 120 sec, 180 sec and endless.  There is also a button to press to begin the timer which will make it turn off automatically, and then there&#x27;s a separate on-off switch as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I am extremely happy with this product, I did notice that the timers were not accurate.  They were coming up about 12 seconds short.  I just turned the timer on again to finish the cycle, and used the on-off switch to turn it off when I was ready. For this reason, I gave it only 4 stars -- it&#x27;s just less than perfect.  Other than that, I&#x27;m excited about my purchase.</li>
            <li> I like this lamp, works well, I wish it would  recommend it. It really dries your nails in 2 minutes. I wish it came as a LED Lamp.</li>
            <li> It was a chritsmas gift for my sister and I wasn&#x27;t very sure about the quality of the lamp and if she were going to use it. I&#x27;ve had a Chinese lamp for about 3 months and it has been ok, but I didn&#x27;t want to give her a chinese present.  I wanted a good quality and not very expensive UV lamp and it was the right decision.  This lamp seems to be good quality, it&#x27;s nice (with the pink logo on it), and it works great. I think the size is standard in every 36w lamp (a little too big), but the smaller have lower voltage, so I prefer this one. I spent a little bit more money than with the chinese one, but I would do it again. Actually, if I had to buy a new one for me, I would buy this one for sure.  There are many brands of lamps to choose from, at diferent prices, but I doubt that buying a more expensive one I would have gotten something better than this lamp.  My sister loves it. I think it was the best Xmas present.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to use with the gelish system and I love it!  It has a timer for 2 or 3 minutes which coordinates with the product requirements.  It&#x27;s a very sturdy unit and has a nice pink design on the top.  The light seems to be quality made for a fraction of the price.  One thing I really love is that you can put your entire hand in this one unlike some of the smaller cheaper units I&#x27;ve purchased you have to do your thumbs seperate, which can add up to a lot of additional time.  I&#x27;ve used it 4 times now with no complaints!  I would deffinitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Product seems to be well made and dries the nails fairly well .</li>
            <li> I was unsatisfied with my first order with no hesitation new better lights were sent out to me. I am now extremely happy n have been telling everyone they worked to be sure I was satisfied 100%. Thank u very much.</li>
            <li> Received promptly and was set up ready to go. Just plugged in, have used once and performed as described. Really like the 2 and 3min timing feature. I use for soak off gel polish and can set the timer as I desire. Previous reviews featured this item, not to mention it was the only one rated w 5 stars, so that sold me.  Am very pleased. I found a tote bag to pack it and polish items so will be easy for travel.</li>
            <li> I ordered this unit after returning the Thermal Spa unit. Received this unit yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give 5 stars, is because the second thing I checked after operability, was ease of bulb replacement (they were installed on arrival which seemed fishy)...therein lies the rub. Removing the bulbs is a pain with the bulb clip...to remove the side ones, you need to remove the screw on the bottom of the unit that holds clip in place, and replace screw after bulb replacement. You can also just remove the bulb clip and be done with it...not at all necessary, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll probably do.&lt;br /&gt;Would have ordered a unit without clip, but I wanted the 2 minute AND 3 minute timer.</li>
            <li> Arrived with one broken lamp. Waited too long and couldn&#x27;t return!</li>
            <li> We used this with the gelish starter set and it works well. You have to cure it a little longer than 30 seconds each round, but still comes out great :) lots of ample room for hands and feet. :)</li>
            <li> It works ok.. it&#x27;s not very stong so it takes about 10 minutes to dry the nails&lt;br /&gt;The Left side does not get hot AT ALL so I can only use the Right side.</li>
            <li> My younger sister is a big fan of nail polish. She&#x27;s collected numerous types of nail polish and changes her nail colors quitely frequently. I don&#x27;t quite agree with the fact that she is so into this hobby, but I simply couldn&#x27;t find any other good birthday gift for her, cuz I knew she would definitely love it. No surprise - after I gave it to her on her birthday, she was hilarious! As far as she&#x27;s happy, I am also happy.   Before I placed the order, I did some research. Seems like Amazon has the wider selection of different types of nail dryers and the prices here are also very attractive. Also I did see there are some other 36 nail dryers sold on Amazon, but from the pictures, they look quite generic - no brand logo on the surface of the dryer, no user manal, perhaps white-box package. I don&#x27;t know that for sure, but since it would be a birthday gift, I spent several dollars more and went with this USpicy USND-3601 36W Professional Nail Dryer. I am glad I&#x27;ve made the right decision, cuz after my sister opened it, it had everything inside as shown in the pictures - beautiful package, the branded nail dryer, four bulbs, nicely-done user manual, and even the free gift of sanding file.   Lots of thanks to both Sunvalleytek and USpicy to make a great birthday gift for my sister!</li>
            <li> This works awesome for CND Shellac curing.  I think the side bulbs help your thumb nails cure well.  There is no bulb clips as the description stated and picture showed, that is the only negative.</li>
            <li> I love it. it is very easy to use. I painted my grandmothers toes and just plugged this in on the floor to dry her toes and done. I use it for my nails. it is great and works greats.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase, exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Love my nail dryer, worked very well on my 1st try doing manicures, GREAT top-notch company with super customer service.  Save your money and do your own nails with this dryer.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works perfectly, very fast during application. Well made product, easy to assemble, would buy more products from this vendor and would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing lamp! It fits great at my work station, and the fact that I can now dry both hands at once, and quickly, is such a time saver. I am a professional nail tech with a small business and have been using 9 watt lamps that only fit four fingers because the cost of a 54 watt two hand lamp, or even just a 36 watt one hand lamp, was out of my price range. Splurging on a bigger lamp when I have other, more pressing, business expenses just seemed excessive to me, and the little lamps did the job I needed them to do, albeit not as timely as I would have liked. I&#x27;ve never found a dryer this size for such a great, low price. This USpicy dryer is exactly what I needed to shave time off my appointments. I never need to dry for longer than the 3 minute timer, but I love that I have the option to set it for 2 minutes or 5 minutes as well. It works great on gel polishes and gel topcoats, and it just looks nice at my station. I am so glad I found this lamp! Thanks for making such an amazing product, USpicy!</li>
            <li> I received it earlie which was a plus I loved it is big love that both hands fit and all features are nice!!!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Used it about 4 times and it works well. Shipping was pretty fast. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish that 1) I wish I had the choice to  run the fan without the uv but they must be run together and 2) I thought that the lamp was coming with gloves but guess I thought wrong. Other than that, good purchase.</li>
            <li> I find this nail light easy to use - I just push the button on the back and it turns on for the appropriate amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wraps around to dry the thumb and some models you must do the thumbs separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read one review where the person said it didn&#x27;t work but she either didn&#x27;t use gel products or didn&#x27;t use the final step of wiping the nails wit alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great!  I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> perfect wattage for drying UV gel manicures.  great packaging and upgraded features are thoughtful with the sliding tray.  would love to know where to get replacement bulbs.</li>
            <li> It is awesome. I absolutely love it.  It works great and cures nails fast!  It shipped extremely quickly as well!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Have been doing my own nails and this nail dryer works GREAT!  It has also saved me a lot of money and it was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> This works great for my needs! I redo my polish about every 1.5 weeks. It works very well and I&#x27;ve never had any issues in the couple of months I&#x27;ve owned it.</li>
            <li> I invested some money into getting the Shellac system and of course you  need an UV light. I chose this one and haven&#x27;t looked back. It works great, good quality for the money and I love that it came with the UV protecting gloves. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with peeling or non curing of the Shellac.</li>
            <li> I love getting gel manicures at the salon, but each one was costing me about $30. And even though, they promise to last two weeks, there is always some chip that happens that sends me running back. This little lamp has saved me so much hassle. It works exactly as stated. I have for several months and dropped it quite a few times and have not had any problems from it. I am able to change my nail color to suit my mood, patch up little chips that happen along the way, and I can even fit my toes in there. My daughter is now able to use gel polish because I can do her nails instead of expensive salon manicures. Really, I just love this little lamp!</li>
            <li> I bought this after a botched job at the nail salon. I paid $35 for a no-chip manicure which only lasted 5 days. I knew when I left that it was not a good job. So, I decided to save some money and do it myself. I was not going to go every two weeks where someone else can mess up my nails. I can do that myself! lol. I decided to give this a try after the reviews. It is a learning curve. One hand looks way better (I am right handed):) This works within a nice amount of time if you follow directions. It took me about 15min per hand. Use thin coats!!!! You can always add another coat for your desired color/look. This was very economical.</li>
            <li> This product works really well for gel nails. My nails came out perfectly the first time I used it. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3JA1MSYUN044Q]]My wife used to have her nails done all the time at the nail salon.  She stopped going and she didn&#x27;t really mention that she liked the gel polish and the UV curing process.  She has thin nails and she felt that the UV cured gel polish made her nails stronger and break less often.  She also said that the gel polish lasted for about 2 to 3 weeks without chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we got this UV curing lamp we really didn&#x27;t know all the steps to get professional results.  We found that all the items you need are available on Amazon at good prices and fast delivery.  I have included the instructions we used and linked the products we purchased so you can look at the other items.  This detail is included both this written review and in the attached video review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process, once you know what to buy, is fast, easy and safe to do. The supplies that you buy will last and allow you to do our nails many times.  One bottle of the gel nail polish (0.5 Oz) can do your nails about 100 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy doing your own nails and now you can get the same professional results as going to the Nail Salon you will love this lamp. For a fraction of the cost you can get the same professional results, save money and tell your friends that you did it yourself.  My wife has already had several compliments on her nails in just a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the list of what we ordered to do this process:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006L6WNVG ROYAL NAILS ANTI UV GLOVES FOR UV LIGHT/LAMP NAIL DRYER ONLY NAIL EXPOSED]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0057JCYYE Gelish Basix Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B007U8R0D0 Gelish Soak Off .5 oz Gossip Girl Gel Nail Color UV Manicure Harmony Polish Lamp]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember that to use this lamp you need to use a UV curable gel polish.

My wife was very happy with using this UV nail light and we give it:&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample of this USpicy UV light/lamp for test and evaluation.</li>
            <li> I returned this item as the bulbs didn&#x27;t work. They were already inserted in the machine when I received it and maybe that is why.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my personal use and liked very much.  Used to have the one for only one hand at a time-this one makes it almost 50% fast than the other dryer.  However, be sure you have enough room to store it.</li>
            <li> Originally purchased a Salon brand lamp, got it and it never worked -- not even once.  This was what I purchased to replace it and I have been very pleased.  Not only are the bulbs securely in place, but there are two timers in addition to the on/off switch.  (I think I may have mixed up my reviews previously and given this one a bad review and the bad lamp a good review!  I purchased them very close in time, so it was easy to be confused.)</li>
            <li> Going to have your nail done is expensive! I love this product. Its easy to use and love that I can do my feet to! My sisters and I have nail parties. This is a great buy! UV lights is the way to go!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been spending money  for Shellac on our nails at the salon for quite a while. If we go twice a month each thats over 120$ a month!!  I read  alot of reviews on the lights, this one looked the best for the price, I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This works great! I got it as a gift for my mom and she uses it all the time. It is so nice to do my own nails and not have to pay a fortune to have them done. My only complaint is that the gloves that have come with it are for individuals with long fingers which I don&#x27;t have so I just use sunscreen on my hands to protect them.</li>
            <li> 5 and even 10 min not enough to dry up nail polish  you have to repeat 2 even 3 time for every coat</li>
            <li> excellent product, very easy to use...</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after researching what type of UV Light I would need to gel nails. This was a well thought out gift I was purchasing for my mother along with the gel nail polish and starter kit needed to get her started (all other items off Amazon by different sellers). I purchased this December 15th 2012 thinking this would be enough time to receive all the items for Christmas. It wasn&#x27;t until Christmas eve that I received this UV Lamp/Dryer and to my surprise IT DOESN&amp;#34;T EVEN TURN ON. I&#x27;m ok with this at first thinking they will rush me a working product.. I will wrap the damaged one so she knows the thought was there but I will get her a working product and hopefully sooner than later..to my surprise I was not dealing with the best customer service as expected. I have had the run around from Uspicy and Sunvalley tek which is the 3rd party vendor you deal with when purchasing a lot of items off Amazon. This being said I have been shipped a new UV lamp after 20 attempts to call both Uspicy and Sunvalley and this second product just arrived today! January 7th 2013... IT DOESN&amp;#34;T EVEN WORK EITHER!!! Can you believe this??? I have never gotten an apology or an offer for a credit at all from either of these companies. They even expected me to pay UPS to ship the damaged goods back to them... I am seriously scared to try to purchase another one from a different company now. My mother is so excited awaiting a UV light and I dont have one here a month later.. I have requested a refund today from Sunvalley and I better get it ASAP. I am no longer interested in playing the wait for another product game with them anymore.. I hope this review helps others from purchasing from Uspicy.. Good luck if you choose to do so. I am now going to have to do my homework on the next light/dryer I may take a chance on.</li>
            <li> Great product very fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> This is a professional Uv lamp, I strongly recomend those persons who wanna have their nail made at home.</li>
            <li> Read all reviews, seemed like a good product. Got it for my girlfriend for Christmas and 2 of the lights keep going out.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm. I did a lot of research before buying this one and I am really satisfied. Anxious to see if it lasts.</li>
            <li> This upgraded version with removable tray works better than my kidney-shaped LED dryer. Removable tray opens up the bottom of the dryer and extends its drying positions. Curing time is down from 3 min. on the LED dryer to 2 min. with this USpicy apparatus. It came with bulbs installed and the bulb clip is holding bulbs firmly. Included UV protection gloves are a great plus.</li>
            <li> I love how roomy the hand tray is. I am able to place all 5 fingers in at one time, so it decrease my time for doing my gel nails. I wish it had an true on and off switch, I have to unplug it to turn it off if its not set on the timer modes, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
