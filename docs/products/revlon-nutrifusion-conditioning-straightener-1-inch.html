    <ol>
            <li>Color me impressed -</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with this straightener.</li>
            <li>I am so impressed with the hot-curling iron.</li>
            <li>color is very beautiful and it fits in my hand well.  </li>
            <li>The straightener is great!</li>
            <li>I Bought this along with the curling iron and use both very awesome for folks with the frizzy curly course hair that does not like humity.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that is looking a good straightener!!</li>
            <li>sister has wavy, non frizzy almost perfect hair</li>
            <li>Over all I am very happy with this one:}  UPDATE!!!  </li>
            <li>in, 5 star...doesn&#x27;t walk the dog, do laundry or shop for you, but is a good iron that works well!</li>
            <li>and it came out beautiful</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t feel like this straightener did that great of a job.</li>
            <li>It also serves as a curling iron, which is great having two options in one unit.  </li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>The Revlon Nutrifusion Triple Oil Infused Straightener is an attractive, easy-to-use styling device that comes with easy-to-understand instructions.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall great product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>We LOVE it!!</li>
            <li>bright turquoise shade...</li>
            <li>The bright color is an added bonus.&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So If you have babyfine hair like me you will like that it does a good job</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d think for the price it would be a good thing to have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the straightener is a good buy for the price.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice weight to it and the cord is a great length.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Oil Infused product seems like a good concept.  </li>
            <li>Is that good for your hair?  </li>
            <li>Looks like I&#x27;m going to have to keep looking for a good 2 in 1.</li>
            <li>I loved the straightening mechanism.  </li>
            <li>I got it as a gift and am very glad I didn&#x27;t spend any money on it.</li>
            <li>I love this straightener/curler!</li>
            <li>Love this straightener!</li>
            <li>I need to experiment some more with it!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to get almost all the way to the roots of the hair, and the results are great.  </li>
            <li>It heats quickly, is comfortable in your hand, and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>the curls come out really nice.</li>
            <li>I think it would&#x27;ve been nice</li>
            <li>Should moisturizers be applied with that kind of heat?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The conditioner was a nice feature, but I still continue using the conditioning products that I always use.  </li>
            <li>It acts as a nice addition but probably doesn&#x27;t replace any products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice idea, being a straightener and curling iron-in-one.</li>
            <li>But it was nice to have one product instead of two when traveling.  </li>
            <li>We tried this out on her hair and were very pleased with the results - with the heat setting at 15 (about halfway up), she had beautifully smoothed and straight hair with just one pass.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, I think if you have the right type of hair this product will be great for you, but for us hair challenged gals, we need something stronger.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that tends to get frizzy after drying it</li>
            <li>Love the handle color too.</li>
            <li>Why spend more if you don&#x27;t need to?</li>
            <li>I have never had a Revlon curling iron before, but am certainly glad I got this one.</li>
            <li>or maybe I don&#x27;t know how to get the most out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The dials are all on the side, most straighteners you have to put your fingers in between the clamps to change settings or turn it off.</li>
            <li>The plates are nice and smooth (I guess because of the infused oils).  </li>
            <li>I removed the guide combs and it was better</li>
            <li>I also have a ton of static even though it&#x27;s mid-summer</li>
            <li>Fill in the top?  </li>
            <li>Are we sure?  </li>
            <li>Straightening it makes it more manageable.  </li>
            <li>so maybe this is better suited for teens.</li>
            <li>It is actually more time consuming than plugging in two separate products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The one that is used the most is made by Chi.  </li>
            <li>and I love the results that they give me.  </li>
            <li>Used more for curling than straightening.  </li>
            <li>I was able to slide the plates on and off easily while the iron was on hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine hair, I  found that it worked just as good as the higher priced ceramic iron that my daughter paid almost $100  for.</li>
            <li>In this case, the smooth and bend strategy on the top layer gives the illusion that there&#x27;s fullness to this head of hair when, in fact, there is not.  </li>
            <li>When I got this to try out, I was excited because I could use it more to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>So, you cannot easily switch from straightening to curling.  </li>
            <li>This is easy to use and is designed well</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with the product and the very smart design.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What more can I say...buy this item and all of your wildest hair straightening and curling dreams can come true :</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars as I averaged 5 stars for my fine hair and the 1 and 2 stars my daughter and friend rated it for their hair types.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Didn&#x27;t like this one, didn&#x27;t work for my fine, colored hair.</li>
            <li>iron straightens fine.  </li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>hair is shoulder length, medium to fine, and wavy/curly so it always requires some styling tool.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many a straightener and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>Overall a great product for an affordable price.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t see the conditioner as being an important part of the product.  </li>
            <li>It would also be great for a dorm room or anywhere you don&#x27;t have a lot of bathroom space as it is 2 different products in one.</li>
            <li>The light would come on but no heat.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that the curling plates don&#x27;t get very hot, but for my fine hair, they work ok.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s enough to know I love, love, love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this line and recommend you try this or another tool if you&#x27;re interested.  </li>
            <li>and I think they are unique in the results they give.  </li>
            <li>the plates that go from straight to curly are easily changed out, it is inexpensive and it does the job!</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;triple oil infused&amp;#34; is misleading - no, there isn&#x27;t anything special about this straightener.</li>
            <li>Great Flat Iron and very smart design.  </li>
            <li>Truthfully, I don&#x27;t know much about those oils mentioned in their ads, but I do know it&#x27;s not damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>then i introduced it to some one with thinner more straight hair</li>
            <li>There is a tip that remains cool at the end of the wand to allow you to do this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it daily, and I like it more and more.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and does not leave my hair brittle.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in the super humid south.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>10 times better than our older one.</li>
            <li>Though, a regular curling iron works much better and has more area to work with.</li>
            <li>Combined it makes for an ok iron but as a stand alone for a flat iron it works better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the wand is too loose to get a good grip and straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have unmanageable hair most of the time so the infusion of oils on the plates creates soft, wavy curls.</li>
            <li>I docked it one star because I would have liked to see a digital temperature</li>
            <li>The flat iron worked perfectly and did what is expected of it.</li>
            <li>Here is the review right from the person who has been using the straightener for three weeks: &amp;</li>
            <li>and she ordered right away ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty but very flimsy.</li>
            <li>They work amazingly well, the effects last a long time, and my hair is shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>Having said that, its a basic flat iron and made for a great gift.  </li>
            <li>I received my first curling iron through the Amazon Vine and loved it so much that I purchased these other two tools!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine ever needing to use a higher heat setting than what we used today (15 out of 30).  </li>
            <li>could go on and on about the tangle-free cord and how pretty it is...</li>
            <li>It straightened my hair okay, but it left it frizzier than my preferred straightener.</li>
            <li>I love that it curls too with the heat on the outside</li>
            <li>After using it, I can&#x27;t say I understand how exactly this works.  </li>
            <li>was the first thing I noticed</li>
            <li>Now I have no idea if I am setting the temperate too hot.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting that the hot metal part is on both sides of the wand, although if your hair is between the wand, how is the outside metal plate doing anything?</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t understand exactly HOW the plates are infused with these oils.  </li>
            <li>However at no time was my hair as pretty as the picture on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>did feel funny</li>
            <li>Not as hot as some of the higher dollar brands, but enough heat to safely style as you like.</li>
            <li>both this and the curling iron keep hair looking smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>use the curling iron you have to affix the curler part but you cant do that when it is hot, so you are not saving any time.  </li>
            <li>is my first straightener so it has been a bit of a learning experience.  </li>
            <li>iron gets extremely hot.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still plenty hot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the first curling iron for almost a year now</li>
            <li>#34;I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>The flat iron itself is just okay.</li>
            <li>The effectiveness of the oils is debatable, but if you&#x27;re looking for an alternative to some of the more expensive straighteners, this is a good option.</li>
            <li>I tried mine for the first time yesterday, and it performed very well.</li>
            <li>My hair is super straight and fine so the temps on this go high enough.</li>
            <li>thought it was very ingenious to to have hot iron plates on the outside of the flat iron to help with curling your hair.  </li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t like the plates at all: it felt like my hair was being pulled more, as if my hair was dry like hay.</li>
            <li>The guard are easy to remove and put back on.</li>
            <li>, the little grippers slip off when using and the outside of the barrel that&#x27;s supposed to give nice, bouncy curls barely gets warm, I could touch it with my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I used this the same way I use my favorite iron, keeping it in motion, more or less.  </li>
            <li>; actually means, but the plates slide smoothly through the hair</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, and doesn&#x27;t fry your hair.</li>
            <li>did both straighten and curl like it was suppose to just not as much as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li>It has an automatic shut off system that I really like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been careful with the temps, making sure to use protective products, etc.</li>
            <li>It also makes our hair very silky &amp; shiney &amp; we don&#x27;t even have to use any heat protection spray.</li>
            <li>I found the curling wand doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>daughters really like this model a lot, so</li>
            <li>The kids have much thicker hair</li>
            <li>I really like the Revlon straight irons.  </li>
            <li>This appealed to me as I use both a curling iron and a straight iron after I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>Straight iron to defrizz and the curling iron to give it some body that I just stripped</li>
            <li>so of course she wants to straighten it.</li>
            <li>The plates seem smooth enough and do glide through hair...</li>
            <li>This Revlon straightener uses the same highly popular ingredients currently touted by the hair care industry everywhere</li>
            <li>The plates are very smooth and glide nicely over my hair but aren&#x27;t any different than my other flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I am reluctant to use new hair products or devices having found that the combination of Kronos shampoo, Fancifull temporary hair color, and a hot brush takes the anguish out of a.m. hair prep.  </li>
            <li>flat iron does a fantastic job smoothing out and curling my hair.  </li>
            <li>little experimentation over a week resulted in a more than satisfactory end result--hot brush first, then, once dry, this tool to further smooth and bend my hair at just the right level to give it some fullness (i.e. no Morticia look).  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s multiple heat levels based on preference and hair type, and it heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>Works great for my thick hair!!</li>
            <li>I have one of the high end brands that I use in conjunction with the hair oil straightening sprays</li>
            <li>So while I liked it, I would only recommend it for those with thin, fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li>We only tried a little bit of curling, but that seemed to be fairly effective, as well, although she&#x27;ll probably just use the curling part to get her bangs to go the direction she wants and to curl the ends</li>
            <li>Not only is it pretty, but it makes my hair look much thicker and wavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I normally just turn it all the way up.</li>
            <li>I would say it would be good for those who have thin to medium hair and don&#x27;t wish to spend a lot of money on a styling tool.  </li>
            <li>you can also use this as a curling iron not hard at all.</li>
            <li>It is such a nice looking flat iron, why not put the digital temperature read out on it?  </li>
            <li>and you can get down to the roots easily,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get that feeling with my other two straighteners; they run smoothly through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>--I need a new perm for curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will update my review if I have new information to add.</li>
            <li>my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron aspect is fine for adding some curl but nothing beyond average to note.</li>
            <li>From the description, I expected something spectacular but it worked about as well as other straighteners that I have.</li>
            <li>Most of the time you have a hair straightener and a curling iron cluttering up one of those small bathroom drawers.  </li>
            <li>but as far as straightening her hair &amp; mine, it does wonders!</li>
            <li>but they have all left a positive impression on me.  </li>
            <li>She has long, not thick or not thin hair just normal</li>
            <li>do not say, I do not notice any difference with the triple Oil Infused plates, there is probably some benefit to this, but I do not see or feel the difference than my old straighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but like I said, the digital model I have is much simpler for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it i introuduced it to one person with verrrrry thick curly and corse hair</li>
            <li>straightener tends to dry out hair and doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot</li>
            <li>It took me about 2 extra passes per section than it takes me with my high end brand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it a few weeks now and some of the comments I&#x27;ve read are true.  </li>
            <li>They certainly aren&#x27;t the most expensive you can invest in</li>
            <li>My 12 year old daughter wanted a new flat iron for Christmas</li>
            <li>; (aka more expensive) straight irons.  </li>
            <li>Well, I no longer use the more expensive irons because I prefer the Revlon straight irons</li>
            <li>I normally like to set the heat on my flat iron to 390 degrees</li>
            <li>The guild in the directions: 1-6 fine; 7-14 wavy; 15-22 thick &amp; 23-30 coarse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>curling iron part is adequate for my hair, but the plates for the curling iron part will only heat up if you lock the flat iron closed.  </li>
            <li>Instead of temperature indications, there are number ranges:  1-6 for fine hair, 7-14 for wavy, 15-22 for thick, and 23-30 for coarse, hard-to-style hair.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s average for me, but they really do like it</li>
            <li>My wife has long, naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>This was hot enough that the hair burns your hand a little after each section is straightened.</li>
            <li>One really cool feature of this is that when you&#x27;re not using it, there is a little switch on the bottom that you can turn and it will hold the plates closed together for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One less step is always appreciated right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no reservoir in which these oils are kept, and the only indication that something different might be going on, is that the straightener gives off a little smoke when it is first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty basic and doesn&#x27;t do much to tame fly-aways.</li>
            <li>and I am so irritated because the whole things still works just not that little piece.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Overall great product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> We LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> bright turquoise shade...</li>
            <li> The bright color is an added bonus.&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So If you have babyfine hair like me you will like that it does a good job</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d think for the price it would be a good thing to have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the straightener is a good buy for the price.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice weight to it and the cord is a great length.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Oil Infused product seems like a good concept.  </li>
            <li> Is that good for your hair?  </li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;m going to have to keep looking for a good 2 in 1.</li>
            <li> I loved the straightening mechanism.  </li>
            <li> I got it as a gift and am very glad I didn&#x27;t spend any money on it.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener/curler!</li>
            <li> Love this straightener!</li>
            <li> I need to experiment some more with it!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to get almost all the way to the roots of the hair, and the results are great.  </li>
            <li> It heats quickly, is comfortable in your hand, and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> the curls come out really nice.</li>
            <li> I think it would&#x27;ve been nice</li>
            <li> Should moisturizers be applied with that kind of heat?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The conditioner was a nice feature, but I still continue using the conditioning products that I always use.  </li>
            <li> It acts as a nice addition but probably doesn&#x27;t replace any products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a nice idea, being a straightener and curling iron-in-one.</li>
            <li> But it was nice to have one product instead of two when traveling.  </li>
            <li> We tried this out on her hair and were very pleased with the results - with the heat setting at 15 (about halfway up), she had beautifully smoothed and straight hair with just one pass.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, I think if you have the right type of hair this product will be great for you, but for us hair challenged gals, we need something stronger.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that tends to get frizzy after drying it</li>
            <li> Love the handle color too.</li>
            <li> Why spend more if you don&#x27;t need to?</li>
            <li> I have never had a Revlon curling iron before, but am certainly glad I got this one.</li>
            <li> or maybe I don&#x27;t know how to get the most out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dials are all on the side, most straighteners you have to put your fingers in between the clamps to change settings or turn it off.</li>
            <li> The plates are nice and smooth (I guess because of the infused oils).  </li>
            <li> I removed the guide combs and it was better</li>
            <li> I also have a ton of static even though it&#x27;s mid-summer</li>
            <li> Fill in the top?  </li>
            <li> Are we sure?  </li>
            <li> Straightening it makes it more manageable.  </li>
            <li> so maybe this is better suited for teens.</li>
            <li> It is actually more time consuming than plugging in two separate products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one that is used the most is made by Chi.  </li>
            <li> and I love the results that they give me.  </li>
            <li> Used more for curling than straightening.  </li>
            <li> I was able to slide the plates on and off easily while the iron was on hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine hair, I  found that it worked just as good as the higher priced ceramic iron that my daughter paid almost $100  for.</li>
            <li> In this case, the smooth and bend strategy on the top layer gives the illusion that there&#x27;s fullness to this head of hair when, in fact, there is not.  </li>
            <li> When I got this to try out, I was excited because I could use it more to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> So, you cannot easily switch from straightening to curling.  </li>
            <li> This is easy to use and is designed well</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with the product and the very smart design.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What more can I say...buy this item and all of your wildest hair straightening and curling dreams can come true :</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars as I averaged 5 stars for my fine hair and the 1 and 2 stars my daughter and friend rated it for their hair types.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Didn&#x27;t like this one, didn&#x27;t work for my fine, colored hair.</li>
            <li> iron straightens fine.  </li>
            <li> It works fine</li>
            <li> hair is shoulder length, medium to fine, and wavy/curly so it always requires some styling tool.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many a straightener and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> Overall a great product for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t see the conditioner as being an important part of the product.  </li>
            <li> It would also be great for a dorm room or anywhere you don&#x27;t have a lot of bathroom space as it is 2 different products in one.</li>
            <li> The light would come on but no heat.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that the curling plates don&#x27;t get very hot, but for my fine hair, they work ok.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s enough to know I love, love, love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love this line and recommend you try this or another tool if you&#x27;re interested.  </li>
            <li> and I think they are unique in the results they give.  </li>
            <li> the plates that go from straight to curly are easily changed out, it is inexpensive and it does the job!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;triple oil infused&amp;#34; is misleading - no, there isn&#x27;t anything special about this straightener.</li>
            <li> Great Flat Iron and very smart design.  </li>
            <li> Truthfully, I don&#x27;t know much about those oils mentioned in their ads, but I do know it&#x27;s not damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> then i introduced it to some one with thinner more straight hair</li>
            <li> There is a tip that remains cool at the end of the wand to allow you to do this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it daily, and I like it more and more.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and does not leave my hair brittle.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in the super humid south.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 10 times better than our older one.</li>
            <li> Though, a regular curling iron works much better and has more area to work with.</li>
            <li> Combined it makes for an ok iron but as a stand alone for a flat iron it works better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the wand is too loose to get a good grip and straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have unmanageable hair most of the time so the infusion of oils on the plates creates soft, wavy curls.</li>
            <li> I docked it one star because I would have liked to see a digital temperature</li>
            <li> The flat iron worked perfectly and did what is expected of it.</li>
            <li> Here is the review right from the person who has been using the straightener for three weeks: &amp;</li>
            <li> and she ordered right away ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty but very flimsy.</li>
            <li> They work amazingly well, the effects last a long time, and my hair is shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, its a basic flat iron and made for a great gift.  </li>
            <li> I received my first curling iron through the Amazon Vine and loved it so much that I purchased these other two tools!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine ever needing to use a higher heat setting than what we used today (15 out of 30).  </li>
            <li> could go on and on about the tangle-free cord and how pretty it is...</li>
            <li> It straightened my hair okay, but it left it frizzier than my preferred straightener.</li>
            <li> I love that it curls too with the heat on the outside</li>
            <li> After using it, I can&#x27;t say I understand how exactly this works.  </li>
            <li> was the first thing I noticed</li>
            <li> Now I have no idea if I am setting the temperate too hot.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting that the hot metal part is on both sides of the wand, although if your hair is between the wand, how is the outside metal plate doing anything?</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand exactly HOW the plates are infused with these oils.  </li>
            <li> However at no time was my hair as pretty as the picture on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> did feel funny</li>
            <li> Not as hot as some of the higher dollar brands, but enough heat to safely style as you like.</li>
            <li> both this and the curling iron keep hair looking smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> use the curling iron you have to affix the curler part but you cant do that when it is hot, so you are not saving any time.  </li>
            <li> is my first straightener so it has been a bit of a learning experience.  </li>
            <li> iron gets extremely hot.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still plenty hot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the first curling iron for almost a year now</li>
            <li> #34;I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> The flat iron itself is just okay.</li>
            <li> The effectiveness of the oils is debatable, but if you&#x27;re looking for an alternative to some of the more expensive straighteners, this is a good option.</li>
            <li> I tried mine for the first time yesterday, and it performed very well.</li>
            <li> My hair is super straight and fine so the temps on this go high enough.</li>
            <li> thought it was very ingenious to to have hot iron plates on the outside of the flat iron to help with curling your hair.  </li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t like the plates at all: it felt like my hair was being pulled more, as if my hair was dry like hay.</li>
            <li> The guard are easy to remove and put back on.</li>
            <li> , the little grippers slip off when using and the outside of the barrel that&#x27;s supposed to give nice, bouncy curls barely gets warm, I could touch it with my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I used this the same way I use my favorite iron, keeping it in motion, more or less.  </li>
            <li> ; actually means, but the plates slide smoothly through the hair</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, and doesn&#x27;t fry your hair.</li>
            <li> did both straighten and curl like it was suppose to just not as much as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> It has an automatic shut off system that I really like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been careful with the temps, making sure to use protective products, etc.</li>
            <li> It also makes our hair very silky &amp; shiney &amp; we don&#x27;t even have to use any heat protection spray.</li>
            <li> I found the curling wand doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> daughters really like this model a lot, so</li>
            <li> The kids have much thicker hair</li>
            <li> I really like the Revlon straight irons.  </li>
            <li> This appealed to me as I use both a curling iron and a straight iron after I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> Straight iron to defrizz and the curling iron to give it some body that I just stripped</li>
            <li> so of course she wants to straighten it.</li>
            <li> The plates seem smooth enough and do glide through hair...</li>
            <li> This Revlon straightener uses the same highly popular ingredients currently touted by the hair care industry everywhere</li>
            <li> The plates are very smooth and glide nicely over my hair but aren&#x27;t any different than my other flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I am reluctant to use new hair products or devices having found that the combination of Kronos shampoo, Fancifull temporary hair color, and a hot brush takes the anguish out of a.m. hair prep.  </li>
            <li> flat iron does a fantastic job smoothing out and curling my hair.  </li>
            <li> little experimentation over a week resulted in a more than satisfactory end result--hot brush first, then, once dry, this tool to further smooth and bend my hair at just the right level to give it some fullness (i.e. no Morticia look).  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s multiple heat levels based on preference and hair type, and it heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> Works great for my thick hair!!</li>
            <li> I have one of the high end brands that I use in conjunction with the hair oil straightening sprays</li>
            <li> So while I liked it, I would only recommend it for those with thin, fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li> We only tried a little bit of curling, but that seemed to be fairly effective, as well, although she&#x27;ll probably just use the curling part to get her bangs to go the direction she wants and to curl the ends</li>
            <li> Not only is it pretty, but it makes my hair look much thicker and wavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I normally just turn it all the way up.</li>
            <li> I would say it would be good for those who have thin to medium hair and don&#x27;t wish to spend a lot of money on a styling tool.  </li>
            <li> you can also use this as a curling iron not hard at all.</li>
            <li> It is such a nice looking flat iron, why not put the digital temperature read out on it?  </li>
            <li> and you can get down to the roots easily,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get that feeling with my other two straighteners; they run smoothly through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> --I need a new perm for curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will update my review if I have new information to add.</li>
            <li> my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron aspect is fine for adding some curl but nothing beyond average to note.</li>
            <li> From the description, I expected something spectacular but it worked about as well as other straighteners that I have.</li>
            <li> Most of the time you have a hair straightener and a curling iron cluttering up one of those small bathroom drawers.  </li>
            <li> but as far as straightening her hair &amp; mine, it does wonders!</li>
            <li> but they have all left a positive impression on me.  </li>
            <li> She has long, not thick or not thin hair just normal</li>
            <li> do not say, I do not notice any difference with the triple Oil Infused plates, there is probably some benefit to this, but I do not see or feel the difference than my old straighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but like I said, the digital model I have is much simpler for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it i introuduced it to one person with verrrrry thick curly and corse hair</li>
            <li> straightener tends to dry out hair and doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot</li>
            <li> It took me about 2 extra passes per section than it takes me with my high end brand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a few weeks now and some of the comments I&#x27;ve read are true.  </li>
            <li> They certainly aren&#x27;t the most expensive you can invest in</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter wanted a new flat iron for Christmas</li>
            <li> ; (aka more expensive) straight irons.  </li>
            <li> Well, I no longer use the more expensive irons because I prefer the Revlon straight irons</li>
            <li> I normally like to set the heat on my flat iron to 390 degrees</li>
            <li> The guild in the directions: 1-6 fine; 7-14 wavy; 15-22 thick &amp; 23-30 coarse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> curling iron part is adequate for my hair, but the plates for the curling iron part will only heat up if you lock the flat iron closed.  </li>
            <li> Instead of temperature indications, there are number ranges:  1-6 for fine hair, 7-14 for wavy, 15-22 for thick, and 23-30 for coarse, hard-to-style hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s average for me, but they really do like it</li>
            <li> My wife has long, naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> This was hot enough that the hair burns your hand a little after each section is straightened.</li>
            <li> One really cool feature of this is that when you&#x27;re not using it, there is a little switch on the bottom that you can turn and it will hold the plates closed together for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One less step is always appreciated right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no reservoir in which these oils are kept, and the only indication that something different might be going on, is that the straightener gives off a little smoke when it is first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty basic and doesn&#x27;t do much to tame fly-aways.</li>
            <li> and I am so irritated because the whole things still works just not that little piece.</li>
            <li> They glided through my hair nicely without leaving that initial root crimp that can sometimes happen with the other lesser expensive</li>
            <li> In both cases, the straightening effects and curling effects do not last as long as with more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I prefer the flat irons that use the digital controls because I find them easier to get to the temperature I use for</li>
            <li> It’s pretty hard to do anything with it.  </li>
            <li> We tried it from both angles for a curling iron and a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned dozens of flat irons in every price range.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t attest to the oil infused flat irons.</li>
            <li> Those of you with similar hair will appreciate how the disposition of just a few hairs can change your look for better or worse.  </li>
            <li> This straightener is thinner than others, so you can straighten your hair clear down to the roots.</li>
            <li> I used this several times and didn&#x27;t notice anything different than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I alternate between using these and a couple other tools depending on how I&#x27;m styling my hair so they don&#x27;t all get weekly use but have been used numerous times since I&#x27;ve owned them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However that said, my daughter who has medium thick straight hair and my friend who has coarse curly hair both said that it worked below average for them as it didn&#x27;t last no matter what temperatures they tried.  </li>
            <li> I have really long, curly, frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I also did not find any information in the packaging or on the Revlon product website about how long the oil was expected to last on the plates.  </li>
            <li> This one wasn&#x27;t bad, but I have used better ones that cost around the same price.</li>
            <li> had to use this at least 3 times on a section of hair to get my hair as straight and frizz less than my current iron.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think it works just as well as the high priced salon straighteners - at least for my hair.</li>
            <li> a bit of a joke, she convinced her dad to straighten his very thick, coarse, curly beard, and with minimal effort, that went straight as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an average flat iron that is also designed for use as a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy, curly, and straight hair.  </li>
            <li> hair is very thick, course and  very frizzy (living in SC</li>
            <li> my previous flat iron i had for 8 years and was faithful to it</li>
            <li> I only use a straightener to tame fly-aways and/or bed head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what it means when it claims that the plates are infused with oils because I didn&#x27;t notice a different between them and plates that I have on other straighteners.</li>
            <li> This straightener worked as well as other straighteners/flat irons that I have used.  </li>
            <li> daughter reports that this device straightens as well as other straighteners she has used, and that it curls as well as a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> so I am no stranger to straighteners and other hair</li>
            <li> but I hold the iron in one hand and press it together on the end with my other hand.  </li>
            <li> It can be a little loose to hold hair in</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this straightener/curler! I have unmanageable hair most of the time so the infusion of oils on the plates creates soft, wavy curls. I&#x27;ve had many a straightener and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this item for Christmas, so after researching various models I went ahead and got it for her.  We both have thick, wavy hair that tends towards flyaways and frizz.  We tried this out on her hair and were very pleased with the results - with the heat setting at 15 (about halfway up), she had beautifully smoothed and straight hair with just one pass.  We only tried a little bit of curling, but that seemed to be fairly effective, as well, although she&#x27;ll probably just use the curling part to get her bangs to go the direction she wants and to curl the ends under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bit of a joke, she convinced her dad to straighten his very thick, coarse, curly beard, and with minimal effort, that went straight as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m skeptical about what &amp;#34;oil infused&amp;#34; actually means, but the plates slide smoothly through the hair, it&#x27;s easy to get almost all the way to the roots of the hair, and the results are great.  I can&#x27;t imagine ever needing to use a higher heat setting than what we used today (15 out of 30).  Color me impressed - I&#x27;ll probably be stealing this one out of her bathroom any time I want to do some smoothing and straightening.</li>
            <li> Love this straightener! Love the handle color too. This straightener is thinner than others, so you can straighten your hair clear down to the roots. Heats up fast, and doesn&#x27;t fry your hair. I&#x27;ve used it daily, and I like it more and more.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine hair, I  found that it worked just as good as the higher priced ceramic iron that my daughter paid almost $100  for. However that said, my daughter who has medium thick straight hair and my friend who has coarse curly hair both said that it worked below average for them as it didn&#x27;t last no matter what temperatures they tried.  As for the oil infused aspect of this curling iron, everyone agreed that there was nothing noticeable that they could see that made this stand out from the ones they had that did not have this feature. So If you have babyfine hair like me you will like that it does a good job and you can get down to the roots easily, the plates that go from straight to curly are easily changed out, it is inexpensive and it does the job! Why spend more if you don&#x27;t need to? I gave it 3 stars as I averaged 5 stars for my fine hair and the 1 and 2 stars my daughter and friend rated it for their hair types. So while I liked it, I would only recommend it for those with thin, fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I have never had a Revlon curling iron before, but am certainly glad I got this one. Not only is it pretty, but it makes my hair look much thicker and wavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is very short, I don&#x27;t need the straightener. I got it solely for the curler...and to see what the fusion was all about. Truthfully, I don&#x27;t know much about those oils mentioned in their ads, but I do know it&#x27;s not damaging my hair. My hair actually feels silky and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on about the tangle-free cord and how pretty it is...bright turquoise shade... but it&#x27;s enough to know I love, love, love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review by Betty Dravis, June 15, 2014&lt;br /&gt;Author of &amp;#34;The Snack,&amp;#34; in production for a short-film</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with this straightener. I have really long, curly, frizzy hair so I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different straighteners to try and tame it. This one wasn&#x27;t bad, but I have used better ones that cost around the same price. I&#x27;m not really sure what it means when it claims that the plates are infused with oils because I didn&#x27;t notice a different between them and plates that I have on other straighteners. One really cool feature of this is that when you&#x27;re not using it, there is a little switch on the bottom that you can turn and it will hold the plates closed together for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t feel like this straightener did that great of a job. It straightened my hair okay, but it left it frizzier than my preferred straightener.</li>
            <li> The Revlon Nutrifusion Triple Oil Straightner is a hair straightener that has multiple settings (30!), is &#x27;infused with oils&#x27; somehow (not sure how this works) and is the latest/greatest from Revlon.  Having said that, its a basic flat iron and made for a great gift.  Here is the review right from the person who has been using the straightener for three weeks: &amp;#34;I love this flat iron.  It also serves as a curling iron, which is great having two options in one unit.  It heats up quickly and does not leave my hair brittle.  I also like the heat guards which are detacable.  The bright color is an added bonus.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in, 5 star...doesn&#x27;t walk the dog, do laundry or shop for you, but is a good iron that works well!</li>
            <li> I think this did everything it can do but I have crummy hair! lol or maybe I don&#x27;t know how to get the most out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did both straighten and curl like it was suppose to just not as much as I&#x27;d like--I need a new perm for curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d think for the price it would be a good thing to have. I need to experiment some more with it!</li>
            <li> I am used to using Remington Pearl and my TS-2 Millennium straighteners. When I got this to try out, I was excited because I could use it more to curl my hair. However, I didn&#x27;t like the plates at all: it felt like my hair was being pulled more, as if my hair was dry like hay. I don&#x27;t get that feeling with my other two straighteners; they run smoothly through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t like this one, didn&#x27;t work for my fine, colored hair.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with the hot-curling iron. It works as well as my 50$ straightener. I love that it curls too with the heat on the outside the curls come out really nice. The guard are easy to remove and put back on. There is a style setting guide but I normally just turn it all the way up. This was hot enough that the hair burns your hand a little after each section is straightened. The dials are all on the side, most straighteners you have to put your fingers in between the clamps to change settings or turn it off. It has an automatic shut off system that I really like. I always forget to turn off my straighter. Over all I am very happy with this one:}  UPDATE!!!  This broke after a couple of months. The on off button broke and I am so irritated because the whole things still works just not that little piece.</li>
            <li> The Revlon Nutrifusion Triple Oil Infused Straightener is an attractive, easy-to-use styling device that comes with easy-to-understand instructions.  The thing that makes this straightener different from others is the claim that it infuses the user&#x27;s hair with Moringa, Macadamia and Argan oils.  After using it, I can&#x27;t say I understand how exactly this works.  There is no reservoir in which these oils are kept, and the only indication that something different might be going on, is that the straightener gives off a little smoke when it is first activated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat settings can be adjusted by a small dial on the side.  Instead of temperature indications, there are number ranges:  1-6 for fine hair, 7-14 for wavy, 15-22 for thick, and 23-30 for coarse, hard-to-style hair.  I think it would&#x27;ve been nice if somewhere in the instructions, there was a temperature equivalent for these settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Revlon Nutrifusion Triple Oil Infused Straightener can be used to both straighten and curl.  To use as a straightener, keep the removable black  safety plates in place.  To curl, slide the safety plates off.  In both cases, the straightening effects and curling effects do not last as long as with more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the straightener is a good buy for the price.  The effectiveness of the oils is debatable, but if you&#x27;re looking for an alternative to some of the more expensive straighteners, this is a good option.</li>
            <li> Great Flat Iron and very smart design.  I docked it one star because I would have liked to see a digital temperature readout.&lt;br /&gt;This was the first thing I noticed and I was disappointing right a way.  It is such a nice looking flat iron, why not put the digital temperature read out on it?  I normally like to set the heat on my flat iron to 390 degrees but this only had numbers ranging from 1-30 (30 being coarse hair). Now I have no idea if I am setting the temperate too hot.  The guild in the directions: 1-6 fine; 7-14 wavy; 15-22 thick &amp; 23-30 coarse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was very ingenious to to have hot iron plates on the outside of the flat iron to help with curling your hair.  I was able to slide the plates on and off easily while the iron was on hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron does a fantastic job smoothing out and curling my hair.  Overall very happy with the product and the very smart design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is very beautiful and it fits in my hand well.  It has a nice weight to it and the cord is a great length.&lt;br /&gt;I do not say, I do not notice any difference with the triple Oil Infused plates, there is probably some benefit to this, but I do not see or feel the difference than my old straighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am mystified by the claims of all the miracle oils in this because where are they? They don&#x27;t squeeze out when you use it. It can&#x27;t be refilled. When I shake it, I don&#x27;t hear any liquid inside. Where are these three oils? My husband thinks maybe that&#x27;s what is heating up inside the wand, but how would that impact your hair at all? And why would you need three? The 30 heat settings is just a dial you can rotate for hotter, hotter or hotter. It&#x27;s interesting that the hot metal part is on both sides of the wand, although if your hair is between the wand, how is the outside metal plate doing anything? I guess maybe if you twist the wand like a curling iron, some of your hair will wrap itself all the way around. I used this several times and didn&#x27;t notice anything different than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I have long thick Italian hair that I need to straighten at least 3 days a week.  I have one of the high end brands that I use in conjunction with the hair oil straightening sprays so I was intrigued with the idea of a straightener that was infused with the oil already!  One less step is always appreciated right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron straightens fine.  It took me about 2 extra passes per section than it takes me with my high end brand.  The plates are nice and smooth (I guess because of the infused oils).  They glided through my hair nicely without leaving that initial root crimp that can sometimes happen with the other lesser expensive brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand exactly HOW the plates are infused with these oils.  Obviously there is no way to refill them.  I also did not find any information in the packaging or on the Revlon product website about how long the oil was expected to last on the plates.  I tried calling the only customer service number for the product which is for their distributor, Helen of Troy (1-800-487-7273) but was on hold for 10 minutes before giving up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron feature didn&#x27;t work well for me.  As I mentioned I have really thick hair and the guide combs were just not effective in getting any heat to my wrapped hair.  I removed the guide combs and it was better but the curls were out of hair in less than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Oil Infused product seems like a good concept.  I would say it would be good for those who have thin to medium hair and don&#x27;t wish to spend a lot of money on a styling tool.  My feeling though is, with the product only having a one year warranty and not knowing how long the oil on the plates will last, why not invest in a higher end straightener that you know will be quality and last for a few years?</li>
            <li> We tried it from both angles for a curling iron and a flat iron. The flat iron worked perfectly and did what is expected of it. The curling iron part was disappointing was not uniform in the heating. It also a little complicated in that it had to remain locked in order to heat up the curler part. Combined it makes for an ok iron but as a stand alone for a flat iron it works better.</li>
            <li> From the description, I expected something spectacular but it worked about as well as other straighteners that I have. If anything, it made my hair a little too flyaway. Not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> This straightener worked as well as other straighteners/flat irons that I have used.  The plates are very smooth and glide nicely over my hair but aren&#x27;t any different than my other flat iron.  I have very fine hair that tends to get frizzy after drying it and I thought the &amp;#34;oil infused&amp;#34; feature would help with that.  I had no idea what oil infused means and after receiving the product I still have no idea.  There is nothing in the packaging materials that explain it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron part is adequate for my hair, but the plates for the curling iron part will only heat up if you lock the flat iron closed.  So, you cannot easily switch from straightening to curling.  It&#x27;s true that the curling plates don&#x27;t get very hot, but for my fine hair, they work ok.</li>
            <li> The straightener is great! I think it works just as well as the high priced salon straighteners - at least for my hair. There&#x27;s multiple heat levels based on preference and hair type, and it heats up quickly. It also has rounded edges for someone who is looking to use the straightener as a curler as well. Overall a great product for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Most of the time you have a hair straightener and a curling iron cluttering up one of those small bathroom drawers.  This unit does both jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter reports that this device straightens as well as other straighteners she has used, and that it curls as well as a curling iron.  She now uses this all the time.  It heats quickly, is comfortable in your hand, and does a great job.  What more can I say...buy this item and all of your wildest hair straightening and curling dreams can come true :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars.</li>
            <li> Works great for my thick hair!!</li>
            <li> I am reluctant to use new hair products or devices having found that the combination of Kronos shampoo, Fancifull temporary hair color, and a hot brush takes the anguish out of a.m. hair prep.  Nevertheless, age and menopause have added unfortunate waves to thin and fine, so I gave this straightener a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little experimentation over a week resulted in a more than satisfactory end result--hot brush first, then, once dry, this tool to further smooth and bend my hair at just the right level to give it some fullness (i.e. no Morticia look).  Those of you with similar hair will appreciate how the disposition of just a few hairs can change your look for better or worse.  In this case, the smooth and bend strategy on the top layer gives the illusion that there&#x27;s fullness to this head of hair when, in fact, there is not.  Plus it completes the shine that Fancifull begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned dozens of flat irons in every price range.  I have very thick, curly hair.  I&#x27;ve always been careful with the temps, making sure to use protective products, etc. and have never had a problem.  After I used this product once on a low temp, my hair became extremely flat with a weird texture, almost like there was wax on it.  I tried washing, clarifying, treatments and none of it helped.  I finally went to my hair stylist and she said it felt like my hair had been damaged or that candle wax had been infused into it.  She&#x27;s been cutting my hair for 17 years, so she knows my hair.  She was shocked that everywhere I used this flat iron, my curls apoeared to be permanently removed.  I also have a ton of static even though it&#x27;s mid-summer and I&#x27;m in the super humid south.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what is being infused into your hair when using this thing, but it&#x27;s not good.  The only thing that has recovered my hair st all is 100% air drying, no products, soaking it in aloe, organic coconut oil and egg yolk treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the little grippers slip off when using and the outside of the barrel that&#x27;s supposed to give nice, bouncy curls barely gets warm, I could touch it with my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was wondering how they handled this conditioner infusion.  What do you do?  Fill in the top?  Does it come out a little at a time?  And Argan?  Why Macadamia?  What is Moring?  Is that good for your hair?  Why do we think that?  Are we sure?  Should moisturizers be applied with that kind of heat?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I used this the same way I use my favorite iron, keeping it in motion, more or less.  I have very thick wavy, curly, and straight hair.  It’s pretty hard to do anything with it.  Straightening it makes it more manageable.  However at no time was my hair as pretty as the picture on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did feel funny but I couldn’t figure out what it was.  Was it like the wax on grocery store apples?  I did not like the sensation.</li>
            <li> I tried mine for the first time yesterday, and it performed very well. Not as hot as some of the higher dollar brands, but enough heat to safely style as you like. Definite buy.</li>
            <li> I Bought this along with the curling iron and use both very awesome for folks with the frizzy curly course hair that does not like humity. both this and the curling iron keep hair looking smooth and soft. you can also use this as a curling iron not hard at all.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter wanted a new flat iron for Christmas so this is the one I purchased...thinking she could curl her hair or straighten her hair. She has long, not thick or not thin hair just normal I guess u would say. She couldn&#x27;t ever figure out how to curl it but as far as straightening her hair &amp; mine, it does wonders!! 10 times better than our older one. It also makes our hair very silky &amp; shiney &amp; we don&#x27;t even have to use any heat protection spray. We LOVE it!! Just wish we could get it to curl her hair...maybe we should watch a YouTube video?! I would recommend this to anyone that is looking a good straightener!!</li>
            <li> Love it i introuduced it to one person with verrrrry thick curly and corse hair and she wanted mine then i introduced it to some one with thinner more straight hair and she ordered right away ...im mixed so i have very long thick curly hair my previous flat iron i had for 8 years and was faithful to it this was my second and i was sketic but i trust revlon and after this product im a faithful believer they wont let me down</li>
            <li> I found the curling wand doesn&#x27;t work very well. It&#x27;s like the wand is too loose to get a good grip and straighten my hair. It&#x27;s very pretty but very flimsy. I got it as a gift and am very glad I didn&#x27;t spend any money on it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this straightener/curler. Looks like I&#x27;m going to have to keep looking for a good 2 in 1.</li>
            <li> This is an average flat iron that is also designed for use as a curling iron. It works fine but I prefer the flat irons that use the digital controls because I find them easier to get to the temperature I use for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron aspect is fine for adding some curl but nothing beyond average to note. This is easy to use and is designed well but like I said, the digital model I have is much simpler for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughters really like this model a lot, so it&#x27;s average for me, but they really do like it so maybe this is better suited for teens. My hair is super straight and fine so the temps on this go high enough. The kids have much thicker hair and it seems to be straightening their hair well. There are not a lot of bells and whistles on this, it&#x27;s simple to use and designed well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t attest to the oil infused flat irons. I think it&#x27;s rather gimmicky but again, the teens think there is something to it.</li>
            <li> I really like the Revlon straight irons.  Before owning the Revlon products, I only bought the &amp;#34;higher-end&amp;#34; (aka more expensive) straight irons.  Well, I no longer use the more expensive irons because I prefer the Revlon straight irons instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer my hair straight--rather than curly--so I didn&#x27;t try the curling option for this product.  I loved the straightening mechanism.  The conditioner was a nice feature, but I still continue using the conditioning products that I always use.  It acts as a nice addition but probably doesn&#x27;t replace any products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the conditioner can be replaced once it is used.  But I don&#x27;t see the conditioner as being an important part of the product.  And if I&#x27;m wrong, then I can buy a new one for less than $30.</li>
            <li> My sister and I both used this iron and had completely different results.  She thought it was 4 stars and I thought it was 2 stars, hence the 3+ star rating.&lt;br /&gt;The product is called a conditioning straightener but it is also a curling iron too.  This appealed to me as I use both a curling iron and a straight iron after I wash my hair.  Straight iron to defrizz and the curling iron to give it some body that I just stripped away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very thick, course and  very frizzy (living in SC doesn&#x27;t help).&lt;br /&gt;I had to use this at least 3 times on a section of hair to get my hair as straight and frizz less than my current iron.&lt;br /&gt;I could not tell if it was infused with conditioner or not, it didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference on my hair.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;To use the curling iron you have to affix the curler part but you cant do that when it is hot, so you are not saving any time.  It is actually more time consuming than plugging in two separate products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister has wavy, non frizzy almost perfect hair (yes, you can hate her too)&lt;br /&gt;She used it once through every hair section and it came out beautiful and it also shined with the infused conditioner.  I saw the difference too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I think if you have the right type of hair this product will be great for you, but for us hair challenged gals, we need something stronger.  It would also be great for a dorm room or anywhere you don&#x27;t have a lot of bathroom space as it is 2 different products in one.</li>
            <li> My wife has long, naturally curly hair so of course she wants to straighten it. I also have a daughter who just turned 20...so I am no stranger to straighteners and other hair implements laying about.  The one that is used the most is made by Chi.  This Revlon straightener uses the same highly popular ingredients currently touted by the hair care industry everywhere you look...Moringa, Argan &amp; Macadamia.  The idea is that the infused plates will nourish and help hair during the straightening process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I sort of can&#x27;t get past how plates on a straightener can be infused with this blend of oils.  The plates seem smooth enough and do glide through hair...but this straightener just doesn&#x27;t stack up to a more expensive model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightener tends to dry out hair and doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am skeptical of the infused with oils claim and this unit is not up to par with some of the other irons we have.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight, fine hair. I only use a straightener to tame fly-aways and/or bed head. So, I don&#x27;t buy expensive brands. This is a nice idea, being a straightener and curling iron-in-one. Though, a regular curling iron works much better and has more area to work with. I do appreciate the plastic protective sleeves that snap on when not using the curling iron. The flat iron itself is just okay. The &amp;#34;triple oil infused&amp;#34; is misleading - no, there isn&#x27;t anything special about this straightener. You get what you pay for. It&#x27;s pretty basic and doesn&#x27;t do much to tame fly-aways.</li>
            <li> This straightener is my third hair tool in the &amp;#34;Nutrifusion&amp;#34; line.  I have two curling irons as well and I love the results that they give me.  They work amazingly well, the effects last a long time, and my hair is shiny and healthy looking.  I received my first curling iron through the Amazon Vine and loved it so much that I purchased these other two tools!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first straightener so it has been a bit of a learning experience.  I&#x27;ve had it a few weeks now and some of the comments I&#x27;ve read are true.  It can be a little loose to hold hair in but I hold the iron in one hand and press it together on the end with my other hand.  There is a tip that remains cool at the end of the wand to allow you to do this.  It helps to roll your hair over the curling part this way too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My iron gets extremely hot.  I&#x27;ve turned it down to half the max (15) and it&#x27;s still plenty hot.  I believe that you could brand cattle with it on max!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how they infuse the oils in these tools but they have all left a positive impression on me.  I&#x27;ve had the first curling iron for almost a year now and it&#x27;s still performing well.  I alternate between using these and a couple other tools depending on how I&#x27;m styling my hair so they don&#x27;t all get weekly use but have been used numerous times since I&#x27;ve owned them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is shoulder length, medium to fine, and wavy/curly so it always requires some styling tool.  I envy those with wash and wear hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this line and recommend you try this or another tool if you&#x27;re interested.  They certainly aren&#x27;t the most expensive you can invest in and I think they are unique in the results they give.  I will update my review if I have new information to add.</li>
            <li> Purchased from a local store.  Worked well on my fairly thick, fairly coarse hair.  Used more for curling than straightening.  But it was nice to have one product instead of two when traveling.  Problem is it stopped heating up after only 7 months.  The light would come on but no heat.  And I didn&#x27;t abuse it or even use it every day.  Very disappointed, and am on Amazon looking for a different brand.</li>
