    <ol>
            <li>I know teenagers aren&#x27;t perfect but it should have lasted a bit longer.</li>
            <li>this is perfect.</li>
            <li>This Knife(comb) is a great practice knife to use!</li>
            <li>The comb isn&#x27;t the best either.</li>
            <li>It came on time and it seemed to be all perfect, but it started to fall apart after a while.</li>
            <li>play with it and do all these awesome tricks&lt;</li>
            <li>I remember my brother saying he wanted a butterfly knife, so i got him this awesome comb for his birthday!</li>
            <li>This item is a very good beginners item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome, with great balance and weight</li>

            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>This was a great trainer.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the screws, though, the product itself is great.</li>
            <li>He really liked them!  </li>
            <li>I love it, its the best way to comb my way out of a situation! :-P</li>
            <li>Great quality good price</li>
            <li>This was a great and very cute idea, however the quality of the item is flimsy.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to people who want a good trainer and a comb.</li>
            <li>The latch is fairly l√µse and will swing around when it is spinning.</li>
            <li>I suppose it is a good life lesson for him, not to buy anything sight unseen.</li>
            <li>The comb its self is not any good.</li>
            <li>get\\&quot; but on the good side it come on time.</li>
            <li>- Safe&lt;br /&gt; - Good for kids</li>
            <li>It is a good gag comb</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a good product</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>so it wasent that good but good buy.</li>
            <li>But i would not recommend this for combing hair it is made out of metal and just doesn&#x27;t feel good in your hair.</li>
            <li>well bult, and it had a good weight.</li>
            <li>The item did not look cheap or feel cheep very good Quality.</li>
            <li>am very pleased with everything from the price, shipping &amp; product.</li>
            <li>i love it its great for practicing.</li>
            <li>Kind of a good quality tool..</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It&#x27;s and amazing comb</li>
            <li>After retightening, it keeps loosening on its own unfortuanately</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t matter which kind, price, or quality of balisong</li>
            <li>This one from True Tiger however is great.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t actually use this, but it&#x27;s the best training knife I&#x27;ve ever seen to be honest</li>
            <li>But it is cool and the metal is good but the screws need to be tightened or replaced</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>, hope you all enjoy it because i sure did!</li>
            <li>its okay.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li>I love to use it and all, BUT the problem is after using for about two days, the bolts started to loosen.</li>
            <li>so i could practice some more.</li>
            <li>Do you like being able to freshen up on the go?  </li>
            <li>There are flaws in this product, most of which aren&#x27;t fixable.</li>
            <li>At the top of the handle, the two ends meet, causing it to get stuck in a \\&quot;Y\\&quot; position when spinning.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;re safe since it doesn&#x27;t have a blade.</li>
            <li>Overall this Knife is great!</li>
            <li>I  love it</li>
            <li>I bought this comb mostly for balisong practice;  </li>
            <li>fallout/ be sure to watch my repair video:  </li>
            <li>its good for training but if you on expert or a starter you need to find something worth your money like people say \\&quot;you pay what you</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>the bite handle was the safe handle.</li>
            <li>I love my comb</li>
            <li>Fun to play with and whips good.</li>
            <li>It was perfect since he had just recently gotten his comb-over haircut!</li>
            <li>Do not buy, find a better one</li>
            <li>The all metal construction was great and very durable for the user.</li>
            <li>it has a good weight to it and the play is in fact just right.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH !!!!</li>
            <li>The handles are very cheap and easily bendable.</li>
            <li>its weighted pretty good and everything,but its screws need tightening ALOT.</li>
            <li>Played with the comb for a while, it was pretty good for 2 days.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty cheap too, so good buy.</li>
            <li>This is better than the plastic one that I received from Assisted knife that was almost a pain to flip because it was so light.</li>
            <li>Over al it&#x27;s a great trainer after it is fixed.</li>
            <li>Quality is good and shipped fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame too because the actual comb portion of it is a really good quality!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to fix, so if you&#x27;re planning on getting it</li>
            <li>and you can easily afford it</li>
            <li>The screws for the scales loosen easily and one of them fell off on mine.  </li>
            <li>The screws are an easy fix anyway, just need a 1.5 alan for &#x27;em.</li>
            <li>Strong metal comb.</li>
            <li>it was nice at first</li>
            <li>The comb works ok, not bad.</li>
            <li>It worked fine for a day</li>
            <li>The handles, both bite and safe, fell apart quite quickly.</li>
            <li>and he didn&#x27;t get to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a durable comb and great for just playing with (without using an actual knife).</li>
            <li>After it&#x27;s Dried your comb should work PERFECTLY!     </li>
            <li>The actual comb part seems to be well made, and works great as a comb.</li>
            <li>You will need a 1.5 mm Allen wrench to tighten the screws, but that will come with a cheap product.</li>
            <li>Cheap,</li>
            <li>When the screws came out, I went into my basement and found some screws that fit the hole.</li>
            <li>Would be a wonderful practice device for anyone actually considering the real knife.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i love this comb its heavy easy to fit in my pocket and works great</li>
            <li>My son was upset at how quick and easily it broke.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this trainer after waiting a couple of days for this.</li>
            <li>However, if you contact the supplier about missing parts, they&#x27;d be more than happy to supply them.</li>
            <li>i think most people are flipping it around to much its not a knife trainer as for the pain when you comb with it</li>
            <li>overall its a good buy.</li>
            <li>It is really light and fun to flip.</li>
            <li>The material is lighter than a real balisong and if you tamper with its parts, it does flow better.</li>
            <li>My son really loved this for Christmas but the scews started to back out and ended up trowing it away because of that.  </li>
            <li>Overall good comb all olluniom.</li>
            <li>it was novel idea but after mild use the handle&#x27;s outer piece detached  and it wobbled all over.</li>
            <li>&gt; - It falls apart quickly.</li>
            <li>This comb is a tad bit cheaply made, but it&#x27;s still pretty cool.</li>
            <li>The comb was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>A little light, but very nice.</li>
            <li>It fell apart on the very first day he got it.  </li>
            <li>It is quite well built ,am very satisfied especially for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the very first day of using it, (didnt drop it or anything)</li>
            <li>I bought this thing a long time ago, and I loved it when I opened it up and started flailing it</li>
            <li>..it is metal which is good butbolts become loose..</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the best for me, because I get fidgety quite a bit, so I would mess with it frequently.</li>
            <li>its nice and sturdy, plus the comb actually works pretty well!</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a great practice balisong for spinning after a few adjustments; however, if you&#x27;re looking for a comb, this isn&#x27;t the one for you.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s self is made from cheap \\&quot;Stainless</li>
            <li>Pretty cool item.</li>
            <li>During the unboxing, I thought it was pretty cool that they made a balisong into a comb.</li>
            <li>If you do, rarely do tricks with it or It&#x27;ll come apart.</li>
            <li>Still a lot of fun to play with.</li>
            <li>It is good a a practice but be careful about the screws.</li>
            <li>I thought i might as well have fun.  </li>
            <li>ITS WELL WORTH</li>
            <li>Still alot of fun</li>
            <li>Son has had fun with it.</li>
            <li>but it fell apart pretty quickly</li>
            <li>just fix it with the right tool and no problem</li>
            <li>I have the right allen wrenches.</li>
            <li>This comb looks cool and sleek and it flips really well.</li>
            <li>This was even better then I expected, the all steel comb is not only lightweight but durable, definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Transaction was good in all but the item was not worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to face my first full month without so much as a budge from the screws.</li>
            <li>However you will have to flip the handlebars of the comb to make it more proper.   </li>
            <li>Im going to be using more tri flow to lube the metal spacers, and am going to use blue loctite so the screws dont keep falling off.</li>
            <li>I have a comb that has bigger teeth than this comb and works a million times better.</li>
            <li>So overall this comb is neat for showing off :)</li>
            <li>I have a buzz cut and it is still really fun to practice with, its metal and is like my real butterfly knife</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to buy this item and mind that it will break or fall apart in a matter of hours then go for it.</li>
            <li>it flipped like a real Balisong, and I no longer had to Tighten the Screws!  </li>
            <li>[...]  {if your Prefer Reading continue below:}  You only have to do the Repair once!  </li>
            <li>First thing you need to do is remove the screws, you can use a hex screwdriver, or Mirco-screwdriver or whatever.  </li>
            <li>This was my first butterfly knife.</li>
            <li>When it first arrived It felt</li>
            <li>The handles are very unique but have solid construction.</li>
            <li>Not a bad buy for the money, and there are better trainers out there that cost significantly more, but having one that is legal does come in handy when you want to show off, and the comb blade makes it even better than a boring training blade.</li>
            <li>You should rather get a training one or a rel one if your skilled enough, or if you are in a country that has it legal.</li>
            <li>They loved their present and use it daily.  </li>
            <li>Weight is beautiful, combs like a charm (at least for my hair, which is medium-length and rather thick and oily), and very elegant design.</li>
            <li>It came later than expected, and right of the bat had a good weight to it.</li>
            <li>This is a decent little trainer, a bit on the light side, but it flips okay with some practice.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my son and it is very realistic.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to put back together</li>
            <li>As most the other reviews say The Screws come loose very easily.  </li>
            <li>out fast so tightening the screw can be a challenge.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for though and $9 doesn&#x27;t get you much.</li>
            <li>It was a gift he really wanted for his birthday</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very disapointed in Amazon as well.</li>
            <li>fell apart very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a comb, then look for a real comb.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a practice balisong, then look for a real one.    </li>
            <li>So much so that we were detained by TSA when going through an airport with it.  </li>
            <li>The screws came out and the trainer had too much play in the handles.  </li>
            <li>Buy this if you&#x27;re not going to flip it a whole bunch.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is pros to this comb, although i just opened my package 30 minutes ago the comb seems durable with 440 stainless steel and with no paint added it will maintain it&#x27;s look as time passes</li>
            <li>I really hope they&#x27;re not custom made</li>
            <li>(really, really, really, annoying)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The comb is made of metal so if you use it to really comb your hair, it would hurt your scalp if you don&#x27;t do it gently.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE IT DOESNT REALLY MATTER</li>
            <li>The material is a very flimsy metal and when I opened it the pins had already fallen out that</li>
            <li>I used to own one of these before i misplaced it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It felt very light, and it was gentle on my hands, but the comb part was sharp and</li>
            <li>This item is a great item, and it works fine, when i first opened it, the only problems i noticed was it was weighted wrong, but that wasnt much of a problem, Another issue was that is</li>
            <li>I had to tighten it so many times, but other than that it served its purpose.</li>
            <li>In the end, good product, lots of small problems that can easily be fixed in 10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>Overall if you want a cool item that can still comb your hair this item can do just that.</li>
            <li>As cool as it was for the short amount of time I had it, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>I had to file down the top of the handle to fix this.</li>
            <li>The perfect quirky gift for the guy in your life who is obsessed with his hair.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a decent buy.</li>
            <li>Mainly it was because one of my friends had brought a switchblade comb to school, and I was not one to be outdone.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had bought it for five dollars and sold it for ten, so I made a profit.  </li>
            <li>I recommend making sure that you have a 1.5mm hex key so that you can tighten all the screws on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, on time, and didn&#x27;t last 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Seriously not 10 minutes into playing with it, the screws fell out and one was lost.</li>
            <li>The screws fall of pretty easily after a couple flips but a little glue on the screws or tape of the screws</li>
            <li>High quality material and well made.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I bought this so that I could take it to my high school and show it to my friends.</li>
            <li>After his older brother received a real butterfly knife from a friend, my 10 year old son ordered this comb to play with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cool novelty item and a fun little toy, something you would expect to get when paying under $10.</li>
            <li>This item is worth buying, if only if you want to comb.</li>
            <li>Thing broke on the first day and I barely used it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely normal.</li>
            <li>But before it dry&#x27;s make sure that the screws are louse enough</li>
            <li>The handles are too close and move stiff, but you can continue to flip and eventually it will get better.</li>
            <li>i had to end up bringing it to a hardware store for some new screws, but other than that it was fine.</li>
            <li>The screws will come loose when flipping the butterfly hair comb comes for more ten 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>You can put the screws back in, but they come loose if you use it for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>this comb is cool, what i dont like about it is that the screws come loose often</li>
            <li>If you are new to balisongs this is the toy for you.</li>
            <li>First, I received the product within a couple days (literally) and had just chosen standard shipping.</li>
            <li>and not knowing this, i tried to flip it around a bit, but it instantly fell apart on the first swing.</li>
            <li>Tiny bolt fell out of handle after the first day.</li>
            <li>First I&#x27;ll start off saying that this actually came a day early, so kudos to that.</li>
            <li>the butterfly comb is very light, hard to do a Y2k or a suicide drop with.</li>
            <li>Finally the screws that hold the whole thing together get loose fairly quickly with use.</li>
            <li>Hurts if you comb too fast, or if you have thick hair, or if your hair knots easy.</li>
            <li>and the parts are small that could be lost pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I would only recommend this comb for purely novelty purposes.</li>
            <li>The latch is on the safe handle instead of the bite handle, but it isn&#x27;t that hard to get used to.</li>
            <li>This product was a huge waste of money it broke in an hour of the unboxing.</li>
            <li>This ballysong comb makes a great tool for practices tricks without cutting yourself.</li>
            <li>It is clear that the two do not go together with quality in mind at this time.</li>
            <li>latch is on the &#x27;wrong&#x27; side, the pivot pins are fairly cheap and will break off with extended use, and it wasn&#x27;t a comfortable to use as a comb.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just buy a real knife next time.</li>
            <li>I fixed it</li>
            <li>that the whole left part came off!</li>
            <li>After about a day of me playing with it constantly, it loosened up too much and fell apart.</li>
            <li>This item was purchased for my 14 year old son.  </li>
            <li>(I bought it for my 13 year old brother)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a epic comb.</li>
            <li>so I thought maybe its supposed to be like that, then it fell completely apart</li>
            <li>and I fixed it and all the screws came undone.</li>
            <li>Metal construction, not too flimsy, completely legal&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Also even though it is made of metal the weight is not the same as a real knife</li>
            <li>Overall definitely worth the ten dollars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible like, unable to be fixed or handles literally fall off right away or anything.</li>
            <li>Made with very low quality, I highly unseggest buying this item</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews on here are bad, but i feel there is an easy fix to the problem of it falling apart.</li>
            <li>I jerry-rigged some new bolts with comb teeth and electrical tape because I lost the actual screws when they came out.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect much for such a low price but</li>
            <li>After a week or two, the Butterfly Hair Comb fell apart pretty abruptly.</li>
            <li>I started flipping and mastered the basic open in about the first 15 minutes but the very next day it fell apart.  </li>
            <li>but not sharp.</li>
            <li>the screw gets loose fast and the screw also gets \\&quot;worn\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Overall, it is very heavy, I have a Jaguar balisong and it definitely weighs much more than that.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old grandson saved his chore money for several weeks to buy it.</li>
            <li>and then the screws start to come undone, but the latter could probably be fixed with a bit of thread lock.</li>
            <li>And not that anyone would wanna buy this for a comb or anything, but even if you wanted to be some kind of weird hipster</li>
            <li>When they flip back and forth, if caught at a certain angle, the two points collide with each other.     </li>
            <li>read it broke easily but ordered one and confirmed stupidly...</li>
            <li>The actual comb is made of stainless steel and has a black coat on it.</li>
            <li>and i have very thick but smooth hair.</li>

            <li> I know teenagers aren&#x27;t perfect but it should have lasted a bit longer.</li>

            <li> This Knife(comb) is a great practice knife to use!</li>
            <li> The comb isn&#x27;t the best either.</li>
            <li> It came on time and it seemed to be all perfect, but it started to fall apart after a while.</li>
            <li> play with it and do all these awesome tricks&lt;</li>
            <li> I remember my brother saying he wanted a butterfly knife, so i got him this awesome comb for his birthday!</li>

            <li> and it is a great gag gift.</li>
            <li> Great trainer, although it does have a lot of problems.</li>
            <li> Great buy.</li>
            <li> This was a great trainer.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the screws, though, the product itself is great.</li>
            <li> He really liked them!  </li>
            <li> I love it, its the best way to comb my way out of a situation! :-P</li>
            <li> Great quality good price</li>
            <li> This was a great and very cute idea, however the quality of the item is flimsy.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to people who want a good trainer and a comb.</li>
            <li> The latch is fairly l√µse and will swing around when it is spinning.</li>
            <li> I suppose it is a good life lesson for him, not to buy anything sight unseen.</li>
            <li> The comb its self is not any good.</li>
            <li> get\\&quot; but on the good side it come on time.</li>
            <li> - Safe&lt;br /&gt; - Good for kids</li>
            <li> It is a good gag comb</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a good product</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> A good buy.</li>
            <li> so it wasent that good but good buy.</li>
            <li> But i would not recommend this for combing hair it is made out of metal and just doesn&#x27;t feel good in your hair.</li>
            <li> well bult, and it had a good weight.</li>
            <li> The item did not look cheap or feel cheep very good Quality.</li>
            <li> am very pleased with everything from the price, shipping &amp; product.</li>
            <li> i love it its great for practicing.</li>
            <li> Kind of a good quality tool..</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It&#x27;s and amazing comb</li>
            <li> After retightening, it keeps loosening on its own unfortuanately</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t matter which kind, price, or quality of balisong</li>
            <li> This one from True Tiger however is great.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t actually use this, but it&#x27;s the best training knife I&#x27;ve ever seen to be honest</li>
            <li> But it is cool and the metal is good but the screws need to be tightened or replaced</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> , hope you all enjoy it because i sure did!</li>
            <li> its okay.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li> I love to use it and all, BUT the problem is after using for about two days, the bolts started to loosen.</li>
            <li> so i could practice some more.</li>
            <li> Do you like being able to freshen up on the go?  </li>
            <li> There are flaws in this product, most of which aren&#x27;t fixable.</li>
            <li> At the top of the handle, the two ends meet, causing it to get stuck in a \\&quot;Y\\&quot; position when spinning.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;re safe since it doesn&#x27;t have a blade.</li>
            <li> Overall this Knife is great!</li>
            <li> I  love it</li>
            <li> I bought this comb mostly for balisong practice;  </li>
            <li> fallout/ be sure to watch my repair video:  </li>
            <li> its good for training but if you on expert or a starter you need to find something worth your money like people say \\&quot;you pay what you</li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> the bite handle was the safe handle.</li>
            <li> I love my comb</li>
            <li> Fun to play with and whips good.</li>
            <li> It was perfect since he had just recently gotten his comb-over haircut!</li>
            <li> Do not buy, find a better one</li>
            <li> The all metal construction was great and very durable for the user.</li>
            <li> it has a good weight to it and the play is in fact just right.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH !!!!</li>
            <li> The handles are very cheap and easily bendable.</li>
            <li> its weighted pretty good and everything,but its screws need tightening ALOT.</li>
            <li> Played with the comb for a while, it was pretty good for 2 days.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty cheap too, so good buy.</li>
            <li> This is better than the plastic one that I received from Assisted knife that was almost a pain to flip because it was so light.</li>
            <li> Over al it&#x27;s a great trainer after it is fixed.</li>
            <li> Quality is good and shipped fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame too because the actual comb portion of it is a really good quality!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to fix, so if you&#x27;re planning on getting it</li>
            <li> and you can easily afford it</li>
            <li> The screws for the scales loosen easily and one of them fell off on mine.  </li>
            <li> The screws are an easy fix anyway, just need a 1.5 alan for &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> Strong metal comb.</li>
            <li> it was nice at first</li>
            <li> The comb works ok, not bad.</li>
            <li> It worked fine for a day</li>
            <li> The handles, both bite and safe, fell apart quite quickly.</li>
            <li> and he didn&#x27;t get to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a durable comb and great for just playing with (without using an actual knife).</li>
            <li> After it&#x27;s Dried your comb should work PERFECTLY!     </li>
            <li> The actual comb part seems to be well made, and works great as a comb.</li>
            <li> You will need a 1.5 mm Allen wrench to tighten the screws, but that will come with a cheap product.</li>
            <li> Cheap,</li>
            <li> When the screws came out, I went into my basement and found some screws that fit the hole.</li>
            <li> Would be a wonderful practice device for anyone actually considering the real knife.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i love this comb its heavy easy to fit in my pocket and works great</li>
            <li> My son was upset at how quick and easily it broke.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this trainer after waiting a couple of days for this.</li>
            <li> However, if you contact the supplier about missing parts, they&#x27;d be more than happy to supply them.</li>
            <li> i think most people are flipping it around to much its not a knife trainer as for the pain when you comb with it</li>
            <li> overall its a good buy.</li>
            <li> It is really light and fun to flip.</li>
            <li> The material is lighter than a real balisong and if you tamper with its parts, it does flow better.</li>
            <li> My son really loved this for Christmas but the scews started to back out and ended up trowing it away because of that.  </li>
            <li> Overall good comb all olluniom.</li>
            <li> it was novel idea but after mild use the handle&#x27;s outer piece detached  and it wobbled all over.</li>
            <li> &gt; - It falls apart quickly.</li>
            <li> This comb is a tad bit cheaply made, but it&#x27;s still pretty cool.</li>
            <li> The comb was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> A little light, but very nice.</li>
            <li> It fell apart on the very first day he got it.  </li>
            <li> It is quite well built ,am very satisfied especially for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the very first day of using it, (didnt drop it or anything)</li>
            <li> I bought this thing a long time ago, and I loved it when I opened it up and started flailing it</li>
            <li> ..it is metal which is good butbolts become loose..</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the best for me, because I get fidgety quite a bit, so I would mess with it frequently.</li>
            <li> its nice and sturdy, plus the comb actually works pretty well!</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a great practice balisong for spinning after a few adjustments; however, if you&#x27;re looking for a comb, this isn&#x27;t the one for you.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s self is made from cheap \\&quot;Stainless</li>
            <li> Pretty cool item.</li>
            <li> During the unboxing, I thought it was pretty cool that they made a balisong into a comb.</li>
            <li> If you do, rarely do tricks with it or It&#x27;ll come apart.</li>
            <li> Still a lot of fun to play with.</li>
            <li> It is good a a practice but be careful about the screws.</li>
            <li> I thought i might as well have fun.  </li>
            <li> ITS WELL WORTH</li>
            <li> Still alot of fun</li>
            <li> Son has had fun with it.</li>
            <li> but it fell apart pretty quickly</li>
            <li> just fix it with the right tool and no problem</li>
            <li> I have the right allen wrenches.</li>
            <li> This comb looks cool and sleek and it flips really well.</li>
            <li> This was even better then I expected, the all steel comb is not only lightweight but durable, definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Transaction was good in all but the item was not worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to face my first full month without so much as a budge from the screws.</li>
            <li> However you will have to flip the handlebars of the comb to make it more proper.   </li>
            <li> Im going to be using more tri flow to lube the metal spacers, and am going to use blue loctite so the screws dont keep falling off.</li>
            <li> I have a comb that has bigger teeth than this comb and works a million times better.</li>
            <li> So overall this comb is neat for showing off :)</li>
            <li> I have a buzz cut and it is still really fun to practice with, its metal and is like my real butterfly knife</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to buy this item and mind that it will break or fall apart in a matter of hours then go for it.</li>
            <li> it flipped like a real Balisong, and I no longer had to Tighten the Screws!  </li>
            <li> [...]  {if your Prefer Reading continue below:}  You only have to do the Repair once!  </li>
            <li> First thing you need to do is remove the screws, you can use a hex screwdriver, or Mirco-screwdriver or whatever.  </li>
            <li> This was my first butterfly knife.</li>
            <li> When it first arrived It felt</li>
            <li> The handles are very unique but have solid construction.</li>
            <li> Not a bad buy for the money, and there are better trainers out there that cost significantly more, but having one that is legal does come in handy when you want to show off, and the comb blade makes it even better than a boring training blade.</li>
            <li> You should rather get a training one or a rel one if your skilled enough, or if you are in a country that has it legal.</li>
            <li> They loved their present and use it daily.  </li>
            <li> Weight is beautiful, combs like a charm (at least for my hair, which is medium-length and rather thick and oily), and very elegant design.</li>
            <li> It came later than expected, and right of the bat had a good weight to it.</li>
            <li> This is a decent little trainer, a bit on the light side, but it flips okay with some practice.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and it is very realistic.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to put back together</li>
            <li> As most the other reviews say The Screws come loose very easily.  </li>
            <li> out fast so tightening the screw can be a challenge.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for though and $9 doesn&#x27;t get you much.</li>
            <li> It was a gift he really wanted for his birthday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disapointed in Amazon as well.</li>
            <li> fell apart very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a comb, then look for a real comb.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a practice balisong, then look for a real one.    </li>
            <li> So much so that we were detained by TSA when going through an airport with it.  </li>
            <li> The screws came out and the trainer had too much play in the handles.  </li>
            <li> Buy this if you&#x27;re not going to flip it a whole bunch.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is pros to this comb, although i just opened my package 30 minutes ago the comb seems durable with 440 stainless steel and with no paint added it will maintain it&#x27;s look as time passes</li>
            <li> I really hope they&#x27;re not custom made</li>
            <li> (really, really, really, annoying)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The comb is made of metal so if you use it to really comb your hair, it would hurt your scalp if you don&#x27;t do it gently.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE IT DOESNT REALLY MATTER</li>
            <li> The material is a very flimsy metal and when I opened it the pins had already fallen out that</li>
            <li> I used to own one of these before i misplaced it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It felt very light, and it was gentle on my hands, but the comb part was sharp and</li>
            <li> This item is a great item, and it works fine, when i first opened it, the only problems i noticed was it was weighted wrong, but that wasnt much of a problem, Another issue was that is</li>
            <li> I had to tighten it so many times, but other than that it served its purpose.</li>
            <li> In the end, good product, lots of small problems that can easily be fixed in 10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> Overall if you want a cool item that can still comb your hair this item can do just that.</li>
            <li> As cool as it was for the short amount of time I had it, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I had to file down the top of the handle to fix this.</li>
            <li> The perfect quirky gift for the guy in your life who is obsessed with his hair.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a decent buy.</li>
            <li> Mainly it was because one of my friends had brought a switchblade comb to school, and I was not one to be outdone.</li>
            <li> Luckily I had bought it for five dollars and sold it for ten, so I made a profit.  </li>
            <li> I recommend making sure that you have a 1.5mm hex key so that you can tighten all the screws on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, on time, and didn&#x27;t last 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Seriously not 10 minutes into playing with it, the screws fell out and one was lost.</li>
            <li> The screws fall of pretty easily after a couple flips but a little glue on the screws or tape of the screws</li>
            <li> High quality material and well made.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I bought this so that I could take it to my high school and show it to my friends.</li>
            <li> After his older brother received a real butterfly knife from a friend, my 10 year old son ordered this comb to play with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cool novelty item and a fun little toy, something you would expect to get when paying under $10.</li>
            <li> This item is worth buying, if only if you want to comb.</li>
            <li> Thing broke on the first day and I barely used it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely normal.</li>
            <li> But before it dry&#x27;s make sure that the screws are louse enough</li>
            <li> The handles are too close and move stiff, but you can continue to flip and eventually it will get better.</li>
            <li> i had to end up bringing it to a hardware store for some new screws, but other than that it was fine.</li>
            <li> The screws will come loose when flipping the butterfly hair comb comes for more ten 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> You can put the screws back in, but they come loose if you use it for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> this comb is cool, what i dont like about it is that the screws come loose often</li>
            <li> If you are new to balisongs this is the toy for you.</li>
            <li> First, I received the product within a couple days (literally) and had just chosen standard shipping.</li>
            <li> and not knowing this, i tried to flip it around a bit, but it instantly fell apart on the first swing.</li>
            <li> Tiny bolt fell out of handle after the first day.</li>
            <li> First I&#x27;ll start off saying that this actually came a day early, so kudos to that.</li>
            <li> the butterfly comb is very light, hard to do a Y2k or a suicide drop with.</li>
            <li> Finally the screws that hold the whole thing together get loose fairly quickly with use.</li>
            <li> Hurts if you comb too fast, or if you have thick hair, or if your hair knots easy.</li>
            <li> and the parts are small that could be lost pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this comb for purely novelty purposes.</li>
            <li> The latch is on the safe handle instead of the bite handle, but it isn&#x27;t that hard to get used to.</li>
            <li> This product was a huge waste of money it broke in an hour of the unboxing.</li>
            <li> This ballysong comb makes a great tool for practices tricks without cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> It is clear that the two do not go together with quality in mind at this time.</li>
            <li> latch is on the &#x27;wrong&#x27; side, the pivot pins are fairly cheap and will break off with extended use, and it wasn&#x27;t a comfortable to use as a comb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just buy a real knife next time.</li>
            <li> I fixed it</li>
            <li> that the whole left part came off!</li>
            <li> After about a day of me playing with it constantly, it loosened up too much and fell apart.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased for my 14 year old son.  </li>
            <li> (I bought it for my 13 year old brother)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a epic comb.</li>
            <li> so I thought maybe its supposed to be like that, then it fell completely apart</li>
            <li> and I fixed it and all the screws came undone.</li>
            <li> Metal construction, not too flimsy, completely legal&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Also even though it is made of metal the weight is not the same as a real knife</li>
            <li> Overall definitely worth the ten dollars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible like, unable to be fixed or handles literally fall off right away or anything.</li>
            <li> Made with very low quality, I highly unseggest buying this item</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews on here are bad, but i feel there is an easy fix to the problem of it falling apart.</li>
            <li> I jerry-rigged some new bolts with comb teeth and electrical tape because I lost the actual screws when they came out.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect much for such a low price but</li>
            <li> After a week or two, the Butterfly Hair Comb fell apart pretty abruptly.</li>
            <li> I started flipping and mastered the basic open in about the first 15 minutes but the very next day it fell apart.  </li>
            <li> but not sharp.</li>
            <li> the screw gets loose fast and the screw also gets \\&quot;worn\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Overall, it is very heavy, I have a Jaguar balisong and it definitely weighs much more than that.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old grandson saved his chore money for several weeks to buy it.</li>
            <li> and then the screws start to come undone, but the latter could probably be fixed with a bit of thread lock.</li>
            <li> And not that anyone would wanna buy this for a comb or anything, but even if you wanted to be some kind of weird hipster</li>
            <li> When they flip back and forth, if caught at a certain angle, the two points collide with each other.     </li>
            <li> read it broke easily but ordered one and confirmed stupidly...</li>
            <li> The actual comb is made of stainless steel and has a black coat on it.</li>
            <li> and i have very thick but smooth hair.</li>
            <li> I am a Martial Arts instructor and, this novelty butterfly hair comb, actually hurts when trying to use the metal comb, The handle screws popped out after a few flips, and the handles never closed  and locked completely around the comb without considerable force, also lending to the loose screw problem.</li>
            <li> Once you have the screw out, put a tiny bit of Glue on the Treads, ten reassemble your comb, and let it dry.    </li>
            <li> Long story short, if you want a comb, buy a comb.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the screws get loose and the teeth are faccing the opposite way the blade would.</li>
            <li> The butterly hair comb did not last one complete day for my son as it fell apart after using it a few times.  </li>
            <li> Bearings are not actually bearings, they are loose metal rings between the screws and handles.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller about all of the screws coming loose and being lost, and he did not get back to me about a replacement or atlease some replacement parts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a neat little toy for someone too young for a butterfly knife, but the construction quality isn&#x27;t fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well this thing is no good because the first thing I noticed is that the 2 screws that hold together the blade are in contact, creating friction.</li>
            <li> As long as I still have hair</li>
            <li> Complete junk, don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> The handles actually hit each other around the screws (this is not supposed to happen.)</li>
            <li> but then one of the screws that goes into the other screw on the opposite side fell out.  </li>
            <li> The screws have already come loose and there are no bearings, just metal spacers.</li>
            <li> The blade comb is really loose and flimsy.</li>
            <li> The pivot screws also come loose, but I do flip it a lot</li>
            <li> a screw came loose.</li>
            <li> but becomes loose after using it</li>
            <li> The screws came loose just from swinging it.</li>
            <li> It was loose when I got it</li>
            <li> THE HANDEL DOES GET LOOSE</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re going to get a max of 10-30min of any balisong before the screws come loose.</li>
            <li> Well the screws holding the thing together are loose and I lost one</li>
            <li> Super fun but lost a screw, fixable but a little annoying.</li>
            <li> You can fix that by covering the screws in glue and screwing the comb back together, just don&#x27;t make the screws too tight.</li>
            <li> : the comb is on the wrong side, a little too light, gets loose quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> its stainless steel and its a little hard on your hair though.</li>
            <li> The only drawbacks is that the paint starts to flack a little around some of the screws</li>
            <li> We tried to reassemble the product but again it only lasted for a a little while.  </li>
            <li> I recieved this product yesterday and within 5 minutes the screws were worn out and the whole thing was broken</li>
            <li> The screws itself are very loose.</li>
            <li> Heavier than I expected even though they show you the shipping weight.</li>
            <li> because I found With a Few Simple Repairs that take Under 10 Minuets, I can Fix It  </li>
            <li> After using it for only 10 minutes, the screws fell out, and I&#x27;m not going to waste my time by putting it together again, because it just keeps falling apart.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s what I paid for so its to be expected.</li>
            <li> it are much harder to accomplish.</li>
            <li> the screws only lasted a few minutes before</li>
            <li> It latches in both closed and open position and is firm.</li>
            <li> My concerns are pretty much the same as everyone else: screws have awful lifetimes, need regular tightening.</li>
            <li> the came lose and fell out and cannot find the right type of screwdriver to fix, very poor product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how other people rate this five stars.</li>
            <li> Like all the other reviews, this thing falls apart within minutes.     </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> If you have other problems, (latch moves too much)/hinge</li>
            <li> When I received the item, it came in with the comb pointing the other direction from what is shown in the picture by the seller.</li>
            <li> However, in mine, the comb points the other direction - for reference - [...]    </li>
            <li> Well, I read a lot of the other reviews about this item falling apart, but went ahead and bought one anyways.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE LOOSE</li>
            <li> If you are looking for at least a working butterfly knife stick to above the $25 mark even if it&#x27;s not a real knife like this.</li>
            <li> They come loose with just a few flicks.</li>
            <li> Just the screws will come loose after a few flips.</li>
            <li> not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I then used nuts on the other side and applied a little loc- tite to keep them in place.</li>
            <li> I played with it for less than 10 mins and it broke...</li>
            <li> This item, Butterfly Hair Comb, is not worthy of the 99 cent store.</li>
            <li> But rather than black</li>
            <li> Cons to this comb, it,s not very easy to comb your hair do to</li>
            <li> It was received 2 days ago and is still in one piece, though my son is afraid to use it very much.</li>
            <li> Also One of the Handles was too louse, and the other too tight!  </li>
            <li> The lock is to tight.</li>
            <li> a buy some lock tight.</li>
            <li> Get them a trainer because this will break with out lock tight.</li>
            <li> But its nothing a little glue on the treads won&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> The paint on the comb leaves little bumps on the comb.</li>
            <li> This one screw came out that holds this little plate on the handle</li>
            <li> A little nail polish on the screws</li>
            <li> this thing to play around with and to show off a little bit.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t actualy want to come my hair with it because the metal prongs are a bit painful, with that being said its still fun to show off.</li>
            <li> I bought this expecting it to be low quality when I saw the price, but this was even worse than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> waste your money on this item.</li>
            <li> A few flicks and the paint already starts to peel off.    </li>
            <li> Again like the comb, a few flicks and the paint chips.</li>
            <li> He saved his allowance, watched the mail for days and waited impatiently.</li>
            <li> without any other word dull.</li>
            <li> Just a little hard to comb with.</li>
            <li> making it a little hard to do aerials</li>
            <li> The screws are very weak, after several hours of flipping and using it it does die.</li>
            <li> DON&amp;#34;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> If I try to pry out the screws from the middle with a jeweller&#x27;s screwdriver (in order to correct the positioning of the comb), the screws are of very poor quality and promptly lost their grooves/heads/drive</li>
            <li> Base on the feedbacks that saw I&#x27;m definitely not buying this, such a waste though!</li>
            <li> The construction of the handles aren&#x27;t terrible, they are sandwhiched, which usually is not a good thing, but these handles and pretty solid.</li>
            <li> The handles do not completely close making the lock useless.</li>
            <li> , now I feel a little dumb for buying.</li>
            <li> its hard to comb with this and</li>
            <li> The screws came out because of shoddy production.  </li>
            <li> The product was ordered for Christmas, and was late (12-30-11).</li>
            <li> At least it can&#x27;t seem to comb my hair.</li>
            <li> Those of you with experience with the real thing will notice though that the comb part is not on the blade side which is a bit annoying if you are used to doing some tricks that involve the blunt side rolling off some part of you hand/body.</li>
            <li> This will get very annoying when it the handles hit each other and the whole thing stops and drops.</li>
            <li> No more issues!</li>
            <li> Even after all that i still have very small hopes for this.</li>
            <li> - now I am unable to dissasemble the comb now, and am left with an useless balisong that I cannot do any of the tricks with.    </li>
            <li> But the thing can&#x27;t even open all the way, the cruddy paint job chips off, the screws fall off, and the handles bind on each other so it won&#x27;t even flip.</li>
            <li> When I first Got it I was VERY Disappointed With the quality, and the Fact that I had to Re Tighten the Screws after  &lt;60 flips.</li>
            <li> Steel\\&quot; and is a bit tough to comb with.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, and it would just pull on it and wouldn&#x27;t comb it at all.</li>
            <li> Do you have friends who constantly defend their stupid haircuts?  </li>
            <li> Utter crap.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s terrible because really, it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The comb is a bit thin but if used correctly it will not bend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was already broken when it was in the box.</li>
            <li> However when I saw this flaw I thought I could just buy new handles and just switch out the parts, but all the screws in it were so badly striped that it was impossible to remove them.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed item broke the same day we opened it.  </li>
            <li> so i just threw it a way sorry</li>
            <li> Go to prison in style as in mere seconds</li>
            <li> but it has broken over 5 times!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> Also, latch is on the wrong handle.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;blade\\&quot; was facing the wrong way, so</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a play my son is in as a prop and after a whopping 5 mins of teaching him how to use a butterfly type knife (comb), one of the rivets popped out, rendering it useless.</li>
            <li> but i was very disappointed on its past late arrival.</li>
            <li> and the comb itself had a uncomfortable sharpness to it that made combing with it an unpleasant experience</li>
            <li> it was broke within a week and now i have an unhappy son.  </li>
            <li> Do you have mad knife skills?  </li>
            <li> the comb is so bad it pulls on my hair and hurts...</li>
            <li> Although this may be bad if your going to transition from this to a expert knife because the latch is on the bite part of the comb.</li>
            <li> Bad move.</li>
            <li> The hinge is the weak point, hope you listen, do not buy it!!!</li>
            <li> Stupid me kept playing with it,</li>
            <li> This thing is a hunk of crap.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, but I guess it&#x27;s my fault for buying it after reading all the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my son and he was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and when i did it was worst</li>
            <li> This was a really bad experience!!  </li>
            <li> The screws are the worst.</li>
            <li> Terribly made.</li>
            <li> This comb is soooooo Sick!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it was nice at first but it broke because the the screws came off almost every time i used it so  if i used it 1 time i had to screw it back on and when i did it was worst then it was before so i just threw it a way sorry</li>
            <li> i love this comb its heavy easy to fit in my pocket and works great i think most people are flipping it around to much its not a knife trainer as for the pain when you comb with it i don&#x27;t feel any but definitely a convenient thing to have.</li>
            <li> its okay. its hard to comb with this and when you open it, the hinge does not close unless i force it. the butterfly comb is very light, hard to do a Y2k or a suicide drop with. the screw gets loose fast and the screw also gets \\&quot;worn\\&quot; out fast so tightening the screw can be a challenge.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing. its weighted pretty good and everything,but its screws need tightening ALOT. But its nothing a little glue on the treads won&#x27;t fix. you&#x27;ll also need a pretty small screwdriver or a alan wrench. overall its a good buy. its nice and sturdy, plus the comb actually works pretty well! I would recommend this to people who want a good trainer and a comb.</li>
            <li> I bought this expecting it to be low quality when I saw the price, but this was even worse than I thought it would be. The handles are set to closely together for it to flip properly so if your buying it to flip it don&#x27;t buy it. However when I saw this flaw I thought I could just buy new handles and just switch out the parts, but all the screws in it were so badly striped that it was impossible to remove them. You get what you pay for though and $9 doesn&#x27;t get you much. If you are looking for at least a working butterfly knife stick to above the $25 mark even if it&#x27;s not a real knife like this.</li>
            <li> Played with the comb for a while, it was pretty good for 2 days.  After that, it just collaped.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> well this thing is no good because the first thing I noticed is that the 2 screws that hold together the blade are in contact, creating friction. Secondly, the screws came off. Third, the handle positioning is wrong, where the bite handle should be where the safe handle for it. Made with very low quality, I highly unseggest buying this item</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this trainer after waiting a couple of days for this. I flipped it for one day, and it broke.  Utter crap. The screws came out because of shoddy production.  DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> Lasted about a month before it fell apart.</li>
            <li> It is really light and fun to flip. Great price. The only problem is the screws get loose and the teeth are faccing the opposite way the blade would. If you are new to balisongs this is the toy for you.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product yesterday and within 5 minutes the screws were worn out and the whole thing was broken and I had to throw it away. DONT BUY THIS!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> not worth the money.  it was broke within a week and now i have an unhappy son.  I know teenagers aren&#x27;t perfect but it should have lasted a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son  for his birthday and the next day he used it and it broke, the screw came off. It was a gift he really wanted for his birthday and he didn&#x27;t get to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This item is a very good beginners item. I would recommend this seller. The item did not look cheap or feel cheep very good Quality.</li>
            <li> I love to use it and all, BUT the problem is after using for about two days, the bolts started to loosen. Then the comb came apart. After retightening, it keeps loosening on its own unfortuanately</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the need of practicing without damaging my hand this is perfect. However you will have to flip the handlebars of the comb to make it more proper.   Only cons: The screws are very weak, after several hours of flipping and using it it does die.</li>
            <li> This was actually a gift and I would like to say that this comb is everything it says. First, I received the product within a couple days (literally) and had just chosen standard shipping. It&#x27;s a durable comb and great for just playing with (without using an actual knife). Would be a wonderful practice device for anyone actually considering the real knife.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with everything from the price, shipping &amp; product. Would definitely prefer this seller in the future!</li>
            <li> This was a really bad experience!!  The product was ordered for Christmas, and was late (12-30-11). The product has already fallen apart. I don&#x27;t feel like Amazon has the same accountability as their  \\&quot;sellers\\&quot;. I&#x27;ll probably watch that closer in the future.</li>
            <li> Junk, broke in minutes!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item. The hinge is the weak point, hope you listen, do not buy it!!!</li>
            <li> So i decided to try out buying another one of these butterfly knife fakes so i could practice some more. The last one i purchase broke in a week. This one broke already. I had to use triflow to lube it up so that it would actually slide around like a butterfly knife. The screws have already come loose and there are no bearings, just metal spacers. Im going to be using more tri flow to lube the metal spacers, and am going to use blue loctite so the screws dont keep falling off. Even after all that i still have very small hopes for this. And not that anyone would wanna buy this for a comb or anything, but even if you wanted to be some kind of weird hipster the comb is so bad it pulls on my hair and hurts... and i have very thick but smooth hair. I have a comb that has bigger teeth than this comb and works a million times better.</li>
            <li> Do you have mad knife skills?  Do you have friends who constantly defend their stupid haircuts?  Do you like being able to freshen up on the go?  Then this is the comb for you!  Go to prison in style as in mere seconds you are arrested for carrying something that looks like a balisong.&lt;br /&gt;In all seriousness though, the handles are flimsy and the comb itself is flimsier so don&#x27;t actually use this, but it&#x27;s the best training knife I&#x27;ve ever seen to be honest and it is a great gag gift.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how other people rate this five stars. This product functions neither as a practice knife, nor a hair comb! At least it can&#x27;t seem to comb my hair. But the thing can&#x27;t even open all the way, the cruddy paint job chips off, the screws fall off, and the handles bind on each other so it won&#x27;t even flip. I&#x27;ll just buy a real knife next time.</li>
            <li> This comb was shipped to me earlier than I expexted, which is a plus. There are flaws in this product, most of which aren&#x27;t fixable. The latch is fairly l√µse and will swing around when it is spinning. This will get very annoying when it the handles hit each other and the whole thing stops and drops. The screws itself are very loose. After several days of spinning, the screws came flying off. I had to apply loctite on the screws to fix them, and thankfully they haven&#x27;t come out yet. At the top of the handle, the two ends meet, causing it to get stuck in a \\&quot;Y\\&quot; position when spinning. I had to file down the top of the handle to fix this. The comb doesn&#x27;t actually work either. All in all, this is a great practice balisong for spinning after a few adjustments; however, if you&#x27;re looking for a comb, this isn&#x27;t the one for you.</li>
            <li> I played with it for less than 10 mins and it broke... I fixed it but it has broken over 5 times! DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> I just got this knife today have been flipping it around a bit. The construction of the handles aren&#x27;t terrible, they are sandwhiched, which usually is not a good thing, but these handles and pretty solid. The comb part is made of metal. Overall, it is very heavy, I have a Jaguar balisong and it definitely weighs much more than that. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s terrible because really, it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a cool novelty item and a fun little toy, something you would expect to get when paying under $10.</li>
            <li> High quality material and well made. This thing is solid. Heavier than I expected even though they show you the shipping weight. Comb bristles are square at the end. Hurts if you comb too fast, or if you have thick hair, or if your hair knots easy.</li>
            <li> Quality is good and shipped fast</li>
            <li> This item, Butterfly Hair Comb, is not worthy of the 99 cent store. It broke within an hour and could not be repaired. My 10 year old grandson saved his chore money for several weeks to buy it. I suppose it is a good life lesson for him, not to buy anything sight unseen. I&#x27;m very disapointed in Amazon as well.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool item. You can do all the same tricks you do with butterfly knife but you&#x27;re safe since it doesn&#x27;t have a blade.</li>
            <li> fell apart very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;my son used this for about 5 days before it was in oieces  and he was using for for what it was inrended..</li>
            <li> I purchased a pair of these for my friend as a gift, after he lost his switchblade hair comb.  He really liked them!  The perfect quirky gift for the guy in your life who is obsessed with his hair.</li>
            <li> This Knife(comb) is a great practice knife to use! Although this may be bad if your going to transition from this to a expert knife because the latch is on the bite part of the comb. I recommend practicing with this ONLY. Overall this Knife is great! it has a good weight to it and the play is in fact just right. this is a knife for its price, hope you all enjoy it because i sure did!</li>
            <li> Like all the other reviews, this thing falls apart within minutes.     The blade comb is really loose and flimsy. The comb its self is not any good. The teeth of the comb are too short to even comb your hair. The paint on the comb leaves little bumps on the comb. A few flicks and the paint already starts to peel off.    The handles are very cheap and easily bendable. Again like the comb, a few flicks and the paint chips. The locking clip on the handle is just junk. The lock is to tight. Does not swivel back and forth without force. The handles do not completely close making the lock useless. Forcing the handles together is the only way to lock the handles together. The spacing of the two handles are too close together. When they flip back and forth, if caught at a certain angle, the two points collide with each other.     The screws are the worst. They come loose with just a few flicks. The handle and comb are held together by two washer spacers and a male/female screw.    If you&#x27;re looking for a comb, then look for a real comb. If you&#x27;re looking for a practice balisong, then look for a real one.    Would I recommend this for the advertised price?  - NO.</li>
            <li> This product was a huge waste of money it broke in an hour of the unboxing. Terribly made. I wish i would have kept the box so i could get my money back</li>
            <li> During the unboxing, I thought it was pretty cool that they made a balisong into a comb. But then While doing tricks, I noticed one of the screws came undone. Stupid me kept playing with it, that the whole left part came off! This item is worth buying, if only if you want to comb. If you do, rarely do tricks with it or It&#x27;ll come apart. You should rather get a training one or a rel one if your skilled enough, or if you are in a country that has it legal.</li>
            <li> this comb is cool, what i dont like about it is that the screws come loose often but i have a screwdriver for that which doesnt bother me at all. So overall this comb is neat for showing off :)</li>
            <li> This comb is soooooo Sick!! I have a buzz cut and it is still really fun to practice with, its metal and is like my real butterfly knife</li>
            <li> Base on the feedbacks that saw I&#x27;m definitely not buying this, such a waste though! I was reallly wanting to buy this so I can show people how it&#x27;s done, oh well.</li>
            <li> Great trainer, although it does have a lot of problems. The handles are too close and move stiff, but you can continue to flip and eventually it will get better. The comb works ok, not bad. The screws fall of pretty easily after a couple flips but a little glue on the screws or tape of the screws will fix it for a while. It&#x27;s pretty cheap too, so good buy. It&#x27;s not perfect but it&#x27;s easy to fix, so if you&#x27;re planning on getting it and you can easily afford it, it&#x27;s a decent buy. It&#x27;s not terrible like, unable to be fixed or handles literally fall off right away or anything. In the end, good product, lots of small problems that can easily be fixed in 10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to buy this item and mind that it will break or fall apart in a matter of hours then go for it. If you want quality material this item is not it. Save your money and buy a more expensive one that might last longer. Transaction was good in all but the item was not worth it. Overall if you want a cool item that can still comb your hair this item can do just that.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed item broke the same day we opened it.  I would not recommend this product. My son was upset at how quick and easily it broke.</li>
            <li> The pegs that keep the comb in place keep falling out. If there are only a way to fix it.  Other than that I  love it</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I bought this so that I could take it to my high school and show it to my friends. Mainly it was because one of my friends had brought a switchblade comb to school, and I was not one to be outdone. The handles, both bite and safe, fell apart quite quickly. I jerry-rigged some new bolts with comb teeth and electrical tape because I lost the actual screws when they came out. Luckily I had bought it for five dollars and sold it for ten, so I made a profit.  Long story short, if you want a comb, buy a comb. If you want a butterfly knife trainer, buy a butterfly knife trainer. It is clear that the two do not go together with quality in mind at this time.</li>
            <li> This is a decent little trainer, a bit on the light side, but it flips okay with some practice.  The screws for the scales loosen easily and one of them fell off on mine.  The pivot screws also come loose, but I do flip it a lot so it is bound to happen.  I recommend making sure that you have a 1.5mm hex key so that you can tighten all the screws on a regular basis.  Not a bad buy for the money, and there are better trainers out there that cost significantly more, but having one that is legal does come in handy when you want to show off, and the comb blade makes it even better than a boring training blade.</li>
            <li> (How To Repair Tutorial is below the review)  ---------------  ---{Review}---  ---------------  I bought this comb mostly for balisong practice;  As most the other reviews say The Screws come loose very easily.  Also One of the Handles was too louse, and the other too tight!  Also the comb it&#x27;s self is made from cheap \\&quot;Stainless Steel\\&quot; and is a bit tough to comb with.  When I first Got it I was VERY Disappointed With the quality, and the Fact that I had to Re Tighten the Screws after  &lt;60 flips. WD40 Helped a bit, but after a matter of minuets, it would be back to the way it was...    ----  So Why Did i Give this 4 stars you ask?    Good Question!    because I found With a Few Simple Repairs that take Under 10 Minuets, I can Fix It  Once Repaired I LOVED IT! it flipped like a real Balisong, and I no longer had to Tighten the Screws!  and I did not net to go out and buy LOCTIE or anything!  ----------------------  {How To Repair}  ----------------------  {This Video is all you need}  [...]  {if your Prefer Reading continue below:}  You only have to do the Repair once!  First thing you need to do is remove the screws, you can use a hex screwdriver, or Mirco-screwdriver or whatever.  Once you have the screw out, put a tiny bit of Glue on the Treads, ten reassemble your comb, and let it dry.    But before it dry&#x27;s make sure that the screws are louse enough that you can still do some tricks!    After it&#x27;s Dried your comb should work PERFECTLY!     If you have other problems, (latch moves too much)/hinge too louse/washers fallout/ be sure to watch my repair video:  [...]</li>
            <li> I will star off by saying, DO NOT BUY THIS! It came later than expected, and right of the bat had a good weight to it. After using it for only 10 minutes, the screws fell out, and I&#x27;m not going to waste my time by putting it together again, because it just keeps falling apart. Do not get this!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy this it broke two times the same week i received you will need hex key and some thread lock when it broke it took me three hours to find the screw</li>
            <li> I bought this thing a long time ago, and I loved it when I opened it up and started flailing it around.&lt;br /&gt;It felt very light, and it was gentle on my hands, but the comb part was sharp and unforgiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 3 weeks of playing around with it off and on, it fell apart catastrophically beyond repair. As cool as it was for the short amount of time I had it, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my brother. He&#x27;s like 14. it was novel idea but after mild use the handle&#x27;s outer piece detached  and it wobbled all over. a screw came loose.</li>
            <li> I like this thing, my grandpa says it takes him back. Its convenient and looks like a knife, and its built to last!:^]</li>
            <li> This comb looks cool and sleek and it flips really well. The only drawbacks is that the paint starts to flack a little around some of the screws and then the screws start to come undone, but the latter could probably be fixed with a bit of thread lock.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the best for me, because I get fidgety quite a bit, so I would mess with it frequently. After about a day of me playing with it constantly, it loosened up too much and fell apart. The comb isn&#x27;t the best either. I have very thick hair, and it would just pull on it and wouldn&#x27;t comb it at all. It broke the day after I got it, so I would recommend just looking for another one.</li>
            <li> Super fun but lost a screw, fixable but a little annoying. Still a lot of fun to play with.</li>
            <li> I love it, its the best way to comb my way out of a situation! :-P</li>
            <li> What the HELL? I got it, used it for 2 hours, then it FELL APART IN MY HAND. Get your stuff together.</li>
            <li> It came on time and it seemed to be all perfect, but it started to fall apart after a while. I had to tighten it so many times, but other than that it served its purpose.</li>
            <li> First I&#x27;ll start off saying that this actually came a day early, so kudos to that. This is better than the plastic one that I received from Assisted knife that was almost a pain to flip because it was so light. This one from True Tiger however is great. The handles are very unique but have solid construction. The \\&quot;blade\\&quot; has teeth only on one side but they are..without any other word dull. Just a little hard to comb with. The actual comb is made of stainless steel and has a black coat on it. It has dual tang pins and are actual quite big. It latches in both closed and open position and is firm. The only problem I think there is, is that the handles touch eachother when they are both in the middle. making it a little hard to do aerials but thats nothing a Dremel tool will fix. Overall definitely worth the ten dollars.</li>
            <li> This one screw came out that holds this little plate on the handle and there you go.  Now my hair is messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TANKS.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased for my 14 year old son.  It fell apart on the very first day he got it.  I have contacted the seller and am hoping that they will assist me in resolving this.  The seller promptly sent me a replacement.  It was received 2 days ago and is still in one piece, though my son is afraid to use it very much.</li>
            <li> its good for training but if you on expert or a starter you need to find something worth your money like people say \\&quot;you pay what you get\\&quot; but on the good side it come on time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and it is very realistic.  So much so that we were detained by TSA when going through an airport with it.  He even takes it in the shower and it still works as well as when we purchased it a year ago.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> When I received the item, it came in with the comb pointing the other direction from what is shown in the picture by the seller. In the seller&#x27;s picture, the comb is pointing the same direction as the latch when it is unhooked.    However, in mine, the comb points the other direction - for reference - [...]    If I try to pry out the screws from the middle with a jeweller&#x27;s screwdriver (in order to correct the positioning of the comb), the screws are of very poor quality and promptly lost their grooves/heads/drive - now I am unable to dissasemble the comb now, and am left with an useless balisong that I cannot do any of the tricks with.    I am requesting Amazon to work with the seller to please issue a refund of the item.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Cheap&lt;br /&gt; - Safe&lt;br /&gt; - Good for kids (I bought it for my 13 year old brother)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - It falls apart quickly. I bought some Loctite Red to remedy this problem. No more issues! You will need two hex keys of the same size for the screw.</li>
            <li> After a week or two, the Butterfly Hair Comb fell apart pretty abruptly. It seems like it wasn&#x27;t put together well enough.</li>
            <li> it fell apart before 1 week of usage i only gained somthing from it because i learned how to use a butterfly knife</li>
            <li> This was a great trainer.  I started flipping and mastered the basic open in about the first 15 minutes but the very next day it fell apart.  The screws came out and the trainer had too much play in the handles.  Buy this if you&#x27;re not going to flip it a whole bunch.  If you do,  I think that it will require a 1.5mm alan the next day.</li>
            <li> The material is lighter than a real balisong and if you tamper with its parts, it does flow better. It is a good gag comb but it does not help with practice.</li>
            <li> This comb is a tad bit cheaply made, but it&#x27;s still pretty cool. Just the screws will come loose after a few flips. You can fix that by covering the screws in glue and screwing the comb back together, just don&#x27;t make the screws too tight. The actual comb part seems to be well made, and works great as a comb. The latch is on the safe handle instead of the bite handle, but it isn&#x27;t that hard to get used to.</li>
            <li> This was an alright item. It is good a a practice but be careful about the screws. Also as a safety reminder, the saftey handle has the latch on this one.</li>
            <li> My concerns are pretty much the same as everyone else: screws have awful lifetimes, need regular tightening. However, if you contact the supplier about missing parts, they&#x27;d be more than happy to supply them. So kudos for that.  Aside from the screws, though, the product itself is great. Weight is beautiful, combs like a charm (at least for my hair, which is medium-length and rather thick and oily), and very elegant design. The screws are an easy fix anyway, just need a 1.5 alan for &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a neat little toy for someone too young for a butterfly knife, but the construction quality isn&#x27;t fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latch is on the &#x27;wrong&#x27; side, the pivot pins are fairly cheap and will break off with extended use, and it wasn&#x27;t a comfortable to use as a comb. I would only recommend this comb for purely novelty purposes.</li>
            <li> broke in a day...&lt;br /&gt;I read it broke easily but ordered one and confirmed stupidly...&lt;br /&gt;do not buy...</li>
            <li> Kind of a good quality tool..but becomes loose after using it&lt;br /&gt;..it is metal which is good butbolts become loose..just fix it with the right tool and no problem</li>
            <li> Broke as soon as I opened it. Very cheaply made. I bought this as a gift for my son and he was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, the estimated date was January 3rd through the 6th of 2014. I received my product yesterday February 18.&lt;br /&gt;As I took notice of my product i noticed it was not as in the picture But rather than black it was silver and the design was noticeably different from the supposed image.&lt;br /&gt;There is pros to this comb, although i just opened my package 30 minutes ago the comb seems durable with 440 stainless steel and with no paint added it will maintain it&#x27;s look as time passes and you will not have to worry about the paint rubbing off.&lt;br /&gt;Just as there is pros to every product you can also find cons. Cons to this comb, it,s not very easy to comb your hair do to it&#x27;s sharpness. The comb is a bit thin but if used correctly it will not bend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good product but i was very disappointed on its past late arrival.</li>
            <li> All steel.  except for alloy bolt sleeves.  A little nail polish on the screws and i&#x27;ve been flipping it without drama.  A little light, but very nice.</li>
            <li> For the price of this product, it is well made. The screws will come loose when flipping the butterfly hair comb comes for more ten 15 minutes. You will need a 1.5 mm Allen wrench to tighten the screws, but that will come with a cheap product. The comb is not that functional, but it is different. If you are looking for a product that you can train with and you can maintain, this is or you.</li>
            <li> The handles actually hit each other around the screws (this is not supposed to happen.) Also, latch is on the wrong handle. Bearings are not actually bearings, they are loose metal rings between the screws and handles.</li>
            <li> Cheap, but that&#x27;s what I paid for so its to be expected. I wouldn&#x27;t actualy want to come my hair with it because the metal prongs are a bit painful, with that being said its still fun to show off.</li>
            <li> This is a epic comb. But after apart after about an hour. But it&#x27;s good I have the right allen wrenches. I also needed to go to the store a buy some lock tight. Then it took about 2 hours to put back together. Over al it&#x27;s a great trainer after it is fixed.</li>
            <li> My son really loved this for Christmas but the scews started to back out and ended up trowing it away because of that.  It need Locltite on the screws before uses</li>
            <li> It was ok. This was my first butterfly knife.Literally lasted about an hour.A good buy.Parents please do not get your kid this.Get them a trainer because this will break with out lock tight.Overall good comb all olluniom.Sandwich design so it wasent that good but good buy.XD</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews on here are bad, but i feel there is an easy fix to the problem of it falling apart. I used to own one of these before i misplaced it. When the screws came out, I went into my basement and found some screws that fit the hole. I then used nuts on the other side and applied a little loc- tite to keep them in place. After that i had no problem using it for a extended periods of time without it falling apart</li>
            <li> It worked fine for a day but then one of the screws that goes into the other screw on the opposite side fell out.  I lost it and was wondering if anyone knew where I could get the same screws.  I really hope they&#x27;re not custom made or I&#x27;m throwing it away.</li>
            <li> The butterly hair comb did not last one complete day for my son as it fell apart after using it a few times.  We tried to reassemble the product but again it only lasted for a a little while.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I opened this product imediatley after reciveing it in the mail and it fell apart instantly upon opening the knife. I sent a email to the manufacturer explaining my problem with the product and I never got a reply. All in all: Do NOT buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome, with great balance and weight but it fell apart pretty quickly and the parts are small that could be lost pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Thing broke on the first day and I barely used it. Very fragile. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless they fix this problem.</li>
            <li> screws fell out, now it just sits in the drawer.</li>
            <li> Just got this. As long as I still have hair I thought i might as well have fun.  This ballysong comb makes a great tool for practices tricks without cutting yourself. It is quite well built ,am very satisfied especially for the price.</li>
            <li> its stainless steel and its a little hard on your hair though. it just pulls. the bristles are like square. but not sharp. i love it its great for practicing.</li>
            <li> This item is a great item, and it works fine, when i first opened it, the only problems i noticed was it was weighted wrong, but that wasnt much of a problem, Another issue was that is \\&quot;blade\\&quot; was facing the wrong way, so the bite handle was the safe handle. (really, really, really, annoying)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the very first day of using it, (didnt drop it or anything) It broke. The screws came loose just from swinging it. You can put the screws back in, but they come loose if you use it for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I am a Martial Arts instructor and, this novelty butterfly hair comb, actually hurts when trying to use the metal comb, The handle screws popped out after a few flips, and the handles never closed  and locked completely around the comb without considerable force, also lending to the loose screw problem.</li>
            <li> I love my comb&lt;br /&gt;I play with it and do all these awesome tricks&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s and amazing comb also&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This was a great and very cute idea, however the quality of the item is flimsy. The comb is made of metal so if you use it to really comb your hair, it would hurt your scalp if you don&#x27;t do it gently.</li>
            <li> It was loose when I got it so I thought maybe its supposed to be like that, then it fell completely apart and I fixed it and all the screws came undone.</li>
            <li> Strong metal comb. You wouldn&#x27;t guess it was a comb until you opened it.</li>
            <li> The screws loosen and it falls apart after 10-15 times of opening it. It&#x27;s a shame too because the actual comb portion of it is a really good quality! DON&amp;#34;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> I &amp;#60;3 IT ITS WELL WORTH THE BUY BUN THE HANDEL DOES GET LOOSE BUT JUST TIGHTEN IT OR LEAVE IT BECAUSE IT DOESNT REALLY MATTER I  LIKE IT A LITTLE LOOSE</li>
            <li> This was even better then I expected, the all steel comb is not only lightweight but durable, definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Fun to play with and whips good. But i would not recommend this for combing hair it is made out of metal and just doesn&#x27;t feel good in your hair. Another is that after playing with it alot the screws holding it get lose and you need to re screw them back in. Still alot of fun</li>
            <li> The comb was shipped quickly. When it first arrived It felt well bult, and it had a good weight. The picture is of the BudK knife, wich is not the one that it actually is. The sandwitch design does not have the same features. I contacted the seller about all of the screws coming loose and being lost, and he did not get back to me about a replacement or atlease some replacement parts.</li>
            <li> Pros: Metal construction, not too flimsy, completely legal&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the comb is on the wrong side, a little too light, gets loose quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got this thing to play around with and to show off a little bit. Those of you with experience with the real thing will notice though that the comb part is not on the blade side which is a bit annoying if you are used to doing some tricks that involve the blunt side rolling off some part of you hand/body. Also even though it is made of metal the weight is not the same as a real knife so tricks that involve spinning it are much harder to accomplish. Finally the screws that hold the whole thing together get loose fairly quickly with use.</li>
            <li> This thing is a hunk of crap. It fell apart after 2 days. Do NOT buy this! It will dissapoint.</li>
            <li> It has some weight to it and is sturdy. Will not break even when dropped.  Son has had fun with it.</li>
            <li> well, i got this like a month ago. it was already broken when it was in the box. and not knowing this, i tried to flip it around a bit, but it instantly fell apart on the first swing. i had to end up bringing it to a hardware store for some new screws, but other than that it was fine.</li>
            <li> I remember my brother saying he wanted a butterfly knife, so i got him this awesome comb for his birthday! It was perfect since he had just recently gotten his comb-over haircut!</li>
            <li> Well, I read a lot of the other reviews about this item falling apart, but went ahead and bought one anyways. Bad move. Mine fell apart too, within hours of opening the box. Very disappointed, but I guess it&#x27;s my fault for buying it after reading all the bad reviews. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake.</li>
            <li> Great quality good price</li>
            <li> Made in China. Tiny bolt fell out of handle after the first day. Not worth it. Sorry but I would have rather kept my money.</li>
            <li> After his older brother received a real butterfly knife from a friend, my 10 year old son ordered this comb to play with. He saved his allowance, watched the mail for days and waited impatiently. It arrived quickly, on time, and didn&#x27;t last 10 minutes. Seriously not 10 minutes into playing with it, the screws fell out and one was lost. Reading the reviews this is a standard problem with these things. Complete junk, don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> What a POS !!! I ordered this for a play my son is in as a prop and after a whopping 5 mins of teaching him how to use a butterfly type knife (comb), one of the rivets popped out, rendering it useless. Not to mention it took over a WEEK to get here, leaving me NO TIME to order a replacement. THANK YOU SO MUCH !!!!</li>
            <li> This comb lasted just over 1 day for me.  after swinging it for a while, I noticed that the screw came loose.&lt;br /&gt;I found it and put it back in and this process repeated 3 times and just before I wrote this review, the screw got lost in the carpet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> the screws only lasted a few minutes before the came lose and fell out and cannot find the right type of screwdriver to fix, very poor product. Do not buy, find a better one</li>
            <li> The material is a very flimsy metal and when I opened it the pins had already fallen out that and the comb itself had a uncomfortable sharpness to it that made combing with it an unpleasant experience</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo25TBFZBNPFY62]]I hope all future customers know this but it doesn&#x27;t matter which kind, price, or quality of balisong you buy - you&#x27;re going to get a max of 10-30min of any balisong before the screws come loose. It&#x27;s completely normal. So not to fret. Just buy Loctite thread locker *BLUE ONE* which is a must have for all balisong users. One guy said it lasted for six months and still going. I&#x27;m about to face my first full month without so much as a budge from the screws.</li>
            <li> Falls apart occasionally but it&#x27;s easy to put back together</li>
            <li> Well the screws holding the thing together are loose and I lost one, now I feel a little dumb for buying. But it is cool and the metal is good but the screws need to be tightened or replaced</li>
            <li> Son ordered this butterfly comb. Didn&#x27;t expect much for such a low price but the item  literally fell apart 2 hours after opening.</li>
            <li> The Butterfly Hair Comb delivered and was a big hit for the recipient.  They loved their present and use it daily.  The all metal construction was great and very durable for the user.</li>
