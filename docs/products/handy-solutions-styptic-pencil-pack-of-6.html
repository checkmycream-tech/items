            <li> Wished it was a little better at stopping the bleeding when needed, seems weak compared to the ones I used when i started to learn to shave 20 years ago, but since they hard to find in stores anymore, take them where you can get them</li>
            <li> Wet it, rub it on the nick, you get a bit of a sting and the bleeding stops.</li>
            <li> However, I have traveled with this pencil and it has not happened to me yet, so the risk seems a minimal point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the storage tube is not too stiff in the middle.</li>
            <li> only *very* slight problem is that the weight is not listed on the package I received.</li>
            <li> I do not feel there is any risk of the tube itself breaking, but if it is packed in a tight shaving kit or suite case, then there could be a risk that the pencil is crushed.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;sting\\&quot; isn&#x27;t too painful at all and it only last for a fraction of a second, there is zero pain after initial contact.</li>
            <li> Typical styptic pencil.</li>
            <li> added feature is the storage tube has a small hole in the center of the cap.</li>
            <li> Stings a little</li>
            <li> and it could be a little softer</li>
            <li> Stopping the bleeding without a face covered in spots of tissue or small bandaids is not easy unless you have a styptic pencil; the active ingredient is an astringent which basically causes the skin to tighten and stop the bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small nick/cut relief.</li>
            <li> However, hard to argue at this price.</li>
            <li> Well, I gave them 2 stars because they, at least, are styptic pencils.  </li>
            <li> I had been to a grocery store, a drugstore, and WalMart and was unable to find a Styptic Pencil.  </li>
            <li> For anyone who&#x27;s ever used a Styptic pencil, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> they work well for minor shaving cuts.</li>
            <li> Does what it says on the packet. Stings a little and it could be a little softer (I feel like I want it to make a paste like chalk, but it&#x27;s harder then that so really it&#x27;s only the stinging sensation that makes you know it&#x27;s working).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had discovered these years ago.</li>
            <li> These Brut \\&quot;Styptic Pencils\\&quot; work well for stopping minor bleeding from nicks and cuts. Styptic pencils are always useful to have around when shaving with a razor blade, but they are also useful for scrapes and abrasions that come from having active teens in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit \\&quot;stingy\\&quot;, but works very quickly. Applying the moistened tip of the styptic stick to a shallow cut causes the blood vessels at the site to contract and cut off the flow long enough for natural clotting to close the wound (was curious, so looked it up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a six-pack of individually packaged sticks, with each one in a plastic tube for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> Great product, stops bleeding from razor cuts immediately, easy to use and does the job thoroughly. Not messy, easy cleanup.</li>
            <li> GOOD JUST WHAT I WANTED</li>
            <li> This product is as advertised.  Each pencil has its own little storage tube.  Remember to wipe excess water (or blood) from the pencil before storing away for the next use.  I shave wilh a double edge blade so I never need to use the product.  Well, I never admit it to the wife.</li>
            <li> These are so useful for little nicks. I won&#x27;t have to buy any again for a while now. I would just buy which ever is cheaper though between brut and clubman because for me it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product.  I&#x27;d been looking in local stores for styptic pencils, and had been unsuccessful.  These are exactly what I needed at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have never used these before. I got tired of paying the exhorbitant prices the razor companies want for replacement blades on the new style razors and went back to using an older style double edged razor. You do get more nicks with those and these pencils have worked exactly as they are supposed to. Wet it, rub it on the nick, you get a bit of a sting and the bleeding stops. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do! Stops minor cuts/nicks from bleeding right away! Must have for shaving, and works good on minor hand cuts as well. The \\&quot;sting\\&quot; isn&#x27;t too painful at all and it only last for a fraction of a second, there is zero pain after initial contact. Works perfect.</li>
            <li> i BOUGHT THESE AND STARTED WITH ONE. AFTER TWO SHAVES AND MAYBE 4 TINY BLEEDERS, THE STICK HAS SHRUNK BY 25%. WATER JUST MELTS THESE TO NOTHING.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Stops bleeding for minor cuts on contact.  Excellent product and at a great price!  Easy to use.  Well done!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> Best thing on the market for cuts...works wonderful...just wish we could buy it locally</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;ve not actually used this product yet. I assume it provides the same relief for minor cuts and scratches as the reviews and the fact that they&#x27;re styptic pencils suggest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a differently branded product than is listed here. I am unsure if this is a simple mistake made by the picker working for Amazon. It isn&#x27;t a big deal however. The ones I was sent are branded \\&quot;Handy Solutions\\&quot;, not \\&quot;BRUT\\&quot;. I can tell it&#x27;s the same product because the \\&quot; * STOPS BLEEDING FAST\\&quot; and \\&quot; * IDEAL FOR RAZOR NICKS &amp; MINOR CUTS\\&quot; portions of the packaging are exactly the same as pictured and in the same place. Also, in the top-right corner of my version, I read \\&quot;NO. 29649 V2\\&quot;, while the photo here reads \\&quot;No. 29549\\&quot;. They&#x27;ve just replaced the logos and packaging colors. It is probably that BRUT (a well-known brand in shaving) brands this product as their own, as is typical in the world of products like this. Not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only *very* slight problem is that the weight is not listed on the package I received. Without a scale, I can&#x27;t tell if this is 0.33 ounces as the listing says. Problem is, in the photograph of the item, it looks more like the pencils themselves are a rectangle shape, while the ones I received are about the circumference of an actual pencil. I can&#x27;t be sure whether it&#x27;s the fault of the photographer and the photograph, or if I actually received lesser pencils for the same price. In the latter case, it would be the typical slimming down of products while charging the same amount of money and hoping nobody notices that we see all over the place now. The \\&quot;V2\\&quot; in the product number suggests this may be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t make a determination either way as I don&#x27;t have a scale. Either way, I&#x27;ve taken off a star because I didn&#x27;t receive the exact product listed.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as its supposed to. Small nick/cut relief. Great product to have in the shaving kit. Couldn&#x27;t find it in stores, the 6 pack came out to around $1/pencil. Pretty good price. Read my full review here: \\&quot;[...]\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I had been to a grocery store, a drugstore, and WalMart and was unable to find a Styptic Pencil.  My husband did not like a similar product that was being sold in its place.  The pack of 6 that we purchased may last him for the rest of our lives. LOL</li>
            <li> Typical styptic pencil. Does the job &amp; the case is a nice touch. This is a product that is better purchased locally though. Two of the six were broke &amp; as you can see from the price, returns are not cost/time effective.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service. Good value for the money. I am very pleased with this product and I will buy this same product again,.</li>
            <li> These stop the bleeding fast! They do sting for a second, but every styptic pencil I have used stings. With these, you do not have to worry about trying to stop the bleeding or using toilet paper anymore. If I nick myself, then within seconds I can have it stopped by using this pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added feature is the storage tube has a small hole in the center of the cap. I am assuming this was placed there to allow the pencil to dry out since leaving one of these wet will cause it to dissolve. Even with the hole, I try to leave the pencil sit out until dry before storing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the storage tube is not too stiff in the middle. I do not feel there is any risk of the tube itself breaking, but if it is packed in a tight shaving kit or suite case, then there could be a risk that the pencil is crushed. However, I have traveled with this pencil and it has not happened to me yet, so the risk seems a minimal point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is being a package of 6, but they are small to store and very affordable. Each pencil will last a long time if cared for and you will be stocked up for many years. I highly recommend them for anyone that has to shave with a razor.</li>
            <li> Well, I gave them 2 stars because they, at least, are styptic pencils.  Beyond that, the comparison ends.  Far from the advertised Brut sticks for which you pay a premium price, these are actually branded \\&quot;Handy Solutions\\&quot;; and, carry a Navajo guarantee.  Nice to see that Amazon is supporting small businesses; but, it would be good if they properly advertised the products as such....</li>
            <li> I agree it&#x27;s quite cheap and you can&#x27;t complain paying this kind of money for a whole bunch of pencils, but they dissolve incredibly fast even though I dry it after use(( I had much better/solid ones than this.</li>
            <li> Picked these up when I was dabbling with a Shavette, which I&#x27;ve since given up. Wasn&#x27;t reading the description or title very closely because I was surprised to get so many sticks for the price. For anyone who&#x27;s ever used a Styptic pencil, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Works as advertised. It&#x27;s been several months and I haven&#x27;t quite finished the first stick.</li>
            <li> I take blood thinners and even a tiny nick will bleed forever this stops it right away I love it!</li>
            <li> Wished it was a little better at stopping the bleeding when needed, seems weak compared to the ones I used when i started to learn to shave 20 years ago, but since they hard to find in stores anymore, take them where you can get them</li>
            <li> timely shipping, and it does a great job of stopping those little nicks before they get out of control. I shave my head and face and neck, and sometimes being groggy or not paying attention to blade replacement or days off from shaving can lead to close calls. sometimes a nick happens, this guy stops the bleeding right away, the burn just lets you know its working. highly recommend</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving with a double edge razor and have had my share of cuts as I get used to it. Stopping the bleeding without a face covered in spots of tissue or small bandaids is not easy unless you have a styptic pencil; the active ingredient is an astringent which basically causes the skin to tighten and stop the bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only small downside is that there are 6 in the pack - it should last for years unless you really hack yourself to pieces on a daily basis! However, hard to argue at this price.</li>
            <li> Indispensable if you shave!  This a great value too!</li>
