            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>These one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I keep this in my make-up bag, and I love that the lid stays on.  </li>
            <li>; I also love her eye liner pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Oh, and most importantly...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gets your pencils sharp as a needle for perfect winged eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and to discard shavings.</li>
            <li>so I can easily carry it in my bag.</li>
            <li>Works fine on everything else though.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It holds more than a week&#x27;s worth of sharpening pencils every morning (three-five turns a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this thing, its really handy to have around and works well.</li>
            <li>This is a simple and great sharpener.  </li>
            <li>The Revlon Universal Points Sharpener, does a great job of sharping my eye-liner pencils.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good product; I have not had any issues with it falling apart or ruining any of my pencils.</li>
            <li>but good enough.</li>
            <li>super cool.</li>
            <li>This was not the size i needed but it worked great on all my other eye liner pencils and lip liners.</li>
            <li>Great sharpener I like the precision sharpens pencils other sharpeners wouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Thanks, REVLON!!</li>
            <li>Definitely deserves a 5/5 rating :]!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another nice feature is that it catches the shavings and is easy to empty.</li>
            <li>Judging by the description, I was hoping that it would fit one really fat color pencil that I have.</li>
            <li>This pencil sharpener works great for my eyeliner - it has a few different sized holes as well which is nice.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seems a little strange to be so enthusiastic about a pencil sharpener, but this is a great product.</li>
            <li>A sharpener that right size for my eye pencils and brow pencils.  </li>
            <li>The collection chamber is also very convenient so that I don&#x27;t have to clean up shavings every time I sharpen.</li>
            <li>Give a good point and does not leave little bits of wood on the pencil.</li>
            <li>This sharpener creates a broader, stubbier point that is ideal for a cosmetic pencil for which you don&#x27;t want a long sharp point.</li>
            <li>Smooth tips, doesn&#x27;t get clogged, empties easy, doesn&#x27;t leave traces of other color eyeliners.</li>
            <li>I have not tried the large hole.  </li>
            <li>This product was a really good deal for the quality (super sharp clean cut with a large and small hole).</li>
            <li>This is a handy little gadget.  </li>
            <li>Great little sharpener, works especially well for the chunky Nars lip pencils.  </li>
            <li>After muddling along with a cheap alternative I finally got this one and</li>
            <li>It has two holes for different sized pencils, and while I have only used the smaller one, it works great.</li>
            <li>Also it is really sleek looking</li>
            <li>Small, light, cheap, functional.</li>
            <li>This is a great feature because it&#x27;s hard to find sharpeners that work with larger pencils.</li>
            <li>Trish McEvoy Classic Eye Pencil, shade&#x3D;Black]]</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Gets my eyeliner pencil sharp very quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks better than your typical clear plastic</li>
            <li>Extremely well made, compact, and light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to keep the shavings self-contained until you&#x27;re ready to empty the little drawer, instead of inadvertently spreading them all over the bathroom and into one&#x27;s makeup bag.</li>
            <li>Larger ones can be sharpened too and it is easy to empty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than my previous sharpener because this one has a hinged cap whereas my old one just snapped on and would occasionally snap off and all the shredding would be all over the bottom of my cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li>Overall, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I like that the lid on this one comes completely off, so there</li>
            <li>Clean &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; and traps the mess.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a little stick to clean the blades embedded inside the sharpener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it replaced my old sharpener which had the normal sharpening hole and the bigger sharpening hole.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately it was a small investment.</li>
            <li>When you finally get a high quality sharpener you can feel how big the difference is.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, it sharpens fabulously AND catches and holds the shavings.  </li>

            <li> or else I&#x27;ll have dirty eyeliner shavings all inside of my clean makeup bag!!</li>
            <li> sharpener comes with two holes: a small and large.</li>
            <li> Most pencil sharpeners are designed to create a long, very sharp point, which is not ideal for a cosmetic pencil.</li>
            <li> I tried to use them for regular pencils, and of course they won&#x27;t work, but I was curious.</li>
            <li> Ihave tried several other products and I always get a rough cut</li>
            <li> I always seem to loose my sharpeners.  </li>
            <li> Finally I have found a makeup sharpener that doesn&#x27;t get jammed by the tips of the makeup pencil like all the other sharpeners I have tried...kudos!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two similar ones, but the hinges on them broke making the lid impossible to secure to the sharpener.  </li>
            <li> Small and can be used for small and large pencils</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> May seem expensive, but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The container is also very useful, it does not become dirty</li>
            <li> While other sharpeners break eyeliner/brow pencil tips, this one sharpens like a dream.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because my NYX jumbo pencils would not fit in my other one.  </li>
            <li> the only con of this sharpener is trying to open it without shavings flying everywhere is difficult to do.</li>
            <li> I also like the black finish.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Caps stays tight (no accidental shavings</li>
            <li> With this little sharpener I can draw brows that look close to reality.  </li>
            <li> The hole for a small (regular) eye pencil does not create a sharp point - frustrating!  </li>
            <li> I like how the compartment catches everything, but the lid isn&#x27;t very tight</li>
            <li> if the pencil breaks inside the sharpener, theres a little tool, like a pick, inside to get it out!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a sucker for that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not perfect</li>
            <li> Others that I&#x27;ve had start looking dirty from makeup soon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with sharpeners but this one hasn&#x27;t failed me yet!</li>

            <li> This thing is the best sharpener ever. Omg. How did I survive for the entirity of my make-up wearing life without this?

            <li> I have been looking for a sharpener big enough for my one cream eye shadow stick and this one has a piece you remove and it fits it. I am very happy with this sharpener, I can leave it in my makeup bag because it has a compartment for the shavings.</li>

            <li> This works really well for eyeliner pencils--they sharpened up beautifully!  I sharpened five or six. Larger ones can be sharpened too and it is easy to empty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seems a little strange to be so enthusiastic about a pencil sharpener, but this is a great product. After muddling along with a cheap alternative I finally got this one and my life is all the better for it. It has two holes for different sized pencils, and while I have only used the smaller one, it works great. Gets my eyeliner pencil sharp very quickly. The collection chamber is also very convenient so that I don&#x27;t have to clean up shavings every time I sharpen. Overall, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a simple and great sharpener.  Must have for the make up collection.  I use this with the Prestige eyeliners that I found on Amazon and could not be happier.</li>
            <li> This was not the size i needed but it worked great on all my other eye liner pencils and lip liners.</li>
            <li> Great sharpener, does not fall apart and holds a lot of shavings. I recommend this if you need a sharpener. I love this sharpener!</li>
            <li> I am writing this review months after buying this sharpener. Works great. What more can I say?</li>
            <li> Good buy, very cheap and pretty good quality. It was above expectations. Sharpens my lip pencils and eyeliners excellently. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I like that this comes with a compartment to trap the shavings so that if you&#x27;re doing your makeup on-the-go, you don&#x27;t have to make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sharpener comes with two holes: a small and large. The smaller one fits a regular eyeliner pencil. The larger hole has a plastic stopper piece that you can pull out to make an even bigger hole. This is a great feature because it&#x27;s hard to find sharpeners that work with larger pencils. This works with my [[ASIN:B0006B12KK NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil]] and my [[ASIN:B00FKPK09G NYX Jumbo Shadow Crayon]].</li>
            <li> This is a very good sharperner. I use it to sharpen my Maybelline eye pencil and benefit instant brow pencil. Works as expected. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little gadget.  At 74 my eyebrows are practically non-existent, so I use a brow pencil daily.  With this little sharpener I can draw brows that look close to reality.  May seem expensive, but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not Revlon&#x27;s fault, but this item doesn&#x27;t work with Avon&#x27;s eye shadow pencils. It is sturdy, though, and I&#x27;ll keep it. Fortunately it was a small investment.</li>
            <li> Great little sharpener, works especially well for the chunky Nars lip pencils.  It&#x27;s nice to keep the shavings self-contained until you&#x27;re ready to empty the little drawer, instead of inadvertently spreading them all over the bathroom and into one&#x27;s makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Very good sharpener. Love it</li>
            <li> When you finally get a high quality sharpener you can feel how big the difference is.  I bought this because my NYX jumbo pencils would not fit in my other one.  This one fits everything and works great.  Also it is really sleek looking and I&#x27;m a sucker for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to add (cause I just found it) if the pencil breaks inside the sharpener, theres a little tool, like a pick, inside to get it out!! super cool.</li>
            <li> i picked a winner! this sharpener makes great points on my makeup pencils and does not crack the makeup part of the pencil when it gets to a centain sharpened length, as most sharpeners do. the only con of this sharpener is trying to open it without shavings flying everywhere is difficult to do. i guess it will come with experience.</li>
            <li> The hole for a small (regular) eye pencil does not create a sharp point - frustrating!  I have not tried the large hole.  It is easy to use and to discard shavings.</li>
            <li> I always seem to loose my sharpeners.  These one is my favorite.  Smooth tips, doesn&#x27;t get clogged, empties easy, doesn&#x27;t leave traces of other color eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Small and can be used for small and large pencils</li>
            <li> I keep this in my make-up bag, and I love that the lid stays on.  I&#x27;ve had two similar ones, but the hinges on them broke making the lid impossible to secure to the sharpener.  I like that the lid on this one comes completely off, so there no hinges that can break.  I also like the black finish.  Others that I&#x27;ve had start looking dirty from makeup soon.  Oh, and most importantly... this sharpens great too!</li>
            <li> This Revlon Universal Points Sharpener, 0.85 Ounce works well &amp; sharpens both smaller and larger pencils.&lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature is that it catches the shavings and is easy to empty.</li>
            <li> I just changed over from Trish McEvoy&#x27;s powder eye liner to her pencil [[ASIN:B002D509NS Trish McEvoy Classic Eye Pencil, shade&#x3D;Black]] and I needed a sharpener &amp; this works great; I also love her eye liner pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do keep it in my make-up bag and it has not opened &amp; dumped shavings all over.</li>
            <li> This is PERFECT!  It&#x27;s a wonderful price and it replaced my old sharpener which had the normal sharpening hole and the bigger sharpening hole.  It&#x27;s even better than my previous sharpener because this one has a hinged cap whereas my old one just snapped on and would occasionally snap off and all the shredding would be all over the bottom of my cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this sharpener for about a month now, and it works perfectly! No matter how many times i use it, it&#x27;s still spick n&#x27; span! Considering the quality, the price is a great bargain! Definitely deserves a 5/5 rating :]!</li>
            <li> Good sharpener at a great price. Like the cover and can carry in makeup bag for both my eyeliner pencil and bigger lip pencils.</li>
            <li> Someone reviewing it said when they dropped it, it didn&#x27;t bust open but it did open and spill the shavings when I dropped it in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner sharpener I&#x27;ve used for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caps stays tight (no accidental shavings spills!)&lt;br /&gt;Sharpens effectively&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t jam/snap pencils</li>
            <li> Clean &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; and traps the mess. Both fat and skinny eyeliner fits in it. Good price for a good product.</li>
            <li> This product was a really good deal for the quality (super sharp clean cut with a large and small hole). I&#x27;ve always had problems with sharpeners but this one hasn&#x27;t failed me yet!</li>
            <li> Great sharpener I like the precision sharpens pencils other sharpeners wouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This is a excellent product for sharpening your eye pencils.  Ihave tried several other products and I always get a rough cut but this seems to work just great.</li>
            <li> Extremely well made, compact, and light.  While other sharpeners break eyeliner/brow pencil tips, this one sharpens like a dream.  Great product!</li>
            <li> The Revlon Universal Points Sharpener, does a great job of sharping my eye-liner pencils. Overall it is a good product; I have not had any issues with it falling apart or ruining any of my pencils. I would definitely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Serve the purpose. I tried to use them for regular pencils, and of course they won&#x27;t work, but I was curious.</li>
            <li> Works well. What can I say? I bought it to sharpen different Revlon and etc brow pencils and lip pencils. It works. :D Not perfect--it&#x27;s not as universal as I&#x27;d like--but good enough.</li>
            <li> This pencil sharpener works great for my eyeliner - it has a few different sized holes as well which is nice. Overall I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Small, light, cheap, functional.</li>
            <li> Great sharpener. Does not harm the eyeliner at all. The container is also very useful, it does not become dirty so I can easily carry it in my bag.</li>
            <li> I like how the compartment catches everything, but the lid isn&#x27;t very tight so I just end up emptying it in the trash everytime anyway--or else I&#x27;ll have dirty eyeliner shavings all inside of my clean makeup bag!!</li>
