            <li>I will do my on line ordering, with another webb site, I do not like not being treated fairly.</li>
            <li>and I got it at a good price.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be a good alternative to my InStyler.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially good with a light mousse or gel.</li>
            <li>Love these air brushes, work great</li>

            <li>This was a great product at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not that thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>I thought I was buying one that rotated on its own.</li>
            <li>The nice rubber tips on the brush don&#x27;t tangle or damage my hair and the unit</li>
            <li>Best hair product ever; thanks.  </li>
            <li>I choose it according to many happy reviews and want to add one more to it.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Great hot air brushes!!</li>
            <li>is very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>May have to return and spend more on one that rotates on its own.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li>For anyone who has difficulty styling their hair the conventional way - using a blow brush is a wonderful and effective alternative!</li>
            <li>I use the Helen of Troy for many years and it is perfect for my fine and straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Great styling brush and love the way your hair comes right out after pressing the button.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a hot air brush, this one is great.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made product for the price.</li>
            <li>I have fine wavy hair and this styles it perfectly in just minutes, making it sleek, straight and smooth.</li>
            <li>I work in the film industry, and more than once, have been told by hair and make-up stylists that most hair and skin problems are operator-error, not product error-related.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless of the cons, this is the tool I use most often and take on vacation.  </li>
            <li>I so love this brush.  </li>
            <li>This is ok.  </li>
            <li>one by another company which was way better but can&#x27;t seem to find it on the internet.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t my hair look pretty?  :^)</li>
            <li>and it does an ok job</li>
            <li>glad I found it on line...</li>
            <li>I love this brush except that the plastic bristles fall off.</li>
            <li>I had bought one here in my town and paid a lot more for that one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possibly ok for finishing out a style on damp hair.</li>
            <li>that is much better than this one, but it&#x27;s a 1 inch size</li>
            <li>This Helen of Troy brush dryer is ok</li>
            <li>Love the product...</li>
            <li>This is perfect for my mid length hair.  </li>
            <li>love this brush perfect for mid length hair I use mine every day !</li>
            <li>I love these stylers.  </li>
            <li>It came in great condition, and fast.</li>
            <li>my 3rd one in over 20 years, the best</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>What can I say, this dryer is just okay.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to findone.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>The blow brush works perfectly and gives my hair the same results without causing me any pain.</li>
            <li>Ok but wish it would heat up more.</li>
            <li>Will do until I find a better one</li>
            <li>I was expecting more volume and a sleeker, bouncier look.</li>
            <li>FINALLY I found this brush and it is perfect!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s some safety thing built in</li>
            <li>I wish there was a better one on the market for an affordable price.  </li>
            <li>For the most part, it cuts out the need for a blowdryer, vented hairbrush and a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I have so much more control with this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more for should length or longer hair, but I use it for my &amp;#34;just below the ear&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Helen of Troy always has great products and I bought this to replace my mom&#x27;s old one which broke after 10 + years.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>I experienced a couple of tangles when in use and the bristles are way to soft to style with.</li>
            <li>Great soft waves or curls.</li>
            <li>I love the hot air brush!!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I need for my hair that is colored, somewhat fine (although a lot of it), and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>easy to get.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and the results are quite satisfactory.  </li>
            <li>It was worth it because it really does a great job for me on my hair.</li>
            <li>It has a comfortable grip handle and the release button really does make this brush fairly tangle proof.</li>
            <li>Blow air but no heat... do not know how to return if it heated it would most likely be great.</li>
            <li>Easy release button.</li>
            <li>but has a tendacy to shut off easily overheats.</li>
            <li>Motor changed speed on its own first time</li>
            <li>The first lasted many, many years.  </li>
            <li>My fine hair does not tangle in it either.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder length and baby fine but plentiful.</li>
            <li>I love this hot air brush!  </li>
            <li>I love this hot air brush!  </li>
            <li>It creates a smooth, shiny hair texture with body.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smooth &amp; shiney</li>
            <li>The barrel is easy to remove and clean.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoy how it dries my hair as it&#x27;s styling it.</li>
            <li>It does smooth my hair and give it fullness.  </li>
            <li>It worked great for about 3 months, when it quit entirely.</li>
            <li>Great for that extra fullness some of us need.  </li>
            <li>add body and light control.</li>
            <li>I use it to smooth my hair after washing.</li>
            <li>This Helen of Troy works perfectly to smooth and add a hint of curl and body.  </li>
            <li>gives me smooth hair with body.  </li>
            <li>Great product, have been using for quite sometime  now, and still wish I had purchased earlier.  </li>
            <li>Overall, an excellent product at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>hair which makes your hair more straight than anything (which is how most of the world wears their hair).</li>
            <li>Comfortable soft grip/non slip handle, very good air flow considering its size, thus allowing for easy effortless styling and professional salon styling results.</li>
            <li>Using alligator or butterfly clips to section hair (then re-clamping dried section until it&#x27;s completely cool if making curls) will help create perfect hair.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hot air brush.</li>
            <li>Love this hot air brush.</li>
            <li>I do love this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>I love this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>Love this Hot Air Brush, but it would shut off after using it for about six months.  </li>
            <li>I like this product better than bristle brush hot air dryers.</li>
            <li>Just mildly hot at most.</li>
            <li>I love my hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>So perfect that I just bought a second one so that when this one dies in ten years, I will have a replacement!!  :-)</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t burn up, but it should be able to stay on when it&#x27;s hot.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t pull the hair taut for a super smooth finish because the brush tangles up in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li>My wish would be for one to be much more powerful and to rotate and to have strong bristles to pull the hair straight, but this one does fit those requirements.</li>
            <li>I also found that you can prolong the life and prevent the overheating if you keep the vents on the end of the handle clean</li>
            <li>I also would suggest to Helen of Troy that a twist off end would be the solution for the clean out.</li>
            <li>It is the single most important grooming tool I own.</li>
            <li>In a couple of minutes, the dryer is cool again.  </li>
            <li>Good for second day hair.</li>
            <li>and you have to wait for it to cool off before you can turn it on again.</li>
            <li>Everything the reviews say are true....</li>
            <li>Overall, however - especially when it is fairly new - it&#x27;s an excellent and handy tool.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and Ilike it very much</li>
            <li>I bought this Helen of Troy 1574 Tangle Free Hot Air Brush, White, 1 Inch Barrel for my mom and I was very impressed when I used it on my daughter just to show my mom how to use it, you can get nice curls and straight hair without having to spend a long time doing it.</li>
            <li>I can easily give my roots volume with this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>It really is tangle free with my silky, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different types of heated brush styling products and I am truly in love with this one.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re lucky if you get a year out of one of these.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
            <li>I use it for several months and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Exactly as promised!  </li>
            <li>This cuts out sometimes when it gets hot!</li>
            <li>In fact it&#x27;s much easier to use because I can use my free hand to separate the hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Love how it smoothes and adds body to my soft silky hair</li>
            <li>Wish I could take the cover off on the bottom to be able to clear lint so that motor doesn&#x27;t burn out.</li>
            <li>but I would never call it powerful</li>
            <li>I have used the large barrel hot brush for years, and the rubber-type bristles never tangle my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have used Helen of Troy for years and it straightens my slightly naturally curly hair easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li>As others have said, it&#x27;s handy for quick touch-ups on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The air blows right at the roots which makes lift and body there</li>
            <li>it gives just the right amount of curl</li>
            <li>Going to try the 3/4\\&quot; and maybe the two together would be just right.</li>
            <li>It will  over heat and eventually stop working if you use too much hair at one time and you don&#x27;t clean the hair off each time.</li>
            <li>This large brush is great for smoothing and maybe adding a slight curve to the ends.</li>
            <li>The price is great considering it is usually used every day.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and own several, one I keep in my luggage/travel bag and one that I use daily.  </li>
            <li>The teeth are soft and firm at the same time -- really nice, easy to deal with and feels good on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;6.  </li>
            <li>When I used this for the first time, I did not experience any kind of awakening and there was no soft euphoric hum in the background.</li>
            <li>The teeth are easy on my hair and a soft plastic.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other brand&#x27;s designs, but found none that worked for my fine, chin-length</li>
            <li>The only positive thing is it did make my hair look silky straight with a nice curl at the end.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I was glad I was able to purchase the exact same one I currently  have.  </li>
            <li>B000A2RQQE HELEN OF TROY Hot Air Brush 1 1/2 inch Barrel Tangle Free with Soft Grip Textured Handle</li>
            <li>I purchased this hot air brush because of the brand.  </li>
            <li>Is there some reason that no manufacturer can make a hot air brush that lasts longer than a year?</li>
            <li>I have used this exact product for years.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair, so I first use a blow dryer</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to overdo it with the hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>expect it to last more than 2 months.  </li>
            <li>Have used this hot air brush for years.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased this about 5 years ago and needed a replacement.</li>
            <li>replaced it with a Conair for about the same price that works much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews about this hot air brush, and I&#x27;ve owned and replace one for quite some time.</li>
            <li>It was most definitely USED.</li>
            <li>This hot air brush styler is convenient, easy-to-fit-in-the-hand, and maneuverable.  </li>
            <li>The hot setting is not that hot.</li>
            <li>I use with Kenra Hot Spray to set curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) con - you cannot interchange rollers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what she wanted, so I remain out of the doghouse - for a while.</li>
            <li>should have returned it immediately, but used it anyway and was pleased for a short time.</li>
            <li>This type of hot air brush works well for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what my wife wanted.</li>
            <li>Otherwise works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying a hair dryer/brush combo.</li>
            <li>Does not seems to get too hot like some of the brushes with metal bases.</li>
            <li>Once it gets hot, it turns off.  </li>
            <li>You are styling your hair and it turns off because it&#x27;s hot.  </li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t a hot air brush supposed to get hot?  </li>
            <li>The first one I had lasted over a year</li>
            <li>I love this product and it arrived almost next day.</li>
            <li>give s me a lot of volume leaving my hair smooth, soft</li>
            <li>I have two of these hot air brushes....</li>
            <li>Gentle on my hair!</li>
            <li>Gives my hair a soft and smooth curl and does not get tangled.</li>
            <li>I loved what this did to my hair, but it just stopped working after a few months.</li>
            <li>as it&#x27;s fast, does not remain hot and can be packed right after use.</li>
            <li>this product is good the button is a bit stiff to release brush...</li>
            <li>I have very fine shoulder length hair that I let air dry about 75% and then use this hot air brush to blow the ends under.  </li>
            <li>This is helpful to smooth hair without adding bulk, I would like a little more power</li>
            <li>I use my regular blow dryer set on cool to blow cool air onto the hot air brush.</li>
            <li>Wow, It gives my hair body and a smooth straight look.</li>
            <li>This hot air brush over heats fast.</li>
            <li>those who experience tangles, you really do have to get used to using a hot air brush.</li>
            <li>This hot air brush accomplished neither task.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many different brushes I have purchased only to find out that they did not perform the way my original brush did.</li>
            <li>I&#x60;ve used this brand for years, for some reason this new one isn&#x60;t as powerful as the ones I&#x60;ve had before.  </li>
            <li>- I took a quick look at it &amp; wasn&#x27;t comfortable messing with AC current &amp; just bought her a new one - out of all the brands out there</li>
            <li>Its the best thing to use when hair is wet for you can dry and style at the same time instead of drying first then styling after.</li>
            <li>Not as effective as a curling iron but much less damaging to the hair.  </li>
            <li>Too large of a barrel for my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like my Helen of troy 1573 Tangle Free Hot Air Brush, White, 1 1/2 inchens Barrel.  </li>
            <li>The rigid bristles are great for my thick hair, but the air isn&#x27;t strong enough or warm enough to dry the hair at all.</li>
            <li>I think for longer, fine hair, it would be absolutely terrific!</li>
            <li>and I think the little bit of curl it gives is nice.</li>
            <li>Since there&#x27;s no hot metal touching my hair, it seems to stay healthier and doesn&#x27;t break as much as with a hot curling iron.</li>
            <li>but really isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I am very please with it.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t style my hair very often.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much power at all</li>
            <li>Got used to it so much</li>
            <li>This size brush really helps to keep my thinning hair looking fuller.</li>
            <li>and the end screw wasn&#x27;t even attached and the whole thing fell apart in my hands.  </li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>I went straight to Amazon.com, found another one, and ordered it immediately.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>and I could probably use that because I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It makes styling my hair so much easier than holding a dryer and a brush.  </li>
            <li>but the tangle fee does not work very well.</li>
            <li>It is also much lighter in weight</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like this.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I hope to buy a larger one too if it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely the easiest product to style my hair.  </li>
            <li>The hot air brush now works like new.  </li>
            <li>Nothing last&#x27;s forever - hence the 4 star&#x27;s - her original Helen of Troy (really ?)</li>
            <li>Is there a carrying case for this brush as it can be cumbersome due to the electrical cord being rolled around the brush when packing and unpacking and does get tangled many</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my Helen of Troy hot air brush for two years, and though I have noticed that it sometimes will not turn back on while the motor is over-hot, I have found that this rarely occurs.</li>
            <li>After reading a professionals review about cleaning the filter, I found it is necessary to to clean out the filter at the end of the brush.  </li>
            <li>, it work well, but as long as my old favorite 1 works I will use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can use this product for a number of styles on dry or damp hair with little or no styling product and I get great results.</li>
            <li>some reason there are not many blow dryers of this kind that heat from the inside out on the market.  </li>
            <li>My first one was so old</li>
            <li>I buy one of these about every two or three years, when one wears out, I&#x27;m ordering a new one!</li>
            <li>Liked this blow dryer a lot because I have thick hair &amp; the bristles hold my hair better than other dryers I have tried...</li>
            <li>I have previously given this item a 5 star rating because I love the product</li>
            <li>This is a super product and is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>The few times I was able to get the brush through one section of my hair without issue, I didn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I know how to round brush my own hair and this -This pulls out the curly parts near my scalp.</li>
            <li>and this is the only brush that will tame it and make it look good.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I wish the bristles had a little more grip on my hair.</li>
            <li>I use it to turn my ends under and add a little volume on top.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased to discover this type of hot air brush with a barrel larger than the 1\\&quot; diameter Vidal Sassoon I have used for years (in spite of all the problems I and other users have had with that product.)</li>
            <li>However, it overheats fairly easily and it if you need to turn it off to answer the phone or some other interuption</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product at least t 6 times because I liked the way it works...</li>
            <li>Worth the extra bucks for the added touches.</li>
            <li>Since it doesn&#x27;t have dense bristles or much force, it isn&#x27;t going to dramatically change hair shape or texture, but it leaves a very natural, soft look.</li>
            <li>It comes back on right away.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without these convenient hairdryers.  </li>
            <li>When this happens you just have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>most PC&#x27;s don&#x27;t last that long !!!</li>
            <li>It has a release button that slightly turns the barrel to loosen the hair for easy release from the bristles.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping the first one was defective but the new one is the same, turns off after 30 seconds?  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>This is my second Helen of Troy Hot Air Brush.  </li>
            <li>The first time that I turned it on, the handle got extremely hot (and no hot air ever came out of the brush) then quit worked.  </li>
            <li>Love it, have used the Vidal Sassoon for years but can&#x27;t find it, also threw away the big brush with the burnt out one last time and could not find the big size brush anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I does exactly what I expect, my hair is rather short</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this brush puts out enough hot air to be a styling tool.</li>
            <li>It takes a while to cool down and cannot be used for more than a few minutes before it overheats again.  </li>
            <li>almost dry use the hot air brush to style, it makes the hot air brush last longer.</li>
            <li>My original hot air brush is  at least 10 years old, still running, but I didn&#x27;t want to take a chance</li>
            <li>Major props to this company for continuing to make such a stellar product.</li>
            <li>which is why I bought it), but let me be clear, IT DOES NOT ROTATE.</li>
            <li>it up to clear the lint.</li>
            <li>Keeping the barrel free of dried hair product and lint seems to solve that problem.  </li>
            <li>Takes out frizz and gives my hair lots of soft curls, with added lift.</li>
            <li>It is much easier to work with since only one hand is used.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>Just soak it in water and all the old hair products wash off.&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li>I replace my old one that lasted for 4 years.  </li>
            <li>my old one lasted 8 years...</li>
            <li>The forced warm/hot air gently dries my hair and styles it while making it soft silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>but I think that&#x27;s reasonable for such an inexpensive styling tool that I use almost every day.</li>
            <li>were loud.</li>
            <li>It has a thermostat that is sensitive and when it gets</li>
            <li>It frequently shut itself off and would not restart until it cooled off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They work very well, and save time by drying and styling your hair, at the same time!</li>
            <li>Before, I had something similar but whatever the brush was made of really tangled my hair.</li>
            <li>My old 1 is on</li>
            <li>So far they are holding up well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-This pulls out the curly parts near my scalp.</li>
            <li>This air brush gives it just enough body to not have those stick straight edges.</li>
            <li>I can also get lift near the scalp.</li>
            <li>at most so one would think the product would last longer than a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it would save me some time getting ready in the morning, but you have to pretty much completely dry your hair prior to using it</li>
            <li>have thick hair that will hold any shape without using a super hot tool.  </li>
            <li>I like that this hot air brush has a fairly large barrel to add extra lift to my hair that was cut too short recently.</li>
            <li>I believe they indicated that you could blow dry your hair and curl it with this hot air bush.  </li>
            <li>I always use a hot air brush after my frizzy hair is 1/2 way dry.</li>
            <li>This is my second Hot Air Brush that I wanted for our second home.  </li>
            <li>Normally, after washing my hair, I blow-dry it and then either flat-iron it to make it sleek and glossy, or occasionally I take a curling iron to it.</li>
            <li>I did like the hard plastic brush, but it is more for short</li>
            <li>so I bought a new &#x27;back up&#x27; brush.  </li>
            <li>you have to buy a whole different brush if you want a smaller roll.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>works very well and makes a bigger curve than the smaller size</li>
            <li>I love this for my thick coarse colored hair.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I need it just doesn&#x27;t last as long as other hot curling brushes...</li>
            <li>but sounds funny like it might not last very long</li>
            <li>Since airflow isn&#x27;t strong, it takes a little time to shape the hair, even if it&#x27;s mostly dry.</li>
            <li>and mainly I need to lift and direct it, not much curling and Helen of Troy</li>
            <li>There is not enough difference between the high and low settings.</li>
            <li>They last about three months then just stop working completely.  </li>
            <li>I kept it mainly because it does style hair, but it certainly won&#x27;t dry it.</li>
            <li>The product lasted a couple of months before overheating and now barely runs for longer than a minute.  </li>
            <li>It is the only product that I have found with the soft teeth.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely not a blow dryer meant for a head full of wet hair.</li>
            <li>My fine, thick hair holds wave and curl for a couple of days when I dry it with this device, even though I live in humid Virginia.  </li>
            <li>I have been a loyal Helen of Troy user for years and usually rave about them.  </li>
            <li>Especially useful on the back of my hair as my hair is very thick and about 18&amp;#34; long.</li>
            <li>This device doesn&#x27;t really work - it blows MUCH less air than any other hot air brush i&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>It works as well as the other one did and allows her to save time getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li>My hair was still a little frizzy and still very straight.</li>
            <li>con-gets hot and if you shut it off, it won&#x27;t come back on, until it cools down.</li>
            <li>And though I&#x27;ve tried other similar hot air brushes, I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li>Even 20 minutes later all I had was really frizzy, partially wet hair!  </li>
            <li>The Helen of Troy hot air brush is NOT a rotating brush, as a few one-star reviewers have mistakenly believed.  </li>
            <li>Any salon stylist (and the instructions on most of these devices) will tell you that, regardless of using a hot air brush or old-fashioned round brush &amp; blow dryer, one should rough-dry one&#x27;s hair to about 80-90% dry (upside down for volume), then switch to the round brush &amp; dryer to create smoothness and/or curl.  </li>
            <li>The Helen of Troy brush has rigid bristles which I really like, but it has less power than the John Frieda.</li>
            <li>This same complaint has been noted by others and I would suggest the same filter clean out and your brush should work.  </li>
            <li>This brush doesn&#x27;t last as long as the Champion professional model that I had for yesrs.  </li>
            <li>Even after drying my hair 90% with a regular hairdryer, this brush would not dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine and thin hair...</li>
            <li>It is very cheaply made &amp; the \\&quot;Hi Lo Off\\&quot; button is difficult to use as it is not raised enough.  </li>
            <li>This is not easy because the end is not removable, but with a bit of work with a narrow, thin flat tool I was able to clean out the filter.  </li>
            <li>Saves so much time to add a little curl at the same time as drying.</li>

            <li> I work in the film industry, and more than once, have been told by hair and make-up stylists that most hair and skin problems are operator-error, not product error-related.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless of the cons, this is the tool I use most often and take on vacation.  </li>
            <li> I so love this brush.  </li>
            <li> This is ok.  </li>
            <li> one by another company which was way better but can&#x27;t seem to find it on the internet.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t my hair look pretty?  :^)</li>
            <li> and it does an ok job</li>
            <li> glad I found it on line...</li>
            <li> I love this brush except that the plastic bristles fall off.</li>
            <li> I had bought one here in my town and paid a lot more for that one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possibly ok for finishing out a style on damp hair.</li>
            <li> that is much better than this one, but it&#x27;s a 1 inch size</li>
            <li> This Helen of Troy brush dryer is ok</li>
            <li> Love the product...</li>

            <li> Will do until I find a better one</li>
            <li> I was expecting more volume and a sleeker, bouncier look.</li>
            <li> FINALLY I found this brush and it is perfect!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s some safety thing built in</li>
            <li> I wish there was a better one on the market for an affordable price.  </li>
            <li> For the most part, it cuts out the need for a blowdryer, vented hairbrush and a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I have so much more control with this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more for should length or longer hair, but I use it for my &amp;#34;just below the ear&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Helen of Troy always has great products and I bought this to replace my mom&#x27;s old one which broke after 10 + years.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> I experienced a couple of tangles when in use and the bristles are way to soft to style with.</li>
            <li> Great soft waves or curls.</li>
            <li> I love the hot air brush!!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I need for my hair that is colored, somewhat fine (although a lot of it), and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> easy to get.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and the results are quite satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> It was worth it because it really does a great job for me on my hair.</li>
            <li> It has a comfortable grip handle and the release button really does make this brush fairly tangle proof.</li>
            <li> Blow air but no heat... do not know how to return if it heated it would most likely be great.</li>
            <li> Easy release button.</li>
            <li> but has a tendacy to shut off easily overheats.</li>
            <li> Motor changed speed on its own first time</li>
            <li> The first lasted many, many years.  </li>
            <li> My fine hair does not tangle in it either.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length and baby fine but plentiful.</li>
            <li> I love this hot air brush!  </li>
            <li> I love this hot air brush!  </li>
            <li> It creates a smooth, shiny hair texture with body.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair smooth &amp; shiney</li>
            <li> The barrel is easy to remove and clean.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoy how it dries my hair as it&#x27;s styling it.</li>
            <li> It does smooth my hair and give it fullness.  </li>
            <li> It worked great for about 3 months, when it quit entirely.</li>
            <li> Great for that extra fullness some of us need.  </li>
            <li> add body and light control.</li>
            <li> I use it to smooth my hair after washing.</li>
            <li> This Helen of Troy works perfectly to smooth and add a hint of curl and body.  </li>
            <li> gives me smooth hair with body.  </li>
            <li> Great product, have been using for quite sometime  now, and still wish I had purchased earlier.  </li>
            <li> Overall, an excellent product at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> hair which makes your hair more straight than anything (which is how most of the world wears their hair).</li>
            <li> Comfortable soft grip/non slip handle, very good air flow considering its size, thus allowing for easy effortless styling and professional salon styling results.</li>
            <li> Using alligator or butterfly clips to section hair (then re-clamping dried section until it&#x27;s completely cool if making curls) will help create perfect hair.  </li>
            <li> My favorite hot air brush.</li>
            <li> Love this hot air brush.</li>
            <li> I do love this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> I love this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> Love this Hot Air Brush, but it would shut off after using it for about six months.  </li>
            <li> I like this product better than bristle brush hot air dryers.</li>
            <li> Just mildly hot at most.</li>
            <li> I love my hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> So perfect that I just bought a second one so that when this one dies in ten years, I will have a replacement!!  :-)</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t burn up, but it should be able to stay on when it&#x27;s hot.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t pull the hair taut for a super smooth finish because the brush tangles up in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> My wish would be for one to be much more powerful and to rotate and to have strong bristles to pull the hair straight, but this one does fit those requirements.</li>
            <li> I also found that you can prolong the life and prevent the overheating if you keep the vents on the end of the handle clean</li>
            <li> I also would suggest to Helen of Troy that a twist off end would be the solution for the clean out.</li>
            <li> It is the single most important grooming tool I own.</li>
            <li> In a couple of minutes, the dryer is cool again.  </li>
            <li> Good for second day hair.</li>
            <li> and you have to wait for it to cool off before you can turn it on again.</li>
            <li> Everything the reviews say are true....</li>
            <li> Overall, however - especially when it is fairly new - it&#x27;s an excellent and handy tool.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and Ilike it very much</li>
            <li> I bought this Helen of Troy 1574 Tangle Free Hot Air Brush, White, 1 Inch Barrel for my mom and I was very impressed when I used it on my daughter just to show my mom how to use it, you can get nice curls and straight hair without having to spend a long time doing it.</li>
            <li> I can easily give my roots volume with this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> It really is tangle free with my silky, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different types of heated brush styling products and I am truly in love with this one.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re lucky if you get a year out of one of these.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
            <li> I use it for several months and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Exactly as promised!  </li>
            <li> This cuts out sometimes when it gets hot!</li>
            <li> In fact it&#x27;s much easier to use because I can use my free hand to separate the hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love how it smoothes and adds body to my soft silky hair</li>
            <li> Wish I could take the cover off on the bottom to be able to clear lint so that motor doesn&#x27;t burn out.</li>
            <li> but I would never call it powerful</li>
            <li> I have used the large barrel hot brush for years, and the rubber-type bristles never tangle my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have used Helen of Troy for years and it straightens my slightly naturally curly hair easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li> As others have said, it&#x27;s handy for quick touch-ups on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The air blows right at the roots which makes lift and body there</li>
            <li> it gives just the right amount of curl</li>
            <li> Going to try the 3/4\\&quot; and maybe the two together would be just right.</li>
            <li> It will  over heat and eventually stop working if you use too much hair at one time and you don&#x27;t clean the hair off each time.</li>
            <li> This large brush is great for smoothing and maybe adding a slight curve to the ends.</li>
            <li> The price is great considering it is usually used every day.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and own several, one I keep in my luggage/travel bag and one that I use daily.  </li>
            <li> The teeth are soft and firm at the same time -- really nice, easy to deal with and feels good on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;6.  </li>
            <li> When I used this for the first time, I did not experience any kind of awakening and there was no soft euphoric hum in the background.</li>
            <li> The teeth are easy on my hair and a soft plastic.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other brand&#x27;s designs, but found none that worked for my fine, chin-length</li>
            <li> The only positive thing is it did make my hair look silky straight with a nice curl at the end.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I was glad I was able to purchase the exact same one I currently  have.  </li>
            <li> B000A2RQQE HELEN OF TROY Hot Air Brush 1 1/2 inch Barrel Tangle Free with Soft Grip Textured Handle</li>
            <li> I purchased this hot air brush because of the brand.  </li>
            <li> Is there some reason that no manufacturer can make a hot air brush that lasts longer than a year?</li>
            <li> I have used this exact product for years.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair, so I first use a blow dryer</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to overdo it with the hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> expect it to last more than 2 months.  </li>
            <li> Have used this hot air brush for years.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased this about 5 years ago and needed a replacement.</li>
            <li> replaced it with a Conair for about the same price that works much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews about this hot air brush, and I&#x27;ve owned and replace one for quite some time.</li>
            <li> It was most definitely USED.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush styler is convenient, easy-to-fit-in-the-hand, and maneuverable.  </li>
            <li> The hot setting is not that hot.</li>
            <li> I use with Kenra Hot Spray to set curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) con - you cannot interchange rollers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what she wanted, so I remain out of the doghouse - for a while.</li>
            <li> should have returned it immediately, but used it anyway and was pleased for a short time.</li>
            <li> This type of hot air brush works well for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what my wife wanted.</li>
            <li> Otherwise works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying a hair dryer/brush combo.</li>
            <li> Does not seems to get too hot like some of the brushes with metal bases.</li>
            <li> Once it gets hot, it turns off.  </li>
            <li> You are styling your hair and it turns off because it&#x27;s hot.  </li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t a hot air brush supposed to get hot?  </li>
            <li> The first one I had lasted over a year</li>
            <li> I love this product and it arrived almost next day.</li>
            <li> give s me a lot of volume leaving my hair smooth, soft</li>
            <li> I have two of these hot air brushes....</li>
            <li> Gentle on my hair!</li>
            <li> Gives my hair a soft and smooth curl and does not get tangled.</li>
            <li> I loved what this did to my hair, but it just stopped working after a few months.</li>
            <li> as it&#x27;s fast, does not remain hot and can be packed right after use.</li>
            <li> this product is good the button is a bit stiff to release brush...</li>
            <li> I have very fine shoulder length hair that I let air dry about 75% and then use this hot air brush to blow the ends under.  </li>
            <li> This is helpful to smooth hair without adding bulk, I would like a little more power</li>
            <li> I use my regular blow dryer set on cool to blow cool air onto the hot air brush.</li>
            <li> Wow, It gives my hair body and a smooth straight look.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush over heats fast.</li>
            <li> those who experience tangles, you really do have to get used to using a hot air brush.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush accomplished neither task.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many different brushes I have purchased only to find out that they did not perform the way my original brush did.</li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve used this brand for years, for some reason this new one isn&#x60;t as powerful as the ones I&#x60;ve had before.  </li>
            <li> - I took a quick look at it &amp; wasn&#x27;t comfortable messing with AC current &amp; just bought her a new one - out of all the brands out there</li>
            <li> Its the best thing to use when hair is wet for you can dry and style at the same time instead of drying first then styling after.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as a curling iron but much less damaging to the hair.  </li>
            <li> Too large of a barrel for my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like my Helen of troy 1573 Tangle Free Hot Air Brush, White, 1 1/2 inchens Barrel.  </li>
            <li> The rigid bristles are great for my thick hair, but the air isn&#x27;t strong enough or warm enough to dry the hair at all.</li>
            <li> I think for longer, fine hair, it would be absolutely terrific!</li>
            <li> and I think the little bit of curl it gives is nice.</li>
            <li> Since there&#x27;s no hot metal touching my hair, it seems to stay healthier and doesn&#x27;t break as much as with a hot curling iron.</li>
            <li> but really isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I am very please with it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t style my hair very often.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much power at all</li>
            <li> Got used to it so much</li>
            <li> This size brush really helps to keep my thinning hair looking fuller.</li>
            <li> and the end screw wasn&#x27;t even attached and the whole thing fell apart in my hands.  </li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> I went straight to Amazon.com, found another one, and ordered it immediately.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> and I could probably use that because I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It makes styling my hair so much easier than holding a dryer and a brush.  </li>
            <li> but the tangle fee does not work very well.</li>
            <li> It is also much lighter in weight</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I hope to buy a larger one too if it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely the easiest product to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> The hot air brush now works like new.  </li>
            <li> Nothing last&#x27;s forever - hence the 4 star&#x27;s - her original Helen of Troy (really ?)</li>
            <li> Is there a carrying case for this brush as it can be cumbersome due to the electrical cord being rolled around the brush when packing and unpacking and does get tangled many</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Helen of Troy hot air brush for two years, and though I have noticed that it sometimes will not turn back on while the motor is over-hot, I have found that this rarely occurs.</li>
            <li> After reading a professionals review about cleaning the filter, I found it is necessary to to clean out the filter at the end of the brush.  </li>
            <li> , it work well, but as long as my old favorite 1 works I will use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can use this product for a number of styles on dry or damp hair with little or no styling product and I get great results.</li>
            <li> some reason there are not many blow dryers of this kind that heat from the inside out on the market.  </li>
            <li> My first one was so old</li>
            <li> I buy one of these about every two or three years, when one wears out, I&#x27;m ordering a new one!</li>
            <li> Liked this blow dryer a lot because I have thick hair &amp; the bristles hold my hair better than other dryers I have tried...</li>
            <li> I have previously given this item a 5 star rating because I love the product</li>
            <li> This is a super product and is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li> The few times I was able to get the brush through one section of my hair without issue, I didn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I know how to round brush my own hair and this -This pulls out the curly parts near my scalp.</li>
            <li> and this is the only brush that will tame it and make it look good.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wish the bristles had a little more grip on my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it to turn my ends under and add a little volume on top.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased to discover this type of hot air brush with a barrel larger than the 1\\&quot; diameter Vidal Sassoon I have used for years (in spite of all the problems I and other users have had with that product.)</li>
            <li> However, it overheats fairly easily and it if you need to turn it off to answer the phone or some other interuption</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product at least t 6 times because I liked the way it works...</li>
            <li> Worth the extra bucks for the added touches.</li>
            <li> Since it doesn&#x27;t have dense bristles or much force, it isn&#x27;t going to dramatically change hair shape or texture, but it leaves a very natural, soft look.</li>
            <li> It comes back on right away.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without these convenient hairdryers.  </li>
            <li> When this happens you just have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> most PC&#x27;s don&#x27;t last that long !!!</li>
            <li> It has a release button that slightly turns the barrel to loosen the hair for easy release from the bristles.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping the first one was defective but the new one is the same, turns off after 30 seconds?  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> This is my second Helen of Troy Hot Air Brush.  </li>
            <li> The first time that I turned it on, the handle got extremely hot (and no hot air ever came out of the brush) then quit worked.  </li>
            <li> Love it, have used the Vidal Sassoon for years but can&#x27;t find it, also threw away the big brush with the burnt out one last time and could not find the big size brush anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I does exactly what I expect, my hair is rather short</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this brush puts out enough hot air to be a styling tool.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to cool down and cannot be used for more than a few minutes before it overheats again.  </li>
            <li> almost dry use the hot air brush to style, it makes the hot air brush last longer.</li>
            <li> My original hot air brush is  at least 10 years old, still running, but I didn&#x27;t want to take a chance</li>
            <li> Major props to this company for continuing to make such a stellar product.</li>
            <li> which is why I bought it), but let me be clear, IT DOES NOT ROTATE.</li>
            <li> it up to clear the lint.</li>
            <li> Keeping the barrel free of dried hair product and lint seems to solve that problem.  </li>
            <li> Takes out frizz and gives my hair lots of soft curls, with added lift.</li>
            <li> It is much easier to work with since only one hand is used.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> Just soak it in water and all the old hair products wash off.&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li> I replace my old one that lasted for 4 years.  </li>
            <li> my old one lasted 8 years...</li>
            <li> The forced warm/hot air gently dries my hair and styles it while making it soft silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s reasonable for such an inexpensive styling tool that I use almost every day.</li>
            <li> were loud.</li>
            <li> It has a thermostat that is sensitive and when it gets</li>
            <li> It frequently shut itself off and would not restart until it cooled off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They work very well, and save time by drying and styling your hair, at the same time!</li>
            <li> Before, I had something similar but whatever the brush was made of really tangled my hair.</li>
            <li> My old 1 is on</li>
            <li> So far they are holding up well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-This pulls out the curly parts near my scalp.</li>
            <li> This air brush gives it just enough body to not have those stick straight edges.</li>
            <li> I can also get lift near the scalp.</li>
            <li> at most so one would think the product would last longer than a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would save me some time getting ready in the morning, but you have to pretty much completely dry your hair prior to using it</li>
            <li> have thick hair that will hold any shape without using a super hot tool.  </li>
            <li> I like that this hot air brush has a fairly large barrel to add extra lift to my hair that was cut too short recently.</li>
            <li> I believe they indicated that you could blow dry your hair and curl it with this hot air bush.  </li>
            <li> I always use a hot air brush after my frizzy hair is 1/2 way dry.</li>
            <li> This is my second Hot Air Brush that I wanted for our second home.  </li>
            <li> Normally, after washing my hair, I blow-dry it and then either flat-iron it to make it sleek and glossy, or occasionally I take a curling iron to it.</li>
            <li> I did like the hard plastic brush, but it is more for short</li>
            <li> so I bought a new &#x27;back up&#x27; brush.  </li>
            <li> you have to buy a whole different brush if you want a smaller roll.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> works very well and makes a bigger curve than the smaller size</li>
            <li> I love this for my thick coarse colored hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need it just doesn&#x27;t last as long as other hot curling brushes...</li>
            <li> but sounds funny like it might not last very long</li>
            <li> Since airflow isn&#x27;t strong, it takes a little time to shape the hair, even if it&#x27;s mostly dry.</li>
            <li> and mainly I need to lift and direct it, not much curling and Helen of Troy</li>
            <li> There is not enough difference between the high and low settings.</li>
            <li> They last about three months then just stop working completely.  </li>
            <li> I kept it mainly because it does style hair, but it certainly won&#x27;t dry it.</li>
            <li> The product lasted a couple of months before overheating and now barely runs for longer than a minute.  </li>
            <li> It is the only product that I have found with the soft teeth.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely not a blow dryer meant for a head full of wet hair.</li>
            <li> My fine, thick hair holds wave and curl for a couple of days when I dry it with this device, even though I live in humid Virginia.  </li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Helen of Troy user for years and usually rave about them.  </li>
            <li> Especially useful on the back of my hair as my hair is very thick and about 18&amp;#34; long.</li>
            <li> This device doesn&#x27;t really work - it blows MUCH less air than any other hot air brush i&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> It works as well as the other one did and allows her to save time getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> My hair was still a little frizzy and still very straight.</li>
            <li> con-gets hot and if you shut it off, it won&#x27;t come back on, until it cools down.</li>
            <li> And though I&#x27;ve tried other similar hot air brushes, I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Even 20 minutes later all I had was really frizzy, partially wet hair!  </li>
            <li> The Helen of Troy hot air brush is NOT a rotating brush, as a few one-star reviewers have mistakenly believed.  </li>
            <li> Any salon stylist (and the instructions on most of these devices) will tell you that, regardless of using a hot air brush or old-fashioned round brush &amp; blow dryer, one should rough-dry one&#x27;s hair to about 80-90% dry (upside down for volume), then switch to the round brush &amp; dryer to create smoothness and/or curl.  </li>
            <li> The Helen of Troy brush has rigid bristles which I really like, but it has less power than the John Frieda.</li>
            <li> This same complaint has been noted by others and I would suggest the same filter clean out and your brush should work.  </li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t last as long as the Champion professional model that I had for yesrs.  </li>
            <li> Even after drying my hair 90% with a regular hairdryer, this brush would not dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have baby fine and thin hair...</li>
            <li> It is very cheaply made &amp; the \\&quot;Hi Lo Off\\&quot; button is difficult to use as it is not raised enough.  </li>
            <li> This is not easy because the end is not removable, but with a bit of work with a narrow, thin flat tool I was able to clean out the filter.  </li>
            <li> Saves so much time to add a little curl at the same time as drying.</li>
            <li> On those few occasions when my dryer has had to cool down if I have had to turn it off while using it,(it starts after about 3-5 minutes), I simply switch to doing my make-up, get my wardrobe together or get dressed.  </li>
            <li> Generally, I also don&#x27;t blow dry my hair just out of the shower anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other brushes made of metals and ceramics get too hot and tend to fry my delicate (very color processed) hair and make it look and feel dry brittle or frizzy.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, a decent product for the price as long as you aren&#x27;t expecting this thing to blow like a typical dryer.</li>
            <li> - Hot Air Brush slowly started to cut in &amp; out - &amp; finally just refused to work</li>
            <li> and I have a feeling it won&#x27;t last a long time.</li>
            <li> They now only sell the 1&amp;#34; model which gets caught in my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last long, though.  </li>
            <li> There is not enough power on this air bush to dry anything.  </li>
            <li> I have to mostly dry my hair with a regular dryer and then use this to get some style.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping I could use this hot air brush to not only dry those pockets of slightly damp hair, but also give the ends of my hair a little flip (and thus replace the flat-iron or curling iron).</li>
            <li> The hot air is not really hot enough to have any effect on thick or coarse hair.</li>
            <li> , I have used these for 15 years starting in London in the 90&#x27;s, could not live without them!</li>
            <li> Came without a screw on the end to keep the brush on the wand  - un useable .. too bad - nice piece of equipment otherwise.</li>
            <li> Also, as with any round brush, care must be taken to keep the implement from the layer of hair directly under it or you WILL tangle your hair.  </li>
            <li> Did not work at all for my long hair.</li>
            <li> Not a solution for long hair.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and never press the fatal &amp;#34;curl release&amp;#34; button with your long hair wound into the brush.</li>
            <li> Never wind the hair all the way to the end if you have long hair or you will get the brush stuck and have a nightmare trying to unwind it.</li>
            <li> Like, I spent a solid 15 minutes trying to get the brush out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Item is sturdy and expected to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have short shoulder length hair and only use the dryer every two or three days sometimes less.  </li>
            <li> It would take hours to use this brush to dry and curl my long hair.  </li>
            <li> Often I do not blow-dry my hair completely, and pockets of it are very slightly damp.</li>
            <li> I would turn the brush off between moving to a new section of hair to dry (which were small), and it still over heat.</li>
            <li> After reading some other reviews, I notice that even some of the 3-star reviews mention short product life.  </li>
            <li> However, I wish that some other manufacturer would make a similar product that lasts.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for a very long time.</li>
            <li> If you buy it to dry your hair, you will be unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> With dry hair, I spritz it with water and wait about 5 minutes to soften the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is faster since you are dealing with mostly dry</li>
            <li> The length of time it takes to dry and</li>
            <li> It styles your hair for you as you dry it and</li>
            <li> Dry it (almost)</li>
            <li> use after hair is 75% dry.</li>
            <li> You have to have your hair almost dry before you use it.  </li>
            <li> have used this product for a few yrs.now.i realy like it.its the only blow dryer that dryes and rotates with out pulling hair out.this is my 3rd.one in 5yrs.i like the way the bristles are made.not like a regular hair brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it will last a year if I am having this much trouble with only a couple of usage.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that after a year or two it begins to overheat frequently &amp; then automatically shuts off.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is my last two brushes have only lasted about 2 yrs each.</li>
            <li> If you press a button, the barrel becomes loose so you can unwind your hair</li>
            <li> With wet hair, I let it dry until it feels dry</li>
            <li> It never turned back on even when it cooled down.  </li>
            <li> Be careful, though if your hair is very long as it can grit tangled.</li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad it doesn&#x27;t really get that hot.</li>
            <li> The only plus side is that it appeared to make my hair feel slightly</li>
            <li> I actually use it to help make my curly hair less curly and to give my crown a lift.</li>
            <li> a week needless to say it broke fairly quickly</li>
            <li> And if used properly, will last at least six months or longer.</li>
            <li> Asking for a lesson from your stylist on how to properly use a round, bristled/</li>
            <li> If I go to a big in-town event, I still use a blow dryer and round brush.  </li>
            <li> You can use it with wet hair that been toweled</li>
            <li> Just wind it partially and experiment to see what works for you.</li>
            <li> I would not use it on soaking wet hair.  </li>
            <li> does it perfectly, not too hot or cold, keeps your hand free etc.</li>
            <li> It is not very powerful.</li>
            <li> I would probably have had to spend upwards of twenty minutes to get this brush to dry my (slightly) damp hair.</li>
            <li> A few days later she asked us if she can return it, since this is not very good: low or no heat.</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers have complained that the brush does not dry wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use other types.</li>

            <li> I am a African-American..and the texture of my hair is striaght, due to the relaxers/perms that I put in my hair.....</li>
            <li> See other review of mine.</li>
            <li> It works as well as my other air brush for drying  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting my hair wrapped, my hair is short, but the ends are fizzy and not straight...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the same amount of fluff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This blow dryer was too small for someone with long hair.</li>
            <li> Then it started making a rattling noise and now it over heats and powers down</li>
            <li> , it won&#x27;t turn on until it cools down.  </li>
            <li> I never could get the hang of using a round brush in one hand while holding a hair dryer in the other to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> I guess the one and a half inch barrel is meant for longer hair than mine.</li>
            <li> I do hope it lasts longer than my previous styler with the name Vidal Sasson on it.  </li>
            <li> This was to replace previous one that lasted 3 years.  </li>
            <li> Half way through drying my hair, it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I have seen they have one with a half inch barrel</li>
            <li> Since I can purchase those for so much less, I suppose I will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this is on its last leg and since they no longer make that product, I have been looking everywhere for something similar.  </li>
            <li> Hair must ALWAYS be at least 80% dry before switching from a conventional dryer to a heated brush.  </li>
            <li> than I would if I had a conventional blow dryer and a round hair brush.</li>
            <li> This dryer works well on mid-to longer hair...gives lift without tight curls.</li>
            <li> Provides a sleek, dried and styled look in half the time.  </li>
            <li> I maybe use it weekly or less, I don&#x27;t think it would stand up to everyday use.</li>
            <li> I had to wait a little while before I could get it to turn on again.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that has a very slight wave to it.</li>
            <li> Rotating round hot-air brushes are not meant to do so.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to a blow dryer and round brush, it has both pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this everyday ...</li>
            <li> but this things makes my hair frizzy fluffy looking.  </li>
            <li> I recently packed it in a suitcase for travel and when I arrived, almost all the bristles had broken off and was unusable.</li>
            <li> this is hardcore styling everyday...</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for any type of heavy duty use at all.</li>
            <li> with dust, etc after everyday use, it keeps turning itself off (a safety feature).  </li>
            <li> Gives me body without having to manage a round brush and blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my thumbs and cannot style my hair with a round brush and blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks, it sputtered and emitted a burning smell.</li>
            <li> This over heated after a few times of use.  </li>
            <li> The first few times I used this brush, my hair got tangled in it every time - badly tangled.</li>
            <li> If you are in a hurry, this can be frustrating, since you can&#x27;t predict how long it&#x27;ll take to re-start</li>
            <li> While my hair is thick, the bottom of my hair tends to weigh down the roots.  </li>
            <li> have chin length, slightly wavy, dyed, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Purchased another item in person but barrell was too small.  </li>
            <li> Mine usually goes for a year.</li>
            <li> No more hair dryer needed for me</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and this does not even come close to getting my hair dried let alone curled under.</li>
            <li> but it is helpful for drying underneath the hair and in the back when it is difficult to get the brush to roll through the hair.  </li>
            <li> It is twice the price of the Vidal Sassoon model and I can usually count on at least a few months&#x27; use from those before having to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but  was not able to use because I was diagnosed with cancer and lost all hair for two years.</li>
            <li> , sorta loud, very cheesy.</li>
            <li> Dries well, but a little awkward to use....too long.</li>
            <li> Of the 2 brushes that I bought, I hardly ever use this one, and opt for the John Frieda.</li>
            <li> would have kept that from happening to the reviewers who complained of burning their hair.  </li>
            <li> BUT... I have found over time now that I have to replace it at least every year as it burns itself out over heating and frying my hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s delicate.  </li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s the case for me.</li>
            <li> complaint:  </li>
            <li> The brands that rotate have softer bristles that don&#x27;t penetrate my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Very few places on line that I can find 1 1/2 inch barrel Air Brush!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced burned or heat-damaged hair from this dryer, but using common sense and heat-protective styling products, and not electrically drying hair every time it&#x27;s washed</li>
            <li> I felt like the quality was poor even for me</li>
            <li> My idiot moment cost me an hour of my life and several strands of hair untangling my hair from the brush.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, I&#x27;ve had two now.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> And because this one is all plastic/rubber, no more scorching!!!</li>
            <li> I was unable to find one &amp; settled for the Helen of Troy version.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I missed the return date by one day because I thought it was from the day I received it not on the day</li>
            <li> I was afraid they might not make it anymore.</li>
            <li> Sorry it&#x27;s a NO!</li>
            <li> as mentioned 7 years isn&#x27;t bad this days - heck -</li>
            <li> but I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Alittle disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing quality.</li>
            <li> Annoying isn&#x27;t even the word.  </li>
            <li> But im very frustrated and disappointed that another one broke</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> I will not be using this item, as it was disgusting to receive some hair care item, that was in some strangers hair!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Helen of Troy hot air brush for two years, and though I have noticed that it sometimes will not turn back on while the motor is over-hot, I have found that this rarely occurs. I have started occasionally vacuuming and brushing out the barrel, and since then, have not had overheating and shut-off issues.  Keeping the barrel free of dried hair product and lint seems to solve that problem.  Some other reviewers have complained that the brush does not dry wet hair.  Rotating round hot-air brushes are not meant to do so.  Hair must ALWAYS be at least 80% dry before switching from a conventional dryer to a heated brush.  Any salon stylist (and the instructions on most of these devices) will tell you that, regardless of using a hot air brush or old-fashioned round brush &amp; blow dryer, one should rough-dry one&#x27;s hair to about 80-90% dry (upside down for volume), then switch to the round brush &amp; dryer to create smoothness and/or curl.  Also, as with any round brush, care must be taken to keep the implement from the layer of hair directly under it or you WILL tangle your hair.  Using alligator or butterfly clips to section hair (then re-clamping dried section until it&#x27;s completely cool if making curls) will help create perfect hair.  Asking for a lesson from your stylist on how to properly use a round, bristled/toothed implement before attempting it yourself can be helpful.  The Helen of Troy hot air brush is NOT a rotating brush, as a few one-star reviewers have mistakenly believed.  It has a release button that slightly turns the barrel to loosen the hair for easy release from the bristles.  This feature works perfectly.  It is NOT meant to continuously rotate while drying. My fine, thick hair holds wave and curl for a couple of days when I dry it with this device, even though I live in humid Virginia.  It creates a smooth, shiny hair texture with body.  On those few occasions when my dryer has had to cool down if I have had to turn it off while using it,(it starts after about 3-5 minutes), I simply switch to doing my make-up, get my wardrobe together or get dressed.  In a couple of minutes, the dryer is cool again.  I&#x27;ve never experienced burned or heat-damaged hair from this dryer, but using common sense and heat-protective styling products, and not electrically drying hair every time it&#x27;s washed would have kept that from happening to the reviewers who complained of burning their hair.  I work in the film industry, and more than once, have been told by hair and make-up stylists that most hair and skin problems are operator-error, not product error-related.</li>
            <li> I loved what this did to my hair, but it just stopped working after a few months. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Leaves my hair smooth &amp; shiney</li>
            <li> I will buy anotherone again, a very good product.</li>
            <li> I have had this product before and like it a lot.  I have found if I begin drying my hair with a blow dryer and when hair is almost dry use the hot air brush to style, it makes the hot air brush last longer.</li>
            <li> Takes out frizz and gives my hair lots of soft curls, with added lift. May purchase the smaller barrel as well.</li>
            <li> Liked this blow dryer a lot because I have thick hair &amp; the bristles hold my hair better than other dryers I have tried...</li>
            <li> I always want to have one of these on hand.  It is a great STYLING tool.  If you buy it to dry your hair, you will be unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have chin length, slightly wavy, dyed, thick hair.  With wet hair, I let it dry until it feels dry but really isn&#x27;t.  With dry hair, I spritz it with water and wait about 5 minutes to soften the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to a blow dryer and round brush, it has both pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It is much easier to work with since only one hand is used.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It is faster since you are dealing with mostly dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The air blows right at the roots which makes lift and body there easy to get.&lt;br /&gt;4.  The barrel is easy to remove and clean.  Just soak it in water and all the old hair products wash off.&lt;br /&gt;5.  The teeth are soft and firm at the same time -- really nice, easy to deal with and feels good on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;6.  It is lighter weight so my arms don&#x27;t get tired.&lt;br /&gt;7.  It fixes bed hair fast.&lt;br /&gt;8.  It&#x27;s sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The Big One -- It blows air from the underside of the hair.  Air is pushed up through the hair and creates fuzzy, flyaway hair.&lt;br /&gt;2.  You can&#x27;t pull the hair taut for a super smooth finish because the brush tangles up in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It&#x27;s hard to get the same amount of fluff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of the cons, this is the tool I use most often and take on vacation.  It is so easy to use and the results are quite satisfactory.  If I go to a big in-town event, I still use a blow dryer and round brush.  For everything else, I use this.</li>
            <li> My favorite hot air brush.</li>
            <li> I so love this brush.  I had one and wore it out.  I will buy another one to keep on hand</li>
            <li> I love this hot air brush!  It helps to control the frizz and smooths my hair.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is ok.  I had a diff. one by another company which was way better but can&#x27;t seem to find it on the internet.</li>
            <li> Works great and it saves time when styling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I will always use Helen of Troy. Great way to go.</li>
            <li> I received my air brush faster then if I had went out and bought it myself!  Wow!  It was exactly what I wanted.  Doesn&#x27;t my hair look pretty?  :^)</li>
            <li> This is my second Hot Air Brush that I wanted for our second home.  I was glad I was able to purchase the exact same one I currently  have.  I am very please with it.</li>
            <li> It is excelent for styling the hair. It is easy yo use, i am happy with it. I recomiend it for all women</li>
            <li> Okay...where do I start? It does not rotate like it says it does. You turn it on...off to grab another piece of hair and it won&#x27;t turn back on again!! Awful!</li>
            <li> I believe they indicated that you could blow dry your hair and curl it with this hot air bush.  There is not enough power on this air bush to dry anything.  It would take hours to use this brush to dry and curl my long hair.  I use it only to curl my bangs and it does an ok job but that is about it.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday ...it gives just the right amount of curl</li>
            <li> Bought 2 air brushes at the same time; the Helen of Troy 1.5 and the John Frieda 1.5 air brush. Of the 2, the John Frieda is my favored one. The Helen of Troy brush has rigid bristles which I really like, but it has less power than the John Frieda. The rigid bristles are great for my thick hair, but the air isn&#x27;t strong enough or warm enough to dry the hair at all. I have to mostly dry my hair with a regular dryer and then use this to get some style.  The package says the barrel rotates and I thought that meant that it turned electronically (which is why I bought it), but let me be clear, IT DOES NOT ROTATE. It does have a button that releases the barrel manually so that it can spin when you curl your hair up onto the barrel and then pull it off.  Of the 2 brushes that I bought, I hardly ever use this one, and opt for the John Frieda. My wish would be for one to be much more powerful and to rotate and to have strong bristles to pull the hair straight, but this one does fit those requirements.</li>
            <li> I guess the one and a half inch barrel is meant for longer hair than mine.</li>
            <li> Great hair accessory, have used it for many years and could not get along without it!</li>
            <li> Helen of Troy always has great products and I bought this to replace my mom&#x27;s old one which broke after 10 + years. It works as well as the other one did and allows her to save time getting ready in the morning. Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like my Helen of troy 1573 Tangle Free Hot Air Brush, White, 1 1/2 inchens Barrel.  I replace my old one that lasted for 4 years.  Would like to have a larger roll though.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000A2RQQE HELEN OF TROY Hot Air Brush 1 1/2 inch Barrel Tangle Free with Soft Grip Textured Handle (Model: 1573R)]]  In the past I have purchased a very similar 1 1/2\\&quot; Hot Air Brush under the name of Vidal Sasoon.  I was unable to find one &amp; settled for the Helen of Troy version.  It is very cheaply made &amp; the \\&quot;Hi Lo Off\\&quot; button is difficult to use as it is not raised enough.  I have since found the Vidal Sassoon version (Vidal Sassoon VS432C 1.5) &amp; plan on stocking up.  I hope the manufacturer of Helen of Troy version will read this &amp; improve the quality of their product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hot air brush because of the brand.  It works great!  Really enjoy how it dries my hair as it&#x27;s styling it.</li>
            <li> my old one lasted 8 years... great brand...glad I found it on line...they were all out in the stores i visited</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and as a gift for my mom... she loved it.  I wish the bristles had a little more grip on my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why but this things makes my hair frizzy fluffy looking.  I have a hard time getting my hair wrapped, my hair is short, but the ends are fizzy and not straight... perhaps because it&#x27;s being blown away from the dryer..  I  just don&#x27;t care for look.  Sorry it&#x27;s a NO!</li>
            <li> Thought this was going to be a good durable product - died after 6 months of infrequent (&lt; i per week) use. After reading some other reviews, I notice that even some of the 3-star reviews mention short product life.  Is there some reason that no manufacturer can make a hot air brush that lasts longer than a year?</li>
            <li> have used this product for a few yrs.now.i realy like it.its the only blow dryer that dryes and rotates with out pulling hair out.this is my 3rd.one in 5yrs.i like the way the bristles are made.not like a regular hair brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would save me some time getting ready in the morning, but you have to pretty much completely dry your hair prior to using it and I still felt it didn&#x27;t work that well. It&#x27;s not well made.</li>
            <li> I have used this exact product for years.  But in the last year ive gone through three of them!!  Ridiculous!  I have short shoulder length hair and only use the dryer every two or three days sometimes less.  They last about three months then just stop working completely.  I have been a loyal Helen of Troy user for years and usually rave about them.  But im very frustrated and disappointed that another one broke and i only just bought it in March!  Now I have to try and find something similar but made by someone else.</li>
            <li> This is my second Helen of Troy Hot Air Brush.  The first lasted many, many years.  I love them!  I have shoulder length hair, so I first use a blow dryer so I don&#x27;t have to overdo it with the hot air brush.  I use it to turn my ends under and add a little volume on top.</li>
            <li> I love this brush except that the plastic bristles fall off. At home, it lasted for several months. I recently packed it in a suitcase for travel and when I arrived, almost all the bristles had broken off and was unusable.</li>
            <li> I had bought one here in my town and paid a lot more for that one then I did this. It was worth it because it really does a great job for me on my hair.</li>
            <li> I felt like the quality was poor even for me and I don&#x27;t style my hair very often. it would never work for somebody this is hardcore styling everyday... It didn&#x27;t really work for me and I style my hair maybe once a week needless to say it broke fairly quickly and I won&#x27;t buy  product from this company again</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different types of heated brush styling products and I am truly in love with this one. The forced warm/hot air gently dries my hair and styles it while making it soft silky and smooth. other brushes made of metals and ceramics get too hot and tend to fry my delicate (very color processed) hair and make it look and feel dry brittle or frizzy. It has a comfortable grip handle and the release button really does make this brush fairly tangle proof. I can use this product for a number of styles on dry or damp hair with little or no styling product and I get great results. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this hot air brush.  I bought it to replace a Vidal Sassoon 1 1/2 inch barrel brush that I had that quit.  This is the size that works best for me.  I plan to buy another so that I don&#x27;t get caught without one in case this one quits.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely not a blow dryer meant for a head full of wet hair. It&#x27;s possibly ok for finishing out a style on damp hair. I&#x27;ve had a Jilbere blow dryer brush for several years that is much better than this one, but it&#x27;s a 1 inch size and I wanted to try a 1 1/2 inch size for my bangs. This Helen of Troy brush dryer is ok but I&#x27;m not that thrilled with it. It doesn&#x27;t have much power at all and I have a feeling it won&#x27;t last a long time. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for any type of heavy duty use at all.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all for my long hair. Doesn&#x27;t get very hot. No power. Returned it immediately. Not a solution for long hair.</li>
            <li> The motor is already burned out . Need a refund. I was extremely dissatisfied. Will never by this brand again if I can help.</li>
            <li> I still use it, but it never rotated.  It does smooth my hair and give it fullness.  Good for second day hair.</li>
            <li> Gave to daughter, she said it works good</li>
            <li> Love the product... Exactly what I need it just doesn&#x27;t last as long as other hot curling brushes...</li>
            <li> Very few places on line that I can find 1 1/2 inch barrel Air Brush!  Great price/great product!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product at least t 6 times because I liked the way it works...WHEN IT WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;DONT ( i repeat DON&#x27;T) expect it to last more than 2 months.  Some only lasted weeks.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason there are not many blow dryers of this kind that heat from the inside out on the market.  there should be.&lt;br /&gt;So I resorted to buying this one multiple times. OVERHEATS AND CONKS OUT&lt;br /&gt;  My last one lasted thru 4 blow dries and DIED... I am done with it now.</li>
            <li> Its the best thing to use when hair is wet for you can dry and style at the same time instead of drying first then styling after. The length of time it takes to dry and style is according to your hair length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I will order another one so I can have one for traveling. Is there a carrying case for this brush as it can be cumbersome due to the electrical cord being rolled around the brush when packing and unpacking and does get tangled many a times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ela, Guam</li>
            <li> I had one of these for a very long time. Got used to it so much I can&#x27;t use other types. My hair is shoulder-length and it works great.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my hair and very fast.  This size brush really helps to keep my thinning hair looking fuller.</li>
            <li> Love this hot air brush. Comfortable soft grip/non slip handle, very good air flow considering its size, thus allowing for easy effortless styling and professional salon styling results. Overall, an excellent product at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> Purchased another item in person but barrell was too small.  This is perfect for my mid length hair.  Item is sturdy and expected to last a long time.  Priced well for the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Helen of Troy since the mid-90s. I have to replace it about every 3 or 4 years or so when the motor will start to konk out but I think that&#x27;s reasonable for such an inexpensive styling tool that I use almost every day. And though I&#x27;ve tried other similar hot air brushes, I always come back to this one. I have fine wavy hair and this styles it perfectly in just minutes, making it sleek, straight and smooth. Major props to this company for continuing to make such a stellar product.</li>
            <li> This is the nest drying curling brush I have every owned. Makes my hair fuzz fess and shiney and have had two and will always buy sgain</li>
            <li> Have had several of these...Great hot air brushes!!</li>
            <li> Great styling brush and love the way your hair comes right out after pressing the button.</li>
            <li> Have used this hot air brush for years.  The price is great considering it is usually used every day.  And if used properly, will last at least six months or longer. Mine usually goes for a year. Depends on the amount of hair you wrap around it and if the hair is cleaned off it after every use.  It will  over heat and eventually stop working if you use too much hair at one time and you don&#x27;t clean the hair off each time.</li>
            <li> My order was for the 1 1/2 inch barrel but I received the 1 inch barrell</li>
            <li> love this brush perfect for mid length hair I use mine every day ! No more hair dryer needed for me</li>
            <li> I love these stylers.  I do hope it lasts longer than my previous styler with the name Vidal Sasson on it.  I think it&#x27;s made by the same factory, it looks the same except for the colors used.</li>
            <li> Blow air but no heat... do not know how to return if it heated it would most likely be great.</li>
            <li> Nothing last&#x27;s forever - hence the 4 star&#x27;s - her original Helen of Troy (really ?) - Hot Air Brush slowly started to cut in &amp; out - &amp; finally just refused to work - I took a quick look at it &amp; wasn&#x27;t comfortable messing with AC current &amp; just bought her a new one - out of all the brands out there - I trust this one ... as mentioned 7 years isn&#x27;t bad this days - heck - most PC&#x27;s don&#x27;t last that long !!!</li>
            <li> I love the hot air brush!! It styles your hair for you as you dry it and it very quiet. I&#x27;ve had ones before that were loud. This one is perfect!</li>
            <li> Wonder when someone will come up with a solution to tangled cords... this product is good the button is a bit stiff to release brush...</li>
            <li> Exactly as promised!  This was a great product at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Hair does not tangle.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a hot air brush, this one is great. The reason for 4 stars is this will be my second one. I use mine daily, and they only last a couple years. My mom is a hair dresser, and this is the one she recommends as well. I ordered from Amazon because it is about $10.00 cheaper than the beauty supply store even with the discount. It came in great condition, and fast.</li>
            <li> The first time that I turned it on, the handle got extremely hot (and no hot air ever came out of the brush) then quit worked.  It never turned back on even when it cooled down.  I returned it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I did like the size and brush.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  This was to replace previous one that lasted 3 years.  It has a thermostat that is sensitive and when it gets&lt;br /&gt;clogged with dust, etc after everyday use, it keeps turning itself off (a safety feature).  There doesn&#x27;t appear to be any method to&lt;br /&gt;open it up to clear the lint.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush over heats fast. Half way through drying my hair, it stopped working. I had to wait a little while before I could get it to turn on again. I would turn the brush off between moving to a new section of hair to dry (which were small), and it still over heat. It is not very powerful. The only positive thing is it did make my hair look silky straight with a nice curl at the end. I don&#x27;t believe it will last a year if I am having this much trouble with only a couple of usage.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  Be careful, though if your hair is very long as it can grit tangled.</li>
            <li> My sister has a rotating styler. I thought I was buying one that rotated on its own. It does not. I will try to use it but I am disappointed. May have to return and spend more on one that rotates on its own.</li>
            <li> Several times when I was using this product, it would stop working.  It would not reset.  I would unplug it and wait.  It still would not work.  The next time I tried it would work.  Then it would stop working.  I finally returned it.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this about 5 years ago and needed a replacement. I was afraid they might not make it anymore. But here it was on Amazon. I never get tangles with this!</li>
            <li> It was great for about two weeks. Then it started making a rattling noise and now it over heats and powers down and you have to wait for it to cool off before you can turn it on again. Very cheaply made product for the price.</li>
            <li> I do love this hot air brush.  My hair does not get tangled in it.  Dry it (almost) then begin the curls.  Works perfect for me!</li>
            <li> I have previously given this item a 5 star rating because I love the product BUT... I have found over time now that I have to replace it at least every year as it burns itself out over heating and frying my hair.  The last one I got only lasted 5 months and I had to replace it.  When I got this one in the mail to replace the last one I opened the box and slid it out and the end screw wasn&#x27;t even attached and the whole thing fell apart in my hands.  My husband was standing there and took over putting it back together.  It is working alright but sounds funny like it might not last very long either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something is definitely going on with the quality control of this item.  I have very fine shoulder length hair that I let air dry about 75% and then use this hot air brush to blow the ends under.  I only have it on about 3-4 minutes at most so one would think the product would last longer than a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I may have to find a replacement product eventually as I don&#x27;t appreciate having to replace it this often.</li>
            <li> It works very well but occasionally it trips the circuit breaker.</li>
            <li> Misunderstood what this item does. I wanted a heated brush to curl my hair not a hair dryer with brush. My hair is thick and this does not even come close to getting my hair dried let alone curled under.</li>
            <li> It worked great for about 3 months, when it quit entirely. It frequently shut itself off and would not restart until it cooled off.&lt;br /&gt;I replaced it with a Conair for about the same price that works much better.</li>
            <li> This product is overpriced. The one I purchased is already not working properly. I wish I would have gone to Walmart,I. returned two HELEN Of TROY appliances, I was only issued a credit for one. I will do my on line ordering, with another webb site, I do not like not being treated fairly. THX, for your time.</li>
            <li> Second one that I have purchased over time.  Like it alot</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t last as long as the Champion professional model that I had for yesrs.  You&#x27;re lucky if you get a year out of one of these. I&#x27;ve owned 3 of these now, time to find another product. Very disappointing quality.</li>
            <li> I have used Helen of Troy for years and it straightens my slightly naturally curly hair easily and quickly.  I love this product and own several, one I keep in my luggage/travel bag and one that I use daily.  I prefer the 1&amp;#34; smaller brush.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and never press the fatal &amp;#34;curl release&amp;#34; button with your long hair wound into the brush. My idiot moment cost me an hour of my life and several strands of hair untangling my hair from the brush. Otherwise, a decent product for the price as long as you aren&#x27;t expecting this thing to blow like a typical dryer. Gives me body without having to manage a round brush and blow dryer. Especially useful on the back of my hair as my hair is very thick and about 18&amp;#34; long.</li>
            <li> my 3rd one in over 20 years, the best</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews about this hot air brush, and I&#x27;ve owned and replace one for quite some time. Everything the reviews say are true....it can over heat, and it will wear out after approx a year. BUT...a lot of us keep replacing it because there is nothing out there that I know of that performs as well. I also found that you can prolong the life and prevent the overheating if you keep the vents on the end of the handle clean (found this out from other helpful reviews).</li>
            <li> I buy one of these about every two or three years, when one wears out, I&#x27;m ordering a new one! They work very well, and save time by drying and styling your hair, at the same time!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and the one I had finally \\&quot;bit the dust\\&quot;.  I went straight to Amazon.com, found another one, and ordered it immediately.  It does exactly what I need for my hair that is colored, somewhat fine (although a lot of it), and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Bought a drying brush, and it didn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; when I bought it. Product showed up with dirt and hair on it. It was most definitely USED. I will not be using this item, as it was disgusting to receive some hair care item, that was in some strangers hair! I WILL NEVER buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> This hot air brush styler is convenient, easy-to-fit-in-the-hand, and maneuverable.  Only problem is that, over time and as it ages, it will start to react to heat by stopping temporarily.  If you are in a hurry, this can be frustrating, since you can&#x27;t predict how long it&#x27;ll take to re-start so you can finish styling your hair.  Overall, however - especially when it is fairly new - it&#x27;s an excellent and handy tool.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer was too small for someone with long hair. You can use it with wet hair that been toweled dry.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad it doesn&#x27;t really get that hot. The hot setting is not that hot. I did like the hard plastic brush, but it is more for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;If they had said that in the description, I would not have purchased it. Unfortunately, I missed the return date by one day because I thought it was from the day I received it not on the day I ordered it. Bummer, because I will not be using it.</li>
            <li> I love this hot air brush.  I have course wiry hair and this is the only brush that will tame it and make it look good.  I have two of these brushes in case one goes belly up.</li>
            <li> I love this!! However since the day I bought this it shuts off after +-10-15 minutes of use. It doesn&#x27;t feel as if it&#x27;s overheated..which is the ONLY reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars. It works great otherwise and does a good job of smoothing and volumizing</li>
            <li> Too large of a barrel for my hair.</li>
            <li> This curling brush works great and I got it at a good price. Fast shipping as well. They don&#x27;t last forever so I will buy another just like it when this one quits.</li>
            <li> This is being written by the wife, not Mark.  This is a super product and is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased.  My original hot air brush is  at least 10 years old, still running, but I didn&#x27;t want to take a chance so I bought a new &#x27;back up&#x27; brush.  I have baby fine and thin hair...it&#x27;s delicate.  The nice rubber tips on the brush don&#x27;t tangle or damage my hair and the unit is very easy to handle.  This is one of my favorite beauty products EVER!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am a African-American..and the texture of my hair is striaght, due to the relaxers/perms that I put in my hair.....and it gave me no body....and tangled my hair...</li>
            <li> This device doesn&#x27;t really work - it blows MUCH less air than any other hot air brush i&#x27;ve ever seen. I kept it mainly because it does style hair, but it certainly won&#x27;t dry it.</li>
            <li> We bought this for a friend that moved here from Europe. A few days later she asked us if she can return it, since this is not very good: low or no heat.</li>
            <li> Love this. It really is tangle free with my silky, fine hair. I actually don&#x27;t mind doing my hair in the morning anymore. Before, I had something similar but whatever the brush was made of really tangled my hair.</li>
            <li> Love how it smoothes and adds body to my soft silky hair</li>
            <li> I use the Helen of Troy for many years and it is perfect for my fine and straight hair.  I don&#x27;t want to miss it</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever; thanks.  Second time around ordering; one for my sister and one for me.  Would give as a gift.</li>
            <li> When I used this for the first time, I did not experience any kind of awakening and there was no soft euphoric hum in the background. What can I say, this dryer is just okay. I experienced a couple of tangles when in use and the bristles are way to soft to style with. If I had to do over, I would purchase something else.</li>
            <li> I was looking all over fora brush of this style, like ones I&#x27;ve had before.I was so glad to findone.It is easy to use and Ilike it very much</li>
            <li> Love this Hot Air Brush, but it would shut off after using it for about six months.  After reading a professionals review about cleaning the filter, I found it is necessary to to clean out the filter at the end of the brush.  This is not easy because the end is not removable, but with a bit of work with a narrow, thin flat tool I was able to clean out the filter.  The hot air brush now works like new.  This same complaint has been noted by others and I would suggest the same filter clean out and your brush should work.  I also would suggest to Helen of Troy that a twist off end would be the solution for the clean out.</li>
            <li> Love these air brushes, work great</li>
            <li> I love this for my thick coarse colored hair. use after hair is 75% dry. Easy release button. I like this product better than bristle brush hot air dryers. Great soft waves or curls. I use with Kenra Hot Spray to set curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) con - you cannot interchange rollers. you have to buy a whole different brush if you want a smaller roll.&lt;br /&gt;2) pro-  these brushes last anywhere from 3-5 years&lt;br /&gt;3) con-gets hot and if you shut it off, it won&#x27;t come back on, until it cools down. I use my regular blow dryer set on cool to blow cool air onto the hot air brush. It comes back on right away.</li>
            <li> Burned out motor in 8 months of use...Seems to be a problem with this brand</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service</li>
            <li> The product lasted a couple of months before overheating and now barely runs for longer than a minute.  Will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without these convenient hairdryers.  They are the best.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do when they stop making them.</li>
            <li> Great for that extra fullness some of us need.  I bought two!!!  I never want to be without it for even one day.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it! It&#x27;s exactly what she wanted, so I remain out of the doghouse - for a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hair dryer and styler in one.  Not as effective as a curling iron but much less damaging to the hair.  Provides a sleek, dried and styled look in half the time.  Perfect for travel too, as it&#x27;s fast, does not remain hot and can be packed right after use.</li>
            <li> I used when my hair was chin length and longer. I have seen they have one with a half inch barrel and I could probably use that because I really like this product. It is great for getting rid of frizz and smoothing the hair into a sleek shiny affair</li>
            <li> I always use a hot air brush after my frizzy hair is 1/2 way dry. My old 1 is on it&#x27;s last leg so I got this one. I used it  twice and I do like it , it work well, but as long as my old favorite 1 works I will use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be a good alternative to my InStyler. It does not &#x27;rotate&#x27;. If you press a button, the barrel becomes loose so you can unwind your hair I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone, like me, expecting a &#x27;spinning&#x27; barrel when you read &#x27;rotating&#x27; barrel, look elsewhere. Infinity makes one that actually spins</li>
            <li> I love this product. This is my second one. My first one was so old i burned it out. I&#x27;ll keep using this product. Just love it.</li>
            <li> love it!  had a similar one which i wore out and couldn&#x27;t find a replacement until i found this one!</li>
            <li> See other review of mine.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my thumbs and cannot style my hair with a round brush and blow dryer. The blow brush works perfectly and gives my hair the same results without causing me any pain. In fact it&#x27;s much easier to use because I can use my free hand to separate the hair. For anyone who has difficulty styling their hair the conventional way - using a blow brush is a wonderful and effective alternative!</li>
            <li> This is helpful to smooth hair without adding bulk, I would like a little more power but it is helpful for drying underneath the hair and in the back when it is difficult to get the brush to roll through the hair.  Would buy again- the plastic bristles work becasue they don&#x27;t tangle in the hair.</li>
            <li> Love it, have used the Vidal Sassoon for years but can&#x27;t find it, also threw away the big brush with the burnt out one last time and could not find the big size brush anywhere.  It has just like the VS, works perfectly, I have used these for 15 years starting in London in the 90&#x27;s, could not live without them!</li>
            <li> Great Product! I works well for styling my hair. The heating element burnse out after 6 months. I would be great if  this&lt;br /&gt;would last longer.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great for what&#x27;s it&#x27;s meant to do:  add body and light control. Since it doesn&#x27;t have dense bristles or much force, it isn&#x27;t going to dramatically change hair shape or texture, but it leaves a very natural, soft look. Since airflow isn&#x27;t strong, it takes a little time to shape the hair, even if it&#x27;s mostly dry. At least that&#x27;s the case for me. I have ultra-short wavy hair and got the 1\\&quot;. Going to try the 3/4\\&quot; and maybe the two together would be just right. I think for longer, fine hair, it would be absolutely terrific! Also great for someone with arthritis or weakness in arms and hands. Doesn&#x27;t burn at all. Just mildly hot at most. As others have said, it&#x27;s handy for quick touch-ups on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint:  I wish there was an option for auto rotation of the barrel/brush. The brands that rotate have softer bristles that don&#x27;t penetrate my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased to discover this type of hot air brush with a barrel larger than the 1\\&quot; diameter Vidal Sassoon I have used for years (in spite of all the problems I and other users have had with that product.) I have tried many other brand&#x27;s designs, but found none that worked for my fine, chin-length hair.&lt;br /&gt;When I received this one, I knew it would not last. The barrel might be larger, but the handle and motor are identical to the Vidal Sassoon except for the color.&lt;br /&gt;I should have returned it immediately, but used it anyway and was pleased for a short time. After several uses, I heard the motor&#x27;s now-familiar rattle. Within a few weeks, it sputtered and emitted a burning smell. I don&#x27;t dare plug it in again.&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase another. It is twice the price of the Vidal Sassoon model and I can usually count on at least a few months&#x27; use from those before having to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product one star only because I can still use the barrel; it fits on a Vidal Sassoon handle. Since I can purchase those for so much less, I suppose I will continue to do so. However, I wish that some other manufacturer would make a similar product that lasts.</li>
            <li> I have used the large barrel hot brush for years, and the rubber-type bristles never tangle my fine hair. It&#x27;s perfect for just the right amount of shaping.</li>
            <li> This type of hot air brush works well for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again only with a smaller barrel size.</li>
            <li> My loves this.  This is her second one.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my wife wanted.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It makes styling my hair so much easier than holding a dryer and a brush.  My fine hair does not tangle in it either.  My only complaint is that after a year or two it begins to overheat frequently &amp; then automatically shuts off.  It takes a while to cool down and cannot be used for more than a few minutes before it overheats again.  When this happens you just have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Ok but wish it would heat up more. Will do until I find a better one</li>
            <li> Wish I could take the cover off on the bottom to be able to clear lint so that motor doesn&#x27;t burn out. Motor changed speed on its own first time I used it (I guess when a hair gets in there). Otherwise works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying a hair dryer/brush combo. I was very disappointed.  The brush is only 250 watts, which is almost nothing.  Even after drying my hair 90% with a regular hairdryer, this brush would not dry my hair.  Even 20 minutes later all I had was really frizzy, partially wet hair!  Ugh.. returned it!</li>
            <li> Came without a screw on the end to keep the brush on the wand  - un useable .. too bad - nice piece of equipment otherwise.</li>
            <li> The teeth are easy on my hair and a soft plastic. My only complaint is my last two brushes have only lasted about 2 yrs each. It is the only product that I have found with the soft teeth.</li>
            <li> It works as well as my other air brush for drying  but the tangle fee does not work very well.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve had this air brush and the smaller one for about a month now and I use them every day. So far they are holding up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who experience tangles, you really do have to get used to using a hot air brush. There is a technique to it. Never wind the hair all the way to the end if you have long hair or you will get the brush stuck and have a nightmare trying to unwind it. Just wind it partially and experiment to see what works for you. This large brush is great for smoothing and maybe adding a slight curve to the ends. It it too big to actually curl. I use it to smooth my hair after washing. If I want curl I would use a curling iron or the cone-shaped curling wand.</li>
            <li> My hair is colored and highlighted.  My last metal core hot-air brush (Conair 1000 watt) left my hair scorched and brittle.  This Helen of Troy works perfectly to smooth and add a hint of curl and body.  It is also much lighter in weight then my last one.  And because this one is all plastic/rubber, no more scorching!!!</li>
            <li> I have two....one for travel and one for home.  Love, love, LOVE these wonderful hair tools!</li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve used this brand for years, for some reason this new one isn&#x60;t as powerful as the ones I&#x60;ve had before.  Alittle disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product for years from Ulta.  They now only sell the 1&amp;#34; model which gets caught in my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 1-1/2&amp;#34; is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love my hot air brush.  I have ordered them before.  They don&#x27;t last long, though.  After several months of use, they tend to heat up and turn off automatically.  After a while, they only stay on for a minute at a time.  While they do work, they work great.</li>
            <li> Loved it.........works great......but has a tendacy to shut off easily overheats. Unit may have a short life span. Dont know yet</li>
            <li> I choose it according to many happy reviews and want to add one more to it. I use it for several months and am very pleased. I does exactly what I expect, my hair is rather short and mainly I need to lift and direct it, not much curling and Helen of Troy does it perfectly, not too hot or cold, keeps your hand free etc. Nice product. Thanks</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this. I have long, thick hair that has a very slight wave to it. Normally, after washing my hair, I blow-dry it and then either flat-iron it to make it sleek and glossy, or occasionally I take a curling iron to it. Often I do not blow-dry my hair completely, and pockets of it are very slightly damp. I was hoping I could use this hot air brush to not only dry those pockets of slightly damp hair, but also give the ends of my hair a little flip (and thus replace the flat-iron or curling iron). This hot air brush accomplished neither task. I would probably have had to spend upwards of twenty minutes to get this brush to dry my (slightly) damp hair. It also did not do anything in the way of adding a curl or even a flip to the ends of my hair, even after multiple, prolonged attempts. The hot air is not really hot enough to have any effect on thick or coarse hair. The only plus side is that it appeared to make my hair feel slightly softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush also does not rotate, despite what the box and the description says. Maybe I got a defective product, but it did not rotate for me. Even if it had, I don&#x27;t think that would&#x27;ve helped.</li>
            <li> I bought this Helen of Troy 1574 Tangle Free Hot Air Brush, White, 1 Inch Barrel for my mom and I was very impressed when I used it on my daughter just to show my mom how to use it, you can get nice curls and straight hair without having to spend a long time doing it.</li>
            <li> I like that this hot air brush has a fairly large barrel to add extra lift to my hair that was cut too short recently. I&#x27;m  hating it until it grows back out.</li>
            <li> This dryer works well on mid-to longer hair...gives lift without tight curls. It&#x27;s especially good with a light mousse or gel.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for years and needed a backup. Does not seems to get too hot like some of the brushes with metal bases. Will order again.</li>
            <li> It help me when the weather is humid and my is frizzy.  It straighten my hair and gives me great results.  The sellet is prompt.  Excellent service.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used this brush, my hair got tangled in it every time - badly tangled. Like, I spent a solid 15 minutes trying to get the brush out of my hair. The few times I was able to get the brush through one section of my hair without issue, I didn&#x27;t see much difference. My hair was still a little frizzy and still very straight. I was expecting more volume and a sleeker, bouncier look. I don&#x27;t think this brush puts out enough hot air to be a styling tool.</li>
            <li> About ten years ago, I bought a similar brush that was made by Videl Sassoon.  Needless to say, this is on its last leg and since they no longer make that product, I have been looking everywhere for something similar.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many different brushes I have purchased only to find out that they did not perform the way my original brush did. FINALLY I found this brush and it is perfect!!!  So perfect that I just bought a second one so that when this one dies in ten years, I will have a replacement!!  :-)</li>
            <li> Seems that you can&#x27;t find these in the store(s) anymore.  I am so happy I can get them online.  I can&#x27;t do without it.  Its a great way to style your hair and also to &#x27;pick it up&#x27; after a day at work before going out again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay turned on.  You have to have your hair almost dry before you use it.  Once it gets hot, it turns off.  Annoying isn&#x27;t even the word.  You are styling your hair and it turns off because it&#x27;s hot.  Isn&#x27;t a hot air brush supposed to get hot?  Poor quality, I&#x27;ve had two now.  I was hoping the first one was defective but the new one is the same, turns off after 30 seconds?  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s some safety thing built in so it doesn&#x27;t burn up, but it should be able to stay on when it&#x27;s hot.  The first one I had lasted over a year but then just never turned back on.  I wish there was a better one on the market for an affordable price.  The next price on these is over a hundred dollars.  I worry about buying one because it might be as junky as this one.</li>
            <li> This works on synthetic hair using the *Low Setting* only.  I get really great results w/out damage.. Plus the default shipping from this company was Priority, so I received in 2 days. Happy..</li>
            <li> This over heated after a few times of use.  Also, it made my hair greasy!</li>
            <li> I wanted an &amp;#34;air&amp;#34; curler that didn&#x27;t make skinny  curls - this is great. I actually use it to help make my curly hair less curly and to give my crown a lift.</li>
            <li> works very well and makes a bigger curve than the smaller size</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  For the most part, it cuts out the need for a blowdryer, vented hairbrush and a curling iron.  I use it when my hair is just damp.  I would not use it on soaking wet hair.  Generally, I also don&#x27;t blow dry my hair just out of the shower anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair that will hold any shape without using a super hot tool.  While my hair is thick, the bottom of my hair tends to weigh down the roots.  I like that I can easily give my roots volume with this hot air brush.  I have so much more control with this than I would if I had a conventional blow dryer and a round hair brush.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it arrived almost next day. Thank you for great service. A++++</li>
            <li> #1 ALWAYS USE HEAT PROTECTION ON YOUR HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I have no problem with mine. It works as it should.&lt;br /&gt;-My mother and I both have one and neither of us have experienced any problems. She has had hers for 2 years or so and it&#x27;s going strong.&lt;br /&gt;-I know how to round brush my own hair and this -This pulls out the curly parts near my scalp. I can&#x27;t do that with a brush and blow dryer.  This makes it a lot easier on my arms.&lt;br /&gt;-This pulls out the curly parts near my scalp. I can&#x27;t do that with a brush and blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;-I use mine on damp hair. If I am in a hurry I&#x27;ll blast my hair with the blow dryer then use this. I&#x27;ll use a heat protection spray to dampen every section.&lt;br /&gt;-It give s me a lot of volume leaving my hair smooth, soft and I think the little bit of curl it gives is nice.</li>
            <li> Dries well, but a little awkward to use....too long.</li>
            <li> I use this everytime I wash my hair.  It&#x27;s more for should length or longer hair, but I use it for my &amp;#34;just below the ear&amp;#34; hair which makes your hair more straight than anything (which is how most of the world wears their hair).</li>
            <li> Great product and better than the Vidal Sassoon. Worth the extra bucks for the added touches.</li>
            <li> I have two of these hot air brushes....I leave one at home and one at my daughter&#x27;s house across the country.  I have shoulder-length air and the size of the brush gives me smooth hair with body.  Since there&#x27;s no hot metal touching my hair, it seems to stay healthier and doesn&#x27;t break as much as with a hot curling iron.</li>
            <li> I love this hot air brush!  I never could get the hang of using a round brush in one hand while holding a hair dryer in the other to style my hair.  This brush takes care of the problem for it does both in one hand.  I hope to buy a larger one too if it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> Saves so much time to add a little curl at the same time as drying.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length and baby fine but plentiful. This air brush gives it just enough body to not have those stick straight edges. I can also get lift near the scalp. I have had one of these in my hair arsenal for over ten years. It is the single most important grooming tool I own.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t bough one of these in a while. It works but I would never call it powerful, sorta loud, very cheesy. I maybe use it weekly or less, I don&#x27;t think it would stand up to everyday use.</li>
            <li> It feels like a toy.  There is not enough difference between the high and low settings.</li>
            <li> This cuts out sometimes when it gets hot!</li>
            <li> I had bought this product years ago but  was not able to use because I was diagnosed with cancer and lost all hair for two years. Finally my hair has grown! My hair is now mid length. I had been using my curling iron to style my hair. I reached in my cabinet and rediscovered the tool. Wow, It gives my hair body and a smooth straight look. Gentle on my hair!</li>
            <li> I have owned three of these.  It is absolutely the easiest product to style my hair.  However, it overheats fairly easily and it if you need to turn it off to answer the phone or some other interuption, it won&#x27;t turn on until it cools down.  This is ultimately why I have had three.</li>
            <li> Great product, have been using for quite sometime  now, and still wish I had purchased earlier.  Gives my hair a soft and smooth curl and does not get tangled.</li>
