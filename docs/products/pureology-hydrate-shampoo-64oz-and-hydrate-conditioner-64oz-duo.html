            <li>This shampoo and conditioner are great.  </li>

            <li>Great smells, too.</li>

            <li>so it is great if you have had a keratin treatment 5 star</li>
            <li>great product and the price was great compared to salon prices.</li>
            <li>Packaging has been great and all tops have been taped.</li>
            <li>You will not find another brand better!!</li>
            <li>Now I have to nicely tell my hairdresser that I no longer need her product!  </li>
            <li>Loved this product never use anything else always looking for a great price.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell it smells like hair dye.</li>
            <li>What a great buy on one of my favorite beauty products!  </li>
            <li>Because I have fine hair finding the best product was a challenge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone to use because it a good smelling shampoo and does not smell like pefume, who likes perfume smelling hair?</li>
            <li>The conditioner tingles on your head and feels so good.  </li>
            <li>this is the best place to buy this shampoo from as you will save a lot, and it&#x27;s apparently the best shampoo you can buy.</li>
            <li>The conditioner smells awesomely minty and feels cool on your scalp  when you use it...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a safe choice with great results.</li>
            <li>My hair looks great and my pocket book is pleased.</li>
            <li>Works great and love the smell.</li>
            <li>Also, it has a great refreshing scent to it.  </li>
            <li>Great shampoo and conditioner leaves your hair with lots of body and healthy shine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for about one year and very satisfied</li>
            <li>Love how it smells!</li>

            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>Shampoo not my favorite smell,  as it smells like basil</li>
            <li>, specifically the conditioner has WAY more of a menthol tingle than the stuff that I bought at ULTA.</li>

            <li>LOVE it :)</li>

            <li>It is a tad pricey but totally worth it!!</li>
            <li>Best customer service I have received in a very long time.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for years and this conditioner is the best I have found for my dry hair.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT product for dry hair.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo for colored hair, totally vegan and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>Still, the original product was absolutely unforgettable and even the new recipe is better than most.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other kinds but this is the best conditioner out!</li>
            <li>My hair felt like straw towards the ends, but this has completely transformed my hair to a very healthy state!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, kinda like fresh mint</li>
            <li>I bought the pumps that are frequently bought with these, and they work great.</li>
            <li>This is such a great deal, just need to make sure you buy pumps for the bottles.</li>
            <li>Order was easy to place.  </li>
            <li>where as the conditioner bottle was full to the top.  </li>
            <li>Cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I  got super cute bottles.</li>
            <li>but they are just to large to look nice in the shower.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for my straight, fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Very concentrated...Don&#x27;t need much and leave the hair in great condition.  </li>
            <li>I also love the fresh smell.</li>
            <li>My hair is light brown with highlights and lowlights using purology keeps the color from fading resulting in shine.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Since L&#x27;Oreal bought Pureology, I&#x27;ve heard that the ingredients changed, and I found that the last set I bought didn&#x27;t make my hair nearly as happy.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel silky smooth</li>
            <li>I am one of the faithful diehard users of what used to be a fabulous product.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>somehow he manages to get me a genuine pureology.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner makes running your fingers through your hair smooth as butter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the smaller bottles for years and my hair is in great condition--</li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;I received this right away.</li>
            <li>Also, I originally purchased through &#x27;Free Shipping Beauty LLC&#x27;.   </li>
            <li>Love this product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>My hair is very healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it&#x27;s the only kind I can use on my curly hair and get a comb through it after a shower.  </li>
            <li>Totally vegan and dye free so good for the environment</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>and it has a cool tingle when you use it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get a full 1/2 gallon as advertised.</li>
            <li>This is the most reasonable price I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>Who wants all the sulfates anyways,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon :)</li>
            <li>so I came here in search of something more reasonable.</li>
            <li>My hair was very damaged from coloring it, and this product restored my hair to healthy.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy and straight.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and item as described.</li>
            <li>Product arrived super quick and just as seller describes.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Based on how these products perform, I would say that these are the real thing, and the cost is great compared to buying these in smaller quantities at the salon.</li>
            <li>It was packaged and shippe quickly</li>
            <li>The online price was very reasonable!</li>
            <li>I found myself fighting my hair to comb it through after washing/conditioning and normally Pureology is so fantastic that combing through is effortless!</li>
            <li>I previously purchased Pureology from my salon and it is and always has been a great product.  </li>
            <li>This makes my hair feel very soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>bigger IS better, and cheaper too!</li>
            <li>My hair feels no residue or gunk, it leaves my hair feeling clean and light and unbelievably soft!!  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price, I always paid 30 per 8oz bottle in salons..</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make this more convenient is to have the pumps available.</li>
            <li>My hair has grown long and is very healthy.  </li>
            <li>The combo that I received must have been the old recipe still, because this was fantastic!</li>
            <li>in 2004 I have NEVER and you will never caught me washing my hair with different kind of shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>So worth buying this size.</li>
            <li>The price is worth the buy.</li>
            <li>best product out there for hair care, and advised to use this by my fantastic hair dresser!&lt;br /&gt;thanks for the super sized , and now i don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune in the smaller stores for small bottles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering right now before they run out...</li>
            <li>I love the Pureology products but when I opened the shampoo bottle it was only 2/3 full</li>
            <li>I have tried most major brands from low-end to high-end, to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Decided to weigh them and take a picture of how high they were filled.  </li>
            <li>Using something different on occasion seems to work better for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I first tried this product about 3 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Received the product in a timely manner and was exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products, nothing compares to Pureology..</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>First used at a salon and won&#x27;t use anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>Just added an even more personal feel to my shower.</li>
            <li>You can really see the difference!</li>
            <li>I first wash my hair using nioxin 7 cleanser</li>
            <li>I love Pureology, but I have to admit I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what I actually got.  </li>
            <li>First discover  pureology hydrate (the purple)</li>
            <li>have used pureology for years, since  and know exactly how  it works on my hair.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I am attaching additional pictures of when I first purchased them.</li>
            <li>As the first ingredients are water and now there is alcohol.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, conditioner was filled to the brim while the shampoo was down 2 inches from the top of the container.</li>
            <li>My husband always liked shampoo  from Walmart and once I got him hooked on Pureology, he won&#x27;t use any other product.</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair so soft and clean and even the day after I use it</li>
            <li>and I will finish the bottle because it was pretty spendy and a large bottle</li>
            <li>I love the minty smell and it makes my really long hair super soft!</li>
            <li>Love this product and it lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I was worried ordering online after all the horror stories of people thinning good shampoos out with drugstore shampoo, but I have used Pureology for a long time and this has definitely not been tampered with.</li>
            <li>I returned the large bottles a week ago and have yet to receive refund.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t like the scent though, so I have to always alternate conditioners and shampoos into the mix with this product to somewhat mack the smell, but I think it smells fine.</li>
            <li>Came exactly as promised and would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I had a little bit of my first purchase (small bottles of shampoo and conditioner from a salon) and when I compared them, it was a perfect match.</li>
            <li>I buy this at ULTA in the smaller bottle and this is a huge savings not to mention convenient to have on hand.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Fast service as well.</li>
            <li>they both hold color in much longer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sulfate-free so it does not strip your hair, but gently cleans while maintaining gloss and shine and control.  </li>
            <li>I color my hair every 2 months or so and using these products really help my hair.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper to buy at 64 oz than buying per the liter.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>so I can only use this shampoo every 2 days, I have to use a cheap shampoo inbetween.</li>
            <li>A small amount goes a LONG WAY and it keeps my hair healthy and helps hold the color, This size last me almost a year, so it is a great value.</li>
            <li>But not so much that it burns like some products.</li>
            <li>Leaves concern as to what is really in the containers.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing I had thick hair to begin with.</li>
            <li>When I start to run low again, I will ABSOLUTELY purchase from this seller!!!</li>
            <li>and I love them both other</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what to say other than I love this stuff, I have ordered twice.</li>
            <li>Once you have used Purology, you will never be satisfied with any other shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many other shampoos and conditioners but they cannot conmpair to how Pureology makes your hair feel and look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a big problem from my perspective, and again the savings and quality of these products is well worth it!</li>
            <li>I love this product would recommend it to anyone.it really makes my fine thin hair look so much thicker and shiner</li>
            <li>I have fine limp hair on most days, which actually led me to try the volume line of pureology as well.  </li>
            <li>From the first time I used it my hair was soft, silky and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Compared</li>
            <li>Started buying it in the salon, then on the web as it&#x27;s very expensive, but this was the best deal I have ever found.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite of all time shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I actually alternate this with WEN and use pureology about every 2nd or 3rd shampoo, but even without the WEN, its the best shampoo I have ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li>but I will not order this particular Pureology product again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend to for everyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend using this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommended😃</li>
            <li>This is a very good product but would only buy Pureology in the these large quantities, otherwise it is to expensive.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is one of the few that works of my grand daughters curly hair.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo does not have harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>Keeps my baby fine hair smooth and not fly away.</li>
            <li>If you buy the large bottles this can last a whole year with 2 people using daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for color treated hair and for people using Rogaine.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have ordered this on line, normally have purchased this at upper end Salon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This was a very good price especially as I use a considerable amount of product having long, thick hair.</li>
            <li>Price was higher than the last time I bought them.</li>
            <li>Used this shampoo for about two years now, and it has been a tremendous help for my very dry hair.</li>
            <li>It softens my hair like no other, my limp hair still has a healthy life to it.  </li>
            <li>not real sure this is genuine Pureology.</li>
            <li>While they are pricey at this size, when you factor in how long it last (for me, usually about 8 months), it&#x27;s actually not that much higher than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; products that don&#x27;t do nearly as good of job.  </li>
            <li>Each time the lids are secure  and closed with extra tape and plastic.</li>
            <li>and it makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think they would change it so much that your back feels like it has IcyHot on it!</li>
            <li>It makes your hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a product junkie and will tell you I&#x27;ve tried nearly every hair product out there.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft, hydrated and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny and manageable every.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li>The product leaves your hair silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner has peppermint oil which leaves your scalp feeling tingly and alive.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>Helps retain my color longer, and makes my hair soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>These products keep my hair from drying out, have very curly hair and it tends to look dry from being frizzy.</li>
            <li>Ever since no other product is a match for this hair care line.  </li>
            <li>I bought the 64oz size and since you dont have to use that much, it will last me a LONG time.</li>
            <li>The next day I went to see my styles and beg him to place an order for me directly from the manufacture or legitimate supplier</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to buying directly from an authorized retailer only - even if I have to pay an arm and a leg.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend to anyone who has color damaged hair, or just damaged hair in general.</li>
            <li>I have always had fine and thin hair, I couldn&#x27;t find a product that helped it until I stumbled upon pureology.  </li>

            <li> Who wants all the sulfates anyways,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon :)</li>
            <li> so I came here in search of something more reasonable.</li>
            <li> My hair was very damaged from coloring it, and this product restored my hair to healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy and straight.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and item as described.</li>
            <li> Product arrived super quick and just as seller describes.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Based on how these products perform, I would say that these are the real thing, and the cost is great compared to buying these in smaller quantities at the salon.</li>
            <li> It was packaged and shippe quickly</li>
            <li> The online price was very reasonable!</li>
            <li> I found myself fighting my hair to comb it through after washing/conditioning and normally Pureology is so fantastic that combing through is effortless!</li>
            <li> I previously purchased Pureology from my salon and it is and always has been a great product.  </li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel very soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> bigger IS better, and cheaper too!</li>
            <li> My hair feels no residue or gunk, it leaves my hair feeling clean and light and unbelievably soft!!  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price, I always paid 30 per 8oz bottle in salons..</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make this more convenient is to have the pumps available.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown long and is very healthy.  </li>
            <li> The combo that I received must have been the old recipe still, because this was fantastic!</li>
            <li> in 2004 I have NEVER and you will never caught me washing my hair with different kind of shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> So worth buying this size.</li>
            <li> The price is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> best product out there for hair care, and advised to use this by my fantastic hair dresser!&lt;br /&gt;thanks for the super sized , and now i don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune in the smaller stores for small bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering right now before they run out...</li>
            <li> I love the Pureology products but when I opened the shampoo bottle it was only 2/3 full</li>
            <li> I have tried most major brands from low-end to high-end, to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Decided to weigh them and take a picture of how high they were filled.  </li>
            <li> Using something different on occasion seems to work better for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I first tried this product about 3 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Received the product in a timely manner and was exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products, nothing compares to Pureology..</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> First used at a salon and won&#x27;t use anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> Just added an even more personal feel to my shower.</li>
            <li> You can really see the difference!</li>
            <li> I first wash my hair using nioxin 7 cleanser</li>
            <li> I love Pureology, but I have to admit I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what I actually got.  </li>
            <li> First discover  pureology hydrate (the purple)</li>
            <li> have used pureology for years, since  and know exactly how  it works on my hair.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I am attaching additional pictures of when I first purchased them.</li>
            <li> As the first ingredients are water and now there is alcohol.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, conditioner was filled to the brim while the shampoo was down 2 inches from the top of the container.</li>
            <li> My husband always liked shampoo  from Walmart and once I got him hooked on Pureology, he won&#x27;t use any other product.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair so soft and clean and even the day after I use it</li>
            <li> and I will finish the bottle because it was pretty spendy and a large bottle</li>
            <li> I love the minty smell and it makes my really long hair super soft!</li>
            <li> Love this product and it lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I was worried ordering online after all the horror stories of people thinning good shampoos out with drugstore shampoo, but I have used Pureology for a long time and this has definitely not been tampered with.</li>
            <li> I returned the large bottles a week ago and have yet to receive refund.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t like the scent though, so I have to always alternate conditioners and shampoos into the mix with this product to somewhat mack the smell, but I think it smells fine.</li>
            <li> Came exactly as promised and would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I had a little bit of my first purchase (small bottles of shampoo and conditioner from a salon) and when I compared them, it was a perfect match.</li>
            <li> I buy this at ULTA in the smaller bottle and this is a huge savings not to mention convenient to have on hand.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Fast service as well.</li>
            <li> they both hold color in much longer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sulfate-free so it does not strip your hair, but gently cleans while maintaining gloss and shine and control.  </li>
            <li> I color my hair every 2 months or so and using these products really help my hair.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper to buy at 64 oz than buying per the liter.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> so I can only use this shampoo every 2 days, I have to use a cheap shampoo inbetween.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a LONG WAY and it keeps my hair healthy and helps hold the color, This size last me almost a year, so it is a great value.</li>
            <li> But not so much that it burns like some products.</li>
            <li> Leaves concern as to what is really in the containers.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing I had thick hair to begin with.</li>
            <li> When I start to run low again, I will ABSOLUTELY purchase from this seller!!!</li>
            <li> and I love them both other</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say other than I love this stuff, I have ordered twice.</li>
            <li> Once you have used Purology, you will never be satisfied with any other shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many other shampoos and conditioners but they cannot conmpair to how Pureology makes your hair feel and look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big problem from my perspective, and again the savings and quality of these products is well worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this product would recommend it to anyone.it really makes my fine thin hair look so much thicker and shiner</li>
            <li> I have fine limp hair on most days, which actually led me to try the volume line of pureology as well.  </li>
            <li> From the first time I used it my hair was soft, silky and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Compared</li>
            <li> Started buying it in the salon, then on the web as it&#x27;s very expensive, but this was the best deal I have ever found.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite of all time shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I actually alternate this with WEN and use pureology about every 2nd or 3rd shampoo, but even without the WEN, its the best shampoo I have ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li> but I will not order this particular Pureology product again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly recommend to for everyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend using this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommended😃</li>
            <li> This is a very good product but would only buy Pureology in the these large quantities, otherwise it is to expensive.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is one of the few that works of my grand daughters curly hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo does not have harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> Keeps my baby fine hair smooth and not fly away.</li>
            <li> If you buy the large bottles this can last a whole year with 2 people using daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for color treated hair and for people using Rogaine.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have ordered this on line, normally have purchased this at upper end Salon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This was a very good price especially as I use a considerable amount of product having long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Price was higher than the last time I bought them.</li>
            <li> Used this shampoo for about two years now, and it has been a tremendous help for my very dry hair.</li>
            <li> It softens my hair like no other, my limp hair still has a healthy life to it.  </li>
            <li> not real sure this is genuine Pureology.</li>
            <li> While they are pricey at this size, when you factor in how long it last (for me, usually about 8 months), it&#x27;s actually not that much higher than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; products that don&#x27;t do nearly as good of job.  </li>
            <li> Each time the lids are secure  and closed with extra tape and plastic.</li>
            <li> and it makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think they would change it so much that your back feels like it has IcyHot on it!</li>
            <li> It makes your hair so soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie and will tell you I&#x27;ve tried nearly every hair product out there.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft, hydrated and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny and manageable every.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li> The product leaves your hair silky and soft.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner has peppermint oil which leaves your scalp feeling tingly and alive.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> Helps retain my color longer, and makes my hair soft and touchable.</li>
            <li> These products keep my hair from drying out, have very curly hair and it tends to look dry from being frizzy.</li>
            <li> Ever since no other product is a match for this hair care line.  </li>
            <li> I bought the 64oz size and since you dont have to use that much, it will last me a LONG time.</li>
            <li> The next day I went to see my styles and beg him to place an order for me directly from the manufacture or legitimate supplier</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to buying directly from an authorized retailer only - even if I have to pay an arm and a leg.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone who has color damaged hair, or just damaged hair in general.</li>
            <li> I have always had fine and thin hair, I couldn&#x27;t find a product that helped it until I stumbled upon pureology.  </li>
            <li> The only minor thing that I would note here is that when you get to the very bottom of these bottles, you should expect to have to tip the bottles upside down and manually extract the last bit at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Finding this size at the price I paid made it less expensive and much more convenient than my old store brand.  </li>
            <li> So now I just use the large bottles to refill the small size.  </li>
            <li> It works well and will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way with high quality products.</li>
            <li> Usually you can only find this brand at high end hair salons...</li>
            <li> My hair is usually frizzy but with this shampoo calms right down</li>
            <li> sleek straight black hair that is all the way down to my buttocks  </li>
            <li> I have long wire-y frizzy colored hair and this shampoo and conditioner is my life saver.</li>
            <li> It is thick so don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> So far I love the shampoo and conditioner, I wish conditioner can be not so thick because it&#x27;s difficult to put into container for traveling.</li>
            <li> Also it had been about 20 years since my hair didn&#x27;t grow passed my shoulders and after using purology my hair is long again!</li>
            <li> I wash, blow dry and straighten about 5 days a week.</li>
            <li> I know some people say it&#x27;s an imitation, but this is the only shampoo that I use for years</li>
            <li> single.</li>
            <li> Now I live in Italy and the water is really hard here as it contains a ggod amount of limeware.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders on my dry, damaged hair!</li>
            <li> Much less than I paid last year...</li>
            <li> Paid the same here for these big bottles as she paid for small bottles at the salon</li>
            <li> I even use this on my daughter who has very dry and corse hair</li>
            <li> Only have to use a little amount per use.  </li>
            <li> The product which I&#x27;ve used before it just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Not the results I expected.</li>
            <li> Item as expected</li>
            <li> As a devout user of the Pureology hydrate brand, I know my last order was not  a genuine pureology.  </li>
            <li> and when I use it I have to be careful not to get it anywhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few of the other versions of this product, but I always come back to Hydrate.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the larger size and the price compared to the small ones.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos &amp; conditioners and none compare to this.  </li>
            <li> to all other quality salon products I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
            <li> And, since I have a precancerous condition, I like knowing I am not being exposed to some of carcinogenic chemicals in some of the other hair products.</li>
            <li> Everything was exactly as I expected and my products were delivered sooner than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I began using Pureology from my salon and got hooked, so when I went back to using my old store brand even my hair was sad.  </li>
            <li> have thick highlighted blonde hair</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, thick, gray hair that I have colored regularly.</li>
            <li> Too expensive and regular shampoo works the same.</li>
            <li> Measuring 3&#x27;-5\\&quot; LONG.&lt;br /&gt;I am serious about my hair care products, especially my conditioners.  </li>
            <li> Can you believe it, I still have half.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very expensive, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser has noticed the difference, and the fact that my hair feels a little thicker.  </li>
            <li> My hair suffered dramatic changes from black to blond, to redhead and back to black.  </li>
            <li> I am not very sure about this formula.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and thick hair</li>
            <li> and I have to shower everyday.  </li>
            <li> My wife picked this up at the hair salon for a few years but the cost was WAY out of line</li>
            <li> It lasts me that long, SERIOUS!</li>
            <li> I fill a small bottle and keep it in the shower and refill the bottle as needed.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that this was a legitimate Pureology product.  </li>
            <li> Pureology is the ONLY product I can use, but it&#x27;s so expensive!</li>
            <li> Not happy with shipping method or the lack of manufacturers factory seal.</li>
            <li> Bottle cap was cracked and broken when I recieved it in the mail.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> Just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> you would be crazy to pass this deal up</li>
            <li> If you have used this product, you know it is very expensive to buy in 20oz bottles.  </li>
            <li> While this product is very expensive...</li>
            <li> I was buying this product from my hairdresser and it was very expensive for just 8.5 ounces.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bottles were way smaller than they appeared.  It&#x27;s deceiving.</li>
            <li> Items arrived on time and per expectations.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is the best I&#x27;ve ever used for color treated hair. Plus I got it at a great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great purchase. Great value.</li>
            <li> These are the best products! They are cost effective too if you follow the directions for use.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it lasts a very long time.  Expensive, I know and I will purchase again because it does last.  Using something different on occasion seems to work better for my hair.  Love how it smells!</li>
            <li> I first tried this product about 3 years ago.  Ever since no other product is a match for this hair care line.  My hair suffered dramatic changes from black to blond, to redhead and back to black.  I&#x27;m also a swimmer and I have to shower everyday.  Now I live in Italy and the water is really hard here as it contains a ggod amount of limeware.  I use this product to protect my hair and keep it healthy, shiny, and hydrated. I ran out about a week ago and I&#x27;ve been looking for this product in bulk and thanx to AMAZON.COM I&#x27;m ordering right now before they run out...you should too!  thanks Pureology &amp; AMAZON.COM I&#x27;m your # 1 Fan :)</li>
            <li> If you have used this product, you know it is very expensive to buy in 20oz bottles.  This is such a great deal, just need to make sure you buy pumps for the bottles.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. Have been using it for years and this conditioner is the best I have found for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> It thins my hair. It&#x27;s a good thing I had thick hair to begin with.</li>
            <li> My sister referred me to this product through Amazon. She even washes her her Dogs With it....I also love the fresh smell. The best hydration I&#x27;ve used! Fast service as well.</li>
            <li> I just love Pureology...great for my hair and price is at a  savings!</li>
            <li> I bought the Pureology Hydrate Shampoo &amp; Conditioner in the 64oz container, &amp; am SO glad I did! Instead of going through Shampoo &amp; Conditioner monthly, I only have to buy it once a year! It lasts me that long, SERIOUS!</li>
            <li> Best hair product I have every used. I will always suggest this stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome...Shampoo not my favorite smell,  as it smells like basil but it works well. The conditioner smells awesomely minty and feels cool on your scalp  when you use it... they both hold color in much longer and I love them both other then the shampoo smell because I dont like basil.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever tried.  My hair is soft and healthy looking. I even use this on my daughter who has very dry and corse hair and it makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair.  Thus was a great deal too!</li>
            <li> Order was easy to place.  Price was great and the turn around time was awesome. Would order from here anytime.</li>
            <li> I am not very sure about this formula. I&#x27;ve purchased Pureology from ULTA and it is more expensive. This stuff I bought from Amazon, specifically the conditioner has WAY more of a menthol tingle than the stuff that I bought at ULTA. I know that Pureology changed the formula but I don&#x27;t think they would change it so much that your back feels like it has IcyHot on it! I would just do your research, not real sure this is genuine Pureology.</li>
            <li> best product out there for hair care, and advised to use this by my fantastic hair dresser!&lt;br /&gt;thanks for the super sized , and now i don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune in the smaller stores for small bottles.</li>
            <li> I have found these to be a good price for fine shampoo and conditioner.  When I buy them in a much smaller size from my salon, they are considerably more expensive.  So now I just use the large bottles to refill the small size.  It works well and will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, my hair loves it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is the best for all types of hair! This size is the best value too! You will not find another brand better!! I&#x27;ve tried many other kinds but this is the best conditioner out!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are great.  Only have to use a little amount per use.  It makes your hair so soft.  I and my grown daughters love it.  I am hooked on it.</li>
            <li> I love Pureology products and I really love having it in this convenient size. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner in 1/2 gallon size. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;I received this right away. No problems at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie and will tell you I&#x27;ve tried nearly every hair product out there.  I have fine limp hair on most days, which actually led me to try the volume line of pureology as well.  However I recommend this shampoo and conditioner to ALL hair types.  It softens my hair like no other, my limp hair still has a healthy life to it.  My hair feels no residue or gunk, it leaves my hair feeling clean and light and unbelievably soft!!  Everyone I&#x27;ve recommended this to just loves it!  Occasionally I&#x27;ll try something different, but I keep coming back here to this.  It&#x27;s a safe choice with great results.</li>
            <li> I love it this shampoo is the greatest shampoo I ever used. I would recommend this to anyone to use because it a good smelling shampoo and does not smell like pefume, who likes perfume smelling hair? This smells like peppermint.</li>
            <li> Best hair products ever!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have ordered this on line, normally have purchased this at upper end Salon&#x27;s. Used this shampoo for about two years now, and it has been a tremendous help for my very dry hair. My hair seems to be much more manageable. The online price was very reasonable!</li>
            <li> Received the product in a timely manner and was exactly what I ordered.  Would purchase again from this vendor.  Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every shampoo on the market (biolage, Aveda, Bumble, Joico, WEN, etc) and this seems to be the closest to perfect I could find.  It&#x27;s sulfate-free so it does not strip your hair, but gently cleans while maintaining gloss and shine and control.  It&#x27;s very expensive, but well worth it. I actually alternate this with WEN and use pureology about every 2nd or 3rd shampoo, but even without the WEN, its the best shampoo I have ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. Well worth the price, I always paid 30 per 8oz bottle in salons.. I have tried so many different products, nothing compares to Pureology..</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite of all time shampoo and conditioner. Since buying this my hair has grown a lot and my blonde breakage is now growing! Really works and makes your hair feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I still LOVE it. I appreciate the larger size and the price compared to the small ones.  I just refill my shower bottle.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love, love, love Pureology products. Leaves my hair soft, hydrated and manageable. Another plus for Pureology products is that they are organic, 100% vegan and no animal testing.  I would and have recommended this product to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos &amp; conditioners and none compare to this.  I color my hair every 2 months or so and using these products really help my hair.  I love these products!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great, but the conditioner makes my hair fall off. Do not buy it! I realized after the 30 days of the return window but i would return this product in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Pureology Hydrate Shampoo 64 oz &amp; Hydrate Conditioner 64 oz duo. It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for years. This is a great bargain considering what you pay in a salon. I will continue purchasing it from amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used Purology shampoo &amp; conditioner for over 5 years for my color treated hair. First used at a salon and won&#x27;t use anything else I have tried. My hair is light brown with highlights and lowlights using purology keeps the color from fading resulting in shine. And the fragrance is refreshing.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT product for dry hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Not only did it arrive days before it was supposed to, it also arrived in one piece, neatly packaged. I had a little bit of my first purchase (small bottles of shampoo and conditioner from a salon) and when I compared them, it was a perfect match. When I start to run low again, I will ABSOLUTELY purchase from this seller!!! Thanks so much!!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It was shipped promptly.  The product which I&#x27;ve used before it just what I expected.  Much cheaper to buy at 64 oz than buying per the liter.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff- keeps the Brazilian blowout looking nice. My hair is usually frizzy but with this shampoo calms right down</li>
            <li> Shampooing with Pureology is such a wonderful experience.  I love the way it makes my hair feel and smell.  My hair is much more manageable after using Pureology shampoo and conditioner.  I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it&#x27;s the only kind I can use on my curly hair and get a comb through it after a shower.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Not the results I expected. Too expensive and regular shampoo works the same. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell it smells like hair dye. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say other than I love this stuff, I have ordered twice. Each time the lids are secure  and closed with extra tape and plastic. It makes my hair feel great. I do have greasy hair so I can only use this shampoo every 2 days, I have to use a cheap shampoo inbetween.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and item as described. I was worried ordering online after all the horror stories of people thinning good shampoos out with drugstore shampoo, but I have used Pureology for a long time and this has definitely not been tampered with. My hair looks great and my pocket book is pleased.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Item as expected</li>
            <li> I ordered one shampoo and one conditioner but I received two shampoos.</li>
            <li> The the best shampoo and conditioner ever!  I love the minty smell and it makes my really long hair super soft!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. A small amount goes a LONG WAY and it keeps my hair healthy and helps hold the color, This size last me almost a year, so it is a great value. Purchase a pump. I fill a small bottle and keep it in the shower and refill the bottle as needed. I had the big bottle in the shower with me but they are just to large to look nice in the shower. Any craft or container store will have a selection of bottles, sizes, colors, tops etc. worked out great I  got super cute bottles. Just added an even more personal feel to my shower.</li>
            <li> I love purolog! The shampoo is great but the kicker is the hydrate conditioner. It smells amazing, kinda like fresh mint and it has a cool tingle when you use it. But not so much that it burns like some products. My fav of all time!</li>
            <li> You can really see the difference!</li>
            <li> Awesome, hair care product.  Once I started washing my hair with this shampoo and conditioner I was sold.  I first wash my hair using nioxin 7 cleanser and then I wash again with pureology...great item.  Product arrived super quick and just as seller describes.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair used others this is much better!!!! Get the pump.</li>
            <li> I got hooked on this shampoo and conditioner because my hairdresser used it. It&#x27;s double the price at stores like Ulta.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make this more convenient is to have the pumps available. I buy this at ULTA in the smaller bottle and this is a huge savings not to mention convenient to have on hand.</li>
            <li> I have curly and somewhat frizzy hair. From the first time I used it my hair was soft, silky and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to all other quality salon products I&#x27;ve tried...this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great. I know some people say it&#x27;s an imitation, but this is the only shampoo that I use for years and I don&#x27;t see a difference. It is also a great price!</li>
            <li> Not happy with shipping method or the lack of manufacturers factory seal. Leaves concern as to what is really in the containers. For $130 these should be packaged better and contain factory seals on each container. Additionally, conditioner was filled to the brim while the shampoo was down 2 inches from the top of the container. If they are both the same quantity, why the difference?</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for several years now.  I only buy it on Amazon because I get the best price.  The two containers last a year or so.  My hair has grown long and is very healthy.  I will never change products since the results are so amazing.  My daughter uses the product as well.</li>
            <li> Great product! My hair felt like straw towards the ends, but this has completely transformed my hair to a very healthy state! My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t like the scent though, so I have to always alternate conditioners and shampoos into the mix with this product to somewhat mack the smell, but I think it smells fine.</li>
            <li> Because I have fine hair finding the best product was a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;My hair dresser introduced this product to me several years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I love this shampoo and conditioner. The conditioner smells like mint&lt;br /&gt;and tingles when applied.</li>
            <li> I began using Pureology from my salon and got hooked, so when I went back to using my old store brand even my hair was sad.  Finding this size at the price I paid made it less expensive and much more convenient than my old store brand.  Hurray- now my hair is happy again!</li>
            <li> Love this product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! My hair is soft, shiny and manageable every. single. day. Usually you can only find this brand at high end hair salons...I love being able to buy it online. Absolutely fantastic product. I&#x27;ve used a few of the other versions of this product, but I always come back to Hydrate. It is perfect for my straight, fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li> The combo that I received must have been the old recipe still, because this was fantastic! Since L&#x27;Oreal bought Pureology, I&#x27;ve heard that the ingredients changed, and I found that the last set I bought didn&#x27;t make my hair nearly as happy. Still, the original product was absolutely unforgettable and even the new recipe is better than most.</li>
            <li> Love the Pureology Hydrate Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel silky smooth</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and great description</li>
            <li> By far the best shampoo &amp; conditioner on the planet!!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel very soft and smooth! I will order this again! My hair feels like it is a lot more healthy when I use this product.</li>
            <li> Love this Shampoo and Conditioner. Works great and love the smell. It makes your hair soft. manageable. I love the pureology line.</li>
            <li> Quick ship and great price.  Much less than I paid last year...</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for years now. My dyed (mostly gray now) hair stays lustrous, healthy and manageable with this product. And, since I have a precancerous condition, I like knowing I am not being exposed to some of carcinogenic chemicals in some of the other hair products. As a bonus, it has a wonderful scent. It is the ONLY shampoo for me!</li>
            <li> Keeps my baby fine hair smooth and not fly away. Totally vegan and dye free so good for the environment</li>
            <li> I love Pureology, but I have to admit I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what I actually got.  I&#x27;m going back to buying directly from an authorized retailer only - even if I have to pay an arm and a leg.  I found myself fighting my hair to comb it through after washing/conditioning and normally Pureology is so fantastic that combing through is effortless!</li>
            <li> Once you have used Purology, you will never be satisfied with any other shampoo and conditioner.  The product leaves your hair silky and soft.  Also, it has a great refreshing scent to it.  I love it.  Wish I had bought it sooner.</li>
            <li> I am one of the faithful diehard users of what used to be a fabulous product.&lt;br /&gt;my sleek straight black hair that is all the way down to my buttocks  Measuring 3&#x27;-5\\&quot; LONG.&lt;br /&gt;I am serious about my hair care products, especially my conditioners.  I have tried most major brands from low-end to high-end, to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;I First discover  pureology hydrate (the purple) in 2004 I have NEVER and you will never caught me washing my hair with different kind of shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I have used pureology for years, since  and know exactly how  it works on my hair.&lt;br /&gt; As a devout user of the Pureology hydrate brand, I know my last order was not  a genuine pureology.  I contacted the seller and they denied it.  The next day I went to see my styles and beg him to place an order for me directly from the manufacture or legitimate supplier somehow he manages to get me a genuine pureology.  Since then I never order pureology here.  This happens  March 12, 2012 sold by topbeautysource10.  It was $128.00 then for a pair of hydrate shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> While this product is very expensive...it is worth every penny.  If you buy the large bottles this can last a whole year with 2 people using daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for color treated hair and for people using Rogaine.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner ever. Love this stuff. Perfect cleaning strength with perfect weight from conditioner. Great smells, too. Cheap on amazon too!</li>
            <li> I have used this before but I find the conditioner is not as effective as before. I still have to use extra leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner leaves your hair with lots of body and healthy shine. The conditioner has peppermint oil which leaves your scalp feeling tingly and alive. Helps maintain color - even copper and red. Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Arrived quickly. The conditioner makes running your fingers through your hair smooth as butter. The shampoo gives a nice cooling sensation. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot when you shower...&amp;#34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love pureology. I have very dry skin, and thick hair so I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair but twice a week. This stuff leaves my hair so silky soft and smelling wonderful! Best of all it costs around the same price as it would at the store but your basically getting twice the amount of product! Also the fact that it has no sulfate is great cause thats what damages your hair the most! LOVE it :)</li>
            <li> Love being able to order my hair products online and they ship faster then stated!  Love the Pureology Conditioner and the mint smell and the tingling while using it!</li>
            <li> So worth buying this size. Best shampoo for colored hair, totally vegan and cruelty free. Minty smelling and hydrating. You can buy the pumps on amazon with it.</li>
            <li> I could not believe that I found this product at Amazon.com.  I was buying this product from my hairdresser and it was very expensive for just 8.5 ounces.  Then I went to a place I could buy it cheaper and I paid $100.00 for 36 fluid ounces.&lt;br /&gt;When I found that I could buy 64 ounces of shampoo and conditioner for $120.00 I was shocked.  Now I have to nicely tell my hairdresser that I no longer need her product!  I was paying $37.00 for 8.5 ounces!  This is just the best shampoo and conditioner.  The conditioner tingles on your head and feels so good.  My husband always liked shampoo  from Walmart and once I got him hooked on Pureology, he won&#x27;t use any other product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best! my hair has never been healthier and more manageable. Also it had been about 20 years since my hair didn&#x27;t grow passed my shoulders and after using purology my hair is long again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a giant jug of quality product at 50-100% what your local salon would charge you. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and my hair is so healthy because of it. I have long wire-y frizzy colored hair and this shampoo and conditioner is my life saver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about one year and very satisfied but it can be pricey when purchased in the salon.  This was a very good price especially as I use a considerable amount of product having long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Bought the product when my partner and I switched over to veganism. It works wonders on my dry, damaged hair! I also saved A LOT of money by buying it online.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner you can buy!!!</li>
            <li> Very concentrated...Don&#x27;t need much and leave the hair in great condition.  Love the &amp;#34;scents&amp;#34; too.  My hairdresser turned me on to Pureology...had to have it</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  The conditioner has a very strong peppermint smell which I like. Will use it from now on because it makes my hair very soft and smells wonderful. It is thick so don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> I love the Pureology products but when I opened the shampoo bottle it was only 2/3 full where as the conditioner bottle was full to the top.  Didn&#x27;t get a full 1/2 gallon as advertised.</li>
            <li> Buying Purilogy this way makes using such quality products affordable. I have a family of 8. We all use it regularly. I&#x27;ve done the math and I spend about $70 annually on shampoo &amp; conditioner. That&#x27;s a great price for what we&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> Price was higher than the last time I bought them.</li>
            <li> Everything was exactly as I expected and my products were delivered sooner than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product but would only buy Pureology in the these large quantities, otherwise it is to expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the smaller bottles for years and my hair is in great condition--bigger IS better, and cheaper too!</li>
            <li> I really love these products!  It&#x27;s the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used for my hair.  While they are pricey at this size, when you factor in how long it last (for me, usually about 8 months), it&#x27;s actually not that much higher than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; products that don&#x27;t do nearly as good of job.  Love the scent.  A little goes a LONG way with high quality products.</li>
            <li> Purology is the best hair product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have always had fine and thin hair, I couldn&#x27;t find a product that helped it until I stumbled upon pureology.  My hair dresser has noticed the difference, and the fact that my hair feels a little thicker.  It also smells really  nice.  I recommend to anyone.  The price is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic (just my scalp) to every shampoo &amp; conditioner, whether from a grocery store or salon. Pureology is the ONLY product I can use, but it&#x27;s so expensive! This is the most reasonable price I&#x27;ve seen. Thanks.</li>
            <li> its like 2-4-1 vs ulta. what a great value. plus it is great for hair. you would be crazy to pass this deal up</li>
            <li> I am not sure that this was a legitimate Pureology product.  I previously purchased Pureology from my salon and it is and always has been a great product.  I order this time from Makeup Express and this product caused my hair to fall out and my face, back and head broke out in a rash.  I returned the large bottles a week ago and have yet to receive refund.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo forever.  Started buying it in the salon, then on the web as it&#x27;s very expensive, but this was the best deal I have ever found.  Came exactly as promised and would highly recommend.  Best shampoo and conditioner on the market.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this shampoo and conditioner! My hair feels and looks amamzing. I have tried so many other shampoos and conditioners but they cannot conmpair to how Pureology makes your hair feel and look. I tried it once and had to get some. It is a tad pricey but totally worth it!! I bought the 64oz size and since you dont have to use that much, it will last me a LONG time.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend the money on this product because of the cost, however, it&#x27;s the best decision I could have made. This leaves my hair so soft and clean and even the day after I use it I can still smell the mint in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick highlighted blonde hair and I can definetely tell the difference when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to for everyone.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  The prices were excellent.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. The conditioner is one of the few that works of my grand daughters curly hair. The sellers were beyond amazing. Best customer service I have received in a very long time. They accidentally shipped me two conditioners and told me to keep the extra one and shipped a shampoo. WOW</li>
            <li> Love the results...... My hair is very healthy and soft. Highly recommend using this shampoo and conditioner.  It is my favorite!</li>
            <li> This product is so awesome!  I have tried many shampoo and conditioner combos and this one has to be my favorite.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo does not have harsh chemicals so it is great if you have had a keratin treatment 5 star</li>
            <li> Based on how these products perform, I would say that these are the real thing, and the cost is great compared to buying these in smaller quantities at the salon. I bought the pumps that are frequently bought with these, and they work great. The only minor thing that I would note here is that when you get to the very bottom of these bottles, you should expect to have to tip the bottles upside down and manually extract the last bit at the bottom. It&#x27;s not a big problem from my perspective, and again the savings and quality of these products is well worth it!</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this shampoo and conditioner&lt;br /&gt;it is a great value too!! Who wants all the sulfates anyways,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon :)</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner. Helps retain my color longer, and makes my hair soft and touchable. The lavender colored shampoo smells great, and the conditioner has a peppermint base. Cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love this product would recommend it to anyone.it really makes my fine thin hair look so much thicker and shiner</li>
            <li> I have bleached hair and this is the best combo to hydrate my hair and keep it in great shape..</li>
            <li> Love this product but the pumps should be included.</li>
            <li> Awesome i love this product n excellent shipping</li>
            <li> great product and the price was great compared to salon prices. Would recommend to anyone who uses pureology products but can&#x27;t spend the salon prices</li>
            <li> My wife uses these. Has for years. Used to buy them from the salon. Paid the same here for these big bottles as she paid for small bottles at the salon and they were delivered to the house. Packaging has been great and all tops have been taped.</li>
            <li> The conditioner has a very strong mint smell. I have pretty sensitive skin and when I use it I have to be careful not to get it anywhere but on my hair because it almost feels like it is burning my skin. It works well on my hair and I will finish the bottle because it was pretty spendy and a large bottle but I will not order this particular Pureology product again.</li>
            <li> My wife picked this up at the hair salon for a few years but the cost was WAY out of line so I came here in search of something more reasonable. I found it here....</li>
            <li> best shampoo and conditioner ever made!</li>
            <li> 2015.09.10 - Update  Can you believe it, I still have half.  &#x3D;_). I am still enjoying the shampoo and conditioner.  I am attaching additional pictures of when I first purchased them. Decided to weigh them and take a picture of how high they were filled.  Also, I originally purchased through &#x27;Free Shipping Beauty LLC&#x27;.   2014.07.17  I posted pictures of the 64oz bottles and their ingredients.  I hope this helps others.  From what I&#x27;ve read, these might be the post Loreal ingredients.  As the first ingredients are water and now there is alcohol.  Please make this review helpful and my pictures if they were.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> By far this is the best shampoo and conditioner out there. My hair was very damaged from coloring it, and this product restored my hair to healthy. Would definitely recommend to anyone who has color damaged hair, or just damaged hair in general.</li>
            <li> Loved this product never use anything else always looking for a great price. I tell everyone I work with about this product</li>
            <li> seems like they have diluted the product</li>
            <li> What a great buy on one of my favorite beauty products!  I highlight my hair every 7-8 weeks and this shampoo and conditioner leave my hair feeling moisturized and silky.  Love it.</li>
            <li> These products keep my hair from drying out, have very curly hair and it tends to look dry from being frizzy. Would recommend Pureology products to anyone. Just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> Pureology is a wonderful product</li>
            <li> Bottle cap was cracked and broken when I recieved it in the mail. They did not package it properly and some shampoo leaked out</li>
            <li> I love this product  my hairdresser uses it as well that&#x27;s how I found out about it!!!!!!! I highly recommended😃</li>
            <li> Value for Value this is the best place to buy this shampoo from as you will save a lot, and it&#x27;s apparently the best shampoo you can buy. Dunno, girlfriends words.</li>
            <li> So far I love the shampoo and conditioner, I wish conditioner can be not so thick because it&#x27;s difficult to put into container for traveling.</li>
            <li> Anyone wanting to fall in love with their hair again shold try these products. It was packaged and shippe quickly</li>
            <li> I buy this over and over. I have frizzy, thick, gray hair that I have colored regularly. I use Pureology shampoo and conditioner, a Babyliss straightener, and nothing else. No product necessary to protect my hair. My hair is healthy and straight. I wash, blow dry and straighten about 5 days a week.</li>
