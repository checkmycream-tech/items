            <li> I actually like this product a lot. It really does provide your hair with great body, and doesn&#x27;t leave it too weighed down with product or feel oily.    My only complaint is that the fragrance (which does smell nice), is too strong, and I am very sensitive to most fragrances</li>
            <li> Works OK. I feel like I&#x27;ve used better conditioners. My sister said she would give this 4 stars, but her hair is more manageable than mine. Smells very clean, and rinses well.</li>

Also i feel its great value for money!</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner we have ever used.  It conditions without leaving hair feeling droopy or heavy.  It was a very sad day when Neutrogena decided to discontinue producing it.  Hopefully, they will reverse the decision.  Meanwhile, we have yet to find a suitable replacement.</li>
            <li> prompt delivery, great product</li>
            <li> Our favorite conditioner, leaves your hair natural feeling. No gunky buildup after multiple uses.  No heavy perfumes, a  simple and reliable product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the many Neutrogena products I use . .I use a variety of their lotions and shampoos and conditioners and I love them all!

            <li> All these Neutrogena shampoos/conditioners are being discontinued by the manufacturer, so it was nice that they were still available.  Thank you for your prompt completion of the order.  Mary</li>
            <li> We have used Neutrogena conditioner for years. Could no longer find it in the local stores. Thank goodness for Amazon! The four pack will last us for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Best Conditioner you can find !</li>
            <li> Not as moisturizing as I hoped. I travel a lot and one of the hotels has Neutrogena products and I love the clean conditioner. I was hoping this was the same. Sadly it&#x27;s not. Works great for my daughter who has thick, curly, hair but her hair is a little more fine than mine.</li>
