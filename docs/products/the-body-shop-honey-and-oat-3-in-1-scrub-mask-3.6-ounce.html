            <li> A very pampering treatment.  Use it once a week liberally and it will exfoliate, remove impurities and leave your face feeling really nice.  I always use it about 15 minutes before a shower and then rinse it off with my Nutriganics face wash.  My face always feels really good and clean, and it helps keep my face clear of the nasty stuff that sometimes builds up and causes pimples.</li>
            <li> I have tried homemade oat and honey masks, and while they were effective, they were also messy. I tried this product and got fantastic results. Skin felt smoother, and pores appeared smaller. I like the convenience of having a product that is &amp;#34;ready to use&amp;#34;. A little goes a long way. I would definitely purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I think this is one of my more favorite items from the body shop line of products so far. It&#x27;s hydrating, leaves my skin feeling baby smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling like skin is shrinking, I can&#x27;t say it does much for blemishes but it definitely does hydrate and clean and sometimes I cheat and use it twice a week and it&#x27;s gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. It smells like honey oatmeal which is a huge plus as it needs to sit on your face for 10mins. It doesn&#x27;t become hard and crack like others masks. Overall I think this is a great product to add to your rotation if you&#x27;re in need of some occasional pampering.</li>
            <li> For some reason this burned my skin.  I do not have very sensitive skin, but this definitely was uncomfortable for me to use.</li>
            <li> good,statisfy my need</li>
            <li> I love this face scrub/mask.  The texture and fragrance is amazing,  I actually look forward to my beauty routine by starting out with this creamy honey oat scrub.  I purchased it here on Amazon for a great price, in fact bought multiples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t buy it at the Body Shop often because it costs too much for something I go through pretty fast, as it is in small jar.  This product is a winner and I can&#x27;t reccomend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> I hate it! It makes my face burn and my face broke out after I used it. I&#x27;m very unhappy.</li>
            <li> I love this mask!! A little goes along way and it makes your face feel so soft after you use it! Great for exfoliation, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Pamper ur face with this amazing face &amp; ur face will thank u for it:) been using it for years &amp; dnt see myself stopping soon.Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Got to love the Amazing Science behind The Body Shop products.&lt;br /&gt;Smooths on, scrubs clean, doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel too tight after mask, very nourishing.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good enough to eat. LOL ;)</li>
            <li> My second jar. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked it the first time. But when it was time to look for a scrub mask, I looked for this one. It is not one of the products that make an instant change to your skin but regular use works pretty good. The product leaves your skin clean and hydrated, but when i think mask I have this picture of skin forming pore reducing this is different. Clean and hydrated is what you get. So I would suggest you define expectations before you buy.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! Second time purchasing, helps scrub my pores, hydrating on my skin, feels amazingly smooth soft and shiny after!♡♡♡</li>
            <li> Love this product. You&#x27;ll see a difference immediately after you wash your face.&lt;br /&gt;Has to buy a second one for a friend.</li>
            <li> It smell very good. But it hard to wash, and It is not very effective. I prefer another mask of the Body Shop.</li>
            <li> when i opened it, there is no protective thing on the mask and it seemed used by others. Weird !!!!!</li>
            <li> My skin felt very soft and had a nice clean smell. It was very easy to use. I purchased my second jar today. I was able to get two uses out of the jar.</li>
            <li> I am an Afican Ameircan and I use this product once a week. I have dry and extremely sensitive skin and often times most scrubs leave my face feeling dryed out and tight until I put sometype of moisturerizer on. This product leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft. It has a pleasant smell and it gives a nice glow to my skin after use. This is not an abrasive scurb with harsh beads that leave the skin feeling scratchy but this product can be used day or night. My favroite scrub by far!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!, gives a very clean feel to face, smooths the skin. you will definitely see the difference after one use. Have been using for 5 yrs and keep buying it. It does not irritate your skin and I personally like the scent.</li>
            <li> My God... I love this product. I don&#x27;t want to take it off when it&#x27;s on. Smells so good. So soft my ,skin feels.</li>
