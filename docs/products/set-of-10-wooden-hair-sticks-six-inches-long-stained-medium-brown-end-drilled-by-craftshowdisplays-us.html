            <li>They&#x27;re very strong without being bulky.</li>
            <li>I love these chop sticks.</li>
            <li>I need to buy more.</li>
            <li>I love them because they don&#x27;t brake like the plastic ones.  </li>
            <li>Love the length of these.</li>
            <li>great price, fast return&lt;br /&gt;I am waiting for beads and head pins to finish them off, but for now I have been using them the way they are&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These were a great bargain especially for how many you get.</li>
            <li>They hold my hair in place, are comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t slide thru your hair as easily as I would like but the natural color is good.</li>
            <li>Love them exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>They are smooth and have to hole in the end if you want to add some bling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and the product was amazing.</li>
            <li>I have thickish, tailbone length hair, and these sticks worked great for my various buns.</li>
            <li>Very nice hair sticks, but they lost one star due to the tips.</li>
            <li>These sticks could be little smoother but are great for the price.</li>
            <li>The drilled end really helps secure updos.</li>
            <li>Nice to have several around the house and car when you need to put your hair up.  </li>
            <li>I tried to snap one with my hands and couldn&#x27;t do it, so I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;ll last a good long while.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>I was thrilled with mine, exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and pretty.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love these sticks and would recommend them.</li>
            <li>Holds hair securely and with the end drilled, will be easy to decorate with beads, and other trinkets.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re actually quite pretty enough to stand on their own.</li>
            <li>Can break easily, cheap enough not too care much.</li>
            <li>and I they were really appreciated.</li>
            <li>I use them for picking up my hair, noce smooth texture and real hard rose wood.  </li>
            <li>A little sanding was necessary, but they are otherwise really good for the money.</li>
            <li>It only took me about 5 minutes to sand down the tips on a pair and oil them, and the result is quite lovely.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re long enough to secure a large bun, but not so long they get caught on hoods, jackets, etc.</li>
            <li>These sticks are not easy to come by in the first place!!</li>

            <li> I had to sand the flat tips of these to make them usable.</li>
            <li> The wood is quite nice, but the flat tip catches and rips your hair, which is damaging to hair, and painful.</li>
            <li> They are also not too long!</li>
            <li> Sharp on the pointy ends.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set of hair sticks because the other sticks I&#x27;ve owned broke in half when I was putting my hair up.</li>
            <li> Rips hair, but prettier than the black stained ones, even after sanding down tips.</li>
            <li> The ends are somewhat blunt, so I would recommend sanding them into finer points so they slip through the hair a little easier.</li>
            <li> a little too well hahahha.</li>
            <li> The ends are not completely smooth and therefore will catch your hair and pull as you put them in.</li>
            <li> It gets stuck in my hair and pulls painfully at caught strands.</li>

            <li> I love these chop sticks. They hold my hair in place, are comfortable and easy to use.  My only issue is my daughters take them for their hair. I need to buy more.</li>
            <li> I use them for picking up my hair, noce smooth texture and real hard rose wood.  I polished the ends with a nail file to make them go in the hair easier.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Can break easily, cheap enough not too care much.</li>
            <li> Most excellent. Exactly what I was looking for</li>

            <li> Very nice hair sticks, but they lost one star due to the tips. The tip is a blunt, rather than rounded, end. It gets stuck in my hair and pulls painfully at caught strands. I solved this problem by rounding the ends out with sandpaper, and they are great.</li>
            <li> This are great.  Sturdy and work!  I would buy these again, but I have plenty now.  They have holds in the end so I am going to add beading - awesome.  I love them because they don&#x27;t brake like the plastic ones.  They are also not too long!</li>
            <li> These sticks are not easy to come by in the first place!! I was thrilled with mine, exactly what I expected. The sticks are the perfect length, the wood finish is beautiful. The delivery was fast and the product was amazing. I&#x27;m going to order again because this is a fantastic bargain!! I would recommend these over and over again...100%.</li>
            <li> These sticks could be little smoother but are great for the price. They don&#x27;t slide thru your hair as easily as I would like but the natural color is good.</li>
            <li> Love the length of these. Great value for the quantity. Sturdy and pretty. I like the pre-drilled hole in end if you want to embellish.</li>
            <li> These were a great bargain especially for how many you get. The ends are not completely smooth and therefore will catch your hair and pull as you put them in. I put several coats of nail polish on the tips and that has helped.</li>
            <li> These are more of a craft item than a finished product, but for the price and quality they are an excellent buy.  They&#x27;re long enough to secure a large bun, but not so long they get caught on hoods, jackets, etc. It only took me about 5 minutes to sand down the tips on a pair and oil them, and the result is quite lovely.  The I plan to decorate the ends with beadwork etc. but they&#x27;re actually quite pretty enough to stand on their own.</li>
            <li> I like these a lot I have given some away and I they were really appreciated. they work well stay in place.</li>
            <li> Nice size and design.  Holds hair securely and with the end drilled, will be easy to decorate with beads, and other trinkets.</li>
