            <li>Works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>Of the two, this turned out to be stiffer and took care of the matting best.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the hair brush.</li>
            <li>It works great at removing tangles.</li>
            <li>Great item.</li>
            <li>Happy that I found them.</li>
            <li>It works very nicely.     </li>
            <li>I figured that if its good for a wig</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll be good for my over-processed hair.</li>
            <li>The design of this is simply good for kids.</li>
            <li>it was just amazing (no breaking hair).</li>
            <li>I bought the cheapest one, and I still got quite a nice brush.</li>
            <li>I can use this on my own hair.</li>
            <li>It works great... and shipping was free! :)</li>
            <li>I tried it once on m own hair to see what that felt like, and now I&#x27;m planning to buy another one.</li>
            <li>I love this brush; I learned about these wire brushes from buying wigs and the wig companies suggest you buy this brush.</li>
            <li>God commendeth his love toward us, in that,</li>
            <li>This brush was cheaper and clearly more well-made.  </li>
            <li>She says it works better than the AG brush.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>Been using them for years, love &#x27;em</li>
            <li>so glad I found these.</li>
            <li>love them</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t tug out more hair than you would expect, and it detangles better than the doll &#x27;wig brush&#x27;</li>
            <li>Does a fantastic job!</li>
            <li>First, I purchased two wire pin brushes because I wasn&#x27;t sure which one would do the job best on my very curly, longish Elura synthetic wigs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect brush capable of penetrating my hair to reach the scalp, distributing the oils from my scalp to the rest of the hair such that most of my scalp problems would be greatly reduced by the massaging action of my brush, while leaving my hair looking healthy and well-groomed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Black/Filipina woman with waist-length hair that is incredibly fine, dense, unruly, and wavy.</li>
            <li>Works great on American Girl doll hair.  </li>
            <li>Really nice brush, gently on my wigs.</li>
            <li>In any event, those with similar needs but with thinner hair may find themselves much more successful than myself with this particular brush.</li>
            <li>This item is a hard to find but great stimulator to the scalp item!  </li>
            <li>Also it was fast shipping for me :)</li>
            <li>Just be sure to use some kind of conditioner and to always brush out your wig BEFORE you wash it, not when it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li>Being very curly, they tend to matte after awhile and keeping after them with this brush and a conditioner meant to be used on dry synthetic wigs is doing a beautiful job.  </li>
            <li>This is a great brush and does an admirable job, even on a long, very curly wig.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most brushes, this one feels great on my scalp and (as long as I brush slowly and from the ends first) does a nice job of brushing the knots and frizz out of my hair.</li>
            <li>It works great even on the long haired dolls (julie) and the short hair Twins.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bigger than I thought it would be, but that makes it better.</li>
            <li>I purchased it to use for our American Girl dolls and love it.</li>
            <li>Pins began to fall out the first time we used it on my daughyer&#x27;s doll&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>It was exactly the brush that I was shopping for.  </li>
            <li>My ultimate favorite brush.</li>
            <li>As long as the wig stayed on the head I could brush it with a lot more ease than I think could be done with a brush.</li>
            <li>exactly what i expected will order more</li>
            <li>When I brush my hair with this brush it so easily became brushed</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong; you&#x27;ll still need a decent conditioning product to deal with your colored or tangled hair but this brush feels great on the scalp and does a nice job helping to straighten it out for the next step.</li>
            <li>Be gentle in the crown area</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll find out when my Scalpmaster #125 comes in, as it&#x27;s much wider.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, that means that it will be much sturdier.</li>
            <li>This wire brush works very well.</li>
            <li>We like this so much that we purchased one for a friend.    </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying AG products.</li>
            <li>but it really made it easier.</li>
            <li>Very well designed product.</li>
            <li>Since this brush was marketed towards grooming wigs, I decided it was worth a try, as wig brushes need to be gentle enough to keep from pulling out the hair woven into the wig cap.</li>
            <li>Rather than spend more $$ on the specific brush made for American Girl dolls...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I recommend this brush highly.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for any one of any age with any type hair be it soft, straight or curled.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and mostly straight-ish (actually, it has multiple personalities - fine, coarse, curly, wavy, straight, frizzy..., but the dominant personality is straight).</li>
            <li>Brush is sturdy and better than slightly above average quality build.</li>
            <li>I am an African-American woman who purchased this item to detangle my wigs, weaves, and natural hair.</li>
            <li>The wire pins are so soft in the edge</li>
            <li>Had several like this brush before and really like them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking that this brush is probably too thin in width for hair as dense and unruly as my own.</li>
            <li>BRUSH WAS EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED &amp; EXPECTED, THX!</li>
            <li>Cushions are signifigant and pins are set far enough apart to get through tangle prone hair without undoing curls.</li>
            <li>As my wigs are worn for religious reasons, I want them to always look natural and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, while this brush did, indeed, penetrate through my hair to the scalp and gave me a lovely scalp massage that could only be described as heavenly, I found that my hair is still just a little too much for it.</li>

            <li> It works great at removing tangles. Be gentle in the crown area so you don&#x27;t damage the head piece. After using it for about a week, the pin pad started popping out when it hit a tough snag. It still works, but is a pain to keep popping back in.</li>
            <li> exactly what i expected will order more</li>
            <li> Heyla and well met!  I&#x27;m a Black/Filipina woman with waist-length hair that is incredibly fine, dense, unruly, and wavy. I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect brush capable of penetrating my hair to reach the scalp, distributing the oils from my scalp to the rest of the hair such that most of my scalp problems would be greatly reduced by the massaging action of my brush, while leaving my hair looking healthy and well-groomed. Since this brush was marketed towards grooming wigs, I decided it was worth a try, as wig brushes need to be gentle enough to keep from pulling out the hair woven into the wig cap. Unfortunately, while this brush did, indeed, penetrate through my hair to the scalp and gave me a lovely scalp massage that could only be described as heavenly, I found that my hair is still just a little too much for it. I&#x27;ve only had this brush for about a couple of hours, but the cushion is already beginning to come off. I&#x27;m thinking that this brush is probably too thin in width for hair as dense and unruly as my own. I&#x27;ll find out when my Scalpmaster #125 comes in, as it&#x27;s much wider. Hopefully, that means that it will be much sturdier. In any event, those with similar needs but with thinner hair may find themselves much more successful than myself with this particular brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use with my granddaughters American Girl doll. It works great even on the long haired dolls (julie) and the short hair Twins. Easier to handle and cost much less.</li>
            <li> Brush is sturdy and better than slightly above average quality build. Cushions are signifigant and pins are set far enough apart to get through tangle prone hair without undoing curls. I am an African-American woman who purchased this item to detangle my wigs, weaves, and natural hair.</li>
            <li> I love this brush; I learned about these wire brushes from buying wigs and the wig companies suggest you buy this brush. I figured that if its good for a wig (\\&quot;be careful how you brush it\\&quot;, etc.) it&#x27;ll be good for my over-processed hair. And it is! Unlike most brushes, this one feels great on my scalp and (as long as I brush slowly and from the ends first) does a nice job of brushing the knots and frizz out of my hair. Don&#x27;t get me wrong; you&#x27;ll still need a decent conditioning product to deal with your colored or tangled hair but this brush feels great on the scalp and does a nice job helping to straighten it out for the next step.</li>

            <li> This wire brush works very well. I purchased it to use for our American Girl dolls and love it. It works very nicely.     \\&quot;But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\\&quot; Romans 5:8 [...]</li>
            <li> The spikes were falling out of our American Girl brand brush and the cushion that held them kept coming out also.    We like this so much that we purchased one for a friend.    If your daughter loves styling her American Girl doll&#x27;s \\&quot;wig quality\\&quot; hair, this is the brush for you. It will last as long as the dolls. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Use as a wig brush. I like it.</li>
            <li> Works great on American Girl doll hair.  Always remember to wet hair before brushing.  Much cheaper than buying AG products.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for a VERY long wig that I&#x27;d be using for Halloween. I bought the cheapest one, and I still got quite a nice brush. I can use this on my own hair. I recently had to cut it because it was not very strong and still sometimes when I brushed my hair now (short) it would still pull and break. When I brush my hair with this brush it so easily became brushed it was just amazing (no breaking hair). I think that brushing any wing is a pain (mine because it is VERY long) but it really made it easier. As long as the wig stayed on the head I could brush it with a lot more ease than I think could be done with a brush. I recommend this and wonder why it&#x27;s not sold in stores. Also it was fast shipping for me :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my girls to use on their AG dolls. It works just as I thought it would!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to use for her American Girl dolls when her official AG hair brush fell apart.  This brush was cheaper and clearly more well-made.  She says it works better than the AG brush.</li>
            <li> I used this on an old wig and it brought it half way back to life. Love it.</li>
            <li> This item is a hard to find but great stimulator to the scalp item!  I don&#x27;t know why they stopped selling this in our area, but I love it and had to have enough to last me for a few years at least!</li>
            <li> The design of this is simply good for kids. The wire pins are so soft in the edge and my kids dont complain at all while combing their hair. Very well designed product. I recommend this for any one of any age with any type hair be it soft, straight or curled.</li>
            <li> Rather than spend more $$ on the specific brush made for American Girl dolls... we went with this brush.  It works great... and shipping was free! :)</li>
            <li> Finally found the brush I&#x27;ve been looking for! Works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> First, I purchased two wire pin brushes because I wasn&#x27;t sure which one would do the job best on my very curly, longish Elura synthetic wigs.  Of the two, this turned out to be stiffer and took care of the matting best.  As my wigs are worn for religious reasons, I want them to always look natural and shiny.  Being very curly, they tend to matte after awhile and keeping after them with this brush and a conditioner meant to be used on dry synthetic wigs is doing a beautiful job.  One review mentioned that the cushion pops out, but I brush only one small section at a time due to the length of the curls, and I have not found any problems with the cushion popping out.  I think that if you restrict yourself to brushing one small area at a time, this will not be a problem.  By the way, it was absolutely impossible to find a wire brush in any stores around me.  I got tired of looking and did what I always do; look in Amazon.  This is a great brush and does an admirable job, even on a long, very curly wig.  Just be sure to use some kind of conditioner and to always brush out your wig BEFORE you wash it, not when it&#x27;s wet.  I recommend this brush highly.</li>
            <li> Pins began to fall out the first time we used it on my daughyer&#x27;s doll&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It was exactly the brush that I was shopping for.  Happy that I found them.</li>
            <li> My ultimate favorite brush.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. They&#x27;re hard to find, and I hope this company never stops making them. Every time I try to find a substitute I end up with another brush in my drawer of cosmetic failures. What does one do with things of this nature, which can&#x27;t be given away or sold? Throw them in a landfill? Figure out a craft project to use them in? My hair is thick and mostly straight-ish (actually, it has multiple personalities - fine, coarse, curly, wavy, straight, frizzy..., but the dominant personality is straight).</li>
            <li> Been using them for years, love &#x27;em</li>
            <li> so glad I found these. love them</li>
            <li> I use this brush fairly regularly on some kanekalon wigs. It doesn&#x27;t tug out more hair than you would expect, and it detangles better than the doll &#x27;wig brush&#x27; I was using before. I tried it once on m own hair to see what that felt like, and now I&#x27;m planning to buy another one.</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job!</li>
            <li> Only brush I owned for last 40 years. This will be only the 3 th one in that time</li>
            <li> Really nice brush, gently on my wigs.</li>
            <li> BRUSH WAS EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED &amp; EXPECTED, THX!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the hair brush. Just what I wanted. Had several like this brush before and really like them.</li>
