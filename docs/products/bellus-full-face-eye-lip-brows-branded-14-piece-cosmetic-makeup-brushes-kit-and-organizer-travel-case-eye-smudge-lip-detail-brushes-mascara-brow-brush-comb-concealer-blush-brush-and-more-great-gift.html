            <li>This is a very nice brush set.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are nice, but they have difficulty staying attached to the sticks!</li>
            <li>Those are awesome brushes and I will be purchasing in the future because I am a cosmetologist and need the best of the best....</li>
            <li>These are some great quality brushes at an amazing price.</li>
            <li>These are a good backup/travel/gym set of brushes.</li>
            <li>They smell like the plastic that they come in, but a good wash with some brush cleaner takes care of that.</li>
            <li>these brushes are good quality but some of the brushes weren&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Good starter kit.</li>
            <li>Foundation and blush brush are good quality.</li>
            <li>The brushes are well made and there is a good variety of them.</li>
            <li>and it was good</li>
            <li>but it rolls out beautifully to reveal 13 lovely brushes.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m still testing some of them and luckily I have an excellent foundation and eye shadow brush.</li>
            <li>but these are just as good, OR BETTER!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the quality of the brushes.  </li>
            <li>love the case its very nice no issue with it.</li>
            <li>great if you need some cheap brushes, good range of brushes, but man they break apart, always unglue from the handle.</li>
            <li>The bristles are fine, the case is very nice, the amount of brushes and variety is good.  </li>
            <li>OMG I&#x27;m in LOVE!</li>
            <li>I love the case they come in as well, the magnetic snap is a plus too!  </li>
            <li>I love mine!</li>
            <li>and they were amazing.</li>
            <li>cause it&#x27;s so nice and sleek.</li>
            <li>They are nicely packed in the pouch.</li>
            <li>I got these for my daughter, she was thrilled with them.  </li>
            <li>This set, however, is extremely nice.</li>
            <li>and you get a nice case.</li>
            <li>I kind of had an idea of what to expect from this product from reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>Nice application.</li>
            <li>Over all...a nice product for the cost.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a nice set for the price.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t expect this nice of quality.</li>
            <li>Just letting you know in case that kind of thing annoys you.</li>
            <li>I found that they work nicely, and they don&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li>My family now jokes around that I can start my own beauty salon.</li>
            <li>For the price, the brushes were a nice set.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this brushes, they are very good and arrived fast.</li>
            <li>but for now they get the job done nicely :)</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft, and the case is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, the smell wore off right away, and I&#x27;m very happy with the brushes themselves.</li>
            <li>Very nice starting kit for a great value</li>
            <li>The brushes do have a oil/chemical smell, but very very light.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Quality of brush is good ,they are very soft and purse is too good.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the quality of the brushes, very good.</li>
            <li>I received these brushes in the mail today and they are soft to the touch and of very good quaility.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I opened the box to the lovely smell of vanilla, then got a whiff of the paint fumes.</li>
            <li>For the price I think this is a wonderful starting kit.</li>
            <li>but it is okay for a starter kit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying this set of brushes.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I replaced these with better brushes after a week.</li>
            <li>Brushes were okay</li>
            <li>I love the case as well.</li>
            <li>I received item within next day from purchase so thats great!</li>
            <li>but before I could most of the brushes they fell apart I had to regule them</li>
            <li>Love the brushes.</li>
            <li>This set is a fabulous deal!</li>
            <li>All in all, I would definitely buy again, my makeup application is pretty flawless, and it keeps me organized having the nice case!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them they do reek a bit</li>
            <li>I love this 13 piece makeup brush set and case.</li>
            <li>As soon as I took one out of the case the top of the brush fell off.</li>
            <li>Glue doesn&#x27;t hold tips on for more than a week.</li>
            <li>The brushes were okay.</li>
            <li>I love my brushes but the reason I titled it think about it</li>
            <li>I was really pleased with these brushes, and you cannot beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a kit that you intend on using more than three times, I suggest not buying this product.</li>
            <li>but for now these will do. :)</li>
            <li>However, I really like 3 of their brushes which works really great for concealers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kinda jealous:)</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic brush set for the price!</li>
            <li>Definitely glad I bought these.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>When I got the brushes it was ok until I started to apply my makeup with one of the brushes and</li>
            <li>The foundation/concealer brush is pretty good, I have to blend with my finger though.</li>
            <li>Bought this because I needed some new brushes and they work great.</li>
            <li>They shipped quickly and came wrapped nicely in the faux leatherette case.</li>
            <li>Super quality bag and amazing brushes.</li>
            <li>I did not pay a ton of money for them, but good quality brushes are essential for good makeup application.</li>
            <li>but when I tried to clean the brushes the head of the brush popped off very easily.</li>
            <li>All the rest are fine or better though.</li>
            <li>very high quality brushes and they feel good to your face.</li>
            <li>The brush feels soft and does a great job</li>
            <li>The case is also very nice and soft as well.</li>
            <li>The quality of the brush is not bad!</li>
            <li>Love that I finally have all the brushes I need to do great makeup.</li>
            <li>This product seemed good from the reviews posted here on Amazon, so I thought it would be a half-way decent brush set.  </li>
            <li>I own many different makeup brushes and this does not come close, the material isn&#x27;t that nice.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t take issue with the materials the brushes are made of, which seem fine.  </li>
            <li>This here is a fine set of brushes.</li>
            <li>Before that they worked fine.</li>
            <li>a dab of super glue can&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li>for the cost, you really could not do better!</li>
            <li>I do my makeup several times a week and so great brushes are a must</li>
            <li>brushes clean easy and dont lose hairs.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t realize how much I was getting when I ordered this product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone for the price and the prompt shipping and overall great experience with these brushes.</li>
            <li>If u want GREAT make up brushes u will have to spend some extra $$</li>
            <li>They are not fluffy or good quality.</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft and they manufacturer took care to make sure they were wrapped nicely.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product but its a good STARTER kit for make up artists or daily use.</li>
            <li>The case is beautiful too, and totally makes the set worth it.</li>
            <li>they pretty much are just good for your face and maybe eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I read all or the reviews thinking the brushes were cheap or I would recieve them broken, But all of the brushes are beautiful, Super soft, and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>I am SO excited.</li>
            <li>and I am SO EXCITED to use them.</li>
            <li>thats its original price.</li>
            <li>These are my first makeup brush which i like most.</li>
            <li>come off the handles as I was taking them out of the package to clean them.</li>
            <li>There is a nice variety and they are very soft.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews in high hopes and thought they might be kind of cheaply made..and I was right.  </li>
            <li>I like that the handles are long and the brushes are full, the case is very nice.</li>
            <li>it was special price</li>
            <li>it was more like a new smell!!  </li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft and the case is nice.</li>
            <li>i like this set, the brushes are soft and i liked the ones i used so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fan brush is okay, I don&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li>The brushes once they were repaired Were not bad</li>
            <li>For the price they are not bad</li>
            <li>Anyway quick review since I have not used them.</li>
            <li>But it quickly dissapeated and to me</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need anything fancy so if you want some super fancy brushes these aren&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>So, I had to buy some super glue to re-attach them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing super glue can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>The fibers are soft and suitable for the price</li>
            <li>When these initially arrived, I was happy to have such a variety of brushes for such a great cost.</li>
            <li>My daughter just washed them prior to first use and they are good to go.  </li>
            <li>When I received the product in the mail, the bristles felt cheap and were too firm to successfully do any of their jobs.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are good, but I had to hot glue all the handles back on.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>I honestly feel like I got such a good deal on this set, I feel a bit sad stealing them :p</li>
            <li>It amazing the same day</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>A dab of good glue seems to be doing the trick but not really what I want to be worrying about when putting on my makeup.</li>
            <li>Useful investment.</li>
            <li>I love the case, the case makes them seem professional.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The case is very nice with a double clear protective screen to encase the brushes.</li>
            <li>The handle fell off pretty quickly</li>
            <li>it has a pretty strong plastic smell, but it&#x27;s not like one would expect a high quality case when you are buying 13 brushes for less than $14.The brushes are a very good value for the price, but don&#x27;t expect high end makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>this product is great, the brushes are super soft and haven&#x27;t shed a single hair yet, even through washing.  </li>
            <li>Becaue I needed them right away</li>
            <li>I barely started using these brushes and the stick detaches from the top of the brush.</li>
            <li>Kind of long</li>
            <li>the assortment was perfect for what i needed, only other brushes it could use are large foundation and eyeshadow brushes but already had them.  </li>
            <li>My last makeup brushes were from Estee Lauder and these are far superior.</li>
            <li>They are soft and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be replacing them slowly as I find other brushes that I use more, such as a stippling brush and a foundation brush, but this is an excellent kit to get me going on my newfound brush addiction.</li>
            <li>Superglue fixed it fine for me.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush kit</li>
            <li>you can reglue but it is a pain besides that it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>the brushes started falling apart within the first two uses.  </li>
            <li>So soft and they do not look cheaply made at all.</li>
            <li>but I will know if I love them after start using them on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>One was already separated when I first opened the package...</li>
            <li>, this is my first brush kit</li>
            <li>My sisters were the first to start falling apart and breaking</li>
            <li>She seems to love all the different sizes and quality.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>They are soft, but clearly synthetic and aren&#x27;t nearly as nice as my high end set.  </li>
            <li>That was a little aggravating but I&#x27;m not complaining because it was a good price for decent brushes and case.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>However this was the only brush that broke and was a quick fix with super glue.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase and would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>so I was looking for decent budgeted brushes and this is it for me!</li>
            <li>The case is fine, I will probably slowly replace the brushes with better ones and still use the case.  </li>
            <li>It should also be noted that the handles are pretty long, which is no issue if you plan to keep them in their pleather case, but they BARELY fit into my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>I really like this makeup brush set.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment too much since I have not officially use brushes yet</li>
            <li>Btw they cam REALLY REALLY fast</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot from the price.  </li>
            <li>but I was very disapointed how filmsly it was.</li>
            <li>Like really, the glue has expired...</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;deal\\&quot; isn&#x27;t really a deal at all.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get such a large crush set for 10 dollars.</li>
            <li>this is my first bellus set and let me tell you dont let the new name fool you.</li>
            <li>Other then that I love them.</li>
            <li>The package arrived within a few days, I was surprised with the great case it came in, brushes are very soft, and haven&#x27;t shed so far.</li>
            <li>A really good value, especially since it is less than $1 per brush</li>
            <li>I needed a decent set of makeup brushes</li>
            <li>This brush set arrived quickly in a decent padded \\&quot;pleather\\&quot; roll up case.</li>
            <li>These are decent for the price and the selection for brushes.  </li>
            <li>The leather case they come in has notches for a little pocket for each brush and a plastic overlayer, over which the case snaps shuts, so they are tucked in very securely.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft and after examination feel very sturdy and well put together.</li>
            <li>These are very soft!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>I will be sticking with my high end brushes.</li>
            <li>Nice set, has everything you need, the bristles do not fall out and they are soft but not too soft to not complete the job properly.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, poorly made.</li>
            <li>I am just new to eye-makeup</li>
            <li>I will continue to use these until I buy a new set in a year or so, but I don&#x27;t see myself holding on to them forever.</li>
            <li>so I will have to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are not too soft or too hard, and there is every kind of brush I can imagine needing.</li>
            <li>Very food quality brushed in what I think is a real leather case.</li>
            <li>These seem to be durable brushes - all are very soft.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and hold powder well.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are very soft, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding issues, and I&#x27;ve had them for about a month now.</li>
            <li>You get 12 brushes and they are very soft and mine didn&#x27;t smell like some people said they did.</li>
            <li>They are all very soft, and I have not had any problems with bristles falling out.</li>
            <li>The case is an immitation leather - very soft.  </li>
            <li>Brushes seems nice and soft but not too soft, bristles are very firm in place so far</li>
            <li>also found videos on youtube for putting together an simple brush stand for easier access day to day and a pretty display on your counter.  </li>
            <li>They are so damn soft!</li>
            <li>The case is really pretty overall</li>
            <li>especially if you clean them on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>The previous brush set that I had was a cheap set that I got from WalMart</li>
            <li>The only problem I had with one of the two sets that I bought is that the two larger brushes came unglued so I had to dab some super glue to them.</li>
            <li>Going to super glue it back on, so it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li>Has the essential make up brushes and they feel very soft and blend very well.</li>
            <li>Most brushes and makeups wrapped tightly in plastic has that smell, but one night in the open does the trick.</li>
            <li>Especially for the price, these are very high quality brushes.</li>
            <li>and I use the eyemakeup brushes frequently.  </li>
            <li>so I took them out of the case and aired it out overnight</li>
            <li>The quality of these brushes far outweighs that setback.</li>
            <li>They are baby feather soft on your skin and distribute product evenly.</li>
            <li>One of the brushes&#x27; tips came off early (misglued), but I just reglued it with no problem.  </li>
            <li>These fell completely apart within weeks.</li>
            <li>Very much worth my money and with minimal care</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a good brush set to buy a sibling for christmas, and everything under $20 seemed to be fake.</li>
            <li>So if you have that issue just a quick bite down or use some pliers.</li>
            <li>Because of the reviews I checked each one when they arrived, some of the handles were not tight in the jackets, a little super glue fixed that.</li>
            <li>Nothing a little super or wood glue won&#x27;t fix, but you&#x27;d think they would glue these before selling them.  </li>
            <li>Granted, these aren&#x27;t expensive makeup brushes, but no matter what the price, you expect better workmanship than this!</li>
            <li>Daughter loves, so does our cat, due to real animal hair bristles... case is not very good, but it was included for free, so who can complain?</li>
            <li>I have not used, and probably won&#x27;t use the powder/blush brushes because I use bare minerals</li>
            <li>The case is a little plastic-smelling when it arrives, but it goes away (unless you stick your nose right up to it).</li>
            <li>Other than that I haven&#x27;t had a problem and they work really well.</li>
            <li>The fan brush (used for highlighting) is WAY too thin and kind of rough</li>
            <li>My first experience with these brushes was me pulling the powder brush out of its little holder and having the brush head separate from the handle.</li>
            <li>The brushes did have a funny odor but nothing that airing them out for a few days didn&#x27;t take care of.</li>
            <li>These brushes really let me down!</li>

            <li> This is a very nice brush set.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are nice, but they have difficulty staying attached to the sticks!</li>
            <li> Those are awesome brushes and I will be purchasing in the future because I am a cosmetologist and need the best of the best....</li>
            <li> These are some great quality brushes at an amazing price.</li>
            <li> These are a good backup/travel/gym set of brushes.</li>
            <li> They smell like the plastic that they come in, but a good wash with some brush cleaner takes care of that.</li>
            <li> these brushes are good quality but some of the brushes weren&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Good starter kit.</li>
            <li> Foundation and blush brush are good quality.</li>
            <li> The brushes are well made and there is a good variety of them.</li>
            <li> and it was good</li>
            <li> but it rolls out beautifully to reveal 13 lovely brushes.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m still testing some of them and luckily I have an excellent foundation and eye shadow brush.</li>
            <li> but these are just as good, OR BETTER!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the quality of the brushes.  </li>
            <li> love the case its very nice no issue with it.</li>
            <li> great if you need some cheap brushes, good range of brushes, but man they break apart, always unglue from the handle.</li>
            <li> The bristles are fine, the case is very nice, the amount of brushes and variety is good.  </li>
            <li> OMG I&#x27;m in LOVE!</li>
            <li> I love the case they come in as well, the magnetic snap is a plus too!  </li>

            <li> cause it&#x27;s so nice and sleek.</li>
            <li> They are nicely packed in the pouch.</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughter, she was thrilled with them.  </li>
            <li> This set, however, is extremely nice.</li>
            <li> and you get a nice case.</li>
            <li> I kind of had an idea of what to expect from this product from reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> Nice application.</li>
            <li> Over all...a nice product for the cost.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a nice set for the price.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t expect this nice of quality.</li>
            <li> Just letting you know in case that kind of thing annoys you.</li>
            <li> I found that they work nicely, and they don&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li> My family now jokes around that I can start my own beauty salon.</li>
            <li> For the price, the brushes were a nice set.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this brushes, they are very good and arrived fast.</li>
            <li> but for now they get the job done nicely :)</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft, and the case is perfect.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, the smell wore off right away, and I&#x27;m very happy with the brushes themselves.</li>
            <li> Very nice starting kit for a great value</li>
            <li> The brushes do have a oil/chemical smell, but very very light.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Quality of brush is good ,they are very soft and purse is too good.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the quality of the brushes, very good.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes in the mail today and they are soft to the touch and of very good quaility.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I opened the box to the lovely smell of vanilla, then got a whiff of the paint fumes.</li>
            <li> For the price I think this is a wonderful starting kit.</li>
            <li> but it is okay for a starter kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this set of brushes.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I replaced these with better brushes after a week.</li>
            <li> Brushes were okay</li>
            <li> I love the case as well.</li>
            <li> I received item within next day from purchase so thats great!</li>
            <li> but before I could most of the brushes they fell apart I had to regule them</li>
            <li> Love the brushes.</li>
            <li> This set is a fabulous deal!</li>
            <li> All in all, I would definitely buy again, my makeup application is pretty flawless, and it keeps me organized having the nice case!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them they do reek a bit</li>
            <li> I love this 13 piece makeup brush set and case.</li>
            <li> As soon as I took one out of the case the top of the brush fell off.</li>
            <li> Glue doesn&#x27;t hold tips on for more than a week.</li>
            <li> The brushes were okay.</li>
            <li> I love my brushes but the reason I titled it think about it</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with these brushes, and you cannot beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a kit that you intend on using more than three times, I suggest not buying this product.</li>
            <li> but for now these will do. :)</li>
            <li> However, I really like 3 of their brushes which works really great for concealers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda jealous:)</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic brush set for the price!</li>
            <li> Definitely glad I bought these.</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> When I got the brushes it was ok until I started to apply my makeup with one of the brushes and</li>
            <li> The foundation/concealer brush is pretty good, I have to blend with my finger though.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I needed some new brushes and they work great.</li>
            <li> They shipped quickly and came wrapped nicely in the faux leatherette case.</li>
            <li> Super quality bag and amazing brushes.</li>
            <li> I did not pay a ton of money for them, but good quality brushes are essential for good makeup application.</li>
            <li> but when I tried to clean the brushes the head of the brush popped off very easily.</li>
            <li> All the rest are fine or better though.</li>
            <li> very high quality brushes and they feel good to your face.</li>
            <li> The brush feels soft and does a great job</li>
            <li> The case is also very nice and soft as well.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brush is not bad!</li>
            <li> Love that I finally have all the brushes I need to do great makeup.</li>
            <li> This product seemed good from the reviews posted here on Amazon, so I thought it would be a half-way decent brush set.  </li>
            <li> I own many different makeup brushes and this does not come close, the material isn&#x27;t that nice.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t take issue with the materials the brushes are made of, which seem fine.  </li>
            <li> This here is a fine set of brushes.</li>
            <li> Before that they worked fine.</li>
            <li> a dab of super glue can&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> for the cost, you really could not do better!</li>
            <li> I do my makeup several times a week and so great brushes are a must</li>
            <li> brushes clean easy and dont lose hairs.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t realize how much I was getting when I ordered this product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone for the price and the prompt shipping and overall great experience with these brushes.</li>
            <li> If u want GREAT make up brushes u will have to spend some extra $$</li>
            <li> They are not fluffy or good quality.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft and they manufacturer took care to make sure they were wrapped nicely.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product but its a good STARTER kit for make up artists or daily use.</li>
            <li> The case is beautiful too, and totally makes the set worth it.</li>
            <li> they pretty much are just good for your face and maybe eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I read all or the reviews thinking the brushes were cheap or I would recieve them broken, But all of the brushes are beautiful, Super soft, and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I am SO excited.</li>
            <li> and I am SO EXCITED to use them.</li>
            <li> thats its original price.</li>
            <li> These are my first makeup brush which i like most.</li>
            <li> come off the handles as I was taking them out of the package to clean them.</li>
            <li> There is a nice variety and they are very soft.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews in high hopes and thought they might be kind of cheaply made..and I was right.  </li>
            <li> I like that the handles are long and the brushes are full, the case is very nice.</li>
            <li> it was special price</li>
            <li> it was more like a new smell!!  </li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft and the case is nice.</li>
            <li> i like this set, the brushes are soft and i liked the ones i used so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fan brush is okay, I don&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li> The brushes once they were repaired Were not bad</li>
            <li> For the price they are not bad</li>
            <li> Anyway quick review since I have not used them.</li>
            <li> But it quickly dissapeated and to me</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need anything fancy so if you want some super fancy brushes these aren&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> So, I had to buy some super glue to re-attach them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing super glue can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> The fibers are soft and suitable for the price</li>
            <li> When these initially arrived, I was happy to have such a variety of brushes for such a great cost.</li>
            <li> My daughter just washed them prior to first use and they are good to go.  </li>
            <li> When I received the product in the mail, the bristles felt cheap and were too firm to successfully do any of their jobs.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are good, but I had to hot glue all the handles back on.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> I honestly feel like I got such a good deal on this set, I feel a bit sad stealing them :p</li>
            <li> It amazing the same day</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> A dab of good glue seems to be doing the trick but not really what I want to be worrying about when putting on my makeup.</li>
            <li> Useful investment.</li>
            <li> I love the case, the case makes them seem professional.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The case is very nice with a double clear protective screen to encase the brushes.</li>
            <li> The handle fell off pretty quickly</li>
            <li> it has a pretty strong plastic smell, but it&#x27;s not like one would expect a high quality case when you are buying 13 brushes for less than $14.The brushes are a very good value for the price, but don&#x27;t expect high end makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> this product is great, the brushes are super soft and haven&#x27;t shed a single hair yet, even through washing.  </li>
            <li> Becaue I needed them right away</li>
            <li> I barely started using these brushes and the stick detaches from the top of the brush.</li>
            <li> Kind of long</li>
            <li> the assortment was perfect for what i needed, only other brushes it could use are large foundation and eyeshadow brushes but already had them.  </li>
            <li> My last makeup brushes were from Estee Lauder and these are far superior.</li>
            <li> They are soft and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be replacing them slowly as I find other brushes that I use more, such as a stippling brush and a foundation brush, but this is an excellent kit to get me going on my newfound brush addiction.</li>
            <li> Superglue fixed it fine for me.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush kit</li>
            <li> you can reglue but it is a pain besides that it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> the brushes started falling apart within the first two uses.  </li>
            <li> So soft and they do not look cheaply made at all.</li>
            <li> but I will know if I love them after start using them on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> One was already separated when I first opened the package...</li>
            <li> , this is my first brush kit</li>
            <li> My sisters were the first to start falling apart and breaking</li>
            <li> She seems to love all the different sizes and quality.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> They are soft, but clearly synthetic and aren&#x27;t nearly as nice as my high end set.  </li>
            <li> That was a little aggravating but I&#x27;m not complaining because it was a good price for decent brushes and case.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> However this was the only brush that broke and was a quick fix with super glue.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase and would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> so I was looking for decent budgeted brushes and this is it for me!</li>
            <li> The case is fine, I will probably slowly replace the brushes with better ones and still use the case.  </li>
            <li> It should also be noted that the handles are pretty long, which is no issue if you plan to keep them in their pleather case, but they BARELY fit into my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I really like this makeup brush set.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment too much since I have not officially use brushes yet</li>
            <li> Btw they cam REALLY REALLY fast</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot from the price.  </li>
            <li> but I was very disapointed how filmsly it was.</li>
            <li> Like really, the glue has expired...</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;deal\\&quot; isn&#x27;t really a deal at all.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get such a large crush set for 10 dollars.</li>
            <li> this is my first bellus set and let me tell you dont let the new name fool you.</li>
            <li> Other then that I love them.</li>
            <li> The package arrived within a few days, I was surprised with the great case it came in, brushes are very soft, and haven&#x27;t shed so far.</li>
            <li> A really good value, especially since it is less than $1 per brush</li>
            <li> I needed a decent set of makeup brushes</li>
            <li> This brush set arrived quickly in a decent padded \\&quot;pleather\\&quot; roll up case.</li>
            <li> These are decent for the price and the selection for brushes.  </li>
            <li> The leather case they come in has notches for a little pocket for each brush and a plastic overlayer, over which the case snaps shuts, so they are tucked in very securely.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft and after examination feel very sturdy and well put together.</li>
            <li> These are very soft!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I will be sticking with my high end brushes.</li>
            <li> Nice set, has everything you need, the bristles do not fall out and they are soft but not too soft to not complete the job properly.  </li>
            <li> Good quality, poorly made.</li>
            <li> I am just new to eye-makeup</li>
            <li> I will continue to use these until I buy a new set in a year or so, but I don&#x27;t see myself holding on to them forever.</li>
            <li> so I will have to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are not too soft or too hard, and there is every kind of brush I can imagine needing.</li>
            <li> Very food quality brushed in what I think is a real leather case.</li>
            <li> These seem to be durable brushes - all are very soft.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and hold powder well.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are very soft, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding issues, and I&#x27;ve had them for about a month now.</li>
            <li> You get 12 brushes and they are very soft and mine didn&#x27;t smell like some people said they did.</li>
            <li> They are all very soft, and I have not had any problems with bristles falling out.</li>
            <li> The case is an immitation leather - very soft.  </li>
            <li> Brushes seems nice and soft but not too soft, bristles are very firm in place so far</li>
            <li> also found videos on youtube for putting together an simple brush stand for easier access day to day and a pretty display on your counter.  </li>
            <li> They are so damn soft!</li>
            <li> The case is really pretty overall</li>
            <li> especially if you clean them on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> The previous brush set that I had was a cheap set that I got from WalMart</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with one of the two sets that I bought is that the two larger brushes came unglued so I had to dab some super glue to them.</li>
            <li> Going to super glue it back on, so it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> Has the essential make up brushes and they feel very soft and blend very well.</li>
            <li> Most brushes and makeups wrapped tightly in plastic has that smell, but one night in the open does the trick.</li>
            <li> Especially for the price, these are very high quality brushes.</li>
            <li> and I use the eyemakeup brushes frequently.  </li>
            <li> so I took them out of the case and aired it out overnight</li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes far outweighs that setback.</li>
            <li> They are baby feather soft on your skin and distribute product evenly.</li>
            <li> One of the brushes&#x27; tips came off early (misglued), but I just reglued it with no problem.  </li>
            <li> These fell completely apart within weeks.</li>
            <li> Very much worth my money and with minimal care</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good brush set to buy a sibling for christmas, and everything under $20 seemed to be fake.</li>
            <li> So if you have that issue just a quick bite down or use some pliers.</li>
            <li> Because of the reviews I checked each one when they arrived, some of the handles were not tight in the jackets, a little super glue fixed that.</li>
            <li> Nothing a little super or wood glue won&#x27;t fix, but you&#x27;d think they would glue these before selling them.  </li>
            <li> Granted, these aren&#x27;t expensive makeup brushes, but no matter what the price, you expect better workmanship than this!</li>
            <li> Daughter loves, so does our cat, due to real animal hair bristles... case is not very good, but it was included for free, so who can complain?</li>
            <li> I have not used, and probably won&#x27;t use the powder/blush brushes because I use bare minerals</li>
            <li> The case is a little plastic-smelling when it arrives, but it goes away (unless you stick your nose right up to it).</li>
            <li> Other than that I haven&#x27;t had a problem and they work really well.</li>
            <li> The fan brush (used for highlighting) is WAY too thin and kind of rough</li>
            <li> My first experience with these brushes was me pulling the powder brush out of its little holder and having the brush head separate from the handle.</li>
            <li> The brushes did have a funny odor but nothing that airing them out for a few days didn&#x27;t take care of.</li>
            <li> These brushes really let me down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the eye shadow brushes, they&#x27;re kind of stiff and thin.</li>
            <li> use them every day and so far I haven&#x27;t had any of the usual problems with value brushes such as them coming apart or the bristles falling out when applying make-up and getting every where (which is the most irritating thing imaginable when you are in a hurry), and they apply everything nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I just got mine today and was a little put off by the paint smell, and a bit surprised because I had also ordered 10 tahitian vanilla beans in the same order.</li>
            <li> and it understandably did not last very long.</li>
            <li> then i noticed my brushes were starting to come loose.</li>
            <li> While I do agree with the other comments about the smell when I first opened the package, I feel it&#x27;s a small price to pay for these brushes.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that after awhile the glue holding the wooden handle to the metal of the brush wears out and they slip off, but adding a little extra glue fixes that.</li>
            <li> you could have these a long time.</li>
            <li> Fluffy and soft.</li>
            <li> I ordered abt 4 other things the same day and this came like almost the nxt day!</li>
            <li> Instead of trying to save a few dollars with this brush set, spring for a better quality set so you won&#x27;t be stuck with a useless brush set.</li>
            <li> the only con is that they are a little too long in length</li>
            <li> but they had too many bad reviews</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything great to say nor anything really horrible.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are soft, but I was disappointed to find the largest brush tip not connected to the wooden handle when i opened the case on first inspection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few of them</li>
            <li> I promise I was not that rough with it at all.</li>
            <li> But like a few others that left reviews said, they did smell like spray paint.</li>
            <li> There is an inside flap that covers the brushes to keep them from getting frayed while the case is closed.</li>
            <li> They do not shed as much as other sets I have tried.</li>
            <li> I used other brand brushes and the names are printed on them &#x27;what application brushes used for&#x27;.</li>
            <li> They get the job done in other words.</li>
            <li> But after a week of endless searching, I found this set that retails at $50 for $13, and after reading the reviews I had to order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set for a couple months now and haven&#x27;t had any pieces falling out or any other problems.</li>
            <li> Cheap and bad product.</li>
            <li> So not worth buying at all.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t heavy handed or rough with the brushes but the brush head just fell off.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else said their was a slight paint smell to the pouch that the brushes ame in.  </li>
            <li> Half of the brush heads come off the stick.</li>
            <li> The brushes fell apart just after a few uses, not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> Nothing a little clue can&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> so I just needed a few things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken this case and these brushes on quite a few trips</li>
            <li> I bought these a few months ago and they have progressively fallen apart.</li>
            <li> then I soak for about 3-5 min then rinse with plain water and immediately the smell was gone gone gone after dried.</li>
            <li> Just shows that they are not top quality, but they will suit my needs.</li>
            <li> and voila, no more smell.</li>
            <li> Plus, after a few uses, the heads of at least four of my brushes have fallen off.  </li>
            <li> so i am not sure how to use some brushes (lip?</li>
            <li> Hate that the glue did nto hold but a little presure to clamp them down issue fixed.</li>
            <li> I bought the brushes late in December.</li>
            <li> The case is faux leather but really pretty and had a LITTLE odor of plastic but nothing horrible.</li>
            <li> some useless but after a few months and some baby shampoo cleaning weekly they started detaching.</li>
            <li> also these are not good for eyeshadow...</li>
            <li> I opened  the case one of the brushes got broken.</li>
            <li> One of the brushes was broken, but it&#x27;s nothing that glue can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But i am not experienced in make up</li>
            <li> The bristles of the brushes ARE synthetic and fall out a little but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> i like some of the brushes but am a little disappointed of the professionalism.</li>
            <li> That is my biggest pet peeve, when you are doing your makeup and the stupid brush sheds black hairs all over your face...but these brushes have passed the test.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to spring for an expensive set.</li>
            <li> Nothings wrong with this came on time in the bag, smells like the leather bag</li>
            <li> the brush head fail off.</li>
            <li> Brushes can be very expensive.</li>
            <li> So bad, I was getting a headache.</li>
            <li> The bad things are this...</li>
            <li> but the smell is not that bad the way some people on here stated.</li>
            <li> Not so bad for the price I guess.</li>
            <li> So very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was a horrible product.</li>
            <li> It is a horrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this product is great, the brushes are super soft and haven&#x27;t shed a single hair yet, even through washing.  the assortment was perfect for what i needed, only other brushes it could use are large foundation and eyeshadow brushes but already had them.  the case has a bit of a chemical smell, but doesn&#x27;t linger on the brushes at all and hopefully will fade. also found videos on youtube for putting together an simple brush stand for easier access day to day and a pretty display on your counter.  for the cost, you really could not do better!</li>
            <li> I ordered yesterday, recieved today! I am SO excited. I was expecing them to come tomorrow. Anyway quick review since I have not used them. The case smells ! So bad, I was getting a headache. It hasnt gone away yet and I opened it over an hour ago but it&#x27;s okay cause it&#x27;s so nice and sleek. Kind of long but it rolls out beautifully to reveal 13 lovely brushes. This is my first brush kit and I am SO EXCITED to use them. They are so damn soft! And none of them are fraying, not even the fan brush. I honestly feel like I got such a good deal on this set, I feel a bit sad stealing them :p These are some great quality brushes at an amazing price.</li>
            <li> Run away.  Run away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t take issue with the materials the brushes are made of, which seem fine.  I do take issue with the fact that none of the brush heads have actually been glued to their handles.  If I&#x27;d realized this was a home-assembly project I would have chosen a different set by a different manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I had to Glue  almost every brush back together they all fell off the Handles.  The brushes once they were repaired Were not bad</li>
            <li> These seem to be durable brushes - all are very soft. I am just new to eye-makeup so I was looking for decent budgeted brushes and this is it for me! They are nicely packed in the pouch. Over all great product!</li>
            <li> I needed a decent set of makeup brushes but I didn&#x27;t want to spring for an expensive set. I already have a several Bobbi Brown brushes so I just needed a few things. I was very impressed by the quality of these brushes. They are very soft and hold powder well. Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase and would definitely recommend this product. Also, I did not have an issue with the smell of the faux-leather pouch.</li>
            <li> I really like this makeup brush set.  I have had it for about a month now and I use the eyemakeup brushes frequently.  I have not used, and probably won&#x27;t use the powder/blush brushes because I use bare minerals and I use the brushes that came with it.  But the eyemakeup brushes are great</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughter, she was thrilled with them.  There is a nice variety and they are very soft.</li>
            <li> The previous brush set that I had was a cheap set that I got from WalMart and it understandably did not last very long. This set, however, is extremely nice. The brushes are not too soft or too hard, and there is every kind of brush I can imagine needing. A really good value, especially since it is less than $1 per brush and you get a nice case.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else said their was a slight paint smell to the pouch that the brushes ame in.  But it quickly dissapeated and to me it was more like a new smell!!  Again these brushes are amazing for the price!!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft and the case is nice. My problem is they smell like they were stored in a paint can. I tried airing them out for two days but they still smell. I can&#x27;t use them because as soon as i take one out the smell starts giving me a headache.</li>
            <li> While I do agree with the other comments about the smell when I first opened the package, I feel it&#x27;s a small price to pay for these brushes. I just got mine today and was a little put off by the paint smell, and a bit surprised because I had also ordered 10 tahitian vanilla beans in the same order. I opened the box to the lovely smell of vanilla, then got a whiff of the paint fumes. Luckily, the smell wore off right away, and I&#x27;m very happy with the brushes themselves. They&#x27;re very soft and after examination feel very sturdy and well put together. For the price I think this is a wonderful starting kit. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be replacing them slowly as I find other brushes that I use more, such as a stippling brush and a foundation brush, but this is an excellent kit to get me going on my newfound brush addiction.</li>
            <li> This brush set arrived quickly in a decent padded \\&quot;pleather\\&quot; roll up case. So yeah...it has a pretty strong plastic smell, but it&#x27;s not like one would expect a high quality case when you are buying 13 brushes for less than $14.The brushes are a very good value for the price, but don&#x27;t expect high end makeup brushes. They are soft, but clearly synthetic and aren&#x27;t nearly as nice as my high end set.  These are a good backup/travel/gym set of brushes. It should also be noted that the handles are pretty long, which is no issue if you plan to keep them in their pleather case, but they BARELY fit into my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> great if you need some cheap brushes, good range of brushes, but man they break apart, always unglue from the handle. you can reglue but it is a pain besides that it works pretty well. the metal to hold the bristles in shape on the fan brush broke but it is okay for a starter kit.</li>
            <li> I own many different makeup brushes and this does not come close, the material isn&#x27;t that nice. I gave away to my sister.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I needed some new brushes and they work great. I don&#x27;t need anything fancy so if you want some super fancy brushes these aren&#x27;t it. If you need something basic to get the job done this&#x27;ll do it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this set of brushes. They smell like the plastic that they come in, but a good wash with some brush cleaner takes care of that. They don&#x27;t shed and the application is great. I highly recommend for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken this case and these brushes on quite a few trips and I use the brushes constantly. Very much worth my money and with minimal care you could have these a long time.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I like that the handles are long and the brushes are full, the case is very nice. Because of the reviews I checked each one when they arrived, some of the handles were not tight in the jackets, a little super glue fixed that. I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> The tops of the brushes don&#x27;t stay on the sticks. I suppose you get what you pay for. I replaced these with better brushes after a week.</li>
            <li> This here is a fine set of brushes. Bought them something like a year ago and I&#x27;m still using them today. They&#x27;re soft and there&#x27;s a really wide variety for anything you might need. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> these brushes are good quality but some of the brushes weren&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Daughter loves, so does our cat, due to real animal hair bristles... case is not very good, but it was included for free, so who can complain?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything great to say nor anything really horrible.  The bristles are fine, the case is very nice, the amount of brushes and variety is good.  The bad things are this... the brushes started falling apart within the first two uses.  Nothing a little super or wood glue won&#x27;t fix, but you&#x27;d think they would glue these before selling them.  I will continue to use these until I buy a new set in a year or so, but I don&#x27;t see myself holding on to them forever.</li>
            <li> Good starter kit. Foundation and blush brush are good quality. They do not shed as much as other sets I have tried.</li>
            <li> It amazing the same day I opened  the case one of the brushes got broken. I thougth it was special price but now I know  thats its original price. Cheap and bad product.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews in high hopes and thought they might be kind of cheaply made..and I was right.  Within about a week the eyeliner brush came off the wooden part so I glued it together with Elmer&#x27;s glue. The fan brush (used for highlighting) is WAY too thin and kind of rough (nothing i would want to use under my eyes for highlighting) so I will have to purchase a new one.  The case is fine, I will probably slowly replace the brushes with better ones and still use the case.  Overall, I would not purchase again..this is a case of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great. Good quality brush heads and the case is WONDERFUL! The only problem I had with one of the two sets that I bought is that the two larger brushes came unglued so I had to dab some super glue to them. Other than that I haven&#x27;t had a problem and they work really well. Especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Brushes were okay some useless but after a few months and some baby shampoo cleaning weekly they started detaching.</li>
            <li> These are a steal for the price they are listed at! I used these the same day I got them and they were amazing. So soft and they do not look cheaply made at all. I do my makeup several times a week and so great brushes are a must and that is just what I got! The case is also very nice and soft as well.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. My last makeup brushes were from Estee Lauder and these are far superior. Makeup is easier to apply and blend and there is no fraying of the brushes. I love the case as well.</li>
            <li> These are very soft! They pick up the makeup and apply well, and haven&#x27;t shed when applying or when washing. Very nice starting kit for a great value, I&#x27;d say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pouch does have the paint can smell, but for me it wasn&#x27;t obvious at all. In fact, I can only smell it if I put the pouch up to my nose. The smell hasn&#x27;t transferred to the brushes for me either, so it&#x27;s a total pleasure using them. I didn&#x27;t even need to air them out. And though I imagine I could air out the smell on the pouch I haven&#x27;t needed to since I&#x27;m not gonna go around burying my nose into the pouch all the time (I bought from seller Accessories 4 All).</li>
            <li> This was a horrible product. Half of the brush heads come off the stick. They are not fluffy or good quality. I know that they were 70% off when I bought them, so I did not pay a ton of money for them, but good quality brushes are essential for good makeup application. These just don&#x27;t measure up. I will be sticking with my high end brushes.</li>
            <li> i like  this brush.Quality of brush is good ,they are very soft and purse is too good. These are my first makeup brush which i like most.</li>
            <li> I received item within next day from purchase so thats great! I can&#x27;t comment too much since I have not officially use brushes yet but the smell is not that bad the way some people on here stated. I deodorized them with distil water, baking soda, white vinegar, and baby softer then I soak for about 3-5 min then rinse with plain water and immediately the smell was gone gone gone after dried. Brushes seems nice and soft but not too soft, bristles are very firm in place so far I like them but I will know if I love them after start using them on a regular basis. For the price they are not bad the only con is that they are a little too long in length and I think the name of the type of brush should printed on them individually, for ex: the foundation one should be printed &#x27;foundation brush&#x27; etc... What about people who are not knowledgeable about makeup brushes/and which use for what... beside all that; I do like these brushes. I used other brand brushes and the names are printed on them &#x27;what application brushes used for&#x27;. If brush had name printed I would give a five star.</li>
            <li> The fibers are soft and suitable for the price but but before I could most of the brushes they fell apart I had to regule them</li>
            <li> I kind of had an idea of what to expect from this product from reading the reviews. Packaging was great and the brush case is very nice. The brushes did have a funny odor but nothing that airing them out for a few days didn&#x27;t take care of. The quality of the brush is not bad! They get the job done in other words. Nice application. A lot of the brush heads did fall off before I even tried them out but again...it&#x27;s nothing a dab of super glue can&#x27;t fix! Over all...a nice product for the cost. Brushes can be very expensive. I&#x27;m not expecting these to last a lifetime...but for now they get the job done nicely :)</li>
            <li> Love the brushes. Hate that the glue did nto hold but a little presure to clamp them down issue fixed. So if you have that issue just a quick bite down or use some pliers. love the case its very nice no issue with it. brushes clean easy and dont lose hairs.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the quality of the brushes, very good.I recommend this brushes, they are very good and arrived fast.</li>
            <li> This set is a fabulous deal! The brushes are well made and there is a good variety of them. The case is beautiful too, and totally makes the set worth it.</li>
            <li> These are great. The leather case they come in has notches for a little pocket for each brush and a plastic overlayer, over which the case snaps shuts, so they are tucked in very securely. They also each have individual plastic coverings over the bristles. The brushes themselves are very soft, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding issues, and I&#x27;ve had them for about a month now. The head did come off of one of the smaller brushes, but it fell off in my hand, so I glued it back on, no problem. All in all, I would definitely buy again, my makeup application is pretty flawless, and it keeps me organized having the nice case!</li>
            <li> I thought it was a nice set for the price. One of the brushes was broken, but it&#x27;s nothing that glue can&#x27;t fix. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are nice, but they have difficulty staying attached to the sticks! One was already separated when I first opened the package...a second one separated when I was trying to use it 2 days after I got it! A dab of good glue seems to be doing the trick but not really what I want to be worrying about when putting on my makeup. Granted, these aren&#x27;t expensive makeup brushes, but no matter what the price, you expect better workmanship than this!</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft, but I was disappointed to find the largest brush tip not connected to the wooden handle when i opened the case on first inspection. Going to super glue it back on, so it&#x27;s no big deal. Just shows that they are not top quality, but they will suit my needs.</li>
            <li> I just received my brushes and OMG I&#x27;m in LOVE! I absolutely love them they do reek a bit but once I washed them the smell was gone, this is my first brush kit and I&#x27;m happy I choose these I was going to get shany but they had too many bad reviews and I&#x27;m sooooooo happy with my decision! Btw they cam REALLY REALLY fast I ordered abt 4 other things the same day and this came like almost the nxt day!</li>
            <li> I love this 13 piece makeup brush set and case. I read some reviews stating that the brushes smell so I took them out of the case and aired it out overnight and voila, no more smell. Most brushes and makeups wrapped tightly in plastic has that smell, but one night in the open does the trick. Also, the brushes are great quality. The picture does not do this set justice. I honestly didn&#x27;t realize how much I was getting when I ordered this product. I would recommend to anyone for the price and the prompt shipping and overall great experience with these brushes. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> These are decent for the price and the selection for brushes.  Very basic beginners brushes and thats what I was looking for.  I had to brush heads come off the handles as I was taking them out of the package to clean them. Nothing a little clue can&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> These brushes really let me down! As soon as I took one out of the case the top of the brush fell off. They all were like that.</li>
            <li> My first experience with these brushes was me pulling the powder brush out of its little holder and having the brush head separate from the handle. However this was the only brush that broke and was a quick fix with super glue. The quality of these brushes far outweighs that setback. They are baby feather soft on your skin and distribute product evenly. I only wish it came with a foundation brush. This is the only reason why it is 4 stars and not 5.</li>
            <li> I barely started using these brushes and the stick detaches from the top of the brush. So not worth buying at all. It is a horrible product.</li>
            <li> Glue doesn&#x27;t hold tips on for more than a week.</li>
            <li> The brush tips fall off, at touch of brush! Becaue I needed them right away I didn&#x27;t have time to send back. So, I had to buy some super glue to re-attach them.</li>
            <li> I purchased two sets of these, one for me and one for my sister. My sisters were the first to start falling apart and breaking then i noticed my brushes were starting to come loose. also these are not good for eyeshadow...they pretty much are just good for your face and maybe eyeliner.</li>
            <li> All the brushes fell off the handles.  I have to glue each one of them all.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I bought the brushes late in December. They shipped quickly and came wrapped nicely in the faux leatherette case. You get 12 brushes and they are very soft and mine didn&#x27;t smell like some people said they did. I&#x27;ve only used a few of them but I love them already!!!</li>
            <li> These are really great brushes--for the price I honestly didn&#x27;t expect this nice of quality. No shedding and well made. The brushes are really soft and they manufacturer took care to make sure they were wrapped nicely.</li>
            <li> Why a great value here! Very food quality brushed in what I think is a real leather case. Great for gifting!!</li>
            <li> The brush feels soft and does a great job but when I tried to clean the brushes the head of the brush popped off very easily. I promise I was not that rough with it at all. You could always re- glue, I suppose. Just letting you know in case that kind of thing annoys you.</li>
            <li> i like some of the brushes but am a little disappointed of the professionalism. i&#x27;m still testing some of them and luckily I have an excellent foundation and eye shadow brush. I don&#x27;t recommend if you looking for pro.</li>
            <li> The handle fell off pretty quickly i had to glue them back together. The brushes were okay.</li>
            <li> A lot of the brush heads have fallen off and have needed to be reglued.</li>
            <li> Super quality bag and amazing brushes. I bought these for a friend as a christmas present and found myself wanting to keep them. I told her to buy them for me next christmas. haha.</li>
            <li> The brushes fell apart just after a few uses, not worth the money at all. Instead of trying to save a few dollars with this brush set, spring for a better quality set so you won&#x27;t be stuck with a useless brush set.</li>
            <li> Nice set, has everything you need, the bristles do not fall out and they are soft but not too soft to not complete the job properly.  I love the case they come in as well, the magnetic snap is a plus too!  Would recommend to anyone who wears makeup.</li>
            <li> Especially for the price, these are very high quality brushes. They are all very soft, and I have not had any problems with bristles falling out. I have had these for probably a year now, and they are still in great condition.</li>
            <li> Not the best choice for professionals&lt;br /&gt;Glue on brushes came off after two applications to models&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Not the best, not the worst</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for over a year. I found that they work nicely, and they don&#x27;t shed at all. The only issue is that after awhile the glue holding the wooden handle to the metal of the brush wears out and they slip off, but adding a little extra glue fixes that.</li>
            <li> I love my brushes but the reason I titled it think about it well if you can get this cheaper at a store where you are from then why not go to the store. Nothings wrong with this came on time in the bag, smells like the leather bag but the brushes are covered in plastic. So look at your stores if you don&#x27;t find any cheaper then this is great. Useful investment.</li>
            <li> I read reviews before i purchased and everyone said something about a smell on the brushes.  The brushes do have a oil/chemical smell, but very very light.  My daughter just washed them prior to first use and they are good to go.  Good deal for the price!  I love the case, the case makes them seem professional.</li>
            <li> I have been really happy with this.  The brushes are so soft, and the case is perfect.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with these brushes, and you cannot beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them every day and so far I haven&#x27;t had any of the usual problems with value brushes such as them coming apart or the bristles falling out when applying make-up and getting every where (which is the most irritating thing imaginable when you are in a hurry), and they apply everything nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is very handy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad I came across these!</li>
            <li> This product seemed good from the reviews posted here on Amazon, so I thought it would be a half-way decent brush set.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot from the price.  When I received the product in the mail, the bristles felt cheap and were too firm to successfully do any of their jobs.  Plus, after a few uses, the heads of at least four of my brushes have fallen off.  If you are looking for a kit that you intend on using more than three times, I suggest not buying this product.</li>
            <li> Has the essential make up brushes and they feel very soft and blend very well. However, a&lt;br /&gt;When I was taking off the plastic wrap off the brush handles, TWO of the brush heads popped off just while unwrapping them!! That was a little aggravating but I&#x27;m not complaining because it was a good price for decent brushes and case. It&#x27;s nothing super glue can&#x27;t fix. The bristles of the brushes ARE synthetic and fall out a little but nothing too bad. The case is faux leather but really pretty and had a LITTLE odor of plastic but nothing horrible. The brushes had NO odor whatsoever. The case is really pretty overall I am satisfied with the product but its a good STARTER kit for make up artists or daily use. If u want GREAT make up brushes u will have to spend some extra $$ and the bristles should be made of animal hair. Those are awesome brushes and I will be purchasing in the future because I am a cosmetologist and need the best of the best....but for now these will do. :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are very cheaply made. I was looking forward to the fan brush but I was very disapointed how filmsly it was. However, I really like 3 of their brushes which works really great for concealers. And their lip brushes were great also but I do not like how the powder brushes were made. All in all, I only like 6 out of 13 in this set.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my wife because she can never keep brushes without losing them. She seems to love all the different sizes and quality.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes in the mail today and they are soft to the touch and of very good quaility. The only wish that i have is that they would include what each brush should be used for.</li>
            <li> i like this set, the brushes are soft and i liked the ones i used so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i am not experienced in make up so i am not sure how to use some brushes (lip? eye?)... can someone help me with a picture explaining the name of each brush?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good brush set to buy a sibling for christmas, and everything under $20 seemed to be fake. But after a week of endless searching, I found this set that retails at $50 for $13, and after reading the reviews I had to order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And boy am I happy I did! The leather pouch is exquisite, and the brushes are so, so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was a makeup junkie, I&#x27;d buy three. Get this while it&#x27;s still on sale! I love mine!</li>
            <li> Quality brushes! A great set for my daughter to start with. I&#x27;m kinda jealous:) will by for myself as well.</li>
            <li> When I frist received the producted I was Elated, now that I&#x27;ve had it, the brushes are falling a part...Like really, the glue has expired...I&#x27;m so LIVIED with these brushes...</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic brush set for the price! I have some Estee Lauder brushes, so I got this one to supplement them. My family now jokes around that I can start my own beauty salon.</li>
            <li> Considering the price, these are great brushes. I don&#x27;t have any problems with bristles coming off. The case is very nice with a double clear protective screen to encase the brushes. The only downside of this set is a lack of a smudge brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item the day before yesterday and just got it today. I read all or the reviews thinking the brushes were cheap or I would recieve them broken, But all of the brushes are beautiful, Super soft, and in excellent condition. But like a few others that left reviews said, they did smell like spray paint. Probably the case they come in. Other then that I love them. Definitely glad I bought these.</li>
            <li> I bought these a few months ago and they have progressively fallen apart. Before that they worked fine. Not so bad for the price I guess.</li>
            <li> very high quality brushes and they feel good to your face. I recommend these to anyone because they are awesome. this is my first bellus set and let me tell you dont let the new name fool you. I&#x27;ve had the red shany set and it was good but these are just as good, OR BETTER! I love them</li>
            <li> The brushes are good, but I had to hot glue all the handles back on.</li>
            <li> The case is a little plastic-smelling when it arrives, but it goes away (unless you stick your nose right up to it). I cleaned all the brushes before use. I&#x27;m not a fan of the eye shadow brushes, they&#x27;re kind of stiff and thin. All the rest are fine or better though. The powder and blush brushes are great. Fluffy and soft. The fan brush is okay, I don&#x27;t use it much. The slanted brush is great for eyeliner and using eye shadow as liner. The foundation/concealer brush is pretty good, I have to blend with my finger though. I&#x27;ve had this set for a couple months now and haven&#x27;t had any pieces falling out or any other problems. Overall, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> Only used about 3 brushes</li>
            <li> For the price, the brushes were a nice set.  One of the brushes&#x27; tips came off early (misglued), but I just reglued it with no problem.  They are soft and easy to use.  The case is an immitation leather - very soft.  There is an inside flap that covers the brushes to keep them from getting frayed while the case is closed.</li>
            <li> The package arrived within a few days, I was surprised with the great case it came in, brushes are very soft, and haven&#x27;t shed so far. That is my biggest pet peeve, when you are doing your makeup and the stupid brush sheds black hairs all over your face...but these brushes have passed the test. Love that I finally have all the brushes I need to do great makeup. For the price this is an excellent deal.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush set. When I got the brushes it was ok until I started to apply my makeup with one of the brushes and the brush head fail off. I wasn&#x27;t heavy handed or rough with the brushes but the brush head just fell off.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price. They brushes seem to have GREAT quality. especially if you clean them on a regular basis. I was so excited to get such a large crush set for 10 dollars. Great deal. Only problem I have had is some of the brushes come apart from the metal point. Superglue fixed it fine for me. Good quality, poorly made. Bought 3 of theses for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the quality of the brushes.  They are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;deal\\&quot; isn&#x27;t really a deal at all. When these initially arrived, I was happy to have such a variety of brushes for such a great cost. Variety, YES, durability, NO! These fell completely apart within weeks. I&#x27;m not heavy-handed, nor do I apply makeup daily. So very disappointed.</li>
