            <li>I always get wonderful feedback from all women except my ex, but she is my ex, so she doesn&#x27;t count.</li>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>Romance is very pleasant blend of floral, ginger, and woodsy notes with a powdery finish.  </li>
            <li>Romance is a great cologne, one you can always count on.</li>
            <li>and best of all my husband really liked it as well</li>
            <li>I loved the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I received it in a timely manner and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>smells good.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this fragrance</li>
            <li>It smelled nice.</li>
            <li>Ralph Lauren designs unique and great smelling fragrances.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite winter/evening scents.</li>
            <li>That was ok.</li>
            <li>need I say anything more?  </li>
            <li>What can I say - I am comfortable in my own skin..</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, Romance still ranks in my Top 10.  </li>
            <li>This product is discontinued in stores so its a miracle we were able to get it here.</li>
            <li>Romance is definitely a clean fresh showered fragrance that is pleasant and easy on the nose.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it available since I found out that it is going be discontinued.</li>
            <li>While some people would suggest Romance is a spring or summer fragrance, I would pitch that Romance offers great flexibility/versatility that allows it be worn any time of year and for any occasion.</li>
            <li>We are thrilled to receive this perfume quickly, and it is the original, not a knockoff.</li>
            <li>Came very quick.</li>
            <li>I have romance I have used for women and this clean and sexy scent</li>
            <li>As such, I will just say that I like the smell, my wife likes the smell, and many women I have walked by compliment me on my nice smell :).    </li>
            <li>I bought this product online because it wasn&#x27;t available in retail outlets any longer.</li>
            <li>You folks will have to trust me - the fragrance is pleasant and will be liked by your significant other.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;He recommends t highly and says ladies love it !  </li>
            <li>If the price/value were better, I would score higher.  </li>
            <li>Romance is a fantastic fragrance that gives the clean fresh showered feeling all day.  </li>
            <li>I get compliments all the time from people and mainly from the females :)</li>
            <li>We love this cologne so far!</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite Eau De Toilette.  </li>
            <li>- I love those clear bottles -</li>
            <li>Maybe thats why it was discontunued the product gets old and looses its strenght.will not order again ,paid top dollars for product</li>
            <li>It may the only one of my favorite frags that I have not received compliments.  </li>
            <li>bottle and packaging is first class</li>
            <li>is a real keeper!</li>
            <li>You do not have to use much to get full effect, so the cost is not as high as it seems on first glance.</li>
            <li>The product came in quick and in brand new packaging.</li>
            <li>This perfume is no longer available in our local store.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>The price is too high.</li>
            <li>more tha retail cause  was not available anymore...</li>
            <li>Product is old,scent doesnt last very long.after an hour it feels like you never wore anything..</li>
            <li>This is such a tried and true scent that I&#x27;ll probably never go to anything else for very long.</li>
            <li>And, when compared with a bottle bought at a local department store, the fragrance was clearly much weaker, as if the testers were diluted versions of the standard product.  </li>
            <li>I did love romance when it first came out women were going crazy over it....</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend because apparently they don&#x27;t sale it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>The projection and sillage is above average, especially early on, with decent longevity - it will last all day on clothing and about six (6) hours on the skin.  </li>
            <li>First of all, the bottle was an opened tester (labeled tester, did not have the black lid).  </li>
            <li>Strangely enough, I have not received any compliments - the Wow Factor - wearing Romance, but I think it has potential.  </li>

            <li> This is one of my favorite winter/evening scents. I always get wonderful feedback from all women except my ex, but she is my ex, so she doesn&#x27;t count. Get it!</li>
            <li> This perfume is no longer available in our local store.  We are thrilled to receive this perfume quickly, and it is the original, not a knockoff.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite Eau De Toilette.  You do not have to use much to get full effect, so the cost is not as high as it seems on first glance.</li>
            <li> This review is to let you know that I Havent recieved this item. And The Reason That I Havent Called Or Contaced You Is Because I Didn&#x27;t Print Out The Confirmation Number. And I Dont Have The Phone Number. If You Guys Wanna Call Me This Is My Number To Let You Guys Now, So Please Call Me.  (909)936-3808</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend because apparently they don&#x27;t sale it in stores anymore. The bottle was way bigger than I expected. It smelled nice. Came very quick. Didn&#x27;t come in a box tho. That was ok. Just wanted to cologne anyway. Great buy!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:15938381]]My friend tells why he likes Romance by Ralph Lauren.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He recommends t highly and says ladies love it !  So girls take note, you might want to buy this for your man or the man whose  heart  you wish to capture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found it available since I found out that it is going be discontinued. I have been using mens romance for years and I&#x27;m  disappointed its going to be discontinued.</li>
            <li> I loved the fragrance.  I received it in a timely manner and in good condition.  I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> What we got was very disappointing.  First of all, the bottle was an opened tester (labeled tester, did not have the black lid).  And, when compared with a bottle bought at a local department store, the fragrance was clearly much weaker, as if the testers were diluted versions of the standard product.  My father was seriously disappointed in what he received.</li>
            <li> I bought this product online because it wasn&#x27;t available in retail outlets any longer. The price is too high. Service was as advertised.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time from people and mainly from the females :)</li>
            <li> My wife loves to breath me in when I wear this... need I say anything more?  This is such a tried and true scent that I&#x27;ll probably never go to anything else for very long.</li>
            <li> Ralph Lauren designs unique and great smelling fragrances.  Romance is no exception to that rule.  Romance is very pleasant blend of floral, ginger, and woodsy notes with a powdery finish.  Romance is definitely a clean fresh showered fragrance that is pleasant and easy on the nose.  The projection and sillage is above average, especially early on, with decent longevity - it will last all day on clothing and about six (6) hours on the skin.  Not too shabby..!!  Strangely enough, I have not received any compliments - the Wow Factor - wearing Romance, but I think it has potential.  It may the only one of my favorite frags that I have not received compliments.  You folks will have to trust me - the fragrance is pleasant and will be liked by your significant other.  Sweetie gives Romance a thumbs up..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle and packaging is first class - I love those clear bottles - this is nothing short of expectation from Ralph Lauren.  While some people would suggest Romance is a spring or summer fragrance, I would pitch that Romance offers great flexibility/versatility that allows it be worn any time of year and for any occasion. What can I say - I am comfortable in my own skin..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue of concern is the price value.  There is speculation that Romance has been discontinued, driving up the price.  Currently, the Amazon rate is $75.00.  I can&#x27;t recommend at that rate, but if you can pick it up for $50.00, I definitely recommend adding to your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final scoring for Romance is 4.5 stars out of 5. Romance is a fantastic fragrance that gives the clean fresh showered feeling all day.  If the price/value were better, I would score higher.  Nonetheless, Romance still ranks in my Top 10.  You can change the world - make a contribution...</li>
            <li> smells good. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is discontinued in stores so its a miracle we were able to get it here. The product came in quick and in brand new packaging.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive what was requested. I order romance for men. (As a gift) I searched for \\&quot;romance for men by Ralph Loren\\&quot;. The picture of what I searched is what was sent and the description matched, but the picture is romance for women. I didn&#x27;t know there was a romance for women. So now I have a bottle of perfume that I don&#x27;t want and don&#x27;t have the shipping box to send it back. Very disappointed in my experience.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this fragrance anything by ralph lauren is a winner for me. and best of all my husband really liked it as well</li>
            <li> Product is old,scent doesnt last very long.after an hour it feels like you never wore anything..Maybe thats why it was discontunued the product gets old and looses its strenght.will not order again ,paid top dollars for product more tha retail cause  was not available anymore...Will go back to my chrome for men..I did love romance when it first came out women were going crazy over it....</li>
            <li> We love this cologne so far! I have romance I have used for women and this clean and sexy scent is a real keeper!</li>
