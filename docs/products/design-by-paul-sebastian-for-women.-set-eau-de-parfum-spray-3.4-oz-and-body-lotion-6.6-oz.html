            <li>i know is that i fell in love with it...</li>
            <li>i think it&#x27;s sexy...</li>
            <li>I would have thought that PS would have put out a better fragrance for the woman</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>

            <li>love this perfume</li>

            <li>LOVE  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I took a chance by ordering it online.  </li>
            <li>I have been purchasing Paul Sebastian Design since 1992, always at reputable department stores.  </li>
            <li>Love this....</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent</li>
            <li>lovely scent that lasts.</li>
            <li>the more you pay the better----but</li>
            <li>the fragrance is nice and clean.</li>
            <li>First, the lotion does not smell like Design; in fact, it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything good.</li>
            <li>A favorite of my wife and the purchase was easy and on time.</li>
            <li>So I thought that this would be a great gift for someone for Christmas; I got it for just $21 dollars and thought wow</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>This was such a good deal!</li>
            <li>/&gt;She was way more excited about getting Paul Sebastin&#x27;s Design.  </li>
            <li>ðŸ’Ÿ Would recommend to anyone who wants to smell great but also wants a sophisticated scent, not a teanager scent. .</li>
            <li>It has a crappy cheap smell to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, I don&#x27;t know much about this product for myself as it was nicely packaged</li>
            <li>This smells like a cheap copy of the original fragrance.</li>
            <li>The spray from the newer bottle, which is bigger and supposedly a good deal, lasts about 3 hours.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much and when I discovered that Amazon sold it</li>
            <li>it was in box, smelled good and properly described.</li>
            <li>that being said, I bought it for my husband&#x27;s former wife and she was absolutely delighted with this gift.  </li>
            <li>Of course I ordered it right away and was excited about rec&#x27;ing it.</li>
            <li>hello ladies is that telling you something... the price is right, and the smell is clean and fresh...</li>
            <li>They had it right.  </li>
            <li>I would totally recommend this perfum, it  has such a beautiful scent, you should try it.</li>
            <li>I was excited until I sprayed my wrist from my own bottle of Design which I purchased from Macy&#x27;s and then sprayed my other wrist with this \\&quot;Design\\&quot; that came from Amazon - for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean smell and doesn&#x27;t cause headaches like other flowery types.</li>
            <li>Design perfume I received from Amazon is the same as the original scent, however, it&#x27;s NOT as strong &amp; doesn&#x27;t s  </li>
            <li>I thank Amazon so very much for their prompt service.</li>
            <li>including the fast shipping!</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>this product was exactly as specified.</li>
            <li>i used it today for the first time and within 3hrs i got six compliments... and 4 were from guys...</li>
            <li>It arrived exactly as was promised and on time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s her favorite cologne (the only one she uses) and she has used it for years.</li>
            <li>First time trying the body cream and loves the texture.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing Design online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have been dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh by the way it is the real deal not a tester.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my cleaning lady and she really loves it too.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper when purchased together like this.</li>
            <li>And, yes, this is the real thing---NOT a knockoff like another reviewer said.</li>
            <li>nice fragrance, long lasting</li>
            <li>paid more for smaller bottle at dept store last year .</li>
            <li>I buy for my mom on her birthday and other special days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as if the maker watered down the parfum for the sake of offering a bigger, better deal.</li>
            <li>Design Perfume smells like the same scent , but it is absolutely not the strong scent  of years ago...</li>
            <li>In contrast, I have another, smaller, bottle of Design from over ten years ago; when I use the older bottle, the fragrance lasts about 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Began wearing it at 45 years old I believe and at age 66, still wearing the same brand!  </li>

            <li> Began wearing it at 45 years old I believe and at age 66, still wearing the same brand!  </li>
            <li> The fragrance cream smelled like plastic with a little old scent.</li>
            <li> I put the old bottle on one day and, as usual I could still smell the scent in my bedroom 8 hrs later.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like harsh smells, but if your not sure buy the tiny bottle first and then work your way up if you like it...</li>
            <li> I still will purchase Design perfume, I think Coty decreased the chemical ingredients for economical reasons...</li>
            <li> the creme smells a bit like it may be old not sure,</li>
            <li> if only I could have found this deal when I was looking for it in the sears a few months ago...</li>
            <li> This is NOT real Paul Sebastian Design</li>
            <li> have spent hundreds of dollars with Amazon.</li>
            <li> day like the almost empty bottle I purchased from Macy&#x27;s 2 yrs ago...</li>
            <li> perfume is not good, scent doesn&#x27;t last and clearly the color of perfume is lighter than my previous Design.</li>
            <li> the past year I tried different scents like Flowerbomb $90 delivered, and Guess Gold $160 delivered thinking</li>
            <li> Says she has been wearing it for years and won&#x27;t wear anything other perfume!  </li>
            <li> Even though the price was less than the department store it wasn&#x27;t a bargain because I won&#x27;t be wearing it.</li>
            <li> It was here in just 4 days and cost less, even with shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless some Amazon representative fixes this problem, I will never order from Amazon again nor will I hesitate to tell everyone I know about this mess.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have money to waste.</li>
            <li> I should have paid attention to the other negative ratings.</li>
            <li> anyway, this was a gift to myself  as I did have a small parfum bottle of it that I adored.</li>
            <li> The spray bottle was very difficult to open.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to find locally.  </li>
            <li> But this is not a good deal, and I would not recommend buying the set.</li>
            <li> As for the parfum, I find the fragrance weak.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I have used Design for the past 30 years, but I hate going to the chain stores in the mall just for my cologne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so angry and disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed by the products of this fragrance set which I purchased in spring 2010.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very frustrated that I can&#x27;t get all  </li>

            <li> I just have to say this was excellent!</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for almost 29 years and have always loved it.  The lotion keeps my hands moist and the fragrance lingers for awhile, I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments!</li>
            <li> I have worn this scent for many yrs now and i absolutely love it. So I thought that this would be a great gift for someone for Christmas; I got it for just $21 dollars and thought wow if only I could have found this deal when I was looking for it in the sears a few months ago...lol!!! Oh by the way it is the real deal not a tester.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by the products of this fragrance set which I purchased in spring 2010. First, the lotion does not smell like Design; in fact, it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything good. I&#x27;m going to put it in the charity bin with the hopes that someone somewhere will like its \\&quot;scent.\\&quot; As for the parfum, I find the fragrance weak. In contrast, I have another, smaller, bottle of Design from over ten years ago; when I use the older bottle, the fragrance lasts about 8 hours. The spray from the newer bottle, which is bigger and supposedly a good deal, lasts about 3 hours. It&#x27;s as if the maker watered down the parfum for the sake of offering a bigger, better deal. But this is not a good deal, and I would not recommend buying the set.</li>
            <li> Love the scent! Bought it as a gift.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much and when I discovered that Amazon sold it I was thrilled. Of course I ordered it right away and was excited about rec&#x27;ing it. Well to my surprise it arrived in just a couple days and was not damaged at all. I thank Amazon so very much for their prompt service. I would recommend using Amazon to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have been using this scent for years and I LOVE it.  Also this set is a great value and comes with the lotion.</li>
            <li> this is grandma&#x27;s favorite perfume so I had to get this for her for christmas. she loved everything about it! including the fast shipping! thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and cream, great deal!  I would totally recommend this perfum, it  has such a beautiful scent, you should try it.</li>
            <li> this product was exactly as specified. the perfume and the box were in excellent condition. Very happy with my purchase. thank you.</li>
            <li> this set is great.. i used it today for the first time and within 3hrs i got six compliments... and 4 were from guys... hello ladies is that telling you something... the price is right, and the smell is clean and fresh... i don&#x27;t like harsh smells, but if your not sure buy the tiny bottle first and then work your way up if you like it...&lt;br /&gt;all i know is that i fell in love with it... now it&#x27;s up to you weather you think you&#x27;ll like it or not... i think it&#x27;s sexy...</li>
            <li> STINNKY... Gave it away.  I would have thought that PS would have put out a better fragrance for the woman but nope... I was wrong.  No fault to the seller though.  It arrived exactly as was promised and on time.</li>
            <li> I wear this perfume every day. I really love it. It&#x27;s so light and refreshing. I bought this for my cleaning lady and she really loves it too.</li>
            <li> Design has been my choice of fragrance since its debut in the 80&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m very frustrated that I can&#x27;t get all  the items I like,</li>
            <li> it was in box, smelled good and properly described. I would buy this product again for future presents. thank you</li>
            <li> This smells like a cheap copy of the original fragrance. The spray bottle was very difficult to open. I had to use pliers to remove the top. The fragrance cream smelled like plastic with a little old scent. I should have paid attention to the other negative ratings. They had it right.  Even though the price was less than the department store it wasn&#x27;t a bargain because I won&#x27;t be wearing it. Its going to Good Will on the off chance that someone else might not mind it.</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my aunt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s her favorite cologne (the only one she uses) and she has used it for years. It has a subtle fragrance.  First time trying the body cream and loves the texture.  Always gets compliments on it.</li>
            <li> A favorite of my wife and the purchase was easy and on time.</li>
            <li> loved the size and the set. paid more for smaller bottle at dept store last year . love this perfume</li>
            <li> Love this item and great transaction</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the size of the cologne very nice large size, the body creme is nice and silky also. the creme smells a bit like it may be old not sure, maybe just the way it smells but nice anyway, this was a gift to myself  as I did have a small parfum bottle of it that I adored.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this fragrance but got it for my mom.  She has used it for years and was very happy with the gift set.  The fragrance was certainly authentic.</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> This lotion and perfume is wonderful.Everyone likes it.It has a nice clean smell and doesn&#x27;t cause headaches like other flowery types.Men and Women always stop and ask what I&#x27;m wearing.Great price at amazon, I use to pay 60 for it.</li>
            <li> &#x27;&#x27;  I&#x27;VE BEEN WEARING &#x27;&#x27; DESIGN &#x27;&#x27; BY PAUL SEBASTIAN, SINCE &#x27;&#x27;  1987-  IT&#x27;S  A  KEEPER , TRY IT , YOU&#x27;LL SENSE , WHAT I&#x27;M SAYING&#x27;&#x27;  YOU&#x27;LL  LOVE  IT &#x27;&#x27; .</li>
            <li> Much cheaper when purchased together like this. I buy for my mom on her birthday and other special days. It does smell nice on her and she gets complimented often. Began wearing it at 45 years old I believe and at age 66, still wearing the same brand!  This is her scent and everyone knows it! ðŸ’Ÿ Would recommend to anyone who wants to smell great but also wants a sophisticated scent, not a teanager scent. .</li>
            <li> I have used Design for the past 30 years, but I hate going to the chain stores in the mall just for my cologne. I am so glad I took a chance by ordering it online.  It was here in just 4 days and cost less, even with shipping.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing Paul Sebastian Design since 1992, always at reputable department stores.  This was my first time purchasing Design online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just minutes ago I received this package from Amazon. I was excited until I sprayed my wrist from my own bottle of Design which I purchased from Macy&#x27;s and then sprayed my other wrist with this \\&quot;Design\\&quot; that came from Amazon - for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Amazon stuff must be a copycat product.  It has a crappy cheap smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so angry and disappointed.  This is NOT real Paul Sebastian Design parfum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;returns\\&quot; page says this product cannot be returned and Amazon does not provide any way that I can find to get satisfaction. I can&#x27;t even find an Amazon \\&quot;complaints\\&quot; area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent hundreds of dollars with Amazon. This is the first time that I have been dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless some Amazon representative fixes this problem, I will never order from Amazon again nor will I hesitate to tell everyone I know about this mess. I don&#x27;t have money to waste.</li>
            <li> Love this....I use the eau De Parfum Spray and layer it with the body lotion.  I&#x27;ve used it this way for several years.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> It was great to be able to get the Design lotion.  It&#x27;s almost impossible to find locally.  The quality of the perfume and lotion is just as good as always.  This is my favorite scent and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years.</li>
            <li> lovely scent that lasts. Always get compliments</li>
            <li> nice fragrance, long lasting</li>
            <li> this was ordered for a family member, they were very happy with the quality of the product.  packaging was perfect for a gift.</li>
            <li> Design perfume I received from Amazon is the same as the original scent, however, it&#x27;s NOT as strong &amp; doesn&#x27;t s  day like the almost empty bottle I purchased from Macy&#x27;s 2 yrs ago...I put the old bottle on one day and, as usual I could still smell the scent in my bedroom 8 hrs later.,the next day I sprayed the Amazon Design on, and 4-5hrs later Perfume scent smell  was NOT in my bedroom..Design Perfume smells like the same scent , but it is absolutely not the strong scent  of years ago...I still will purchase Design perfume, I think Coty decreased the chemical ingredients for economical reasons...</li>
            <li> Well, I don&#x27;t know much about this product for myself as it was nicely packaged and I didn&#x27;t want to take it apart to open it--that being said, I bought it for my husband&#x27;s former wife and she was absolutely delighted with this gift.  Says she has been wearing it for years and won&#x27;t wear anything other perfume!  So, the gift was a hit!</li>
            <li> This was such a good deal! I only paid $24 delivered for this perfume and lotion combo, and my wife was delighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past year I tried different scents like Flowerbomb $90 delivered, and Guess Gold $160 delivered thinking the more you pay the better----but never again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was way more excited about getting Paul Sebastin&#x27;s Design.  And, yes, this is the real thing---NOT a knockoff like another reviewer said.</li>
            <li> The set was a replacement.  I&#x27;ve used Design for years.  Also, I liked the price.</li>
            <li> Buyers beware...perfume is not good, scent doesn&#x27;t last and clearly the color of perfume is lighter than my previous Design.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is nice and clean. when i get dressed up i put this on. i get compliment all the time</li>
