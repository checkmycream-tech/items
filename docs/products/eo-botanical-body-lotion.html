            <li>I have loved all EO lotion products</li>
            <li>I have all of the EO scents (they are all good).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You know a product is good when it&#x27;s being called out/noticed mid-labor.</li>
            <li>The smell is really good and does not bother me at all.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My daughter is in LOVE with this lotion!</li>
            <li>Love the scent too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always turned away from flowery, sweet almost stinky scented lotions but this is the most wonderful stuff I&#x27;ve smelled in MANY years!  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s an amazing all over(smell</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, having said that, the skin conditioning properties of this lotion are amazing.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing.  </li>
            <li>An honest review:  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if someday it just came in Mint.</li>
            <li>It soaks in nicely, without leaving a coating that sits atop your skin like some lotions.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice all-purpose, all-season lotion.</li>
            <li>and it was nice and moisturizing without being overly scented.</li>
            <li>They were very unique and I loved their fragrance combinations.</li>
            <li>It has a light and pleasant scent and does not feel greasy or waxy on the hands.  </li>
            <li>and I find myself loving it the most.  </li>
            <li>I feel that the scent could easily be called uni-sex!</li>
            <li>He was very happy with the fact that it left no \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feeling and he also liked the scent.</li>
            <li>Another great quality is that It&#x27;s rich, goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>scent is fairly light and very refreshing.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t break my face out and is great for the whole body!</li>
            <li>The issue I have with the scent is that Grapefruit and Mint are nice together, Mint and Jojoba are nice together, but Grapefruit and Jojoba are 2 bold (but not overpowering) scents that compete for attention.  </li>
            <li>The grapefruit and mint smell is probably my favorite out of all the EO scents.</li>
            <li>, they use Jojoba oil, one of the best of all time to moisturize, and essential oils for scent - NO PERFUMES or synthetic fragrances!</li>
            <li>I LOVE knowing I&#x27;m not putting chemicals into my body (via my skin)</li>
            <li>I use the grapefruit and mint shower gel, which is my favorite, so I decided to try the lotion.</li>
            <li>The grapefruit/mint combo is refreshing</li>
            <li>This is in my top 5 EO products.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the scent - it</li>
            <li>I love the grapefruit and mint combination.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>The grapefruit mint is also my favorite EO scent.</li>
            <li>Many lotions leave your skin sticky after application, but not EO.  </li>
            <li>Its better than most lotions that I&#x27;ve tried that are on the pricey side.  </li>
            <li>The combination of Grapefruit &amp; Mint is so refreshing, I&#x27;ll never tire of it.</li>
            <li>It used to look elegant and now it looks like it was designed by an intern using an iPhone.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite body lotion of all time.  </li>
            <li>EO Body Lotion, Grapefruit &amp; Mint, 8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]]this scent is my favorite..</li>
            <li>LOVE it</li>
            <li>Smells gentle and calming and feels ever so smooth!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, clean, and bright.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad these come in a 3 pack to make them more versatile, and I love the pump for easy dispersing.</li>
            <li>This has a mild, pleasant, clean scent.  </li>
            <li>This is so perfect for the dry winter hands.  </li>
            <li>I love things that smell really refreshing and light and the Grapefruit and Mint Body Lotion</li>
            <li>Love all the scents--they are light and not overbearing.  </li>
            <li>They absorb quickly and have such wonderful smells.</li>
            <li>The jojoba scent is strong, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The grapefruit aroma is very prominent and I can also detect a hint of mint in the scent.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs very well into the skin, leaving it feeling hydrated and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>but this one smells the most mild for me</li>
            <li>The consistency of the lotion is smooth and silky when applied.  </li>
            <li>is really light in scent and texture.</li>
            <li>Great product from a regular customer.</li>
            <li>However, the smell is fantastic, it is very clean and distinct but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>My new favorite lotion!</li>
            <li>EO&#x27;s lotions are all rich but never greasy.</li>
            <li>It is a rich lotion without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>Smells fresh, skin stays moisturized all day!</li>
            <li>It smells great, more like grapefruit than mint, but the smell isn&#x27;t harsh or lingering.  </li>
            <li>The grapefruit scent is identical to a fresh grapefruit skin that you squeeze in your hand and a light mist bursts out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all good stuff, and organic - not only that</li>
            <li>Nice soft scent.</li>
            <li>but today i bought one for my mom and now she&#x27;s hooked wants me to buy more for her..</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on smooth and is absorbed quickly into your skin.  </li>
            <li>The lotion does, as promised on the bottle, absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion and highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>It was midwinter and, for the first time in my 30-plus years, I had silky smooth legs in December.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was searching for a good vegan lotion for my face that was somewhat sensitive, lightly scented, and mostly natural ingredients (and cruelty-free, of course).</li>
            <li>The scent is more grapefruit than mint which I like since citrus is very natural and invigorating.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about my lotion and EO lotions are by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>So, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you don&#x27;t like the smell of mints, otherwise the lotion works great and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy afterwards.</li>
            <li>the scents weren&#x27;t too exciting.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Whole Foods and some of the higher end organic stores carry a portion of the line, but never the full range.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this, long term!</li>
            <li>Every time I use it feel it honestly is feeding my skin, and doing so with a light, refreshing, subtle scent.  </li>
            <li>It was just right for what I had been looking for.  </li>
            <li>I first tried it at a hotel and loved it so much I went to Whole Foods to get the big bottle.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is outstanding and does not overwhelm your senses (like other lotions seem to always be way too strong).</li>
            <li>In this dry Californian weather, keeps me nice and moist.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin very soft and smooth for hours.</li>
            <li>I first experienced these products at back-to-back luxury hotels in different parts of the country several years ago.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, smells light and fresh, it absorbs quickly so no greasy feeling on your hands.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, and the smell is not perfume-y at all, but fresh and lively.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life from body lotion.</li>
            <li>I love essential oils, but I would not want someone to sugar coat a review that I would rely on, so I would never do that either.  </li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin, and this is one lotion that does nothing but condition and smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>I first came across the EO brand of products at an organic store.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>and I love that EO uses essential oils without making your skin feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>I just received my first order of EO Body Lotion, Grapefruit &amp; Mint.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, or just want to maintain a healthy appearance, this is the right lotion for you.  </li>
            <li>Because I am sensitive to many lotions I was leery but pleasantly surprised when it caused no itching or rash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so rich and moisturizes like no other lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>He is very particular about how a lotion feels and how it smells.</li>
            <li>is such a strong scent.</li>
            <li>Now I am using this as my everyday lotion and love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s minty but not too minty and it moisturizes my hands really well.</li>
            <li>and that my skin is so much healthier for it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell much mint, but</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This particular lotion went on very easily, absorbed quickly, and left my skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert, and really go through a lot of moisturizer trying to keep my skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and helped tremendously with my dry skin issue, which a lot of the standard moisturizing body lotions didn&#x27;t help at all.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!  </li>
            <li>The lotion is non-greasy and asborbs quickly making your hands feel soft and hydrated instantly.  </li>
            <li>True oils of plants are used, which goes a long way towards providing natural scents, and truly skin-friendly products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally spent a winter with smooth, soft hands.</li>
            <li>I am so willing to spend a tiny bit extra for something that actually helps my hands stay chap free in the winter time.  </li>
            <li>My skin stays moisturized and clear!</li>
            <li>For the longest time I&#x27;ve been trying different lotions from the common brands such as Aveeno, Eucerin, and Vaseline, but was never quite happy with them.  </li>
            <li>have used this lotion for several days now and really like it!</li>
            <li>I love that all of their products use organic ingredients, are free of sulfates, parabens, artificial colors and scents, and are not tested animals.</li>
            <li>You can definitely smell the citrus of grapefruit and the mint really stands out in this one since mint</li>
            <li>The blue bottles make me very</li>
            <li>I use it all over after I shower and it leaves my skin soft and silky without being sticky.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Bought this because of its natural origins and I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and does not leave a film on your clothes and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right now I have one on my computer desk, one in the bathroom and the other in my vehicle.  </li>
            <li>I want it to sink in quickly and not leave an oily coating, but I also want it to be substantial enough that my skin isn&#x27;t itchy and dry a couple of hours later.  </li>
            <li>It makes them soft and is very soothing for hot, tired, achey feet.</li>
            <li>I was concerned at first about the \\&quot;mint\\&quot;, afraid it would be too strong</li>
            <li>Essential Oil products are generally a higher-quality product.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The grapefruit scent is identical to a fresh grapefruit skin that you squeeze in your hand and a light mist bursts out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all good stuff, and organic - not only that</li>
            <li> Nice soft scent.</li>
            <li> but today i bought one for my mom and now she&#x27;s hooked wants me to buy more for her..</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on smooth and is absorbed quickly into your skin.  </li>
            <li> The lotion does, as promised on the bottle, absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion and highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> It was midwinter and, for the first time in my 30-plus years, I had silky smooth legs in December.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was searching for a good vegan lotion for my face that was somewhat sensitive, lightly scented, and mostly natural ingredients (and cruelty-free, of course).</li>
            <li> The scent is more grapefruit than mint which I like since citrus is very natural and invigorating.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about my lotion and EO lotions are by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> So, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you don&#x27;t like the smell of mints, otherwise the lotion works great and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy afterwards.</li>
            <li> the scents weren&#x27;t too exciting.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Whole Foods and some of the higher end organic stores carry a portion of the line, but never the full range.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this, long term!</li>
            <li> Every time I use it feel it honestly is feeding my skin, and doing so with a light, refreshing, subtle scent.  </li>
            <li> It was just right for what I had been looking for.  </li>
            <li> I first tried it at a hotel and loved it so much I went to Whole Foods to get the big bottle.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is outstanding and does not overwhelm your senses (like other lotions seem to always be way too strong).</li>
            <li> In this dry Californian weather, keeps me nice and moist.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin very soft and smooth for hours.</li>
            <li> I first experienced these products at back-to-back luxury hotels in different parts of the country several years ago.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, smells light and fresh, it absorbs quickly so no greasy feeling on your hands.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, and the smell is not perfume-y at all, but fresh and lively.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life from body lotion.</li>
            <li> I love essential oils, but I would not want someone to sugar coat a review that I would rely on, so I would never do that either.  </li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin, and this is one lotion that does nothing but condition and smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> I first came across the EO brand of products at an organic store.  </li>
            <li> Makes skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> and I love that EO uses essential oils without making your skin feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> I just received my first order of EO Body Lotion, Grapefruit &amp; Mint.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, or just want to maintain a healthy appearance, this is the right lotion for you.  </li>
            <li> Because I am sensitive to many lotions I was leery but pleasantly surprised when it caused no itching or rash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so rich and moisturizes like no other lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> He is very particular about how a lotion feels and how it smells.</li>
            <li> is such a strong scent.</li>
            <li> Now I am using this as my everyday lotion and love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s minty but not too minty and it moisturizes my hands really well.</li>
            <li> and that my skin is so much healthier for it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell much mint, but</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This particular lotion went on very easily, absorbed quickly, and left my skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert, and really go through a lot of moisturizer trying to keep my skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and helped tremendously with my dry skin issue, which a lot of the standard moisturizing body lotions didn&#x27;t help at all.  </li>
            <li> WOW!!  </li>
            <li> The lotion is non-greasy and asborbs quickly making your hands feel soft and hydrated instantly.  </li>
            <li> True oils of plants are used, which goes a long way towards providing natural scents, and truly skin-friendly products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally spent a winter with smooth, soft hands.</li>
            <li> I am so willing to spend a tiny bit extra for something that actually helps my hands stay chap free in the winter time.  </li>
            <li> My skin stays moisturized and clear!</li>
            <li> For the longest time I&#x27;ve been trying different lotions from the common brands such as Aveeno, Eucerin, and Vaseline, but was never quite happy with them.  </li>
            <li> have used this lotion for several days now and really like it!</li>
            <li> I love that all of their products use organic ingredients, are free of sulfates, parabens, artificial colors and scents, and are not tested animals.</li>
            <li> You can definitely smell the citrus of grapefruit and the mint really stands out in this one since mint</li>
            <li> The blue bottles make me very</li>
            <li> I use it all over after I shower and it leaves my skin soft and silky without being sticky.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Bought this because of its natural origins and I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy and does not leave a film on your clothes and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right now I have one on my computer desk, one in the bathroom and the other in my vehicle.  </li>
            <li> I want it to sink in quickly and not leave an oily coating, but I also want it to be substantial enough that my skin isn&#x27;t itchy and dry a couple of hours later.  </li>
            <li> It makes them soft and is very soothing for hot, tired, achey feet.</li>
            <li> I was concerned at first about the \\&quot;mint\\&quot;, afraid it would be too strong</li>
            <li> Essential Oil products are generally a higher-quality product.  </li>
            <li> The scent is fresh but subtle.</li>
            <li> it is subtle and smells like a fresh grapefruit.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes you need dry fingertips for friction (i.e. to do things such as type on a computer).  </li>
            <li> I hate to be near people who reek of cologne &amp; heavy scents, but this brand carries wonderfully, pleasant smells &amp; scents.  </li>
            <li> A little bit also goes a long way, and I&#x27;ll definitely continue to order this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll order other fragrances of EO in the future.  </li>
            <li> It will take away any dry spots on elbows, feet, hands.</li>
            <li> Dry skin is no longer dry with just one application.  </li>
            <li> This lotion has worked wonders on my dry skin this winter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dry skin and coat my body with lotion immediately after every shower.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how the combination would turn out, I was actually pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> However, I wish it was a little richer because I feel like the hydration is temporary making it necessary to reapply often.  </li>
            <li> My hands do feel softer then with other lotions.</li>
            <li> The combination strikes me as a little odd.  </li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I was hoping that the peppermint oil would give my skin a little tingle.  </li>
            <li> Hate the new label design, but inside, it&#x27;s still the same great-smelling and feeling product.</li>
            <li> Lotion is thick and creamy without being greasy and the smell is \\&quot;just enough\\&quot; without overpowering throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Subtle mint and citrus/grapefruit..... who would have thought.</li>
            <li> thick, creamy (not oily, which we hate).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It made my skin so itchy and then I had a rush... For the first time in my life from body lotion.</li>
            <li> EO products are one of my favorites and that isn&#x27;t going to change. Anyhow, I always keep this lotion on hand. It will take away any dry spots on elbows, feet, hands. Also, it&#x27;s an amazing all over(smell good) moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The grapefruit and mint smell is probably my favorite out of all the EO scents. It&#x27;s minty but not too minty and it moisturizes my hands really well. I first tried it at a hotel and loved it so much I went to Whole Foods to get the big bottle.</li>
            <li> An honest review:  I love essential oils, but I would not want someone to sugar coat a review that I would rely on, so I would never do that either.  Essential Oil products are generally a higher-quality product.  True oils of plants are used, which goes a long way towards providing natural scents, and truly skin-friendly products.  Grapefruit &amp; Mint Body Lotion is a Jojoba oil-based lotion.  The grapefruit scent is identical to a fresh grapefruit skin that you squeeze in your hand and a light mist bursts out.  The mint scent is understated.  The jojoba scent is strong, but not overpowering.  The issue I have with the scent is that Grapefruit and Mint are nice together, Mint and Jojoba are nice together, but Grapefruit and Jojoba are 2 bold (but not overpowering) scents that compete for attention.  The combination strikes me as a little odd.  HOWEVER, having said that, the skin conditioning properties of this lotion are amazing.  The lotion does, as promised on the bottle, absorb quickly.  Dry skin is no longer dry with just one application.  I do recommend towel-drying fingertips after application. It is not greasy, but the conditioning properties of the lotion take away the dryness of the fingertips as well.  Sometimes you need dry fingertips for friction (i.e. to do things such as type on a computer).  Lotion you get at the grocery store, you have to keep applying, it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb properly, etc.  Not this lotion.  If you have dry skin, or just want to maintain a healthy appearance, this is the right lotion for you.  I also have sensitive skin, and this is one lotion that does nothing but condition and smooth skin.  It is truly a wonderful product.  It would be nice if someday it just came in Mint.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I&#x27;ve been trying different lotions from the common brands such as Aveeno, Eucerin, and Vaseline, but was never quite happy with them.  They were either too waxy feeling or the scents weren&#x27;t too exciting.  I first came across the EO brand of products at an organic store.  I decided to try one of their travel size lavender body lotions.  Since them I have been hooked and have expanded my purchases to their soaps and hair products.  After wanting a change from the lavender scent, I decided to give the grapefruit and mint body lotion a chance.  Not sure how the combination would turn out, I was actually pleasantly surprised.  The scent is more grapefruit than mint which I like since citrus is very natural and invigorating.  The consistency of the lotion is smooth and silky when applied.  Now I am using this as my everyday lotion and love it!</li>
            <li> What a truly amazing lotion!  I&#x27;m an ingredient reader and purchase according to what I&#x27;m putting on my skin knowing all those ingredients are elements my body absorbs and has to deal with.  Finally a product with ingredients I know and trust.  It&#x27;s all good stuff, and organic - not only that, they use Jojoba oil, one of the best of all time to moisturize, and essential oils for scent - NO PERFUMES or synthetic fragrances! I LOVE knowing I&#x27;m not putting chemicals into my body (via my skin) and that my skin is so much healthier for it.  Every time I use it feel it honestly is feeding my skin, and doing so with a light, refreshing, subtle scent.  Another great quality is that It&#x27;s rich, goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I&#x27;ve finally spent a winter with smooth, soft hands.</li>
            <li> I use the grapefruit and mint shower gel, which is my favorite, so I decided to try the lotion. EO&#x27;s lotions are all rich but never greasy. They absorb quickly and have such wonderful smells. I don&#x27;t smell much mint, but it you like grapefruit scent, you will love this!  I use it in the morning to help me wake up.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, wonderful fresh smell and and nourishing feel....wish it was a bit thicker in consistency...but that is my preference. Makes skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I was concerned at first about the \\&quot;mint\\&quot;, afraid it would be too strong but it is not.  This has a mild, pleasant, clean scent.  I put it on my feet at night.  It makes them soft and is very soothing for hot, tired, achey feet.</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift and loved it! I love things that smell really refreshing and light and the Grapefruit and Mint Body Lotion is really light in scent and texture. You can definitely smell the citrus of grapefruit and the mint really stands out in this one since mint is such a strong scent. So, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you don&#x27;t like the smell of mints, otherwise the lotion works great and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy afterwards.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001ET72U2 EO Body Lotion, Grapefruit &amp; Mint, 8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this lotion for several days now and really like it! This is one of several products I have purchased from the EO line. I love that all of their products use organic ingredients, are free of sulfates, parabens, artificial colors and scents, and are not tested animals. This particular lotion went on very easily, absorbed quickly, and left my skin soft and silky. I did not feel the need to reapply for several hours.  The scent is fresh but subtle. You smell both the citrus and the mint but it is not overpowering. The biggest test was how my husband would like it. He is very particular about how a lotion feels and how it smells. He was very happy with the fact that it left no \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feeling and he also liked the scent. I feel that the scent could easily be called uni-sex!</li>
            <li> I first experienced these products at back-to-back luxury hotels in different parts of the country several years ago. They were very unique and I loved their fragrance combinations. This is one of my favorites. It takes me back to the state of being in a luxury hotel. The blue bottles make me very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whole Foods and some of the higher end organic stores carry a portion of the line, but never the full range. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The lotion is non-greasy and asborbs quickly making your hands feel soft and hydrated instantly.  However, I wish it was a little richer because I feel like the hydration is temporary making it necessary to reapply often.  However, the smell is fantastic, it is very clean and distinct but not overpowering. I would give this product 4 1/2 stars.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, I have been using it for years.  Not greasy or oily like some with just enough fragrance.</li>
            <li> Bought this with the lotion and both are great.  I was introduced to the product while staying at a spa.  It was just right for what I had been looking for.  Nice soft scent.</li>
            <li> This lotion has worked wonders on my dry skin this winter.  The grapefruit/mint combo is refreshing and I love that EO uses essential oils without making your skin feel greasy.  This is in my top 5 EO products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always turned away from flowery, sweet almost stinky scented lotions but this is the most wonderful stuff I&#x27;ve smelled in MANY years!  I hate to be near people who reek of cologne &amp; heavy scents, but this brand carries wonderfully, pleasant smells &amp; scents.  The texture is creamy &amp; not greasy.</li>
            <li> It is a rich lotion without being greasy.  It soaks in nicely, without leaving a coating that sits atop your skin like some lotions.  I LOVE the scent - it it is subtle and smells like a fresh grapefruit.  These days, I often avoid citrus products because the fragrance is cloying and overpowering.  This is not.  You will not smell like a giant grapefruit after you apply it.  Like another reviewer, I was hoping that the peppermint oil would give my skin a little tingle.  This is a nice all-purpose, all-season lotion.</li>
            <li> I like to coordinate my lotions/scents with the seasons and the Grapefruit Mint Lotion is a wonderful light citrusy scent for Spring and Summer. I use it all over after I shower and it leaves my skin soft and silky without being sticky. I&#x27;m very picky about my lotion and EO lotions are by far my favorite! Love the Lavendar for Fall/Winter too!</li>
            <li> I love the grapefruit and mint combination.  In this dry Californian weather, keeps me nice and moist.</li>
            <li> I just received my first order of EO Body Lotion, Grapefruit &amp; Mint. WOW!!  I will definitely be ordering again!  Smells gentle and calming and feels ever so smooth!!!</li>
            <li> This is so perfect for the dry winter hands.  It has a light and pleasant scent and does not feel greasy or waxy on the hands.  I am so willing to spend a tiny bit extra for something that actually helps my hands stay chap free in the winter time.  I have loved all EO lotion products but this one smells the most mild for me and I find myself loving it the most.  Subtle mint and citrus/grapefruit..... who would have thought.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It absorbs quickly, and the smell is not perfume-y at all, but fresh and lively. I keep it both at my desk at work and at home.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this. I have sensitive skin and this is one lotion that I never get a rash from - not even after shaving. The grapefruit mint is also my favorite EO scent. It&#x27;s light, clean, and bright.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  Great scent.</li>
            <li> This lotion is unlike any I have used before.  I live in the desert, and really go through a lot of moisturizer trying to keep my skin hydrated.  This lotion goes on smooth and is absorbed quickly into your skin.  Many lotions leave your skin sticky after application, but not EO.  Love all the scents--they are light and not overbearing.  Great product from a regular customer.</li>
            <li> Bought this because of its natural origins and I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very thick, creamy (not oily, which we hate). The fragrance is outstanding and does not overwhelm your senses (like other lotions seem to always be way too strong). It leaves your skin very soft and smooth for hours.</li>
            <li> I purchased this when there was a temporary discount price here on amazon, and can&#x27;t believe the quality of this lotion. Its better than most lotions that I&#x27;ve tried that are on the pricey side.  Not greasy but moisturizing! The scent is very delightful and not too overpowering. I plan to use this lotion for the upcoming fall/winter.  Right now I have one on my computer desk, one in the bathroom and the other in my vehicle.  I&#x27;m so glad these come in a 3 pack to make them more versatile, and I love the pump for easy dispersing.</li>
            <li> Hate the new label design, but inside, it&#x27;s still the same great-smelling and feeling product. The combination of Grapefruit &amp; Mint is so refreshing, I&#x27;ll never tire of it. But EO, can you improve the label please? It used to look elegant and now it looks like it was designed by an intern using an iPhone.</li>
            <li> I found this at Sleeping Lady Resort in Washington state and was hooked. It goes on beautifully and smells nice but not overpowering. Because I am sensitive to many lotions I was leery but pleasantly surprised when it caused no itching or rash.</li>
            <li> Baby skin-Smells Great</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent, soaks in quickly, very good lotion!  I&#x27;ll order other fragrances of EO in the future.  My new favorite lotion!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body lotion of all time.  I have all of the EO scents (they are all good).  Lotion is thick and creamy without being greasy and the smell is \\&quot;just enough\\&quot; without overpowering throughout the day.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;How are your legs so smooth,&amp;#34; asked my sister as she held one of my gams while I was in labor. It was midwinter and, for the first time in my 30-plus years, I had silky smooth legs in December.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why? Because of this lotion. It&#x27;s so rich and moisturizes like no other lotion I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s not heavy and does not leave a film on your clothes and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know a product is good when it&#x27;s being called out/noticed mid-labor.</li>
            <li> Love it! Very smooth! Not greasy at all. Soaks right in and has a wonderful smell. Fragrances are a migraine trigger for me so I was leary of this purchase.  The smell is really good and does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing.  It goes on smoothly and helped tremendously with my dry skin issue, which a lot of the standard moisturizing body lotions didn&#x27;t help at all.  It smells great, more like grapefruit than mint, but the smell isn&#x27;t harsh or lingering.  A little bit also goes a long way, and I&#x27;ll definitely continue to order this product in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, smells light and fresh, it absorbs quickly so no greasy feeling on your hands. My hands do feel softer then with other lotions.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001ET72U2 EO Body Lotion, Grapefruit &amp; Mint, 8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]]this scent is my favorite.. its just perfect.. it feels soothing when applied.. I have been using this lotion for a while but today i bought one for my mom and now she&#x27;s hooked wants me to buy more for her.. LOVE it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dry skin and coat my body with lotion immediately after every shower.  I&#x27;ve gotten quite picky about the lotion I use, though.  I want it to sink in quickly and not leave an oily coating, but I also want it to be substantial enough that my skin isn&#x27;t itchy and dry a couple of hours later.  I also won&#x27;t buy products that have been tested on animals or contain animal by-products.  There are some very good products that don&#x27;t, so what&#x27;s the benefit?  Anyway, this lotion fits the bill on all counts.  I use it over my entire body, including my face, immediately after showering, as well as on my hands after washing them throughout the day.  My skin stays moisturized and clear!</li>
            <li> This is my go to lotion for the spring/summer. Smells fresh, skin stays moisturized all day!</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for a friend who had it on her wish list. She likes this brand and she let me try some at the time and it was nice and moisturizing without being overly scented. I would try it myself.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels good.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion out there. I will continue to order it due to the natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> I was searching for a good vegan lotion for my face that was somewhat sensitive, lightly scented, and mostly natural ingredients (and cruelty-free, of course). This lotion hit the nail on the head.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is fairly light and very refreshing. The grapefruit aroma is very prominent and I can also detect a hint of mint in the scent.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs very well into the skin, leaving it feeling hydrated and not greasy at all. I love this lotion and highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t break my face out and is great for the whole body! Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> My daughter is in LOVE with this lotion!</li>
            <li> Beautiful lotion; wonderful consistency. Love the scent too! Very pleased with this, long term!</li>
