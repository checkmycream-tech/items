            <li>Packaging is nice; but it did not suit my needs</li>
            <li>Very nice, smooth colors.</li>
            <li>I still use it, just not as impressive as it was new outta</li>
            <li>This product comes with helpful stencils and very easy instructions.</li>
            <li>The stencils I though were great but the powder was just not cutting it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the eyebrow guide, but the products are incredible and really make a difference.</li>
            <li>All of the products are nicely labeled, and there are great instructions under the lid for new users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, but the stencils are huge!  </li>
            <li>Will not be without this:)</li>
            <li>i really only get it because it has the PERFECT color for blondes but</li>
            <li>Amazon needs to stop making me write more than I want -_-</li>
            <li>I am in love with it.</li>
            <li>my favorite eyebrow kit ever.</li>
            <li>I love the kit</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am getting so many compliments using this eyebrow kit...</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with the stensils</li>
            <li>this kit is going to last me well over 6 months and my brows look perfect!</li>
            <li>I know its bad...ish happens) and the next morning my brows were still PERFECT!!!!</li>
            <li>do love this set though, and would repurchase....</li>
            <li>I love the look of the box.</li>
            <li>I like the step by step instructions that are printed on the inside of the top.</li>
            <li>I love this product .Its</li>
            <li>One of the stencils is similar to my shape &amp; it works perfect.</li>
            <li>Plus the product it comes with is fantastic quality (as always with T.F.), I loove the eyebrow wax to set the shape!</li>
            <li>Love this eyebrow kit, I use it every day.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The tweezers are not that great, but I wans&#x27;t really expecting them to be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50, and like many people my age, my eyebrows are getting thinner.</li>
            <li>The powder isn&#x27;t much better.</li>
            <li>The kit opens with a strong magnetized top and , there are two trays that hold all the tools you&#x27;ll need to create your brow.</li>
            <li>Really great kit, I highly recommend for anyone with light hair or even sparse or overplucked eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use!</li>
            <li>other than that this kit is perfect</li>
            <li>It comes with easy to follow instructions, and templates to help in the shaping eyebrows to compliment your face</li>
            <li>I always buy my daughter something from Too Faced for one of her Christmas presents and this was a HUGE hit.  </li>
            <li>Colors match great, and I actually have shape to my eyebrows</li>
            <li>Fortunately for me the stencil I received it the shape I want for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Great product with three different colors included.</li>
            <li>When I use this on light make up days</li>
            <li>So after using this amazing product my brows are more sharp and defined and I&#x27;ve never felt better about them!</li>
            <li>so opening and closing the lid is super easy and convenient.</li>
            <li>The actual products are amazing!</li>
            <li>The pencil is great as long as you can keep a point on it...</li>
            <li>I was so excited while reading the description of this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this kit, but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>i love it so much</li>
            <li>The only thing they&#x27;re good for is getting the itty bitty brushes out of their slots.</li>
            <li>hopefully that won&#x27;t be the case with this item as I love it so much and would have no idea what to replace it with.</li>
            <li>The Too Faced Cosmetic Kit is a great little kit to have to do quick touch ups and is so easy to carry around with you.</li>
            <li>Im a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>I look ten years younger with my awesome eyebrows.</li>
            <li>all the other stuff in the kit is very nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and is of very high quality.</li>
            <li>my eyebrows are VERY light and this color is kind of an odd color</li>
            <li>Everything was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>While the highlighter is an awesome product, the rest of it is not remarkable at all.</li>
            <li>Beautiful mod pink color!  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>The tools are also useful.</li>
            <li>This kit is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair and a very light skin tone, and my eyebrows are very light.</li>
            <li>Ok so I got this product because of all the great reviews but when I got to try it at home the powder wasn&#x27;t dark enough for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I have been struggling with the right color to fill in my eyebrows with.</li>
            <li>but that certainly cheered me up!  </li>
            <li>I have very light blonde hair and my eyebrows have always been almost transparent.</li>
            <li>Overall I look way more polished than before using the kit.</li>
            <li>The product comes with two tones for your brows - one slightly higher, a highlighter for under the brow and wax to seal it.</li>
            <li>I only used the stencils a couple of times, but I love the shades.</li>
            <li>First time trying brand</li>
            <li>First sharpener didn&#x27;t work, second sharpener I used was better</li>
            <li>/&gt;The box is charmingly designed, cute and pink with a retro feel, and the fun little drawer in front holds your stencils and the eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li>Nice kit for a beginner at creating neat and sharp brow lines.</li>
            <li>the eyebrow pencil and tweezers feel a little cheap as well--but the whole package comes together in such a charmingly designed and useful way that I still give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>My only complain is that the little pencil that comes with it tends to get thick with constant use so it wont pass through the stencil, but you either have to get a good sharpener for it, or you can just use one of those mechanical makeup pencils and those will fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>The pink is perfect for highlighting and both color options allow you to go light or dark with simple blending with the provided applicator brush.</li>
            <li>pretty much identical shades of brown.</li>
            <li>everything was in perfect condition minus a small smudge on my wax.</li>
            <li>What you would definitely expect easy and fast delivery</li>
            <li>A huge difference in my appearance made my eyes look so much brighter and younger..</li>
            <li>and I really like that it includes a brow highlighter.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much my brows had thinned until I used this..</li>
            <li>The eye lighter is matte and smooths on very well.</li>
            <li>&amp; it not staying on very well.</li>
            <li>The eyebrow stencils are very helpful as well.</li>
            <li>I expected more than one stencil.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really finish the arches with it-</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are crazy, but now I have wonderful brows.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Two Face.</li>
            <li>I really like the kit.  </li>
            <li>Works really well on me.</li>
            <li>Really brightens your eyes and creamy blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has brow stencils that REALLY speed up the process.</li>
            <li>The stencils can be tricky, you&#x27;re better off following your natural eyebrow shape.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li>so, Im not big on giving reviews, but this is worth it!</li>
            <li>Love the product but it did not come in the black case as pictured.</li>
            <li>It was decent but.</li>
            <li>I have started getting thinner eyebrows as I get older.</li>
            <li>I have to say this is a very professional and convenient product for girls (like me!)</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend the Too Faced Cosmetics Brow Envy Kit.</li>
            <li>I need to grow my eyebrows out a little more</li>
            <li>but even so, I really like this product so far.</li>
            <li>A mirror would be nice to complete the kit, but not sure where it would go.</li>
            <li>The highlight is amazing and subtle.</li>
            <li>Secondly, it took me about 10 minutes to do them, and the colors worked perfectly with my skin tone especially since a little goes such a long way.</li>
            <li>The color is way too dark for anyone with light colored hair; the pencil doesn&#x27;t look natural -</li>
            <li>I like it a lot better than other products I&#x27;ve used and it stays on a long time.</li>
            <li>Great kit with little complaint.</li>
            <li>Overall I highly recommend this product, especially for first time brow doers</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t waste your time on cheap ones ...</li>
            <li>But I saw a display in a mall that I frequent</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the tweezers are not that good.</li>
            <li>I will say that the stencils probably won&#x27;t work unless you have the exact right eyebrow size for them, and they are hard to keep in place while working with them.</li>
            <li>I just wish the look was more of a brown tone than dark, almost black.</li>
            <li>I will just use the blonde color and it looks really natural.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s something that my other kit didn&#x27;t really</li>
            <li>the powder just wouldn&#x27;t cover those spots no matter how much i applied (I am a brunette with black eyebrows).</li>
            <li>I was a little unsure about spending so much on brow make up, but it works like a charm</li>

            <li> this kit is going to last me well over 6 months and my brows look perfect!</li>
            <li> I know its bad...ish happens) and the next morning my brows were still PERFECT!!!!</li>
            <li> do love this set though, and would repurchase....</li>
            <li> I love the look of the box.</li>
            <li> I like the step by step instructions that are printed on the inside of the top.</li>
            <li> I love this product .Its</li>
            <li> One of the stencils is similar to my shape &amp; it works perfect.</li>
            <li> Plus the product it comes with is fantastic quality (as always with T.F.), I loove the eyebrow wax to set the shape!</li>
            <li> Love this eyebrow kit, I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are not that great, but I wans&#x27;t really expecting them to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50, and like many people my age, my eyebrows are getting thinner.</li>
            <li> The powder isn&#x27;t much better.</li>
            <li> The kit opens with a strong magnetized top and , there are two trays that hold all the tools you&#x27;ll need to create your brow.</li>
            <li> Really great kit, I highly recommend for anyone with light hair or even sparse or overplucked eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use!</li>
            <li> other than that this kit is perfect</li>
            <li> It comes with easy to follow instructions, and templates to help in the shaping eyebrows to compliment your face</li>
            <li> I always buy my daughter something from Too Faced for one of her Christmas presents and this was a HUGE hit.  </li>
            <li> Colors match great, and I actually have shape to my eyebrows</li>
            <li> Fortunately for me the stencil I received it the shape I want for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Great product with three different colors included.</li>
            <li> When I use this on light make up days</li>
            <li> So after using this amazing product my brows are more sharp and defined and I&#x27;ve never felt better about them!</li>
            <li> so opening and closing the lid is super easy and convenient.</li>
            <li> The actual products are amazing!</li>
            <li> The pencil is great as long as you can keep a point on it...</li>
            <li> I was so excited while reading the description of this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this kit, but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> i love it so much</li>
            <li> The only thing they&#x27;re good for is getting the itty bitty brushes out of their slots.</li>
            <li> hopefully that won&#x27;t be the case with this item as I love it so much and would have no idea what to replace it with.</li>
            <li> The Too Faced Cosmetic Kit is a great little kit to have to do quick touch ups and is so easy to carry around with you.</li>
            <li> Im a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> I look ten years younger with my awesome eyebrows.</li>
            <li> all the other stuff in the kit is very nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and is of very high quality.</li>
            <li> my eyebrows are VERY light and this color is kind of an odd color</li>
            <li> Everything was fast and easy.</li>
            <li> While the highlighter is an awesome product, the rest of it is not remarkable at all.</li>
            <li> Beautiful mod pink color!  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> The tools are also useful.</li>
            <li> This kit is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and a very light skin tone, and my eyebrows are very light.</li>
            <li> Ok so I got this product because of all the great reviews but when I got to try it at home the powder wasn&#x27;t dark enough for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have been struggling with the right color to fill in my eyebrows with.</li>
            <li> but that certainly cheered me up!  </li>
            <li> I have very light blonde hair and my eyebrows have always been almost transparent.</li>
            <li> Overall I look way more polished than before using the kit.</li>
            <li> The product comes with two tones for your brows - one slightly higher, a highlighter for under the brow and wax to seal it.</li>
            <li> I only used the stencils a couple of times, but I love the shades.</li>
            <li> First time trying brand</li>
            <li> First sharpener didn&#x27;t work, second sharpener I used was better</li>
            <li> /&gt;The box is charmingly designed, cute and pink with a retro feel, and the fun little drawer in front holds your stencils and the eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li> Nice kit for a beginner at creating neat and sharp brow lines.</li>
            <li> the eyebrow pencil and tweezers feel a little cheap as well--but the whole package comes together in such a charmingly designed and useful way that I still give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My only complain is that the little pencil that comes with it tends to get thick with constant use so it wont pass through the stencil, but you either have to get a good sharpener for it, or you can just use one of those mechanical makeup pencils and those will fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> The pink is perfect for highlighting and both color options allow you to go light or dark with simple blending with the provided applicator brush.</li>
            <li> pretty much identical shades of brown.</li>
            <li> everything was in perfect condition minus a small smudge on my wax.</li>
            <li> What you would definitely expect easy and fast delivery</li>
            <li> A huge difference in my appearance made my eyes look so much brighter and younger..</li>
            <li> and I really like that it includes a brow highlighter.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much my brows had thinned until I used this..</li>
            <li> The eye lighter is matte and smooths on very well.</li>
            <li> &amp; it not staying on very well.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow stencils are very helpful as well.</li>
            <li> I expected more than one stencil.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really finish the arches with it-</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are crazy, but now I have wonderful brows.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Two Face.</li>
            <li> I really like the kit.  </li>
            <li> Works really well on me.</li>
            <li> Really brightens your eyes and creamy blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has brow stencils that REALLY speed up the process.</li>
            <li> The stencils can be tricky, you&#x27;re better off following your natural eyebrow shape.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li> so, Im not big on giving reviews, but this is worth it!</li>
            <li> Love the product but it did not come in the black case as pictured.</li>
            <li> It was decent but.</li>
            <li> I have started getting thinner eyebrows as I get older.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is a very professional and convenient product for girls (like me!)</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend the Too Faced Cosmetics Brow Envy Kit.</li>
            <li> I need to grow my eyebrows out a little more</li>
            <li> but even so, I really like this product so far.</li>
            <li> A mirror would be nice to complete the kit, but not sure where it would go.</li>
            <li> The highlight is amazing and subtle.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it took me about 10 minutes to do them, and the colors worked perfectly with my skin tone especially since a little goes such a long way.</li>
            <li> The color is way too dark for anyone with light colored hair; the pencil doesn&#x27;t look natural -</li>
            <li> I like it a lot better than other products I&#x27;ve used and it stays on a long time.</li>
            <li> Great kit with little complaint.</li>
            <li> Overall I highly recommend this product, especially for first time brow doers</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time on cheap ones ...</li>
            <li> But I saw a display in a mall that I frequent</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the tweezers are not that good.</li>
            <li> I will say that the stencils probably won&#x27;t work unless you have the exact right eyebrow size for them, and they are hard to keep in place while working with them.</li>
            <li> I just wish the look was more of a brown tone than dark, almost black.</li>
            <li> I will just use the blonde color and it looks really natural.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s something that my other kit didn&#x27;t really</li>
            <li> the powder just wouldn&#x27;t cover those spots no matter how much i applied (I am a brunette with black eyebrows).</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure about spending so much on brow make up, but it works like a charm</li>
            <li> You barely need to pick up any product on the brush, just a touch, and you&#x27;ll be surprised and what that little touch can do.</li>
            <li> I bought it with my own money and it&#x27;s a little expensive, but will be the only kit you will EVER need.</li>
            <li> Their return policy is long and drawn out, several follow-ups.  </li>
            <li> complaint that isn&#x27;t a big deal to me because I don&#x27;t rub my face much...</li>
            <li> the tweezers are high quality, the small brush helps blend the colors and the wax helps set everything in place.</li>
            <li> I hardly use the wax and the shadow stays on really well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the stencils that come with the kit, but other than that I usually follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> Faced Cosmetics Brow Envy Kit is expensive, but it is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> I went swimming the other day and the makeup stayed on the entire time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had problems with this one eye shadow that was really dark metallic green/ like a peacock feather colors.</li>
            <li> This product makes them look full without looking fake.</li>
            <li> and it takes so little product I see this lasting awhile.</li>
            <li> I have bad luck with makeup, as soon as I fall in love with it, it&#x27;s discontinued..</li>
            <li> the colors are a bit dark for me and since there is only one pencil (which is too dark)</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and it only takes me two minutes!</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no real need for it...</li>
            <li> expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few people ask what is different, but I&#x27;m not telling!</li>
            <li> The stencils are basically useless unless you have completely gotten rid of your natural brows.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m doing a heavy, night look ill do the brown and blonde and it looks amazing for a dramatic brow.</li>
            <li> The blonde color is a little too dark for me</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have become thin and sparse as I&#x27;ve grown older.</li>
            <li> It also has two very little brushes and a tiny tweezer.</li>
            <li> materials feel a little cheap--with a little inspection the box is obviously cardboard and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little too oily for me and never really sets...</li>
            <li> If I sharpen any further the point &amp;#34;breaks&amp;#34; off leaving a smudgey waxy substance in the pencil sharpener that&#x27;s really hard to get out.</li>
            <li> I am dark brunette</li>
            <li> The pencil is too dark.</li>
            <li> I mix them in order to get a color that&#x27;s not too dark.</li>
            <li> That is really my only complaint with this product.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Ive tried other stencils and kits and none can compare!</li>
            <li> I do not use the little drawer which keeps the stencils but every other piece is perfection...</li>
            <li> The three little plastics for shaping brows are extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> Mine was a black metal case which doesn&#x27;t come with a pencil.  </li>
            <li> I want to say that I ordered from warehouse_depot and received the kit pictured and not the newer black kit that others have</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help the color is a little dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blond and the color was a little dark for me.</li>
            <li> The brunette color is a little dark</li>
            <li> but it will smudge/smear if you mess with it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the brushes and tweezer are too small.</li>
            <li> The colors are too dark, and the pencil is made for brunettes!  </li>
            <li> The stencils are lifesavers for my uneven brows.</li>
            <li> The pencil is so small I can&#x27;t even think about sharpening it as it would be wasted.</li>
            <li> The brushes and tweezers in the kit are very small and not worth it.</li>
            <li> So in conclusion, I am returning :/</li>
            <li> Was missing my stencils &amp; I contacted them and they sent out another product !  </li>
            <li> Not sure what all the hype is about?</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> the stencils are hard to hold on your face while you&#x27;re trying to color them in.  </li>
            <li> Not thrilled with this set.</li>
            <li> So I share the color brush with the wax and the color goes on too thick.</li>
            <li> I have thick eyebrows</li>
            <li> I am from a very small town &amp; the closest \\&quot;shopping</li>
            <li> Seriously, I believe any lady could look prettier by using this.</li>
            <li> I seriously looked like Groucho Marx when I was done.</li>
            <li> so it ends up looking a little fake.</li>
            <li> Not a good look.</li>
            <li> Slick packaging, lousy product.</li>
            <li> My brows are thin on end</li>
            <li> Game changer folks.</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY!</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this is that the eyebrow tweezers do not work at all!</li>
            <li> When I tried other eyebrow pencils I was disappointed because they would either fade or smear.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this little gem!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even get me started on the brow shadow pallets, they made my eyebrows look scary.</li>
            <li> The stencils were useless for me</li>
            <li> This kit is not good for blondes!!  </li>
            <li> Very thin.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and sparse eyebrows</li>
            <li> Disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid that the colors may have been to bright/light for my complexion.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> mine did not come with a brow pencil. :(</li>
            <li> If you need an idiot proof way to pluck and get rid of unwanted eyebrows hair</li>
            <li> The brow pencil is horrible!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been searching for a convenient eyebrow kit for quite some time, and I now have found it!  Too Faced Cosmetics Brow Envy Kit is expensive, but it is worth every penny!  It comes with easy to follow instructions, and templates to help in the shaping eyebrows to compliment your face perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this again when the time comes.  I also recommend it without reservation!</li>
            <li> Super easy to use! Colors are great and I really like that it includes a brow highlighter. I hardly use the wax and the shadow stays on really well.</li>
            <li> Love the product but it did not come in the black case as pictured.</li>
            <li> The Too Faced Cosmetic Kit is a great little kit to have to do quick touch ups and is so easy to carry around with you. Also has a magnetic lid so opening and closing the lid is super easy and convenient. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this little gem!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Will not leave house without it now.. I am dark brunette just turned 40.. I didn&#x27;t realize how much my brows had thinned until I used this.. Application was a snap and mine lasted for 2 days... A huge difference in my appearance made my eyes look so much brighter and younger.. Well worth the price and it takes so little product I see this lasting awhile. Will not be without this:)</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow kit ever ....don&#x27;t waste your time on cheap ones ...pay the 30 one time you won&#x27;t regret it. ...makes your eyebrow s picture perfect</li>
            <li> Everything  in the box works well together and is packaged nicely. The eye lighter is matte and smooths on very well.</li>
            <li> Ok so I got this product because of all the great reviews but when I got to try it at home the powder wasn&#x27;t dark enough for my eyebrows. The stencils I though were great but the powder was just not cutting it. I have some spots where my hair doesn&#x27;t grow and the powder just wouldn&#x27;t cover those spots no matter how much i applied (I am a brunette with black eyebrows). So in conclusion, I am returning :/</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have been struggling with the right color to fill in my eyebrows with. I am from a very small town &amp; the closest \\&quot;shopping store\\&quot; is Wal-Mart. They do offer eyebrow stencils, eyebrow wax, and colors, but my biggest problem was the color matching &amp; it not staying on very well. I&#x27;ve been using this Two~Faced eyebrow kit for a week now and I am in LOVE! Both colors work perfect for me &amp; I love the highlighter it comes with! The eyebrow stencils are very helpful as well. I need to grow my eyebrows out a little more but I do use them as a guide! I would defiantly recommend this to my 4 sisters and my friends! I will be buying it again when I run low!</li>
            <li> It came so quick and is beautiful!!</li>
            <li> This kit works well for me.  The blonde color is a little too dark for me b/c my eyebrows are VERY light and this color is kind of an odd color but I still use it and I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter.She loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Colors match great, and I actually have shape to my eyebrows</li>
            <li> I really like this kit, but don&#x27;t love it. My brows are thin on end so it ends up looking a little fake. It doesn&#x27;t help the color is a little dark. The colors are great though, I wish these were the colors of my eye brows. Overall I look way more polished than before using the kit.</li>
            <li> i love it so much i got it twice. i really only get it because it has the PERFECT color for blondes but all the other stuff in the kit is very nice</li>
            <li> The actual products are amazing! The stencils are basically useless unless you have completely gotten rid of your natural brows.</li>
            <li> Someone else mentioned this. This kit says it&#x27;s made for blondes, but it&#x27;s not. The pencil is too dark. Also, the tweezers aren&#x27;t very good. The only thing they&#x27;re good for is getting the itty bitty brushes out of their slots. I feel like I&#x27;m playing operation whenever I go to use this kit. There aren&#x27;t enough brushes provided for the color, wax and highlighter. Only one is provided. So I share the color brush with the wax and the color goes on too thick. I should have taken my friend&#x27;s advice and bought an inexpensive pack of stencils and used the pencil and powder I was used to.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and it only takes me two minutes! Saves me time and works perfect. Makes my eyebrows look amazing! The only bad thing about this is that the eyebrow tweezers do not work at all! Other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product! It&#x27;s easy to use and is of very high quality. The stencils are lifesavers for my uneven brows.</li>
            <li> Too Faced Cosmetics are awesome! I&#x27;ve only had problems with this one eye shadow that was really dark metallic green/ like a peacock feather colors. I had an allergic reaction to the dyes in the shadow. Everything else I&#x27;ve bought or used has worked beautifully though!</li>
            <li> Everything was fast and easy. I don&#x27;t come across any problems at any point. So awesome, right. Amazon needs to stop making me write more than I want -_-</li>
            <li> Was missing my stencils &amp; I contacted them and they sent out another product !  I was so upset but that certainly cheered me up!  The product is. Great too!</li>
            <li> I expected more than one stencil. Fortunately for me the stencil I received it the shape I want for my eyebrows. The product comes with two tones for your brows - one slightly higher, a highlighter for under the brow and wax to seal it. It also has two very little brushes and a tiny tweezer. All in all very good product. My only complaint is that the brushes and tweezer are too small.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> the colors are a bit dark for me and since there is only one pencil (which is too dark) I can&#x27;t really finish the arches with it- but even so, I really like this product so far.</li>
            <li> My daughter has one and showed me how to use it. I am in love with it. My eyebrows are crazy, but now I have wonderful brows. Thanks to Two Face. Got to get it for yourself.</li>
            <li> I really like the kit.  Unfortunately, the tweezers are not that good.</li>
            <li> It has everything! Perfect colors.</li>
            <li> this brow kit is amazing i love it! the colors are perfect ..powder stays all day</li>
            <li> Love it! Very happy with amazon&#x27;s super speedy delivery and the product is great.</li>
            <li> Its goes on great and stays on all day 12hours plus until I shower...I don&#x27;t use the stencil there&#x27;s no real need for it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice. I only used the stencils a couple of times, but I love the shades. The tweezers are great! If you are just starting to play with your brows, I definitely recommend this. I only rated it 4 stars because I already owned some of the products that are in this kit and never used them. The stencils can be tricky, you&#x27;re better off following your natural eyebrow shape.</li>
            <li> I just started using this and I find it incredible. I don&#x27;t really use the stencils that come with the kit, but other than that I usually follow the instructions. I like it a lot better than other products I&#x27;ve used and it stays on a long time. I went swimming the other day and the makeup stayed on the entire time.</li>
            <li> First time trying brand Too Faced. Excellent quality! I&#x27;m a blond and the color was a little dark for me. I&#x27;m not used to using stencils but these are of excellent quality not flimsy. I just wish the look was more of a brown tone than dark, almost black. So if your a brunet I would recommend this product. Not for blond&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> This product is a rip off. The pencil is so small I can&#x27;t even think about sharpening it as it would be wasted. Brushes are too short. Don&#x27;t even get me started on the brow shadow pallets, they made my eyebrows look scary. Will definitely not be reordering this product.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! My eyebrows have become thin and sparse as I&#x27;ve grown older. This product makes them look full without looking fake. Great product with three different colors included. I mix them in order to get a color that&#x27;s not too dark.</li>
            <li> This product is AH-mazing!!! If you need an idiot proof way to pluck and get rid of unwanted eyebrows hair I HIGHLY recommend the Too Faced Cosmetics Brow Envy Kit. I bought it with my own money and it&#x27;s a little expensive, but will be the only kit you will EVER need.</li>
            <li> my favorite eyebrow kit ever. i have been using it for 2yrs now. Im a loyal customer. Also i recieved this order earlier than my estimated shipping date. Totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was decent but. Not sure what all the hype is about? NYX, ELF  &amp; Wet &amp; Wild offer similar product at a FRACTION of the price. The stencils were useless for me</li>
            <li> The brushes and tweezers are very tiny, but usable. Very nice, smooth colors.</li>
            <li> Kit has been updated, not as shown.  Mine was a black metal case which doesn&#x27;t come with a pencil.  I love the kit but they should update the listing.</li>
            <li> AWESOME. What you would definitely expect easy and fast delivery everything was in perfect condition minus a small smudge on my wax. other than that this kit is perfect</li>
            <li> This kit is not good for blondes!!  The colors are too dark, and the pencil is made for brunettes!  What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products on the market. I have started getting thinner eyebrows as I get older. Works really well on me. I have brown eyebrows and this fills them in great.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have very light blonde hair and my eyebrows have always been almost transparent. This product comes with helpful stencils and very easy instructions. Really great kit, I highly recommend for anyone with light hair or even sparse or overplucked eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I am getting so many compliments using this eyebrow kit... I don&#x27;t use the eyebrow guide, but the products are incredible and really make a difference.</li>
            <li> I got a different version of this... mine did not come with a brow pencil. :(</li>
            <li> Awesome product, and was delivered on time!</li>
            <li> This is a nice starter kit for brows, and would make a good gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box is charmingly designed, cute and pink with a retro feel, and the fun little drawer in front holds your stencils and the eyebrow pencil.  All of the products are nicely labeled, and there are great instructions under the lid for new users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The materials feel a little cheap--with a little inspection the box is obviously cardboard and the eyebrow pencil and tweezers feel a little cheap as well--but the whole package comes together in such a charmingly designed and useful way that I still give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> OK! so, Im not big on giving reviews, but this is worth it! I was sceptical about purchasing this product because it seems to cater to women with fairer skin tones. I am african american with a medium skin tone and I was afraid that the colors may have been to bright/light for my complexion.  But I saw a display in a mall that I frequent and I fell in love with the stensils i the kit. I decided to purchase it and see if I could work with the colors some how.  Let me just say, I am NEVER paying to get my eyebrows done again!!!!!!!!! it came out to be about 30 bucks but if you think about it....every two weeks I pay between 10 and 15 dollars to get my eyebrows waxed or threaded which comes out to about 20-30 bucks a month....this kit is going to last me well over 6 months and my brows look perfect! Either way, I win! Secondly, it took me about 10 minutes to do them, and the colors worked perfectly with my skin tone especially since a little goes such a long way. You barely need to pick up any product on the brush, just a touch, and you&#x27;ll be surprised and what that little touch can do. My only complain is that the little pencil that comes with it tends to get thick with constant use so it wont pass through the stencil, but you either have to get a good sharpener for it, or you can just use one of those mechanical makeup pencils and those will fit perfectly. Also, clean up  is very easy and the setting wax that comes with it is AMAZING!!! I did my brows at about 8am, and didnt have to touch them up all day. Once I even fell asleep without removing my makeup(yes I know its bad...ish happens) and the next morning my brows were still PERFECT!!!! Ive been constantly getting compliments and ppl asking where I go to get my brows done.....my answer....HOME! lol lol Try it out for yourself, you wont regret it! Ive tried other stencils and kits and none can compare! SERIOUSLY!</li>
            <li> I have bad luck with makeup, as soon as I fall in love with it, it&#x27;s discontinued..hopefully that won&#x27;t be the case with this item as I love it so much and would have no idea what to replace it with. There simply is not another product on the market that competes. I do not use the little drawer which keeps the stencils but every other piece is perfection...the tweezers are high quality, the small brush helps blend the colors and the wax helps set everything in place. The pink is perfect for highlighting and both color options allow you to go light or dark with simple blending with the provided applicator brush. This is great!</li>
            <li> Great kit with little complaint. I want to say that I ordered from warehouse_depot and received the kit pictured and not the newer black kit that others have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the brunette shade and it&#x27;s a wonderful match for me, great transition from Benefits beautiful brow palette....pretty much identical shades of brown. The highlighter is also great! Really brightens your eyes and creamy blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaints lie with the pencil and wax. The pencil is great as long as you can keep a point on it...but you can&#x27;t. First sharpener didn&#x27;t work, second sharpener I used was better but I can only get a blunt point. If I sharpen any further the point &amp;#34;breaks&amp;#34; off leaving a smudgey waxy substance in the pencil sharpener that&#x27;s really hard to get out. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so creamy. I still use it, just not as impressive as it was new outta the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax is another thing.... it&#x27;s a little too oily for me and never really sets...kind of makes your brow look oily if you use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last complaint that isn&#x27;t a big deal to me because I don&#x27;t rub my face much...but it will smudge/smear if you mess with it. That&#x27;s something that my other kit didn&#x27;t really do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love this set though, and would repurchase....but I will probably be getting a brow pencil elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Nice kit for a beginner at creating neat and sharp brow lines. I love the look of the box. Beautiful mod pink color!  The kit opens with a strong magnetized top and , there are two trays that hold all the tools you&#x27;ll need to create your brow. A mirror would be nice to complete the kit, but not sure where it would go. I like the step by step instructions that are printed on the inside of the top.</li>
            <li> I love this product .Its expensive but worth it my eyebrows look great. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ever been a wiz with eyebrows but this kit is wonderful. One of the stencils is similar to my shape &amp; it works perfect. Plus the product it comes with is fantastic quality (as always with T.F.), I loove the eyebrow wax to set the shape! : D</li>
            <li> I never did my brows, but I know needed to, and this was a perfect starter kit. I have dark brown hair and a very light skin tone, and my eyebrows are very light. I like how I have options with the colors. When I use this on light make up days I will just use the blonde color and it looks really natural. If I&#x27;m doing a heavy, night look ill do the brown and blonde and it looks amazing for a dramatic brow. The highlight is amazing and subtle. The stencils are exceptional awesome. Overall I highly recommend this product, especially for first time brow doers</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved this product.</li>
            <li> Love this eyebrow kit, I use it every day. Does not smear off and it last all day. Would totally recommend.</li>
            <li> Packaging is nice; but it did not suit my needs so I wanted to return it.  Their return policy is long and drawn out, several follow-ups.  The brushes and tweezers in the kit are very small and not worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this! Ive never thought about actually worrying about how my brows looked. Very thin. So after using this amazing product my brows are more sharp and defined and I&#x27;ve never felt better about them!</li>
            <li> I love the stencils included in this kit! It creates a finish makeup look like it was made by a hollywood makeup artist! Seriously, I believe any lady could look prettier by using this. I also would like to recommend Urban Decay Naked Palette.</li>
            <li> I always buy my daughter something from Too Faced for one of her Christmas presents and this was a HUGE hit.  My daughter can&#x27;t figure out how she ever lived without it &amp; now almost 4 months later, still raves about it.</li>
            <li> Game changer folks. Has brow stencils that REALLY speed up the process. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is a very professional and convenient product for girls (like me!) who have no idea how to deal with their eye brows. The three little plastics for shaping brows are extremely helpful. Great shapes for every one. The tools are also useful. I love it! And I will recommend this product to my friends!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this kit. I have thick eyebrows so I never thought I needed to fill them in. Boy was I wrong! This product is good for beginners because it comes with instructions and all the tools you need. The tweezers are not that great, but I wans&#x27;t really expecting them to be.</li>
            <li> This kit is perfect for someone who is just beginning to play with eyebrow shaping. The brunette color is a little dark but you can mix the 2 colors together as you like to get the desired result.  I will say that the stencils probably won&#x27;t work unless you have the exact right eyebrow size for them, and they are hard to keep in place while working with them. That is really my only complaint with this product.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of my best make up purchases. I was a little unsure about spending so much on brow make up, but it works like a charm</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50, and like many people my age, my eyebrows are getting thinner. Since thicker eyebrows are again in fashion, I was hating my sparse brows. When I tried other eyebrow pencils I was disappointed because they would either fade or smear. Not a good look. This kit has been great, though. It takes just a minute or two and they last all day. I look ten years younger with my awesome eyebrows. I&#x27;ve had a few people ask what is different, but I&#x27;m not telling! This kit is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was so excited while reading the description of this product. When it arrived, I opened the box immediately and followed their instructions. While the highlighter is an awesome product, the rest of it is not remarkable at all. The color is way too dark for anyone with light colored hair; the pencil doesn&#x27;t look natural - neither do the powders. I could have purchased several inexpensive items at my drug store and achieved the same effect I got spending almost $30 for this. Slick packaging, lousy product. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and sparse eyebrows and I&#x27;m always &amp;#34;drawing&amp;#34; them on.  I saw that this had stencils and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, but the stencils are huge!  Way too big for my petite face and the stencils are hard to hold on your face while you&#x27;re trying to color them in.  I seriously looked like Groucho Marx when I was done.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with this set. The setting wax is a joke.. Does not work what so ever. The brow pencil is horrible!!! Looks like you colored your eyebrows in with a crayon. The powder isn&#x27;t much better. Disappointed to say the least. Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> These kits are great. I don&#x27;t really use the stencils but the brow wax is the best brow wax I&#x27;ve ever found and the highlighter is just perfect.</li>
