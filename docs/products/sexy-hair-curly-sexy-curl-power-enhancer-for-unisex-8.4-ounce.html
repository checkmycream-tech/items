            <li>I liked the shampoo but not as happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Good for frizzy hair.</li>

            <li>I love the Curly Sexy Hair foam!!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this for my hair!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>When I use this, no one can tell where my perm ends and my own curl begins.</li>
            <li>so I was thrilled when I found it here.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, wavy semi curly hair</li>
            <li>I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>Great product, it really enhances my curls.</li>
            <li>I spray lightly on top of my hair and in the front I spray the underside as well so that I get more face framing curls.</li>
            <li>This gives my curls more definition than the curling cr&amp;egrave;me</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommendations&#x3D; Works even better with their conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Coloring gives it more body.</li>
            <li>I applaud iou, curly sexy hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit better, but it still sprays everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I spray this on the top and scrunch it</li>
            <li>and then I have curls on top to</li>
            <li>I love this stuff-</li>
            <li>My hairdresser has not been able to get it from the manufacturer</li>
            <li>This arrived today and after using it, I loved it so much I had to write a review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, go EASY... if you use too much on fine curly hair, it will make your hair greasy within 2 hours of drying.</li>
            <li>Fine strands but</li>
            <li>I have fine and thinning hair that does whatever it want&#x27;s to.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great and using a diffuser on my dryer still, my hair isn&#x27;t frizzy and it&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li>I actually need the gel not this product I guess it would be great for those who needed it</li>
            <li>Worth the price for the amount in it!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products with varying results, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your curls crunchy but rather nice curls and natural looking.</li>
            <li>My hair was drying into these glamorous looking curls that I hadn&#x27;t seen on my head for years, I looked in the mirror and saw a mermaid looking back at me with light beams shining out of her beautiful hair and the soft sound of Beyonc&amp;eacute; singing in the background.</li>
            <li>Not bad.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite products to use on my naturally curly, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to live without it.</li>
            <li>Was happy that I could find for less money.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I have been looking for!</li>
            <li>The price is worth</li>
            <li>This product left my hair smelling great and with a soft, bouncing curl.  </li>
            <li>But spraying the foam everywhere isn&#x27;t fun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wavy, but if all the forces in the universe align just right, it will curl.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through many products and this is the only one that will make fixing my hair easy and fast.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time at a friends house and when out the next day to get my own.</li>
            <li>This product had a nice flexible hold once it was dry, but I didnt care for the way it foamed up while I was spraying my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair started to dry into these beautiful, big curls with no frizz.</li>
            <li>I have fine naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>It was just enough to hold my curls but not make them crunchy like most products.  </li>
            <li>I really like it!  </li>
            <li>For the first time, I can wear my hair in a curly style.  </li>
            <li>She uses it properly, and considerably more product.  </li>
            <li>I really like this spray mousse!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get too &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; like regular mousse, because it is sprayed around and more evenly dispersed.</li>
            <li>and I can either use a diffuser for more of a curl or spray it and scrunch for a loose wave.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much but that could be because my hair texture.</li>
            <li>I used to have really springy, curly hair.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use that much of it.</li>
            <li>Used on my daughters hair that already have some body to it and couldnt really tell much difference.  </li>
            <li>and I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and this product weighed it down.</li>
            <li>She is able to get a much fuller and looser curl than I, however, she is generally coloring my hair at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I have long heavy very wavy hair (almost zig-zaggy).This stuff softens my waves, stops frizz and smells great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok and not really worth the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>the other was fine.</li>
            <li>Oh well, it&#x27;s another hair product that will live under my bathroom sink until I toss it away.</li>
            <li>I chose 5 stars because this is the only product I have that enhances and defines my own wave without weighing it down to near straightness.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad really, because what&#x27;s in the can is great, it&#x27;s just getting the product out and onto my hair which I really don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not stiff, but enhances the curls.</li>
            <li>If there was a different application and a little more to it</li>
            <li>Works well, leaves you with soft curls.</li>
            <li>Dries soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly but towards the end.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and wavy.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is a combination of curly, straight, and wavy, in other words it does what it wants.</li>
            <li>very thick/dense just barely below shoulder length with some long layers cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I might have half a container left if I&#x27;m lucky.</li>
            <li>Instead of making nice big waves like my hair usually does I got small zig zag looking waves and my hair grew and grew and grew.</li>
            <li>The whole point of why I tried it out was because I wanted to be able to spray my hair and go - without having to &amp;#34;scrunch it&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;mold it&amp;#34; and unfortunately, its very difficult to get an even spray all over the hair with this product because after several seconds the mousse ends up foaming up around the spray nozzle preventing more product from spraying out.</li>

            <li> This gives my curls a little bit of volume without making them wild.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> but my drawbacks are how long it lasts and the application.</li>
            <li> I have very long wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time on my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you would want to use this on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly, frizz prone dry hair.  </li>
            <li> If you get this product I recommend spraying it on damp hair then blow dry it while scrunching!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty thick, therefore it&#x27;s heavy.</li>
            <li> The fist item I spent the time to write a review</li>
            <li> If I use the curling cr&amp;egrave;me when my hair is too wet, I can get some clumps like you will with gel.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed about the broken one because it was not an inexpensive item</li>
            <li> I spent almost 20$ on it</li>
            <li> You have to be careful.</li>
            <li> I used to always use Panteen for curly hair but it always left my hair stiff.</li>
            <li> This product works well to keep the frizz down on my very long and curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Another gross hair spray to weigh my hair down and make it sticky and stiff..</li>
            <li> After having two kids, however, my hair changed and is now pretty lame.</li>
            <li> Other mousses work just as well for me and are a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the damage.</li>
            <li> I feel the wet hair keeps this from being too heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it crunchy.</li>
            <li> Helps to keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it feel crunchy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I spray it into my hand and use it like a typical mousse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that could restore my hair to its previous luster.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It dried my curls up as soon as I would put it on my hair.</li>

            <li> My hair felt stiff and lost the shine.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or make it feel hard like some products.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard to use this spray, and mousse winds up getting all over the bathroom.  </li>

            <li> Works well, leaves you with soft curls. However, go EASY... if you use too much on fine curly hair, it will make your hair greasy within 2 hours of drying.</li>
            <li> I have fine naturally curly hair. I use it all the time.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down..Great product.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels good. Dries soft. Recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great product for my curly hair. I have been using for a couple of years. Was happy that I could find for less money. I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> My hair is a combination of curly, straight, and wavy, in other words it does what it wants. I have tried many different products with varying results, this product is amazing. It fights the frizz and I can either use a diffuser for more of a curl or spray it and scrunch for a loose wave. It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or make it feel hard like some products. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This gives my curls a little bit of volume without making them wild. It also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it crunchy. This is the only curl mousse I use now.</li>
            <li> It is the most amazing stuff if you want curls!!! The price is worth it becuase its the best stuff ever!!! I love how you do not need to use alot to get awesome results!!</li>
            <li> I have very long wavy hair. I bought this product in place of Redken Guts Spray Mousse. This product had a nice flexible hold once it was dry, but I didnt care for the way it foamed up while I was spraying my hair. The whole point of why I tried it out was because I wanted to be able to spray my hair and go - without having to &amp;#34;scrunch it&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;mold it&amp;#34; and unfortunately, its very difficult to get an even spray all over the hair with this product because after several seconds the mousse ends up foaming up around the spray nozzle preventing more product from spraying out.</li>
            <li> I liked the shampoo but not as happy with this product. My hair felt stiff and lost the shine. My hair is very fine and this product weighed it down.</li>
            <li> Great product, it really enhances my curls.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products to use on my naturally curly, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love it! The fist item I spent the time to write a review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Hair&#x3D; Fine strands but very thick/dense just barely below shoulder length with some long layers cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use&#x3D; After I wash my hair, I comb, towel scrunch, and then wait 10-15 minutes. The sprayer on the bottle is like hairspray rather than mousse. I spray lightly on top of my hair and in the front I spray the underside as well so that I get more face framing curls. I scrunch and I&#x27;m done. If I washed my hair the night before, I will spritz my hair with water and use their curling creme instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it compares with their curling cr&amp;egrave;me&#x3D; This gives my curls more definition than the curling cr&amp;egrave;me but this is heavier than the curling cr&amp;egrave;me. This has no scent. The curling cr&amp;egrave;me smells great. If I use the curling cr&amp;egrave;me when my hair is too wet, I can get some clumps like you will with gel. I don&#x27;t get clumps with this, just compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations&#x3D; Works even better with their conditioner. Spray before you get dressed. I managed to spray the bathroom door a bit behind me once. I don&#x27;t think you would want to use this on dry hair. I feel the wet hair keeps this from being too heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I used to always use Panteen for curly hair but it always left my hair stiff. This stuff is great and using a diffuser on my dryer still, my hair isn&#x27;t frizzy and it&#x27;s super soft. And my hair looks like a perm it&#x27;s so curly. Great stuff. Pricier than Panteen off the shelf but Amazon has it a couple dollars cheaper than Wal-Mart when they carried it.</li>
            <li> Thought it was a spray, turned out to be foam but works almost as well</li>
            <li> My wife loves the way this puts and holds the curl in her hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of wavy hair and this product could not tackle it. I sprayed it on and within an hour I knew I had made a mistake. Instead of making nice big waves like my hair usually does I got small zig zag looking waves and my hair grew and grew and grew. It was so big (and of course I forgot a hair tie) that people were staring at me during class! I seriously looked like a lion. I do not recommend this product if your hair is prone to frizziness or gets big. Also the way that it is applied is weird. It is a spray but mousse at the same time so it clumps at the sprayer.</li>
            <li> Not bad.  Good for frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> My sister raved about this item so I decided to try it.  It&#x27;s just ok and not really worth the price I paid for it. I could have gotten 2 or 3 products for the price I paid for this one that would have worked about the same as this one did.  I will use it until it&#x27;s gone but will probably not buy again.</li>
            <li> Like the product but I otdered TWO .  one arrived with a broken aerosol the other was fine. Very dissapointed about the broken one because it was not an inexpensive item</li>
            <li> Love this for my hair!</li>
            <li> I chose 5 stars because this is the only product I have that enhances and defines my own wave without weighing it down to near straightness. When I use this, no one can tell where my perm ends and my own curl begins. Perfect product!</li>
            <li> I loved this curl enhancer!  It was just enough to hold my curls but not make them crunchy like most products.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have curly, frizz prone dry hair.  This product left my hair smelling great and with a soft, bouncing curl.  I really like it!  I use it in combination with a leave-in conditioner.  No frizz, no crunch, and great curl.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 years now.  I have fine and thinning hair that does whatever it want&#x27;s to.  It&#x27;s wavy, but if all the forces in the universe align just right, it will curl.  This product definitely helps it curl.  For the first time, I can wear my hair in a curly style.  I don&#x27;t have issues with it clumping as someone mentioned.  It is a spray mousse, but I find that a pain in the neck.  I spray it into my hand and use it like a typical mousse.  I take it with me to the hair dresser, as they don&#x27;t carry this line.  She uses it properly, and considerably more product.  She is able to get a much fuller and looser curl than I, however, she is generally coloring my hair at the same time.  Coloring gives it more body.</li>
            <li> works on the best day espectacular nextr day not that great but make my curls look great so is a good investment for a party or so!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much but that could be because my hair texture.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible. It dried my curls up as soon as I would put it on my hair. It is not worth the damage.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and it&#x27;s pretty thick, therefore it&#x27;s heavy. I have gone through many products and this is the only one that will make fixing my hair easy and fast. I finallyhave curl!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this spray mousse! Makes my hair smell good and is great with gel. Helps to keep the frizz down. Worth the price for the amount in it!</li>
            <li> I actually need the gel not this product I guess it would be great for those who needed it but its not what I needed or wanted.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  I&#x27;ve used this for years.  Excellent for curly or wavy hair where you want to enhance the curl.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product for curly hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave your curls crunchy but rather nice curls and natural looking. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Yes!!! Exactly what I have been looking for! This arrived today and after using it, I loved it so much I had to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;  I used to have really springy, curly hair. After having two kids, however, my hair changed and is now pretty lame. I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that could restore my hair to its previous luster.&lt;br /&gt;  I opened the box today and sprayed this into my hair, thinking &amp;#34;oh joy.. Another gross hair spray to weigh my hair down and make it sticky and stiff..&amp;#34; I was so wrong. My hair started to dry into these beautiful, big curls with no frizz. I felt my hair and could not feel Any product AT ALL. My hair was drying into these glamorous looking curls that I hadn&#x27;t seen on my head for years, I looked in the mirror and saw a mermaid looking back at me with light beams shining out of her beautiful hair and the soft sound of Beyonc&amp;eacute; singing in the background. I applaud iou, curly sexy hair.</li>
            <li> I like the product. It works well but my drawbacks are how long it lasts and the application. I have crazy curly frizz poofy hair that&#x27;s really thick. It&#x27;s only about shoulder length and I get it thinned but I&#x27;ve used this stuff maybe four times and I don&#x27;t use that much of it. I might have half a container left if I&#x27;m lucky. I spent almost 20$ on it and it&#x27;s almost gone. Other mousses work just as well for me and are a lot cheaper. It does help with my frizz though. And it doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky. But spraying the foam everywhere isn&#x27;t fun. It&#x27;s not a precise spray so it just goes in whatever semi direction you want. You have to be careful. If there was a different application and a little more to it I wouldn&#x27;t be able to live without it.</li>
            <li> This product works well to keep the frizz down on my very long and curly hair.  The only criticism I have is that it is a spray-on mousse.  It&#x27;s hard to use this spray, and mousse winds up getting all over the bathroom.  If I spray the mousse into my hand it&#x27;s a bit better, but it still sprays everywhere.  It&#x27;s too bad really, because what&#x27;s in the can is great, it&#x27;s just getting the product out and onto my hair which I really don&#x27;t like.  Oh well, it&#x27;s another hair product that will live under my bathroom sink until I toss it away.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for something to bring out the curls this is the product to get!! My hair is naturally curly but towards the end. I spray this on the top and scrunch it and then I have curls on top to so it&#x27;s even!! If you get this product I recommend spraying it on damp hair then blow dry it while scrunching!</li>
            <li> This is my always have product for when I let my hair go curly. It&#x27;s not stiff, but enhances the curls. Great price and shipping deal</li>
            <li> I have long heavy very wavy hair (almost zig-zaggy).This stuff softens my waves, stops frizz and smells great. To apply I put it in my palms and then scrunch through my hair. It lasts a very long time on my hair. Love it, just difficult to find.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff- I spray my damp hair, scrunch it up, and have beach waves all day.  It doesn&#x27;t get too &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; like regular mousse, because it is sprayed around and more evenly dispersed.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser has not been able to get it from the manufacturer so I was thrilled when I found it here.  It leaves my hair soft and wavy.  This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Doesnt work as will as the reviews stated. Used on my daughters hair that already have some body to it and couldnt really tell much difference.  Amazon has the best price compared to Salons and Ebay.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, wavy semi curly hair and I really like this product.  It gives some hold and adds volume but isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li> I love the Curly Sexy Hair foam!! It lets me be lazy without looking like it. I used it for the first time at a friends house and when out the next day to get my own. I have pretty long hair. It&#x27;s thing but there&#x27;s A LOT of it and it definitely has some wave to it. I can put this product in my hair after a shower and I&#x27;m good to go. As it air dries it has great wave with no frizz. And it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it feel crunchy or sticky.</li>
