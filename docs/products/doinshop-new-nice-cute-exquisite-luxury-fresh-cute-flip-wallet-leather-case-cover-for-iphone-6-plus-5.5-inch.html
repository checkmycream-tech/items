            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Totally love it.</li>
            <li>Stylish and protects the phone well.</li>
            <li>it was soo cute.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m able to change covers as needed.</li>
            <li>and I love the wallet part and the credit card slides</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to remove.</li>
            <li>So easy to change out</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s cheap asf don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li>My Phone Doesn&#x27;t Really Fit</li>
            <li>I liked the case originally, but the design has faded from normal wear &amp; tear.</li>
            <li>I love my new case!</li>
            <li>it is very pretty case.</li>
            <li>It was very pretty but it my fault</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s nice it took a long time to recive it, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I liked it for the first week, but the black has already started to rub off around the case, so it looks really warn, and the inside case holder is cheap plastic and pulls away from the outer case.</li>
            <li>Pretty for party or dinner</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>I thought it had glitter or some other cute s</li>
            <li>the only thing that upsets me with this case is that the black keeps fading and comes off after like 2 days and it makes it look not pretty other than that I love my case it fits my phone perfectly</li>
            <li>I love the look of this case and it protects my phone well, but after just ONE DAY, the black dye started rubbing off the edges of the case, and now after one week, almost all the edges have the color rubbed off</li>
            <li>love these cases,  everybody always ask me where I get my phone cases from, they are priced so well that I have several different ones.  </li>
            <li>Kind of sucks</li>
            <li>Not only does this case add a hint of style it gives your iPhone extra protection while conveniently holding important cards and your drivers license.</li>
            <li>I was very upset that my case did not last a month.</li>
            <li>I live in a rural area and had to get to the post office during their hours etc...</li>
            <li>cuz I&#x27;ve been excited and anxiously waiting for my product for about a month.</li>
            <li>The back came unglued just a little at the corner but other than that I love it and can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>

            <li> cuz I&#x27;ve been excited and anxiously waiting for my product for about a month.</li>
            <li> The back came unglued just a little at the corner but other than that I love it and can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s coming off the flat back of the case, too.</li>
            <li> I realized I got the wrong size since I have an iPhone 6 NOT 6 plus, but used it as a wallet and stuck my phone in there anyway, obviously didn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li> Does not fit the iPhone 6, 6 plus maybe as it is too big.</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Carrying a heavy pocketbook is definitely and option now.</li>
            <li> Other products that&#x27;s not really leather didn&#x27;t change or lose color.</li>
            <li> It broke in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a little over 2 weeks</li>

            <li> Color faded, not happy with it at all.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Cheapy looking when you see the actual item.  Pain in the butt to actually receive it because it came registered parcel.  I live in a rural area and had to get to the post office during their hours etc...</li>

            <li> I realized I got the wrong size since I have an iPhone 6 NOT 6 plus, but used it as a wallet and stuck my phone in there anyway, obviously didn&#x27;t fit but the case was so beautiful I wanted to use it still! Lol</li>
            <li> This item is very poor quality. I have had it for two weeks and it has already lost color. It is very cheap material. Guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Eh , looked better in the picture</li>
            <li> Good phone protection but the color fades within two days.</li>
            <li> It was a beautiful case but it was for the iPhone 6 plus or something cuz it was to big for my iPhone. But it came on time</li>
            <li> Does not fit the iPhone 6, 6 plus maybe as it is too big.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered it for a six plus. But I use it as a wallet, good quality.</li>
            <li> I love it. It was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Very nice case! The back came unglued just a little at the corner but other than that I love it and can&#x27;t beat the price.  I will be ordering the mint color soon!</li>

            <li> It finally came in. Very cute and stylish ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> Color faded, not happy with it at all.  Edges turned white and lost color. Other products that&#x27;s not really leather didn&#x27;t change or lose color.</li>
            <li> It was very pretty but it my fault I Oder a plus instead of the 6</li>
            <li> I was very upset that my case did not last a month. Within 3 days I&#x27;ve already experienced the leather coming off. Kind of sucks cuz I&#x27;ve been excited and anxiously waiting for my product for about a month.</li>

            <li> Terrible I thought it had glitter or some other cute s*** but it&#x27;s cheap asf don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> My wife is loves this case. Stylish and protects the phone well. Thanks again</li>
            <li> I love my new case! If you like convenice this is the perfect accessory to compliment your iPhone. Not only does this case add a hint of style it gives your iPhone extra protection while conveniently holding important cards and your drivers license. Carrying a heavy pocketbook is definitely and option now.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law got the one in mine, so I had to get one for my phone bc it was soo cute. I liked it for the first week, but the black has already started to rub off around the case, so it looks really warn, and the inside case holder is cheap plastic and pulls away from the outer case. I&#x27;ve already bought a different brand of cell phone wallet bc of that.</li>
            <li> Received it on time and looks great!</li>
            <li> It broke in less than a week.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s nice it took a long time to recive it, but it was worth the wait. I have several so I&#x27;m able to change covers as needed.</li>
            <li> Very Cheap Looking My Phone Doesn&#x27;t Really Fit In It But I Guess You Get What You Pay For!</li>
            <li> I love the look of this case and it protects my phone well, but after just ONE DAY, the black dye started rubbing off the edges of the case, and now after one week, almost all the edges have the color rubbed off and it&#x27;s coming off the flat back of the case, too. I should have known for the price, it would not be top-quality. It&#x27;s truly disappointing.</li>
            <li> Pretty for party or dinner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a little over 2 weeks &amp; I&#x27;m not satisfied with the product. I liked the case originally, but the design has faded from normal wear &amp; tear.</li>
            <li> Love it! Wallet and iPhone case in ine</li>
            <li> Ordered for an iPhone 6 but received the 6+</li>
            <li> the only thing that upsets me with this case is that the black keeps fading and comes off after like 2 days and it makes it look not pretty other than that I love my case it fits my phone perfectly and I love the wallet part and the credit card slides</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price !</li>
