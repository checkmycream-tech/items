            <li>The bottles look good.</li>
            <li>i got it in good deal too</li>
            <li>for the price, they&#x27;re actually surprisingly good.</li>
            <li>What I really love is that they don&#x27;t spill if turned over!  </li>
            <li>I wish I had ordered more of these!</li>
            <li>The containers are kind of flimsy.  </li>
            <li>comes in handy when i&#x27;m changing polish</li>
            <li>Nice containers.</li>
            <li>Nice for travel.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice way to have nail polish remover without having to turn the bottle over ^^&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice size</li>
            <li>Kind of like sephora</li>
            <li>They are a nice size and serve the purpose well..</li>
            <li>Easy to refill!</li>
            <li>These are very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>(the bottom of where the cap twists on) as you&#x27;re pumping the remover from the top.</li>
            <li>I do like the fact that the top is a flip top that doesn&#x27;t dispense when you close it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s okay for the price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are others that will work besides these.  </li>
            <li>I love this item.  </li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>and it takes 10 to 15 pumps to get the liquid to the top</li>
            <li>it is okay for things like alcohol or acetone.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I thought but ends up to be a perfect size.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even remember how many times I have spilled...</li>
            <li>Maybe the metal lids are better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Great for young girls or teenagers.</li>
            <li>i was really hoping these would be good for polish removal</li>
            <li>It takes a good 6 pumps before you get anything out of them and during those 6 pumps it will be leaking form places it really shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Nail art is popular and items (such as these) help make the application process of clean-up more convenient and handy (at home and on the road).</li>
            <li>The pumps work fine.</li>
            <li>For me that was fine sine</li>
            <li>As soon as I got these I filled them up and gave one to her to keep in her room.</li>
            <li>Beware of cheap pumps... seller should test products before selling.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this for me too.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>Cheap but work.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap and leak around the cap if you tilt them.  </li>
            <li>I filled them with acetone</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re doing anything that requires a lot of use, they end up more in the way than useful.</li>
            <li>Product works well for helping to keep hands free during nail art projects</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t fill too full; seem to leak when filled to the brim.</li>
            <li>Good thing these were a cheap price, otherwise I&#x27;d want my money back.</li>
            <li>these things are super cheap.</li>
            <li>but after first few pumps they will work good!!!!</li>
            <li>However, for the price, it is good enough.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price</li>
            <li>lol be careful!</li>
            <li>Works great just as expected!</li>
            <li>but I would save your money and get a better one, or deal with the fact that you may have to get one thats a little &amp;#34;prettier&amp;#34; than you might want in order to get a good one.</li>
            <li>When iI put the acetone in it wouldn&#x27;t pump to the top and the bottle top wouldn&#x27;t seal properly, would not recommend these to any one!!!!  </li>
            <li>one main gripe (besides leakage) is that they don&#x27;t hold onto the product in between uses, so you have to re-prime it almost every time you want to use more.</li>
            <li>The flip top is convenient for securing, but it can be cut off if you want quick and frequent access to pump the contents.</li>
            <li>Great little pump bottles</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, don&#x27;t wait much of this.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Worth the value that you pay for it....</li>
            <li>You can see right through them</li>
            <li>/&gt;The picture isn&#x27;t exact...</li>
            <li>the first person i ordered it from never sent it)</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but they work great!  </li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love these no chance of spilling like i have spilled whole bottles and if they leak at top when first used pumping then pump fast few times and they will spill out</li>
            <li>Fortunately these were only 1.02 because that is what they are worth.</li>
            <li>these are great little bottles i can easily carry anywhere and take less effort to get alcohol out.</li>
            <li>I received a black top instead of the white top as pictured.....</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re just removing regular nail polish</li>
            <li>Hardly use them but good quality</li>
            <li>The plastic is very thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These bottles are much shorter than pictured, and THEY LEAK LEAK LEAK</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The price was really cheep</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not so much about the size</li>
            <li>Ive been using these pumps for about 3 months and they are holding up and working really well.</li>
            <li>it came fast</li>
            <li>, so make sure you empty them before you travel anywhere with them where they might get tipped over.</li>
            <li>Also, they don&#x27;t dispense as much product as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li>While I am avoiding that, I am wasting more product then ever before due to the leakage.</li>
            <li>An entire full bottle of acetone leaked out in under 2 hours and ruined a shelf.  </li>
            <li>Pay a few extra dollars and go to Mendas website and you will have a great dispenser that last forever.</li>
            <li>wish I would have ordered a few more of these.</li>
            <li>Small, cheap looking and doesnt pump - basically just something to throw away right after you got it.</li>
            <li>I asked for two new pumps and they sent me a label to return.</li>
            <li>I know its dirt cheap, but its not worth a penny.</li>
            <li>Item was what I expected and it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I filled one and it seemed as though you couldn&#x27;t move it around without it leaking a little bit.</li>
            <li>but they are clear not</li>
            <li>Tiny bottles don&#x27;t hold much.</li>
            <li>These handy pump dispensers can be used for any thin liquid that you dispense onto a cotton pad.</li>
            <li>But nail polish does come out on top when pressed, sadly in very small amounts.</li>
            <li>small and jams quickly!</li>
            <li>I am not going to spend my time sending back two non-working pumps across the world when they could just send me new pumps for my bottles.</li>
            <li>These little bottles have become my favorite little bottles.</li>
            <li>I received these early , only thing is that one of the bottles had gotten damaged and had a  giant hole in the side, but nothing duct tape cant fix!!!!! &#x27;</li>
            <li>I am usually pretty messy when I remove nail polish.  </li>

            <li> I am usually pretty messy when I remove nail polish.  </li>
            <li> The one with alcohol is fine, but all the acetone evaporated out of the other, since they are not super tight.</li>
            <li> Not work sending back because I waited so long to get these.</li>
            <li> The other one barely pumped.</li>
            <li> They come directly from china and took a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Expect a long wait for shipping.</li>
            <li> One does not work at all and the other occasionally.</li>
            <li> Recommend when shopping for this type of item to look closely at reviews and find one that will close properly along with not having other reviews states it leaks.</li>
            <li> Only received one , contacted seller like 3 months ago and no one replies nor send the other bottle!</li>
            <li> I had ordered a different bottle that leaked a little.  </li>
            <li> Item is not what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> everything as expected.</li>
            <li> Not what I had expected in polish remover holder, two were broke and one just not work.</li>
            <li> And they arrived sooner than I expected..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I placed alcohol in one, and acetone polish remover on the other.</li>
            <li> One broke, so I don&#x27;t know if it worked, but the other doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> and then those thing squirts the solution at me or other direction...</li>
            <li> They only pump a small amount of liquid per pump.  </li>
            <li> These are pretty much useless.  </li>
            <li> I do not like that there is such lax enforcement of our customs law to allow other countries to profit while the U.S. loses its edge.</li>
            <li> Only complaint.....</li>
            <li> Not worth the money to return.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everytime I use either pump (one has acetone remover and one has non-acetone), remover squirts out the bottom of the dispenser and runs down the side.  </li>
            <li> I was buying these to avoid having to turn my bottle upside down with the chance of me spilling it.  </li>
            <li> When I try to push down to get product it comes out the sides.</li>
            <li> how tight you close it</li>
            <li> These bottles are a little shorter than I imagined, but they work just fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not worth it!.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one dinky little dispenser that leaks all over the place.</li>

            <li> I put this along with my bundle monster plate holder in a bag and the item leaked acetone all over it, damaging my brand new holder :(.  </li>
            <li> Small and compact!</li>
            <li> Supper small!</li>
            <li> These are a joke, they are very small and the plastic if flimsy.</li>
            <li> They leak if tipped over, the pumping mechanism is really difficult to push down.</li>
            <li> One of the pumps was completely broken, it leaked EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> These were what I needed but one pumped was broken though won&#x27;t pump the remover out.</li>
            <li> This happens a bit on amazon and is irritating but the pump does work well</li>
            <li> Definitely not great quality.</li>

            <li> I was skeptical about these because acetone, and even non-acetone remover, will dissolve a lot of plastics.</li>
            <li> and then it will run back into the bottle hate hate</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> and it makes me mad</li>
            <li> They are so small and they leak horribly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just bad</li>
            <li> Leaks badly</li>
            <li> Bummer :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These little bottles have become my favorite little bottles.</li>
            <li> The items work, however, the bottles leak out the side of the cap (the bottom of where the cap twists on) as you&#x27;re pumping the remover from the top. Good thing these were a cheap price, otherwise I&#x27;d want my money back.</li>
            <li> I put this along with my bundle monster plate holder in a bag and the item leaked acetone all over it, damaging my brand new holder :(.  It also does not pump well. I do like the fact that the top is a flip top that doesn&#x27;t dispense when you close it.</li>
            <li> My daughter is constantly changing her nail polish and I&#x27;m always worried she will spill the bottle of nail polish remover. As soon as I got these I filled them up and gave one to her to keep in her room. She used it almost immediately and it worked perfect for her.</li>
            <li> The concept was eveything I was looking for.  These are very cheaply made.  The plastic is very thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everytime I use either pump (one has acetone remover and one has non-acetone), remover squirts out the bottom of the dispenser and runs down the side.  I was buying these to avoid having to turn my bottle upside down with the chance of me spilling it.  While I am avoiding that, I am wasting more product then ever before due to the leakage.</li>
            <li> Great little pump bottles</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought but still work.</li>
            <li> Worth the value that you pay for it.... It a little hard to pump and if stored on its side it leaks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, don&#x27;t wait much of this.&lt;br /&gt;And probably it comes in pair because it don&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s okay for the price</li>
            <li> These bottles are a little shorter than I imagined, but they work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I placed alcohol in one, and acetone polish remover on the other. The one with alcohol is fine, but all the acetone evaporated out of the other, since they are not super tight. So now I just have alcohol in both, and use them for different things.</li>
            <li> These bottles are much shorter than pictured, and THEY LEAK LEAK LEAK, cant use them, they leak constantly, poor poor poor quality, dont buy</li>
            <li> Dispenses acetone and alcohol perfectly onto cotton balls. I would remove all liquid before travelling on a plane. It&#x27;s not leak-proof.</li>
            <li> If your in a hurry don&#x27;t order these.  They come directly from china and took a few weeks. I&#x27;m sure there are others that will work besides these.  They&#x27;re plastic and I&#x27;ll have to wait and see how they fair.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Tiny bottles don&#x27;t hold much. Also leaks, and does not pump well. Item is not what I expected it to be. Would not recommend product.</li>
            <li> One of the pumps was completely broken, it leaked EVERYWHERE. wasted so much nail polish remover. The other one barely pumped. not worth it!.</li>
            <li> The containers are kind of flimsy.  However, for the price, it is good enough. I like the size if the bottles.</li>
            <li> Nail polish leaks out if tilted. But nail polish does come out on top when pressed, sadly in very small amounts.</li>
            <li> These are much smaller than I thought they would be and they both leak. When I try to push down to get product it comes out the sides. In my opinion these aren&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li> The small size of these containers allow the convenience for on the go (travel plans).  Nail art is popular and items (such as these) help make the application process of clean-up more convenient and handy (at home and on the road).</li>
            <li> works great to pump acetone onto cotton ball! the lid goes on perfectly and does not spill. comes in handy when i&#x27;m changing polish</li>
            <li> Hardly use them but good quality</li>
            <li> I guess I got what I paid for. One broke, so I don&#x27;t know if it worked, but the other doesn&#x27;t work. It won&#x27;t pump anything out. Bummer :(</li>
            <li> Pumps did not work. I asked for two new pumps and they sent me a label to return. I am not going to spend my time sending back two non-working pumps across the world when they could just send me new pumps for my bottles. Beware of cheap pumps... seller should test products before selling.</li>
            <li> I know its dirt cheap, but its not worth a penny. I waited weeks for these to arrive and when they did neither worked. They would both suck some of the acetone up into the pump but no matter what they didn&#x27;t dispense.... dissappointing. I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> This item is great.  I got them for my babies. They are now wanting play with polish.  This item keeps them from spilling polish remover.  They gave the item two thumbs up.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love this item.  I use it for makeup remover and for my toner. It&#x27;s perfect!! love it.&lt;br /&gt;Packaged and arrived prefect/</li>
            <li> Nice containers. I had to buy some locally, took a while to get. Nice for travel.</li>
            <li> Was vary leaky and small it&#x27;s just bad it waste all my nail polish romuver and it makes me mad</li>
            <li> great quality. everything as expected. just too small</li>
            <li> Fortunately these were only 1.02 because that is what they are worth. One does not work at all and the other occasionally. Not work sending back because I waited so long to get these. Chalk it up to experience.</li>
            <li> The pumps work fine. it&#x27;s a nice way to have nail polish remover without having to turn the bottle over ^^&lt;br /&gt;The picture isn&#x27;t exact... you get 2 but they are clear not white.&lt;br /&gt;now and then those thing squirts the solution at me or other direction... lol be careful!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to put these in a travel bag, they leak.</li>
            <li> Only received one , contacted seller like 3 months ago and no one replies nor send the other bottle! -.- totally no leak proof -.- small and jams quickly! WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND !</li>
            <li> Not what I had expected in polish remover holder, two were broke and one just not work. They just aren&#x27;t what I can use</li>
            <li> Small and compact! Works great just as expected! Easy to refill! If your looking for a polish container for personal use that you don&#x27;t have to constantly open the polish remover cap and worry about it drying out then this is for you!</li>
            <li> got these and it takes 10 to 15 pumps to get the liquid to the top and then it will run back into the bottle hate hate</li>
            <li> Perfect, thank you. A+++++++</li>
            <li> Great for young girls or teenagers. No more spills and messes. I enjoy this for me too.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> These are a joke, they are very small and the plastic if flimsy. The price was really cheep but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This product was horrible it didn&#x27;t even work and they are tiny!!!!!! I just wanted something that worked it&#x27;s not so much about the size but they both didn&#x27;t world. It&#x27;s cheap but I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I received these early , only thing is that one of the bottles had gotten damaged and had a  giant hole in the side, but nothing duct tape cant fix!!!!! &#x27;God Bless Y&#x27;all</li>
            <li> They serve my purpose, but they do leak if they get knocked over.</li>
            <li> Supper small! and leaks alot!  good that its a two pack. lol</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet. I haven&#x27;t even opened them because I&#x27;m considering turning them in to the Postal Inspector. They came in a package from Asia, and the customs declaration on the package states that it is a cellphone case. I can feel the bottles through the package, and they are not a cellphone case. I do not like that there is such lax enforcement of our customs law to allow other countries to profit while the U.S. loses its edge.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well at all. Save your money</li>
            <li> These were what I needed but one pumped was broken though won&#x27;t pump the remover out.</li>
            <li> The bottles look good. You can see right through them so you know what&#x27;s inside of them. nice size it is okay for things like alcohol or acetone.</li>
            <li> I had ordered a different bottle that leaked a little.  So I ordered these as a replacement.  What a disappointment.  An entire full bottle of acetone leaked out in under 2 hours and ruined a shelf.  One star is the least that I could give in a rating but even that star is not deserved.  Please save your money on this one guys.</li>
            <li> love these no chance of spilling like i have spilled whole bottles and if they leak at top when first used pumping then pump fast few times and they will spill out but after first few pumps they will work good!!!!</li>
            <li> The reason I wanted this pack of two was for different types of remover. The pump works with no problem and they hold alot at one time.</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy, because they were trial size containers. That was not in the description when I purchase them.</li>
            <li> i was really hoping these would be good for polish removal but  they leak pertty badly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: works well&lt;br /&gt;cons  Leaks badly</li>
            <li> these are great little bottles i can easily carry anywhere and take less effort to get alcohol out. i got it in good deal too</li>
            <li> Ive been using these pumps for about 3 months and they are holding up and working really well. Only complaint..... I received a black top instead of the white top as pictured..... This happens a bit on amazon and is irritating but the pump does work well</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price just wish they were leak-proof. Each hold about 2-3 oz.</li>
            <li> I bought these for nail polish remover. They leak if tipped over, the pumping mechanism is really difficult to push down. It wasn&#x27;t a ton of money, but it was a waste for my needs.</li>
            <li> Definitely not great quality. It takes a good 6 pumps before you get anything out of them and during those 6 pumps it will be leaking form places it really shouldn&#x27;t. I wanted simple, industrial pump dispensers, these were the only ones I could find but I would save your money and get a better one, or deal with the fact that you may have to get one thats a little &amp;#34;prettier&amp;#34; than you might want in order to get a good one.</li>
            <li> Love them. Work perfff</li>
            <li> Leaks if not upright, and polish remover evaporates quicker than in a standard bottle</li>
            <li> Great but leaks alot it came fast which was great so it works well for me but it does leak everywhere</li>
            <li> Only one worked like it should. Kind of like sephora I put my eye makeup remover and water in them.</li>
            <li> Cheap but work. Don&#x27;t fill too full; seem to leak when filled to the brim. Expect a long wait for shipping. For me that was fine sine I was in no hurry.</li>
            <li> One plastic container was broken in shipment. I filled one and it seemed as though you couldn&#x27;t move it around without it leaking a little bit.</li>
            <li> wish I would have ordered a few more of these. Smaller than I thought but ends up to be a perfect size.</li>
            <li> These handy pump dispensers can be used for any thin liquid that you dispense onto a cotton pad. They only pump a small amount of liquid per pump.  I am using one for astringent and another for nail polish remover. The flip top is convenient for securing, but it can be cut off if you want quick and frequent access to pump the contents.The entire item is plastic.</li>
            <li> These bottles are a perfect size but do not work well. Also have defects in the thread because there is spilled liquid</li>
            <li> 1. You get one dispenser, not 2&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t look like the picture&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s one dinky little dispenser that leaks all over the place. Horrible especially for nail polish remover. I wish I could give it 1 star</li>
            <li> I purchased these to put finger nail polish remover in for my daughter inlaw and my self for ease of use when we do our nails.  When iI put the acetone in it wouldn&#x27;t pump to the top and the bottle top wouldn&#x27;t seal properly, would not recommend these to any one!!!!  I wouldn&#x27;t even give these 1 star if I didn&#x27;t have to rate them. Don&#x27;t buy them!!!</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work the way they should.  They&#x27;re cheap and leak around the cap if you tilt them.  I do not recommend these at all.</li>
            <li> I had to reorder this product(since the first person i ordered it from never sent it) I like it for what i am using it for but it leaks some</li>
            <li> When I saw that these were plastic I was skeptical, but they work great!  What I really love is that they don&#x27;t spill if turned over!  I am usually pretty messy when I remove nail polish.  I can&#x27;t even remember how many times I have spilled...but now, No worries. Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money to return. Awful. Leaked all over, the push-down mechanism or whatever you call it doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> these things are super cheap. I filled them with acetone and it doesn&#x27;t even pump put, it just dribbles out from the sides. I do not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The bottles look a lit larger then what they are and I ordered 2 sets and they only sent me one of them but billed my credit card for both sets.</li>
            <li> Small, cheap looking and doesnt pump - basically just something to throw away right after you got it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about these because acetone, and even non-acetone remover, will dissolve a lot of plastics. But in that respect, they&#x27;ve held up beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do leak, so make sure you empty them before you travel anywhere with them where they might get tipped over. I keep them upright in my nail polish train case and they stay that way pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one main gripe (besides leakage) is that they don&#x27;t hold onto the product in between uses, so you have to re-prime it almost every time you want to use more. That&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re just removing regular nail polish but if you&#x27;re doing anything that requires a lot of use, they end up more in the way than useful. Also, they don&#x27;t dispense as much product as I&#x27;d like sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the price, they&#x27;re actually surprisingly good.</li>
            <li> Product works well for helping to keep hands free during nail art projects</li>
            <li> I bought these trying to save a few dollars. I lost my Menda brand dispenser during a move. You do get what you pay for. Pay a few extra dollars and go to Mendas website and you will have a great dispenser that last forever. I had mine 10 years before my move and it  still worked like it did the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> The lids don&#x27;t shut like they should and this causes leaking. Recommend when shopping for this type of item to look closely at reviews and find one that will close properly along with not having other reviews states it leaks. Maybe the metal lids are better</li>
            <li> I wish I had ordered more of these! They are a nice size and serve the purpose well.. And they arrived sooner than I expected.. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Item was what I expected and it arrived quickly.  Excellent for holding any liquid so you don&#x27;t need to open and close all the time</li>
            <li> These are horrible! They are so small and they leak horribly. Definitely buying different ones</li>
            <li> These are pretty much useless.  They pump, but it takes awhile to get any liquid and when it does it is not necessarily where one would expect it.  I have them and will likely use them, but I thought it would be easier for one hand use vs. tipping a bottle and that isn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend buying these for us tone because it doesn&#x27;t close well and if it tips over it&#x27;s going to spell no matter how tight you close it</li>
