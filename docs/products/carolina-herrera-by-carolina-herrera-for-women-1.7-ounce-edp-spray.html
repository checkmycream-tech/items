            <li>My favorite for over 16+ years.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I had ordered for a gift and the person liked it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The spray and walk-through technique works fine for me.</li>
            <li>Smells like some Walmart cheap scent.</li>

            <li>This is a classic floral fragrance that I have worn off and on for years.  </li>
            <li>It smells a little strong when you initially spray it on but after a few minutes, it leaves a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>I wear Carolina everyday, but love this smaller size for travel.</li>
            <li>It is long lasting and gives a unique aroma -- but you have to be careful as it tends to be overpowering if used too heavily.</li>

            <li> This is the worst smelling scent I have smelled in a long time. Smells like some Walmart cheap scent. They won&#x27;t let me return it either...one tiny spray and consider it used. Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Excellen fragrance, I love! I recommend, it was what i expected! The perfume has a good price and my friends love it too!</li>
            <li> I always try to find out what a perfum smells like before purchasing on internet, I didnt do it this time, just heard someones opinion about this one and I dont regret, its a delitious, sensual and sexy smell.</li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time based on a recommendation from a friend.  It smells a little strong when you initially spray it on but after a few minutes, it leaves a lovely scent.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I had ordered for a gift and the person liked it.&lt;br /&gt;The price was worth it.</li>

            <li> This is the best fragrance with a touch of gardenia in it.  My favorite for over 16+ years.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The ONLY perfume I get numerous compliments on.  I&#x27;ve never received a negative comment when wearing this perfume.</li>
            <li> I guess I had it wrong with this fragrance. It is very strong and heady. Reminds me of the smell at the make up counter at a dept. store.</li>
            <li> Shipping great, quality great, fragrance great! thank you</li>
            <li> Strong floral that will last the day. I wear Carolina everyday, but love this smaller size for travel. Worn it for years.</li>
            <li> the perfume was great, it arrive on time it was what i wanted it and im happy for it :)</li>
            <li> Lo compre como regalo de mi tia, y le encanto el perfume. (ella esw fanatica de la marca Carolina Herrera, segun ella todos sus productos son excelentes) asi que esta rese√±a va por ella</li>
            <li> This is a perfume that you want to use sparingly. It is long lasting and gives a unique aroma -- but you have to be careful as it tends to be overpowering if used too heavily. The spray and walk-through technique works fine for me.</li>
            <li> This fragrance definitely is a womens scent.  Very seductive, and elegant I must say. I love it.</li>
            <li> MY WIFE LOVES IT AND SO DO I.</li>
            <li> I remembered loving this on another lady I used to know so I finally bought it. It still smells great but use it sparingly. Less is definitely more with this one.</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this I receive compliments. People have stopped me to ask what I&#x27;m wearing. Love it!!! It makes me feel beautiful,  thank you Carolina!</li>
            <li> This is a long time favorite of mine.  I do hope that you will continue to carry it.</li>
