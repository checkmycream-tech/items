            <li>I love this hand cream.  </li>
            <li>Like all the Camille Beckman products it is just wonderful, especially in colder seasons.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best hand lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have paid a lot more for a jar of hand lotion, but I have never had these results.</li>
            <li>This makes a great gift, and I have converted a lot of new customers for this product.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t particularly help my hands but has a pleasant scent and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Amazon makes it easy to continue my habit.</li>
            <li>This scent is strong so it would interfere w/my day or evening perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>It is super moisturizing and I LOVE the scent.  </li>
            <li>A lovely smell and works great to help with dry hands.</li>
            <li>Love the way my hands feel after using the cream- very soft  Love the scent, too.</li>
            <li>Great cream stays in a long time</li>
            <li>I got a sample from Birtchbox &amp; loved the smell of the lotion so much that I actively tried to find the body lotion on here.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Giant jar, definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have tried literally dozens of products and this is the first one that really does keep the skin soft and moist enough to resist cracking.</li>
            <li>I love that it isn&#x27;t greasy, and I can actually see the difference in my hands when used a few times a week.</li>
            <li>But somehow I wound up with some sort of specialized hand treatment that I don&#x27;t need because I&#x27;m only 26 years old.</li>
            <li>A shame because it was keeping my hands in good condition in the cold.</li>

            <li> I have used this for years.  Amazon makes it easy to continue my habit.</li>
            <li> I have to apologize in saying this didn&#x27;t heal....it did/has!  I put on my feet every night &amp; they are getting smoother &amp; smoother.  In my case it&#x27;s somewhat of a miracle.  It does take a couple of weeks to do it&#x27;s magique so be patient.  My pedicurist remarked how well my feet looked.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived as promised &amp; I do feel price was good for the size. I don&#x27;t know about her other products or scents.  This scent is strong so it would interfere w/my day or evening perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy, better purchase.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with the skin on my fingertips.  This hasn&#x27;t cured the underlying problem but it makes it MUCH more managable.  I have tried literally dozens of products and this is the first one that really does keep the skin soft and moist enough to resist cracking.</li>

            <li> Giant jar, definitely worth the price. This will probably last me a year and I use it daily. I love the smell and it feels great on my hands.</li>
            <li> Best hand lotion ever</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream!!  It is super moisturizing and I LOVE the scent.  I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> Everything is excellent!!!</li>
            <li> Wish I got the body lotion-like I meant to. But somehow I wound up with some sort of specialized hand treatment that I don&#x27;t need because I&#x27;m only 26 years old. I got a sample from Birtchbox &amp; loved the smell of the lotion so much that I actively tried to find the body lotion on here. The smell is dope but i gave it 2 my mom bec she has dry hands &amp; said she loves the smell but the product doesn&#x27;t fully deliver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lifelong nail-biter/cuticle-picker. I bit and picked because any rough dry edges on my fingers distracted me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream helped me stop those behaviours. It healed and smoothed my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample in a recent TestTube Beauty Box. I&#x27;m definitely buying more. I&#x27;m even planning on ordering some tubes as Xmas stocking stuffers!</li>
            <li> Great product I wash my hands a lot at work and this product is amazing at keeping your hands moisturized!</li>

            <li> Love this hand cream. Absorbs wonderfully. No greasy.</li>
            <li> I gave this hand therapy cream a 5 star rating because I have finally found something that relieves my dry itchy winter skin!  I use as a body lotion and it lasts all day.  It has a very nice light clean scent and whipped texture that is not greasy.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great cream stays in a long time</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with the smell.  And the texture and moisterizing is good as well.</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream.  I have it sitting on my desk at work and use it a couple of times a day.  It is wonderful.  The scent is divine, tuscany-esque and I have received several compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Love Camille Beckman and this one smells great!</li>
            <li> Like all the Camille Beckman products it is just wonderful, especially in colder seasons.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best hand lotion I have ever used. I love that it isn&#x27;t greasy, and I can actually see the difference in my hands when used a few times a week. The scent is not overpowering either. I have paid a lot more for a jar of hand lotion, but I have never had these results. I have a smaller size tube in my purse at all times, too. This makes a great gift, and I have converted a lot of new customers for this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
