            <li>Sophisticated scent that makes me feel elegant and refined.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>My favorite fragance from the fifties when I was in Paris.</li>
            <li>Have been using this fragrance on and off for many years.  </li>
            <li>Had bought it from Overstock before and was satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Will not buy any more fragrances from Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just feel better when I am wearing it; I even wear it to bed.</li>
            <li>My mom use used this fragance many years ago and you can&#x27;t find it in my country.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is lovely and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find it at such a good price.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quick and new good product!</li>
            <li>I love Je Reviens by Worth, I&#x27;ve used this many years.  </li>
            <li>Even though this Fragrance is &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;, it brings back so many great memories for me.</li>
            <li>It is so light and floral</li>
            <li>fabulous for  fragrancing your sheets mmmmmmm</li>
            <li>I have used this lovely scent for literally fifty years and have never found another that I love as much.  </li>
            <li>My husband first bought this cologne for me at  a BX in Europe when he was in the Air Force more than 50 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I have been in love with this fragrance for 30 years - tried it for the first time in the Spring of 1984.  </li>
            <li>Brought back many nice memories of times in the 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s light and fresh -- not overpowering like some scents.</li>
            <li>I associate the smell with my mom, who I love so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the gentle, sophisticated scent I remember from years ago; however, after application, the scent fades within an hour or so.</li>
            <li>Clean fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this scent for a long time, but can&#x27;t buy it in stores here.  </li>
            <li>Good fragrance for young ladies, certainly a classic.</li>
            <li>Best of all the price here is Amazon is actually about the same price I paid the first time I bought a bottle in 1984 - and</li>
            <li>The service was fantastic -- super  fast shipping, beyond expectations.</li>
            <li>I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I have used this Eau de Toilette by Worth for years.</li>
            <li>Yes, I noticed the most favorable replies are quite old.  </li>
            <li>The price is just right for the pocketbook.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy classic florals, give this a try.  </li>
            <li>As a nurse I&#x27;m very conscious of how strong my perfume is.</li>
            <li>This product can&#x27;t be the same light, citrusy, wonderful eau de toilet that my wife used to buy several years ago.  </li>
            <li>I was introduced to this fragrance by my boyfriend many years ago and now it is the only one I wear.</li>
            <li>My dad, rest his soul, started buying it for her when they were first married.</li>
            <li>I was with my parents and we walked to the closest department store and I purchased my first  bottle.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It is as fresh and vibrant as in 1981 .&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to find it on Amazon and at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scent is subtle, but very nice.</li>
            <li>It takes awhile to use the whole 3.3 ounce spray bottle.</li>
            <li>RECEIVED THIS ITEM FAST</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powdery scent is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this scent for over 30 years and have never tired of it.  </li>
            <li>There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much &amp;#34;eau&amp;#34; in it.  </li>
            <li>Smells differently from the original scent that I remember so well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had more compliments on Je Reviens than any other perfume I&#x27;ve worn.</li>
            <li>The fragrance of the older is much lighter and fresher.</li>
            <li>This EDT is subtle and extremely pleasant, but only when someone is &#x27;very&#x27; close!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;MY HUSBAND PAID MORE THAN DOUBLE FOR A SMALLER SIZE</li>
            <li>The older</li>
            <li>I was also surprised that the price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li>I wore JeReviens by Worth several years ago</li>
            <li>I notice the printing on the new bottle is thicker than on the empty bottle of the original.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent, although in the past, I have had it without the spray.  </li>
            <li>I wore this for years in the early eighties.</li>
            <li>My 82 year old mom has worn it for about 55 years.</li>
            <li>Also, the bottle must have been quite old because on opening, the cellophane wrap pulled the paper off all over the box.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 years old</li>
            <li>This product must have been old.</li>
            <li>However, the eau de toilette gives a much more subtle presentation.  </li>
            <li>Since I do enjoy punning, it is hard to resist.  </li>
            <li>Long time favorite and hard to find.</li>
            <li>, so I am just consoling myself that I did not waste a lot of money (I bought the Eau de toilette only)</li>
            <li>we used to find it at Marshal&#x27;s for $9.99 but those days are gone thanks to all the Paris Hilton and other celebrity perfumes now sold at Marshal&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>There is enough fragrance left in the old bottle that we can still compare.</li>

            <li> was not what I expected through it away</li>
            <li> And not only did it not smell of violets, it has very little longevity and smells of nothing I can recognize.</li>
            <li> and then I was not able to find it locally..  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It smells nothing the way it should, just smells like dusty old water.  </li>
            <li> Like any perfume, you either love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> so she wrote it down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to recommend any scent to others as it smells different on each individual...</li>
            <li> It has a slightly alcohol type smell.</li>
            <li> My Sister has been using this perfume for at least 40 years, if not more, and it is the only perfume&lt;</li>
            <li> Just a waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> AND IT WAS HARD TO FIND.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> So the opportunities for making bad puns while discussing this product are frequent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately I bought also another fragrance and hate to open it.  </li>
            <li> Please pardon my poor humor.]</li>
            <li> The fragrance that does exist isn&#x27;t unpleasant but it&#x27;s so weak that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to detect.</li>
            <li> A  DISAPPOINTMENT.  </li>
            <li> My mother uses this perfume and it is impossible to find in our area.</li>
            <li> Impossible to find at retail locations.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Lovely fragrance, I smell so good.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> have worn it for years and years - happy to find it again</li>
            <li> I bought this based on a memory of a Je Reviens I had over 20 years ago. They probably reformulated it or something. And not only did it not smell of violets, it has very little longevity and smells of nothing I can recognize. But I don&#x27;t think I can blame the seller for that, so I am just consoling myself that I did not waste a lot of money (I bought the Eau de toilette only)</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances and I was so happy to find it this good price. I love this product and hope I&#x27;ll be able to purchase it again soon.</li>
            <li> I just love this scent. I have been using this for over 30 years. Scent is very pleasant and not overpowering. The price is just right for the pocketbook.It takes awhile to use the whole 3.3 ounce spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this perfume in years. I&#x27;m glad I bought it it has a great fresh spring smell.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase.  I will return to buy in the future.</li>
            <li> not as wonderful as I remember it</li>
            <li> Not flowery.  I have been using this scent for ten years and never tire of it.</li>
            <li> Made me cough. Made my boyfriend cough. Made my mother cough. Used to wear it once upon a time. Not what it used to be.</li>
            <li> Delightful fragrance ,a favorite for over twenty years.It is as fresh and vibrant as in 1981 .&lt;br /&gt;Just as music,fragrance can melt away the years to happy memories of yesteryear.</li>
            <li> I wore JeReviens by Worth several years ago and then I was not able to find it locally..  I absolutely LOVE this lovely, sensual, not-over-powering fragrance.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it again.</li>
            <li> Smells differently from the original scent that I remember so well.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, my opinion is the Je Reviens eau de toilette just received from Amazon doesn&#x27;t smell like the product my wife has used for over 60 years, since she was 18 in 1953. The fragrance of the older is much lighter and fresher. I notice the printing on the new bottle is thicker than on the empty bottle of the original. There is enough fragrance left in the old bottle that we can still compare.</li>
            <li> My mother uses this perfume and it is impossible to find in our area. Received quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Given as a gift. Brought back many nice memories of times in the 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Good fragrance for young ladies, certainly a classic. Impossible to find at retail locations. I was also surprised that the price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this scent for a long time, but can&#x27;t buy it in stores here.  I&#x27;m thankful for being able to order it on line.  I think it&#x27;s light and fresh -- not overpowering like some scents.</li>
            <li> I wore this for years in the early eighties. I recently bought it again and it does not smell the same. Why oh why do mfgs change a good thing?</li>
            <li> I love Je Reviens by Worth, I&#x27;ve used this many years.  This was no different, wonderful fragrance very good price. I will purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li> My choice for 50 years and glad I can still find it.  This EDT is subtle and extremely pleasant, but only when someone is &#x27;very&#x27; close!!</li>
            <li> Christmas present for my Mom.  She loved it!!  I loved the price.  Saved $25 per bottle over mall store prices.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this fragrance by my boyfriend many years ago and now it is the only one I wear.</li>
            <li> Got my favorite fragrance at a great price. The service was fantastic -- super  fast shipping, beyond expectations. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This was the perfect gift for my neighbor who has always rated Je Reviens as her favorite perfume. I was delighted with the scent, too, and plan to order some for myself as well. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent, although in the past, I have had it without the spray.  Somehow, I feel the spray takes something away from the scent and the smell of the product doesn&#x27;t seem to last all day.  Other than that, I love the smell.  It&#x27;s difficult to recommend any scent to others as it smells different on each individual...but mostly, I am happy..</li>
            <li> BEEN USING JE REVIENS FOR MANY YEARS.  IT&#x27;S ONE OF MY FAVORITE CHRISTMAS GIFTS.&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS ITEM FAST AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;MY HUSBAND PAID MORE THAN DOUBLE FOR A SMALLER SIZE AND IT WAS HARD TO FIND.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS AMAZON!</li>
            <li> Arrived very quick and new good product!</li>
            <li> My husband first bought this cologne for me at  a BX in Europe when he was in the Air Force more than 50 years ago.  It&#x27;s been my favorite ever since.</li>
            <li> I purchase this fragrance all the time here on Amazon.  I just love it and will continue to buy it over and over again.</li>
            <li> Even though this Fragrance is &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;, it brings back so many great memories for me. It&#x27;s powdery scent is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> my favorite for over 40 yrs.  for evenings only.  Sophisticated scent that makes me feel elegant and refined.  I&#x27;ll always wear this scent.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this since the 60&#x27;s and have never met a person who was offended by it!  It give me that feeling of a woman who has romance on her mind.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely my favorite fragrance. My 82 year old mom has worn it for about 55 years. My dad, rest his soul, started buying it for her when they were first married. I associate the smell with my mom, who I love so much. And, I have worn it for about 25 years too. I love it!</li>
            <li> Clean fresh scent.  I have used this Eau de Toilette by Worth for years. Also a great price.</li>
            <li> Product as described. Have used it before so knew what it was ordering.</li>
            <li> PERFECT PRODUCT I RECOMENDED FOR EVERYBODY,GOOD FRAGANCE FOR SENIORS I WILL GIVE TO MY MOTHER FOR HOLIDAYS SHE LIKE A LOTS</li>
            <li> My favorite fragance from the fifties when I was in Paris. A bit on the spicy side, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;Good size for the price.</li>
            <li> As a nurse I&#x27;m very conscious of how strong my perfume is. I&#x27;ve had more compliments on Je Reviens than any other perfume I&#x27;ve worn. It&#x27;s scent is subtle, but very nice.</li>
            <li> just as I remembered it,  so lady like.</li>
            <li> I have used this lovely scent for literally fifty years and have never found another that I love as much.  I am often complimented on it and have even had people recognize the scent when I am wearing it.  I will never switch!</li>
            <li> Have been using this fragrance on and off for many years.  Had bought it from Overstock before and was satisfied.  This time I bought from Amazon and received it 3 days ago.  WHAT A  DISAPPOINTMENT.  It smells nothing the way it should, just smells like dusty old water.  It must have been improperly stored for years. Yes, I noticed the most favorable replies are quite old.  Just a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I bought also another fragrance and hate to open it.  Will not buy any more fragrances from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This was just like money throwing away.</li>
            <li> 30 years ago I stopped a woman in the Mall and asked her what fragrance she was wearing.  When she said Je Reviens I could not spell it so she wrote it down. I was with my parents and we walked to the closest department store and I purchased my first  bottle. It is so light and floral I just feel better when I am wearing it; I even wear it to bed. LOL The older I get the quicker it seems to fade but I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m so glad to find it on Amazon and at such a reasonable price. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do. May God Bless.</li>
            <li> I have been in love with this fragrance for 30 years - tried it for the first time in the Spring of 1984.  Like the name, I keep returning to it (please pardon my pun).  For the last twenty years, it has been my only fragrance.  If you have ever encountered the eau de parfum, you this can be a very strong scent.  However, the eau de toilette gives a much more subtle presentation.  It doesn&#x27;t announce your arrival 20 feet before you enter the room.  Yet the fragrance endures throughout the day.  I have received compliments on the scent I am wearing 6 or 7 hours after I applied it (never judge by whether you can smell it, you become inured as the day goes on).  If you are going out after work, just apply a spritz or two to revitalize the fragrance - rather like freshening  up your lip color and mascara.  If you enjoy classic florals, give this a try.  Best of all the price here is Amazon is actually about the same price I paid the first time I bought a bottle in 1984 - and that was the smaller 1.7 ounce size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[For anyone who doesn&#x27;t know this fragrance, Je reviens is French for I return.  So the opportunities for making bad puns while discussing this product are frequent.  Since I do enjoy punning, it is hard to resist.  Please pardon my poor humor.]</li>
            <li> My mom use used this fragance many years ago and you can&#x27;t find it in my country.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy because my mom is happy with her gift.</li>
            <li> Like any perfume, you either love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the gentle, sophisticated scent I remember from years ago; however, after application, the scent fades within an hour or so. Also, the bottle must have been quite old because on opening, the cellophane wrap pulled the paper off all over the box.</li>
            <li> This was I was looking for</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this scent for over 30 years and have never tired of it.  Neither has my husband. It is lovely and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for 20 years I&#x27;m 52 years old and I&#x27;ve been using it since I was 20 years.</li>
            <li> This product must have been old. It has a slightly alcohol type smell.</li>
            <li> My Sister has been using this perfume for at least 40 years, if not more, and it is the only perfume&lt;br /&gt;she will use.</li>
            <li> Long time favorite and hard to find.</li>
            <li> fabulous for  fragrancing your sheets mmmmmmm</li>
            <li> was not what I expected through it away</li>
            <li> wife loves it.  give it a 5 star  rating</li>
            <li> This product can&#x27;t be the same light, citrusy, wonderful eau de toilet that my wife used to buy several years ago.  There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much &amp;#34;eau&amp;#34; in it.  The fragrance that does exist isn&#x27;t unpleasant but it&#x27;s so weak that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to detect.</li>
            <li> this perfume is what my mom has worn for years.  we used to find it at Marshal&#x27;s for $9.99 but those days are gone thanks to all the Paris Hilton and other celebrity perfumes now sold at Marshal&#x27;s.  The smell is the same and so for that it was &amp;#34;WORTH&amp;#34; it.  ;)</li>
            <li> I have been using this fragrance for several decades.  I am often complimented on it.  I was happy to find it at such a good price.</li>
            <li> My Mother loves her gift</li>
            <li> Wifey smell real good</li>
