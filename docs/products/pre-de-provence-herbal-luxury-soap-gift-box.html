            <li>i bought many times and always nice</li>

            <li>Love the scents and non-drying properties.</li>
            <li>This is more of a novelty sample set in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this soap</li>
            <li>I love these soaps.</li>
            <li>Most of the scents are subtlly fragrant without being overly powering.  </li>
            <li>They make a thoughtful gift for others as well as a nice reward for oneself.</li>
            <li>After using them I was able to determine which scents are my favorite and I have purchased full-size bars of some of the fragrances as well.</li>
            <li>It would have been better if each soap&lt;br /&gt;had been cello-wrapped to preserve the scents.</li>
            <li>she love it...</li>
            <li>I love these soaps, they are perfect for the bathroom sink because they don&#x27;t get slimy like regular soap</li>
            <li>Be aware, they are quite small, but very attractive and the fragrance is marvelous.  </li>
            <li>Love them all.</li>

            <li>I love soap</li>
            <li>The recipient was pleased.</li>
            <li>okay...</li>
            <li>I assume he has enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>but I do love Amazon, so gave them a try.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t be used many times</li>
            <li>very nice and cute, thanks</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re perfect for guest use and certainly on par with guest soaps found in hotels, although a much higher quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>was a gift sent directly to a friend and she loved the scents!  </li>
            <li>They look beautiful in their packaging, which is always nice for a present, and smell heavenly.</li>
            <li>This is a great lil package of high quality soaps.  </li>
            <li>Amazon used to be a pretty good place to buy things</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel very nice and it lasts for a very long time which is probably good.  </li>
            <li>These arrived quickly, which was nice.</li>
            <li>I loved all the scents, which I did not expect, as I&#x27;m more of a floral girl, and did not think I would like the sage, verbena or coconut much...</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really rate the quality, but they looked nice and smelled nice.  </li>
            <li>Nice pieces of great smelling soaps that I not only use for guests, but</li>
            <li>and she loved them - piled them all into a large bowl in the bathroom and said the room was instantly full of fragrance and nice for her guests.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m confident my wife will enjoy these.</li>
            <li>Ideal for trying different scents.</li>
            <li>nothing over the top fantastic...</li>
            <li>Good use is very fragrant handmade soap</li>
            <li>I bought this set as a gift for my sister, and she loved it so much I bought it for myself.  </li>
            <li>They leave a sweet smell in the bath that lasts for days!</li>
            <li>Beautiful presentation and smells wonderful, although it is smaller than i expected, about the size of a CD case.</li>
            <li>It is really nice to be able to send things direct to people ... easy to give gifts this way and save on postage!</li>
            <li>since I could not take my friend to France, I brought these beautiful French soaps to her!!!!</li>
            <li>This set is a great way to try many of these great smelling soaps - they are very small but they have lasted me a month each!</li>
            <li>I will read the fine print</li>
            <li>Everything was fine with the purchase.</li>
            <li>My wife loves these; says wonderfully scented, long lasting and fair price.</li>
            <li>so I thought she might enjoy a set of French-milled soaps.  </li>
            <li>comfortable for my skin.</li>
            <li>I dislike cheap hotel soap.</li>
            <li>These soaps have such great scents.  </li>
            <li>She already know what fragrance she wants to buy next time :D</li>
            <li>Soaps are great, smell great, and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Perfect small soaps for your guests to use while you&#x27;re hosting</li>
            <li>Too petite size, each soap measures barely 1.5 inch or 4 cms square, literally &amp;#34;guest soaps&amp;#34;, but all scents have good smell.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect gift for a hostess or for a small occasion.</li>
            <li>Each soap has a great scent and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>small ,wonderfully smelling  soaps.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for the guest bathroom when you don&#x27;t want a big old bottle of liquid hand pump soap.</li>
            <li>I should have read the description a little more closely, but they are very nice.</li>
            <li>a special collections</li>
            <li>I love just about all of the soaps made by Pre De Provence and this sampler of small and cute little soaps cubes is a great way to sample nine of their more popular soaps.</li>
            <li>My own fault because it clearly says &#x27;9 oz&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Now they can decide what scents they like if they want to purchase full size bars.</li>
            <li>Smell good but really smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li>I bought this soap gift set as a holiday gift along with other items, and the receiver was happy to get it.</li>
            <li>They make a good rich lather and the scent stays with you when you dry off.</li>
            <li>subtle scent and perfect size for my needs</li>
            <li>For the best homemade organic shaving cream you will need organic soap but French soap already come with different scents where you will not need to purchase any scent.</li>
            <li>These soaps are highly polished, smell divine and made a lovely gift that one would probably not purchase for one&#x27;s self.</li>
            <li>Beautiful little sampling of these soaps!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;d make a great gift, but I have trouble giving them away.</li>
            <li>Using them is a great way to compare the various fragrances available in this line, and so  can help in choosing the larger bath soaps.</li>
            <li>We like to give our guests fresh soap for every visit.  </li>
            <li>love it ,smell so good,makes my skin soft .good products</li>
            <li>I get about 1 week&#x27;s worth of washing out of each mini bar.</li>
            <li>The linden scent soap is one I love to use in a guest bathroom as the smell is so natural and fresh, but the smell of the linden sample in this one is nothing like that.  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s fun to guess.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Great little travel soaps!</li>
            <li>Pre de Provence is a very popular brand with scents like, La Mer, Lime Zest, Sunflowers, Agrumes, Grenade Pomegranate, Mint Leaf, Peony, Green Tea, sandalwood, Lemongrass, White Gardenia, Honey Almond, Rose, Linden, Verdena, Lavender, Sage, Milk, Coconut and much</li>
            <li>Small, but smells great.</li>
            <li>Add great perfume to a small room.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I didn&#x27;t want to invest in the full size bar and wanted to sample as much of the scents beforehand.</li>
            <li>I gave these sweet small bath soaps as a Birthday gift to my Son&#x27;s wife she loved them &amp;</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that they are really a sampler pack of many different soaps--if you are looking for full size bars, this is not it.</li>
            <li>my wife like it very much</li>
            <li>Still, a nice assortment, and they&#x27;d make a nice little house gift or simple birthday gift for my lady friends.</li>
            <li>I wont be using the soaps since they are a gift for a friend, but just be aware, you may not get what is listed.</li>
            <li>they smell nice as expected.</li>
            <li>Arrived when promised and exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>Come in pretty box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they get used up first.  </li>
            <li>If you want to only smell one at a time, don&#x27;t purchase more than one scent, otherwise the scents blend together.  </li>
            <li>I thought the soaps were bigger, otherwise they are lovely.  </li>
            <li>If you are a bar soap person you will love these as they are well milled and last accordingly.</li>
            <li>I gave them two stars as they are pretty, and they do lather up well.  </li>
            <li>gave as a gift recipient was very happy with them and bought an extra set for myself seem to all smell the same not being individually wrapped but are</li>
            <li>Make good sachets, but very expensive for smell good.</li>
            <li>Giftbox, I needed to get a Bithday Gift for a nice Lady and neighbor and did not know what to get her until I saw this Item somewhere else, with all different scents, like, Coconut Sage Rose Petals Almond Honey, something like Herbs De Provence from the Kitchen, but, for the Bath, even though I noticed that some of the Scents listed are not the same ones you get, some of them were different.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great soap gift but beware that they are very small.</li>
            <li>The soaps are small but high quality and smell great.</li>
            <li>: Small, but pretty box and smells good.</li>
            <li>The soaps last a long time and have a pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and they were packaged pretty for a gift and appreciated by the receiver.</li>
            <li>Good scents but small bars of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Appropriate for any mature female as a useful and luxe gift.</li>
            <li>They are small, smells good.</li>
            <li>I love this particular brand of soap, but I didn&#x27;t really it would be SO TINY.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not clear from the picture of the product, I expected more product for the price paid :)</li>
            <li>Just the right size to leave a totally new bar for house guests to wash their hands.</li>
            <li>This was a birthday for a very dear friend of a certain age.</li>
            <li>It is very Qt</li>
            <li>Small soaps, very cute.</li>
            <li>They always go over very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>it can help smooth the face at last.</li>
            <li>I guess maybe I was expecting too much?</li>
            <li>I REALLY didn&#x27;t care for, but I think I can find someone else who might.  </li>
            <li>However, I expected more moisture since it contains shea butter.</li>
            <li>Very pleasing scents.</li>
            <li>I bought them also and find them perfect for next to the lav when a big bar of soap is too big and not necessary.</li>
            <li>but they are very fragrant .</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not organic but it is a good soap with the least amount of ingredients.</li>
            <li>With a Net Wt 0.88oz for each bar, seven bar combination is priced lower than nine bar combination due to the popularity of scents but regardless both are excellent start for deciding which scent will crown the championship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Developed by French soap makers in the 1700s the French milled soap&#x27;s triple-milling process is only available to commercial soap makers with the appropriate stainless steel rolling equipment, unlike handmade, hand-poured soaps, which can be made by amateurs.</li>
            <li>She loved them, and I hope the fragrance is as lasting as other buyers have indicated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and the soaps are high quality, but I still think it&#x27;s too little for the price you pay.  </li>
            <li>One thing to consider is these soaps are very strong scented so if you store them in a cabinet, the cabinet will fill up with the smell of the soap, even if you have several different scents.  </li>
            <li>Very beautiful but little small</li>
            <li>They smell nice and last a long time.</li>
            <li>A wonderful product and very difficult to find.</li>
            <li>and of course don&#x27;t count towards your &#x27;liquids&#x27; allowance, leaving more room in that quart Baggie for other stuff!  </li>
            <li>The soap set is small but quite nice (high quality soap/scents).</li>
            <li>got the following in the very pretty box:lavender, lemongrass, agrumes, sage, milk, fig, honey almond, ginger root, grenade pomegranate and verbena</li>
            <li>soaps are very small, but overall smell great and soften skin.</li>
            <li>This soap doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out which is important since I live in a semi-arid climate.  </li>
            <li>Cute little soaps for a stocking stuffer...</li>
            <li>I love these little bars from this brand -</li>
            <li>Lovely little gift soaps that worked well as part of bridal shower favors.</li>
            <li>I was gifted last year with a homemade soap with such a rich, luxurious lather that I expected this to be on par with that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, but good enough for me to try all the assortment flavours.</li>
            <li>I am planning on using traditional Savon de Marseilles soap for daily use, to see if it will help my dry itchy skin, as I expect the Pre de Provence soaps may be a little drying, but absolutely perfect for use while traveling...</li>
            <li>(house is on the market and wanted some pretty soaps for a big glass bowl).</li>
            <li>Gave these lovely, small soaps to my mother for her birthday</li>
            <li>as a nurse working 12 hour shifts and getting exposed to unpleasant smells and body fluids, I really, really appreciate that lasting feeling of clean, and it is also so lovely to use when I get home from a long shift and need to feel like a girl again :)</li>
            <li>I get to sample different scents, so I can decide what to buy a full bar of later.  </li>
            <li>Yes, they are small, but they are perfect for my Bnb, and they last at least a week.  </li>
            <li>I personally find the tiny little soaps adorable!</li>
            <li>and he kept putting the large bar of bath soap on the bathroom counter which looked just gross!  </li>
            <li>very good,but smaller</li>
            <li>I thought it was a Classy Gift for a Classy Lady. ...</li>
            <li>The packaging adds to the classy feel.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised, but I was.</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin and have had no problems with this soap.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered these a few times and they also make a thoughtful gift.</li>
            <li>They leave your hand soft as well.</li>
            <li>I wonder if they are either years and years old or just knockoffs.</li>
            <li>The main thing I love is that there is no residue left on your skin and your skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dry after using.</li>
            <li>for when I don&#x27;t want to have the same thing over and over in the main bathroom either.  </li>
            <li>Ordinary shower gels only leave you feeling clean for a very short while, but I find traditional soaps give you a clean feeling that lasts for hours....</li>
            <li>These soaps smell really nice but are a little smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Open the lovely box, and you have ridiculous-looking tiny little soaps.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a really nice set of 9 small, long lasting, lathering, soaps.</li>
            <li>I use these in the shower and get to use a new scent often, rather than being stuck with one massive soap log forever.</li>
            <li>So glad to locate a small soap set I can go back to in the future.</li>
            <li>These little soaps were smaller than anticipated but they are fun to place in each bathroom and give the room a soft scent.</li>
            <li>but they are apparently getting greedy.  </li>
            <li>I live alone, so each little soap lasts about a month, so the price is really comparable to grocery store soap.</li>
            <li>lovely little soaps none the less .  </li>
            <li>Although these soaps are small (about the size of typical complimentary hotel soap but thicker) they pack a powerful scent.  </li>
            <li>These little soaps makes a great but slightly expensive gift.  </li>
            <li>These are tiny, but very well made and long lasting.</li>
            <li>They fit with any decor as they are subtle colors.</li>
            <li>Very fragrant soaps but much smaller than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>Getting all these bars with different scents together offers one option where you will not get by only buying one scent bar soap when it comes in making a shaving cream.</li>
            <li>should&#x27;ve just gone to the store and bought some colorful soaps instead of being a lazy ass...</li>
            <li>The soap lathers well and the size of these small soaps is just right for guest bathrooms.  </li>

            <li> but I do love Amazon, so gave them a try.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be used many times</li>
            <li> very nice and cute, thanks</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re perfect for guest use and certainly on par with guest soaps found in hotels, although a much higher quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> was a gift sent directly to a friend and she loved the scents!  </li>
            <li> They look beautiful in their packaging, which is always nice for a present, and smell heavenly.</li>
            <li> This is a great lil package of high quality soaps.  </li>
            <li> Amazon used to be a pretty good place to buy things</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel very nice and it lasts for a very long time which is probably good.  </li>
            <li> These arrived quickly, which was nice.</li>
            <li> I loved all the scents, which I did not expect, as I&#x27;m more of a floral girl, and did not think I would like the sage, verbena or coconut much...</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really rate the quality, but they looked nice and smelled nice.  </li>
            <li> Nice pieces of great smelling soaps that I not only use for guests, but</li>
            <li> and she loved them - piled them all into a large bowl in the bathroom and said the room was instantly full of fragrance and nice for her guests.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m confident my wife will enjoy these.</li>
            <li> Ideal for trying different scents.</li>
            <li> nothing over the top fantastic...</li>
            <li> Good use is very fragrant handmade soap</li>
            <li> I bought this set as a gift for my sister, and she loved it so much I bought it for myself.  </li>
            <li> They leave a sweet smell in the bath that lasts for days!</li>
            <li> Beautiful presentation and smells wonderful, although it is smaller than i expected, about the size of a CD case.</li>
            <li> It is really nice to be able to send things direct to people ... easy to give gifts this way and save on postage!</li>
            <li> since I could not take my friend to France, I brought these beautiful French soaps to her!!!!</li>
            <li> This set is a great way to try many of these great smelling soaps - they are very small but they have lasted me a month each!</li>
            <li> I will read the fine print</li>
            <li> Everything was fine with the purchase.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these; says wonderfully scented, long lasting and fair price.</li>
            <li> so I thought she might enjoy a set of French-milled soaps.  </li>
            <li> comfortable for my skin.</li>
            <li> I dislike cheap hotel soap.</li>
            <li> These soaps have such great scents.  </li>
            <li> She already know what fragrance she wants to buy next time :D</li>
            <li> Soaps are great, smell great, and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Perfect small soaps for your guests to use while you&#x27;re hosting</li>
            <li> Too petite size, each soap measures barely 1.5 inch or 4 cms square, literally &amp;#34;guest soaps&amp;#34;, but all scents have good smell.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect gift for a hostess or for a small occasion.</li>
            <li> Each soap has a great scent and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> small ,wonderfully smelling  soaps.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for the guest bathroom when you don&#x27;t want a big old bottle of liquid hand pump soap.</li>
            <li> I should have read the description a little more closely, but they are very nice.</li>
            <li> a special collections</li>
            <li> I love just about all of the soaps made by Pre De Provence and this sampler of small and cute little soaps cubes is a great way to sample nine of their more popular soaps.</li>
            <li> My own fault because it clearly says &#x27;9 oz&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Now they can decide what scents they like if they want to purchase full size bars.</li>
            <li> Smell good but really smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap gift set as a holiday gift along with other items, and the receiver was happy to get it.</li>
            <li> They make a good rich lather and the scent stays with you when you dry off.</li>
            <li> subtle scent and perfect size for my needs</li>
            <li> For the best homemade organic shaving cream you will need organic soap but French soap already come with different scents where you will not need to purchase any scent.</li>
            <li> These soaps are highly polished, smell divine and made a lovely gift that one would probably not purchase for one&#x27;s self.</li>
            <li> Beautiful little sampling of these soaps!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d make a great gift, but I have trouble giving them away.</li>
            <li> Using them is a great way to compare the various fragrances available in this line, and so  can help in choosing the larger bath soaps.</li>
            <li> We like to give our guests fresh soap for every visit.  </li>
            <li> love it ,smell so good,makes my skin soft .good products</li>
            <li> I get about 1 week&#x27;s worth of washing out of each mini bar.</li>
            <li> The linden scent soap is one I love to use in a guest bathroom as the smell is so natural and fresh, but the smell of the linden sample in this one is nothing like that.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s fun to guess.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great little travel soaps!</li>
            <li> Pre de Provence is a very popular brand with scents like, La Mer, Lime Zest, Sunflowers, Agrumes, Grenade Pomegranate, Mint Leaf, Peony, Green Tea, sandalwood, Lemongrass, White Gardenia, Honey Almond, Rose, Linden, Verdena, Lavender, Sage, Milk, Coconut and much</li>
            <li> Small, but smells great.</li>
            <li> Add great perfume to a small room.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I didn&#x27;t want to invest in the full size bar and wanted to sample as much of the scents beforehand.</li>
            <li> I gave these sweet small bath soaps as a Birthday gift to my Son&#x27;s wife she loved them &amp;</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that they are really a sampler pack of many different soaps--if you are looking for full size bars, this is not it.</li>
            <li> my wife like it very much</li>
            <li> Still, a nice assortment, and they&#x27;d make a nice little house gift or simple birthday gift for my lady friends.</li>
            <li> I wont be using the soaps since they are a gift for a friend, but just be aware, you may not get what is listed.</li>
            <li> they smell nice as expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived when promised and exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> Come in pretty box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they get used up first.  </li>
            <li> If you want to only smell one at a time, don&#x27;t purchase more than one scent, otherwise the scents blend together.  </li>
            <li> I thought the soaps were bigger, otherwise they are lovely.  </li>
            <li> If you are a bar soap person you will love these as they are well milled and last accordingly.</li>
            <li> I gave them two stars as they are pretty, and they do lather up well.  </li>
            <li> gave as a gift recipient was very happy with them and bought an extra set for myself seem to all smell the same not being individually wrapped but are</li>
            <li> Make good sachets, but very expensive for smell good.</li>
            <li> Giftbox, I needed to get a Bithday Gift for a nice Lady and neighbor and did not know what to get her until I saw this Item somewhere else, with all different scents, like, Coconut Sage Rose Petals Almond Honey, something like Herbs De Provence from the Kitchen, but, for the Bath, even though I noticed that some of the Scents listed are not the same ones you get, some of them were different.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great soap gift but beware that they are very small.</li>
            <li> The soaps are small but high quality and smell great.</li>
            <li> : Small, but pretty box and smells good.</li>
            <li> The soaps last a long time and have a pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li> and they were packaged pretty for a gift and appreciated by the receiver.</li>
            <li> Good scents but small bars of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Appropriate for any mature female as a useful and luxe gift.</li>
            <li> They are small, smells good.</li>
            <li> I love this particular brand of soap, but I didn&#x27;t really it would be SO TINY.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clear from the picture of the product, I expected more product for the price paid :)</li>
            <li> Just the right size to leave a totally new bar for house guests to wash their hands.</li>
            <li> This was a birthday for a very dear friend of a certain age.</li>
            <li> It is very Qt</li>
            <li> Small soaps, very cute.</li>
            <li> They always go over very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it can help smooth the face at last.</li>
            <li> I guess maybe I was expecting too much?</li>
            <li> I REALLY didn&#x27;t care for, but I think I can find someone else who might.  </li>
            <li> However, I expected more moisture since it contains shea butter.</li>
            <li> Very pleasing scents.</li>
            <li> I bought them also and find them perfect for next to the lav when a big bar of soap is too big and not necessary.</li>
            <li> but they are very fragrant .</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not organic but it is a good soap with the least amount of ingredients.</li>
            <li> With a Net Wt 0.88oz for each bar, seven bar combination is priced lower than nine bar combination due to the popularity of scents but regardless both are excellent start for deciding which scent will crown the championship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Developed by French soap makers in the 1700s the French milled soap&#x27;s triple-milling process is only available to commercial soap makers with the appropriate stainless steel rolling equipment, unlike handmade, hand-poured soaps, which can be made by amateurs.</li>
            <li> She loved them, and I hope the fragrance is as lasting as other buyers have indicated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and the soaps are high quality, but I still think it&#x27;s too little for the price you pay.  </li>
            <li> One thing to consider is these soaps are very strong scented so if you store them in a cabinet, the cabinet will fill up with the smell of the soap, even if you have several different scents.  </li>
            <li> Very beautiful but little small</li>
            <li> They smell nice and last a long time.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product and very difficult to find.</li>
            <li> and of course don&#x27;t count towards your &#x27;liquids&#x27; allowance, leaving more room in that quart Baggie for other stuff!  </li>
            <li> The soap set is small but quite nice (high quality soap/scents).</li>
            <li> got the following in the very pretty box:lavender, lemongrass, agrumes, sage, milk, fig, honey almond, ginger root, grenade pomegranate and verbena</li>
            <li> soaps are very small, but overall smell great and soften skin.</li>
            <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out which is important since I live in a semi-arid climate.  </li>
            <li> Cute little soaps for a stocking stuffer...</li>
            <li> I love these little bars from this brand -</li>
            <li> Lovely little gift soaps that worked well as part of bridal shower favors.</li>
            <li> I was gifted last year with a homemade soap with such a rich, luxurious lather that I expected this to be on par with that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, but good enough for me to try all the assortment flavours.</li>
            <li> I am planning on using traditional Savon de Marseilles soap for daily use, to see if it will help my dry itchy skin, as I expect the Pre de Provence soaps may be a little drying, but absolutely perfect for use while traveling...</li>
            <li> (house is on the market and wanted some pretty soaps for a big glass bowl).</li>
            <li> Gave these lovely, small soaps to my mother for her birthday</li>
            <li> as a nurse working 12 hour shifts and getting exposed to unpleasant smells and body fluids, I really, really appreciate that lasting feeling of clean, and it is also so lovely to use when I get home from a long shift and need to feel like a girl again :)</li>
            <li> I get to sample different scents, so I can decide what to buy a full bar of later.  </li>
            <li> Yes, they are small, but they are perfect for my Bnb, and they last at least a week.  </li>
            <li> I personally find the tiny little soaps adorable!</li>
            <li> and he kept putting the large bar of bath soap on the bathroom counter which looked just gross!  </li>
            <li> very good,but smaller</li>
            <li> I thought it was a Classy Gift for a Classy Lady. ...</li>
            <li> The packaging adds to the classy feel.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised, but I was.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and have had no problems with this soap.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered these a few times and they also make a thoughtful gift.</li>
            <li> They leave your hand soft as well.</li>
            <li> I wonder if they are either years and years old or just knockoffs.</li>
            <li> The main thing I love is that there is no residue left on your skin and your skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dry after using.</li>
            <li> for when I don&#x27;t want to have the same thing over and over in the main bathroom either.  </li>
            <li> Ordinary shower gels only leave you feeling clean for a very short while, but I find traditional soaps give you a clean feeling that lasts for hours....</li>
            <li> These soaps smell really nice but are a little smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Open the lovely box, and you have ridiculous-looking tiny little soaps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a really nice set of 9 small, long lasting, lathering, soaps.</li>
            <li> I use these in the shower and get to use a new scent often, rather than being stuck with one massive soap log forever.</li>
            <li> So glad to locate a small soap set I can go back to in the future.</li>
            <li> These little soaps were smaller than anticipated but they are fun to place in each bathroom and give the room a soft scent.</li>
            <li> but they are apparently getting greedy.  </li>
            <li> I live alone, so each little soap lasts about a month, so the price is really comparable to grocery store soap.</li>
            <li> lovely little soaps none the less .  </li>
            <li> Although these soaps are small (about the size of typical complimentary hotel soap but thicker) they pack a powerful scent.  </li>
            <li> These little soaps makes a great but slightly expensive gift.  </li>
            <li> These are tiny, but very well made and long lasting.</li>
            <li> They fit with any decor as they are subtle colors.</li>
            <li> Very fragrant soaps but much smaller than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Getting all these bars with different scents together offers one option where you will not get by only buying one scent bar soap when it comes in making a shaving cream.</li>
            <li> should&#x27;ve just gone to the store and bought some colorful soaps instead of being a lazy ass...</li>
            <li> The soap lathers well and the size of these small soaps is just right for guest bathrooms.  </li>
            <li> just the price is little bit high</li>
            <li> Rolled at least three times between large stainless steel rollers until a paste is formed, the paste is then pressed into soap molds, and triple milled high-quality type of soap is created that is completely uniform and smooth, without impurities, and is longer lasting than other types of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always made in France with a typical combination of a fatty acid (oil or fat) in reaction with lye (sodium hydrochloride), with different scents, 8oz usually goes for $3.99 in conventional form and double the price in organic form.</li>
            <li> The little soaps are a sweet little luxury!</li>
            <li> This sizes are small but appreciated the giftset reviews as they mentioned this.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting for their size.</li>
            <li> It will be my last order for a long time.</li>
            <li> Soaps are much smaller than expected, only about the size of a quarter.  </li>
            <li> But they are a little too small, turn to chips all too quickly.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is that they are pretty small so not super realistic for actually washing with.</li>
            <li> All 9 soaps were packed into the box with no individual wrapping: so there were no distinct individual fragrances.</li>
            <li> I just expected them to be a bit larger.</li>
            <li> It is important that you expect small soaps though... very small.  </li>
            <li> For such a small size they do last a long time as well.  </li>
            <li> Soaps are too small to grip, will buy the bigger soaps next time.  </li>
            <li> I thought they would be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> These are actually just a wee little soap.....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just as what i expected.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> TINY TINY TINY - approximately 1&amp;#34</li>
            <li> and they are not very fragrant.</li>
            <li> They are a bit small and that is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give all five stars.</li>
            <li> SMALL A SIZEI WANT IT BIGGER!</li>
            <li> (But I&#x27;m anxious to try to the next bar.)</li>
            <li> Grate some of each bar so it would add up to half of a soap bar, add EVOO and castor oil, add distilled water, mix well, apply low heat, stir till water evaporates, add EVCO, pour mix in a small container with a cap for a day.</li>
            <li> They apparently used serious magnification to misrepresent the size of these soaps.  </li>
            <li> The soaps should be at least 50 percent larger.  </li>
            <li> think that is not worth for ....</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance，but a little expencive</li>
            <li> I purchased these little soaps for a friend who \\&quot;had everything,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> however some of them are a little grainy which is not my preference.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize they were so little.</li>
            <li> the soaps without the little scrubbers seem to work</li>
            <li> I use these little guest soaps every day for hand washing in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> After the soap is made, it is dried into crystals.</li>
            <li> Pictures can be deceiving, quite small.</li>
            <li> Extremely small.</li>
            <li> The soaps are small.</li>
            <li> Each piece is about 1 square inch of soap which means that they are sample size and too small to be used as guest soap without looking silly in a regular soap dish.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to check this before placing the order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I would get it again.&lt;br /&gt;Summary</li>
            <li> I like the scents a lot, and since they are small they don&#x27;t lose the scent when they&#x27;ve been in the shower for a while:  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really small, just sample</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s small, but who cares?</li>
            <li> This soap is small for the price, about the size of a small post-it</li>
            <li> it is a liite small.</li>
            <li> Small size, relatively delicate.</li>
            <li> A little bit too small and thin though.</li>
            <li> first I wanted to try several scents of this soap, and secondly, when traveling, I hate using horrible hotel soaps which irritate my skin, and wanted to add a little comfort and luxury to my travels.  </li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t leave all that soap scum in the sink.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because they were quite small: each soap was only about 1 square inch!</li>
            <li> The box makes the soap look like it came from an expensive boutique.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t bad, just not for me.  </li>
            <li> so stupid me from now on</li>
            <li> Gave these for Xmas, because everyone I know has too much worthless junk cluttering their home.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that the scents listed on the site were not the scents in the box of soaps.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Purchased this set for two reasons...first I wanted to try several scents of this soap, and secondly, when traveling, I hate using horrible hotel soaps which irritate my skin, and wanted to add a little comfort and luxury to my travels.  The perfume from these soaps is amazing, It just flooded out and hit me as I was opening the package...even before I had even opened the plastic bag and beautiful storage box inside.  I loved all the scents, which I did not expect, as I&#x27;m more of a floral girl, and did not think I would like the sage, verbena or coconut much...but they were all beautiful.  I am planning on using traditional Savon de Marseilles soap for daily use, to see if it will help my dry itchy skin, as I expect the Pre de Provence soaps may be a little drying, but absolutely perfect for use while traveling...and of course don&#x27;t count towards your &#x27;liquids&#x27; allowance, leaving more room in that quart Baggie for other stuff!  Ordinary shower gels only leave you feeling clean for a very short while, but I find traditional soaps give you a clean feeling that lasts for hours....as a nurse working 12 hour shifts and getting exposed to unpleasant smells and body fluids, I really, really appreciate that lasting feeling of clean, and it is also so lovely to use when I get home from a long shift and need to feel like a girl again :)</li>
            <li> We like to give our guests fresh soap for every visit.  This is a perfect product for that purpose.  We will order again.</li>
            <li> these soaps were a gift for someone, i think i give them every year.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a gift for a friend.  I was very disappointed that the scents listed on the site were not the scents in the box of soaps. The scents I didn&#x27;t get were: Sage, Linden, Honey Almond, Ginger Spice, and Rose Petal.  Instead I received an extra lavender, orange creme, grenade pomegranate, lemon grass and agrumes.  I am also bothered that the box did not look the same.  I wont be using the soaps since they are a gift for a friend, but just be aware, you may not get what is listed.</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance，but a little expencive</li>
            <li> very good,but smaller</li>
            <li> Pre de Provence Soap. Giftbox, I needed to get a Bithday Gift for a nice Lady and neighbor and did not know what to get her until I saw this Item somewhere else, with all different scents, like, Coconut Sage Rose Petals Almond Honey, something like Herbs De Provence from the Kitchen, but, for the Bath, even though I noticed that some of the Scents listed are not the same ones you get, some of them were different. She did not care or even knew about it, she just loved it. I thought it was a Classy Gift for a Classy Lady. ...Thank You D.D.</li>
            <li> Pretty and great smelling!</li>
            <li> soaps are very small, but overall smell great and soften skin.</li>
            <li> Good !my wife like it very much</li>
            <li> I recently received the soaps, they were delivered on time. My guests love them!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just as what i expected.</li>
            <li> Very fragrant soaps but much smaller than I expected for the price. My own fault because it clearly says &#x27;9 oz&#x27;. I was thinking that each bar was 9 oz.  Also, the gift arrived with no gift tag or indication of who sent it or why.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these; says wonderfully scented, long lasting and fair price.</li>
            <li> Awesome products, bought a couple for Christmas gifts. Smell great and came in very nice packaging and great gift box. If I was given this gift I thought this would have cost $30+. Pictures can be deceiving, quite small. Uploading picture ASAP!</li>
            <li> These were cute with an artisanal feel. Much smaller than I thought it would be, but was a perfect house warming gift.</li>
            <li> Wonderful to not only use for myself, but to take as a hostess gift!!</li>
            <li> The soap feels very smooth, simply love it.&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that the actual size of each soap bar is tiny. It&#x27;s not clear from the picture of the product, I expected more product for the price paid :)</li>
            <li> good smell but tiny(I can hold it easily),I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have to say the soap is really nice and the smell is so good. I love it !</li>
            <li> As advertised, but wish size was mentioned instead of weight. Will have to supliment gift with something else to go with it.</li>
            <li> thsi costs much more in France. Go figure.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and also for myself.  Makes the bath or shower enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Recommended.  These soaps smell really nice but are a little smaller than I expected.  They are about 1.5 inches square.</li>
            <li> Very cute set for a gift. I love these soaps. Only complaint is that they are pretty small so not super realistic for actually washing with. they smell nice as expected.</li>
            <li> Nice collection gift for mothers day.</li>
            <li> Cute little soaps for a stocking stuffer...Now they can decide what scents they like if they want to purchase full size bars. The packaging is very nice.</li>
            <li> Got these as a gift and the recipient loved them! The soaps are small but high quality and smell great. She loved them! Great value/price.</li>
            <li> I purchased these little soaps for a friend who \\&quot;had everything,\\&quot; so I thought she might enjoy a set of French-milled soaps.  She loved them, and they are a nice gift that someone can use perosnally or set out for guests.  The variety of scents and colors were lovely, as well.</li>
            <li> Beautiful little sampling of these soaps!</li>
            <li> Smell great, most taken by others in family.</li>
            <li> Nice set with nice variety</li>
            <li> smell good. comfortable for my skin.</li>
            <li> These delicious smelling soaps are perfect for guests. They come packaged in an adorable box that would make them a great gift too.</li>
            <li> Searched for soaps in these pretty colors and was so happy when I found these.  They fit with any decor as they are subtle colors.</li>
            <li> Good scents but small bars of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I will give them 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Coconut, Rose Petal, Sage&lt;br /&gt;Milk, Lavender, Verbena&lt;br /&gt;Honey Almond, Linden, &amp; White Gardenia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really nice set of 9 small, long lasting, lathering, soaps. They come in a beautiful box for gift giving. They are similar in size and width to a dispenser of square Glide floss. All the scents smell wonderful. Perfect for the guest bathroom when you don&#x27;t want a big old bottle of liquid hand pump soap.</li>
            <li> Great little travel soaps! I dislike cheap hotel soap. These are tiny, but very well made and long lasting. Love the scents and non-drying properties.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful but little small</li>
            <li> It is very Qt and It is smell very good. I love this ,and it package is very beautiful. good</li>
            <li> I stored in my sock drawer, and smells wonderful!  Soaps are great, smell great, and last a long time.  Will purchase again, but may take a while to get through each of the soaps.</li>
            <li> very nice and cute, thanks</li>
            <li> Nice variety here and smells great.  Good price too.  My wife likes these alot.  The packaging adds to the classy feel.</li>
            <li> our hostess loved these</li>
            <li> Extremely small. Over priced for its content. Will go back to using loccitane.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap set for a gift.  It&#x27;s nice and the soaps are high quality, but I still think it&#x27;s too little for the price you pay.  I would have paid $8 max for this.  It&#x27;s still a nice gift, so I don&#x27;t regret the purchase, I just wish the price was lower.  The soaps are small.</li>
            <li> I love this particular brand of soap, but I didn&#x27;t really it would be SO TINY.  Each piece is about 1 square inch of soap which means that they are sample size and too small to be used as guest soap without looking silly in a regular soap dish.  This is more of a novelty sample set in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Small soaps, very cute. Just the right size to leave a totally new bar for house guests to wash their hands.</li>
            <li> I like the variety, and they all smell great.</li>
            <li> The little soaps are a sweet little luxury!</li>
            <li> Good use is very fragrant handmade soap</li>
            <li> I love these little bars from this brand - I bought them for myself as a gift to myself.  I use these in the shower and get to use a new scent often, rather than being stuck with one massive soap log forever.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this soap</li>
            <li> I use these myself as it saves room on sink rim. however some of them are a little grainy which is not my preference. subtle scent and perfect size for my needs</li>
            <li> These little soaps were smaller than anticipated but they are fun to place in each bathroom and give the room a soft scent. Long lasting for their size.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description thoroughly, I guess. I didn&#x27;t realize they were so little. Make good sachets, but very expensive for smell good. I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised, but I was.</li>
            <li> Lovely packaging and smells wonderful.  They are a bit small and that is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give all five stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter in law and she loved their scent, packaging and size, I alson thought their scent lovely.</li>
            <li> love it ,smell so good,makes my skin soft .good products</li>
            <li> I love these soaps. They smell wonderful, last a good amount of time, and the packaging is beautiful. I keep several sets in the house for those times when I need a last-minute gift. They always go over very well.</li>
            <li> because the size of the bars were deceptive they are wonderful except they are miniature and had I known that I would not bought them at 14.00 so stupid me from now on I will not just look at pictures I will read the fine print and if it looks too good to be true... it probably is.</li>
            <li> Perfect small soaps for your guests to use while you&#x27;re hosting</li>
            <li> These soaps are wonderful.  They leave a sweet smell in the bath that lasts for days! The soap lathers well and the size of these small soaps is just right for guest bathrooms.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this set as a gift for my sister, and she loved it so much I bought it for myself.  Most of the scents are subtlly fragrant without being overly powering.  For such a small size they do last a long time as well.  They make a thoughtful gift for others as well as a nice reward for oneself. After using them I was able to determine which scents are my favorite and I have purchased full-size bars of some of the fragrances as well.</li>
            <li> the scents that came with the soaps in this box were soapy-fake smelling. Not what I expected. Another reviewer mentioned that these were not the scents she thoughts she was ordering. I&#x27;m not sure how to check this before placing the order. I have used big-bars from this company and had been very pleased.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a Christmas gift. When I opened the box the cent was nice and strong. I&#x27;m a husband and liked the smell so I&#x27;m confident my wife will enjoy these.</li>
            <li> It was a gift so I can&#x27;t really rate the quality, but they looked nice and smelled nice.  They were exactly the size I was expecting, small.</li>
            <li> With a Net Wt 0.88oz for each bar, seven bar combination is priced lower than nine bar combination due to the popularity of scents but regardless both are excellent start for deciding which scent will crown the championship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Developed by French soap makers in the 1700s the French milled soap&#x27;s triple-milling process is only available to commercial soap makers with the appropriate stainless steel rolling equipment, unlike handmade, hand-poured soaps, which can be made by amateurs. After the soap is made, it is dried into crystals. Rolled at least three times between large stainless steel rollers until a paste is formed, the paste is then pressed into soap molds, and triple milled high-quality type of soap is created that is completely uniform and smooth, without impurities, and is longer lasting than other types of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always made in France with a typical combination of a fatty acid (oil or fat) in reaction with lye (sodium hydrochloride), with different scents, 8oz usually goes for $3.99 in conventional form and double the price in organic form. Pre de Provence is a very popular brand with scents like, La Mer, Lime Zest, Sunflowers, Agrumes, Grenade Pomegranate, Mint Leaf, Peony, Green Tea, sandalwood, Lemongrass, White Gardenia, Honey Almond, Rose, Linden, Verdena, Lavender, Sage, Milk, Coconut and much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not organic but it is a good soap with the least amount of ingredients. Getting all these bars with different scents together offers one option where you will not get by only buying one scent bar soap when it comes in making a shaving cream. Grate some of each bar so it would add up to half of a soap bar, add EVOO and castor oil, add distilled water, mix well, apply low heat, stir till water evaporates, add EVCO, pour mix in a small container with a cap for a day. For the best homemade organic shaving cream you will need organic soap but French soap already come with different scents where you will not need to purchase any scent. If you want no scent then you need to go to unscented soap.e any scent. If you want no scent then you need to go to unscented soap.</li>
            <li> The scents are amazing! A wonderful product and very difficult to find. So glad to locate a small soap set I can go back to in the future.</li>
            <li> These are great.  My husband does nor like liquid hand soap and he kept putting the large bar of bath soap on the bathroom counter which looked just gross!  I took away the liquid hand soap and asked him to use these hand soaps and now we are both happy.  They smell nice and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Soaps are much smaller than expected, only about the size of a quarter.  Nice fragrances, but disappointing for price.</li>
            <li> These were a nice gift for friends.&lt;br /&gt;I stuffed 1 soap into a &#x27;washbag&#x27;, and included the remainder of&lt;br /&gt;the soaps in the gift bag.  It would have been better if each soap&lt;br /&gt;had been cello-wrapped to preserve the scents.</li>
            <li> Translation, Love the taste! VERY GOOD</li>
            <li> Bought it for mothers day... she love it... She already know what fragrance she wants to buy next time :D</li>
            <li> Amazon lost a good bit of my trust on this one.  The soaps are tiny.  They apparently used serious magnification to misrepresent the size of these soaps.  Tried to return them but they are not eligible for return.  Amazon used to be a pretty good place to buy things but they are apparently getting greedy.  I hope Amazon enjoys the 14 bucks they got from me.  It will be my last order for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought four of these as gifts. I was disappointed because they were quite small: each soap was only about 1 square inch! All 9 soaps were packed into the box with no individual wrapping: so there were no distinct individual fragrances. I would have been happy to get this for $9.99 but not for $19.99.</li>
            <li> TINY TINY TINY - approximately 1&amp;#34; square - I returned them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on my third box. They&#x27;d make a great gift, but I have trouble giving them away. Each one has a distinct, delightful scent.</li>
            <li> Arrived when promised and exactly as promised. I love these soaps, they are perfect for the bathroom sink because they don&#x27;t get slimy like regular soap and they don&#x27;t leave all that soap scum in the sink. Plus, they are lightly perfumed and smell delightful.  I live alone, so each little soap lasts about a month, so the price is really comparable to grocery store soap.</li>
            <li> i am definetly purchase it again , the texture of your skin after using it is completely amazing, recommended to all</li>
            <li> she loves the smell..its great to have the variety and they were packaged pretty for a gift and appreciated by the receiver.</li>
            <li> Great for my guest bath and I take&lt;br /&gt;them traveling.They are nice for&lt;br /&gt;little hands also-my daughter loves&lt;br /&gt;the scent</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift and she absolutely loved it.  Appropriate for any mature female as a useful and luxe gift.</li>
            <li> Great soap sampler.  Ideal for trying different scents.</li>
            <li> Very good products! Thanks for the very good service delivery.</li>
            <li> These are going to be nice gifts for my guess to take home.  They each have individual smells like coconut, sage and mango, etc.</li>
            <li> Got it as a stocking suffer for grandma. She likes the smell. Bars are only maybe 1.5&amp;#34; x 1.5&amp;#34;. Come in pretty box.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m not sure if I would get it again.&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Small, but pretty box and smells good.</li>
            <li> They are small, smells good. enduring use.&lt;br /&gt;And a special collections&lt;br /&gt;Hope it can help smooth the face at last.</li>
            <li> Soaps are too small to grip, will buy the bigger soaps next time.  Like the scents and color mixture just wish they were bigger.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift; was happy that they came in a cute box.  But the individual soaps are tiny.  I was almost embarrassed to give this as a gift.  The soaps should be at least 50 percent larger.  Fragrance, packaging, etc. was all nice.  Open the lovely box, and you have ridiculous-looking tiny little soaps.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter-in-law, and was very pleased with the wonderful fragrance of these pretty soaps.  Be aware, they are quite small, but very attractive and the fragrance is marvelous.  She loved them, and I hope the fragrance is as lasting as other buyers have indicated.</li>
            <li> Small, but smells great. I gave it as a gift so I didn&#x27;t get to use it myself but they have a very strong scent. Add great perfume to a small room.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, these are teeny sample sized soaps.  I like the scents a lot, and since they are small they don&#x27;t lose the scent when they&#x27;ve been in the shower for a while:  they get used up first.  But they are a little too small, turn to chips all too quickly.  Still, a nice assortment, and they&#x27;d make a nice little house gift or simple birthday gift for my lady friends.</li>
            <li> Marvellous reminder of the smells of Provence</li>
            <li> I use them every day! Love them all.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soaps - I like every scent!  Pre de Provence soaps last 10 times longer than regular commercial soaps.</li>
            <li> Wish these were bath size bars.</li>
            <li> Great hostess gift ideas.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and feels great on the skin.  I have fairly sensitive skin and have had no problems with this soap.  This soap doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out which is important since I live in a semi-arid climate.  One thing to consider is these soaps are very strong scented so if you store them in a cabinet, the cabinet will fill up with the smell of the soap, even if you have several different scents.  If you want to only smell one at a time, don&#x27;t purchase more than one scent, otherwise the scents blend together.  This package comes with several different scents together.  Smells nice, but if you favor one scent more than another, this would not be the way to go.  Keep in mind these are travel size soaps.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be a little bigger. Aroma is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R.O.</li>
            <li> The seller and item delivery was good but the product itself is just okay. I ordered this because I didn&#x27;t want to invest in the full size bar and wanted to sample as much of the scents beforehand. I don&#x27;t know I guess maybe I was expecting too much? I thought the smell would be stronger and the lather to be richer.  I was gifted last year with a homemade soap with such a rich, luxurious lather that I expected this to be on par with that but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> good,but it is too fragrant.</li>
            <li> Got these as a housewarming gift and they are really lovely. They look beautiful in their packaging, which is always nice for a present, and smell heavenly. Honestly, I&#x27;m considering buying some for myself not as soap but for putting in drawers to make my clothes smell nice. Keep in mind that they are really a sampler pack of many different soaps--if you are looking for full size bars, this is not it.</li>
            <li> My girls love choosing a scent. They are finely milled and lather very nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a Christmas gift and the recipient raved! Great way to give a variety of scents, and it was very prettily wrapped, making it great for gift-giving.</li>
            <li> Soaps were smaller than I thought they would be.  Everything was fine with the purchase.</li>
            <li> These smell delicious and make wonderful lather.  Yes, they are small, but they are perfect for my Bnb, and they last at least a week.  Guests love them.</li>
            <li> very good to clean my face</li>
            <li> Gave these for Xmas, because everyone I know has too much worthless junk cluttering their home. This soap gets used up and enjoyed.</li>
            <li> I gave these sweet small bath soaps as a Birthday gift to my Son&#x27;s wife she loved them &amp; the way her skin felt after using them. I liked the fact I could give a great gift at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Very nice for a powder room. Pleasant aroma. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> GREAT FRAGRANCE. TOO SMALL A SIZEI WANT IT BIGGER!</li>
            <li> I like that I get to sample different scents, so I can decide what to buy a full bar of later.  There were two I REALLY didn&#x27;t care for, but I think I can find someone else who might.  They aren&#x27;t bad, just not for me.  I get about 1 week&#x27;s worth of washing out of each mini bar.</li>
            <li> Am using them to fill an apothecary jar in my bathroom.  They are the perfect size and they smell good too.</li>
            <li> Lovely soaps, a nice sampling of some of the best fragrances.  Great for decorating.  Also can be a great gift.</li>
            <li> smell good, pep me up.</li>
            <li> I love just about all of the soaps made by Pre De Provence and this sampler of small and cute little soaps cubes is a great way to sample nine of their more popular soaps. These are also very attractive in a decorated bowl in the guest bathroom and keep the area smelling fresh and clean. I have ordered these a few times and they also make a thoughtful gift.</li>
            <li> Article very good can in the Amazon to buy really happy is really a very happy shopping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, but good enough for me to try all the assortment flavours. Very nice smell.</li>
            <li> Too petite size, each soap measures barely 1.5 inch or 4 cms square, literally &amp;#34;guest soaps&amp;#34;, but all scents have good smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like kind of perfume but&lt;br /&gt; I love soap scent.&lt;br /&gt;especially, the scent of linden and white gardenia..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good.So great</li>
            <li> Beautiful presentation and smells wonderful, although it is smaller than i expected, about the size of a CD case. I personally find the tiny little soaps adorable!</li>
            <li> Incredibly fantastically smelly, these are the perfect gift as a set (or I took them out and used the individually as favors) - an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Beautiful packaging. The box makes the soap look like it came from an expensive boutique. The soaps themselves are also beautiful and smell great. The recipient was pleased.</li>
            <li> I thought the soaps were bigger, otherwise they are lovely.  I should have read the description a little more closely, but they are very nice.</li>
            <li> I thought that is soap sample.&lt;br /&gt;It is really small, just sample size.&lt;br /&gt;I think that is not worth for ....</li>
            <li> I rellay like it,the smell of them is very good.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect gift for a hostess or for a small occasion. Packaged in a decorative box and they smell wonderful!</li>
            <li> Nice purchase.... Arrived on time...will buy again.</li>
            <li> I tried the product and found the additives cut tiny pieces of my skin during the shower...maybe if i had rougher skin, the soap would be great....the soaps without the little scrubbers seem to work okay...nothing over the top fantastic...would i buy them again? possible but then again, doubt it</li>
            <li> This was a birthday for a very dear friend of a certain age. These soaps are highly polished, smell divine and made a lovely gift that one would probably not purchase for one&#x27;s self. My dear friend was very pleased. I would buy them again for myself or as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;PS. since I could not take my friend to France, I brought these beautiful French soaps to her!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice soap!  Loved it!  Makes your skin feel very nice and it lasts for a very long time which is probably good.  (But I&#x27;m anxious to try to the next bar.)</li>
            <li> Smell good but really smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing. Yes, it&#x27;s small, but who cares? There are 9 bars. They come in a really nice package and they smell great. After washing your hands, they feel very smooth and smell amazing. I got these soaps for my mom for Mothers Day and she loves them!!</li>
            <li> Love this soap!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful clean scented soaps.</li>
            <li> The smell of the soap is great.  However, I expected more moisture since it contains shea butter.</li>
            <li> This set is a great way to try many of these great smelling soaps - they are very small but they have lasted me a month each!</li>
            <li> My son received this item as a present.  I assume he has enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> This sizes are small but appreciated the giftset reviews as they mentioned this.  These are the perfect size for guest bath.  Also place these in my dresser drawers.  Very pleasing scents.</li>
            <li> was a gift sent directly to a friend and she loved the scents!  so I didn&#x27;t get to &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; them...  It is really nice to be able to send things direct to people ... easy to give gifts this way and save on postage!</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Great bridal shower favor bag stuffer, perfect for our paris themed favors. A little bit too small and thin though.</li>
            <li> Lovely and great smelling guest soaps. They leave your hand soft as well. The size and fragrances are listed. Used a beautiful piece of crystal to accent the array of soaps.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to read all information before purchasing. Especially, the size of soaps and fragrances.</li>
            <li> This soap is small for the price, about the size of a small post-it and they are not very fragrant.</li>
            <li> I use these little guest soaps every day for hand washing in the bathroom. If you are a bar soap person you will love these as they are well milled and last accordingly. Using them is a great way to compare the various fragrances available in this line, and so  can help in choosing the larger bath soaps. Great as a gift and for those who prefer bar soap.</li>
            <li> These soaps are perfect stocking stuffers. I made and decorated boxes and added some of the soaps along with sachets. It was a crowd pleaser as the scent was heavenly. The sizes are perfect for hand soaps I like to put them in my lingerie drawer</li>
            <li> Again, these guest soaps did not smell like the pre de provence soaps I&#x27;ve been buying for years.  I gave them two stars as they are pretty, and they do lather up well.  The linden scent soap is one I love to use in a guest bathroom as the smell is so natural and fresh, but the smell of the linden sample in this one is nothing like that.  I would not recommend these soaps.  I wonder if they are either years and years old or just knockoffs.</li>
            <li> This is a great lil package of high quality soaps.  It is important that you expect small soaps though... very small.  Perfect for guests when they come over to stay with you, or if you have soap ADD and want to change it up every 4 days  :)  All of the soaps are labeled with the fragrance, too!  Although it&#x27;s fun to guess.</li>
            <li> This was a house warming gift for my nephew &amp; his wife.  They like trying different scents of soap.  this product delivered.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I cannot find great smelling soap made in the USA.  It seems the Europeans love to craft a great soap product!  Each soap has a great scent and lasts a long time.  Well worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Although these soaps are small (about the size of typical complimentary hotel soap but thicker) they pack a powerful scent.  You can smell it through the box.  I got them as a gift but ended up keeping them.  You can get about 4-6 washes from them.  They make a good rich lather and the scent stays with you when you dry off.</li>
            <li> These arrived quickly, which was nice. They are quite cute, nice colors. I&#x27;m using them to stage our bathroom (house is on the market and wanted some pretty soaps for a big glass bowl). These are actually just a wee little soap.....should&#x27;ve just gone to the store and bought some colorful soaps instead of being a lazy ass...but I do love Amazon, so gave them a try. They are cute though!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect gift because the soaps are so amazing and there&#x27;s a good variety to try.  Pre de Provence makes the best soap I have ever smelled.</li>
            <li> Its good. they smell nice. I just expected them to be a bit larger. The box is about 6 inches by 6 inches.</li>
            <li> Lovely little gift soaps that worked well as part of bridal shower favors.</li>
            <li> Perfect, item just as pictured and described.</li>
            <li> These soaps have such great scents.  They lather real nice.  I feel like I&#x27;m pampering myself when I use them.</li>
            <li> i bought many times and always nice</li>
            <li> just the price is little bit high</li>
            <li> Small size, relatively delicate.</li>
            <li> Amazing Ups,4 DAYS traveling to China</li>
            <li> Omg they smell wonderful wanna get them full size.</li>
            <li> This sample pack is brilliant!  Nice pieces of great smelling soaps that I not only use for guests, but for when I don&#x27;t want to have the same thing over and over in the main bathroom either.  The main thing I love is that there is no residue left on your skin and your skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dry after using.</li>
            <li> Gave these lovely, small soaps to my mother for her birthday and she loved them - piled them all into a large bowl in the bathroom and said the room was instantly full of fragrance and nice for her guests. I bought them also and find them perfect for next to the lav when a big bar of soap is too big and not necessary. They lather well and smell and look wonderful. Recommend without reservation. Price is right, and they arrived on time, well packed, and in excellent condition from this supplier.</li>
            <li> Nice mixture of scents. Attractively packaged</li>
            <li> I bought this soap gift set as a holiday gift along with other items, and the receiver was happy to get it.</li>
            <li> The soap set is small but quite nice (high quality soap/scents). There had been some reviews mentioning size, so I&#x27;ve attached photos showing the actual size. I think they&#x27;re perfect for guest use and certainly on par with guest soaps found in hotels, although a much higher quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soaps are not individually wrapped but I didn&#x27;t find this to be an issue.</li>
            <li> The soaps last a long time and have a pleasant fragrance.  The only problem is that by combining them in one box, the scents intermingle.</li>
            <li> These little soaps makes a great but slightly expensive gift.  All of these soaps are about 11/2 inches and come in a box no bigger than square kitchen tile.&lt;br /&gt;I got the following in the very pretty box:lavender, lemongrass, agrumes, sage, milk, fig, honey almond, ginger root, grenade pomegranate and verbena scents.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very good and the receiver has thanked and complimented me on the great gift.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great soap gift but beware that they are very small.</li>
            <li> Good, very useful, not for guest even for my family</li>
            <li> smallest soap bars I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> small ,wonderfully smelling  soaps.  They don&#x27;t come wrapped, but I wrapped them myself in about three minutes because they keep their smell longer that way.  I actually use dishes of soaps instead of poupori.  in all of my bathrooms, and these are some of the nicest I&#x27;ve found for the money.</li>
            <li> gave as a gift recipient was very happy with them and bought an extra set for myself seem to all smell the same not being individually wrapped but are lovely little soaps none the less .  Have not used them yet but they are very fragrant .</li>
            <li> These came exactly as shown and smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> Good smell.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a good gift to my girl.Natural&lt;br /&gt;But it is a liite small. It can&#x27;t be used many times</li>
