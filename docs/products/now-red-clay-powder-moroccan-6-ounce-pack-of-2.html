            <li>I use it about 1 to 2 times per week and find it has made some very wonderful changes to my skin.&lt;br</li>

            <li>This is a great addition to homemade soaps.</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>Loved the way it made my face feel and could see immediate improvement.</li>
            <li>I loved the tingling and tightening feeling.</li>
            <li>My skin glows and feels very nice after - I love doing this when I am feeling the need to pamper</li>
            <li>I combined with rose water &amp; for my hair added some almond oil.</li>
            <li>Red clay is great for your face but great for your hair too.</li>
            <li>I hope others have a better experience.</li>
            <li>I had so many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My curls feel great and are much looser which makes them manageable.</li>
            <li>saw this on You Tube being used as a full body treatment for sagging skin and the results were amazing...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Afterwards, I use toner (Rose Petal toner from InstaNatural) and put Vit C and Niacinamide serums (also from InstaNatural) and gently working them in with my fingertips and then a Vit E moisturizer cream to top things off.</li>
            <li>This product works great as a mask mixed with my witchhazel toner.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I will keep both tubs and enjoy their contents.</li>
            <li>I just mix with water or alcohol free witch hazel for a facial masque that makes my skin look amazing!  </li>
            <li>It was inexpensive and worth a shot!</li>
            <li>I really like the product but the packaging could be better.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it full body</li>
            <li>Mix it with rose water and the mask dries up nice and tight after I remove it</li>
            <li>So simple with amazing results and free from all those man&#x60;made chemicals.</li>
            <li>Felt so good going on my very sensitive dry skin and even better after I removed it.  </li>
            <li>Really tightens pores!!  </li>
            <li>this is filtered, chlorine free water straight out of the fridge.  </li>
            <li>It absolutely leaves my pores clearer, and if I moisturize and go to bed, when I wake up, my skin looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>It adds the properties of the clasy as well adds a nice red color to the soap.</li>
            <li>I was really wanting to love this product, but it just didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>Now my skin is very smooth and my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li>I used this mask for the first time this evening.</li>
            <li>It really does reduce the look of my pores as well!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use this make a facial about once a week, I like the results and the product is pretty cheap</li>
            <li>Love it but not very much ‚úäüèº</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>After I wash it off I can immediately feel how much cleaner my face</li>
            <li>I thought that that was how much one tub was.</li>
            <li>Its very meesy when trying to dispense and use as a face wash.</li>
            <li>This worked really well for my husband.</li>
            <li>I didnt realize I be getting two for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>It was fun, and really makes your skin feel tight - pretty cool.</li>
            <li>and I actually had some fun one day and used this product outside on a hot summer day as a body mask (in our backyard!)</li>
            <li>rest for about 20 to 30 minutes until my clay mud pack is dry then rinse with cool water and a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>mix about 1 Tablespoon with about 1/2ml of witch hazel and a few drops of rose hip oil that I recently purchased by Insta Natural and then add filtered or bottled water until it is the consistency of pudding.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I had to wipe it off as fast as I possibly could.</li>
            <li>I have so much volume in my hair &amp; the very next day</li>
            <li>then let it set for a couple minutes to thicken completely adding drops of water until the desired consistency.</li>
            <li>He has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I been dealing with adult acne in my chin.  </li>
            <li>my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave this four stars is because when I purchased it the price seemed a bit high.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if it worked well or not due to the fact that I just couldn&#x27;t stand the discomfort.</li>
            <li>Left my skin &amp; hair so soft!</li>
            <li>I am an African American female with natural hsir</li>
            <li>When its drying, my face begins to feel very pulled up and tight - isn&#x27;t that the idea?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I was really wanting to love this product, but it just didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.

I mixed it up, put it on and sat down to what I thought was going to be a relaxing twenty minutes. The mask was so uncomfortable and itchy I had to wipe it off as fast as I possibly could.

            <li> Amazing product! I used it on my hair &amp; skin. I combined with rose water &amp; for my hair added some almond oil. I have so much volume in my hair &amp; the very next day I had so many compliments on my skin. Left my skin &amp; hair so soft!</li>
            <li> Mixed this is filtered, chlorine free water straight out of the fridge.  Felt so good going on my very sensitive dry skin and even better after I removed it.  Loved the way it made my face feel and could see immediate improvement.</li>
            <li> I use this make a facial about once a week, I like the results and the product is pretty cheap</li>
            <li> I used this mask for the first time this evening. I mixed it with the apple cider vinegar (with the mother). I loved the tingling and tightening feeling. My face pulsated. Now my skin is very smooth and my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I use this twice a week. She puts tea tree oil in hers. I love this stuff. my pores are smaller and its not over drying.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> This product works great as a mask mixed with my witchhazel toner. My skin feels so soft, tight and refreshed each time I use it! It really does reduce the look of my pores as well! A++++</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. At first I was skeptical in buying it because I didn&#x27;t know exactly what it was. I did some research and finally decided to purchase it. The clay mask helped my acne go down quite a bit. It really pulled out all the nasty toxins in my face. After I wash it off I can immediately feel how much cleaner my face feels.&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely happy with this product. The only reason I gave this four stars is because when I purchased it the price seemed a bit high. I thought that that was how much one tub was. Upon receiving my package I found that the reason why the price was a little over $14 was because I had purchased 2 tubs and not one. I know I didn&#x27;t see anywhere on the site that said I purchased two of the same product. It just caught me off guard. Nevertheless, I will keep both tubs and enjoy their contents. Once it comes time to purchasing this product again I will just keep my eyes out for any unnecessary extras.</li>
            <li> Really tightens pores!!  I am impressed with how well this works.  Husband and I actually had some fun one day and used this product outside on a hot summer day as a body mask (in our backyard!) and then used the hose to rinse off.  It was fun, and really makes your skin feel tight - pretty cool.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful. Add some distilled water to the powder in a plastic baggy, squish it a bunch, and you have perfect mask goop. I spread it on my face with my fingers, let it dry for fifteen to twenty minutes where it makes my face feel tight, then wash it off. It absolutely leaves my pores clearer, and if I moisturize and go to bed, when I wake up, my skin looks fantastic. I have recommended this to friends and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like it. I mix the clay with a little water to make a paste and apply it on my face once or twice a week. It makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like the product but the packaging could be better. Its very meesy when trying to dispense and use as a face wash.</li>
            <li> I have been using this clay now for about 3 months and ordered it for a really great price thru amazon for a 2 pack. I use it about 1 to 2 times per week and find it has made some very wonderful changes to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix about 1 Tablespoon with about 1/2ml of witch hazel and a few drops of rose hip oil that I recently purchased by Insta Natural and then add filtered or bottled water until it is the consistency of pudding. I mix it in a little disposable drinking cup with a wooden popsicle stick then let it set for a couple minutes to thicken completely adding drops of water until the desired consistency. After cleaning my face with the skin pads from Roc I put a thin layer on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rest for about 20 to 30 minutes until my clay mud pack is dry then rinse with cool water and a wash cloth. It does change the color of my wash cloth so I use white generic ones from the local dollar store which are expendable and can be bleached. I also wash my face afterwards because I noticed that rinsing it off wasn&#x27;t enough to remove the entire amount of mud. When its drying, my face begins to feel very pulled up and tight - isn&#x27;t that the idea?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, I use toner (Rose Petal toner from InstaNatural) and put Vit C and Niacinamide serums (also from InstaNatural) and gently working them in with my fingertips and then a Vit E moisturizer cream to top things off. My skin glows and feels very nice after - I love doing this when I am feeling the need to pamper myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this on You Tube being used as a full body treatment for sagging skin and the results were amazing... Haven&#x27;t tried it full body but it has been great on my face!</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to homemade soaps. It adds the properties of the clasy as well adds a nice red color to the soap. Just mix with water then add to the soap at trace.</li>
            <li> Love it but not very much ‚úäüèº</li>
            <li> Wow!  I just mix with water or alcohol free witch hazel for a facial masque that makes my skin look amazing!  So simple with amazing results and free from all those man&#x60;made chemicals.</li>
            <li> This worked really well for my husband. He has sensitive skin and I have combination skin. If you have combination skin, buy the green clay.</li>
            <li> I am an African American female with natural hsir and I used this clay mask to clarify and detoxify my 3c-4a strands. It left my curls elongated,  defined and very deeply conditioned. I recommend this product to all naturals!!!</li>
            <li> This clay is AWESOME. I have an oily T Zone and this mask did the trick. I use it once a week and my pores are visibly reduced. Great product!</li>
            <li> Red clay is great for your face but great for your hair too. I used it to cleanse my natural hair by mixing it with a little oil and water and applying as a paste. My curls feel great and are much looser which makes them manageable.</li>
            <li> One surprise was the fact that for the price I paid for one, they sent 2. I didnt realize I be getting two for such a cheap price. I have very sensitive skin and I been dealing with adult acne in my chin.  Mix it with rose water and the mask dries up nice and tight after I remove it my skin is so soft. I been using it 2 weeks now and I notice my acne scars r lightening up too.</li>
