            <li>It took a week to get great results.</li>
            <li>In addition, it is a sticky kind of gel that doesn&#x27;t feel good to me.  </li>
            <li>Save yourself the money and spend better in weight loss pills than this!</li>
            <li>As most products would specify that results may vary, it depends on you and your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this product works for me and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Will try one more tube and if I see a change will update my review</li>
            <li>Okay I used this cream but bought another one</li>
            <li>I was VERY EXCITED To see results so fast everybody saw the difference After 3 year of trying.</li>
            <li>It works great the only problem I have its that they don&#x27;t sell bigger size :)</li>
            <li>IT ReALLY WORKS!!</li>
            <li>I just turned 60 and look great with my firm tummy.</li>
            <li>you can see results right away</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t as good as I was hoping for, but did see a difference in my tummy skin firmness in about 2 weeks, while using it everyday, twice a day.  </li>

            <li>When I first rubbed the cream on my stomach i could feel a tightness, and it does really work.</li>
            <li>Been using for over 3 weeks now and do not feel like much is getting done.</li>
            <li>it look like I was 6-7 months pregnant, and I am not the only thing</li>
            <li>really didn&#x27;t see any results except it made my tummy soft</li>
            <li>this product is something that I had been looking for, and I can see the results when I put it on every day, because my stomach was bigger than what it is right now</li>
            <li>It really tightens my stomach and actually sculpts my obliques.</li>
            <li>tummy is now firm and my clothes fit well.</li>
            <li>I was surprised this actually works</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is worth the price now, for the amount you get.  </li>
            <li>No luck and unless you are willing to run around unclothed for 30 minutes while it dries, it really is a waste of time</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I started buying and using this product when it was 1st sold at Walmart and CVS. Been using for 8+ years, impressed with results. Have 4 kids and wanted a product to help firm my tummy. I use this once a day (directed twice a day for best results). I work out 3-5 times a week. It really tightens my stomach and actually sculpts my obliques. I find when I stop using it for a few days even with regular exercise that my tummy starts to feel flabby. As most products would specify that results may vary, it depends on you and your skin. I&#x27;m glad this product works for me and will continue to use it. One downfall, not so happy about the increase in price. Besides, I recommend this product for a flatter and toned stomach.</li>
            <li> Been using for over 3 weeks now and do not feel like much is getting done. I have been using as advertised on the bottle. I will keep at it and update my review if anything changes...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but orderd it anyways. When I first rubbed the cream on my stomach i could feel a tightness, and it does really work. I would definately buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product.  Wasn&#x27;t as good as I was hoping for, but did see a difference in my tummy skin firmness in about 2 weeks, while using it everyday, twice a day.  But am disappointed in the price of it now.  It&#x27;s gone up a little. Not sure if it is worth the price now, for the amount you get.  Lasted me a little under a month.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try to fight flab. Bad news. It does NOT work! Save yourself the money and spend better in weight loss pills than this!</li>
            <li> I have got to say I was shcoked with the results. It gave me noticeable improvement in about a week. I just had a baby and it works excellent for that after baby bulge.I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I used it as directed...It did not work at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money!! (I&#x27;m skinny and I had a pregnancy 2 years ago, I just needed something to firm a little my belly... not a big quest!)</li>
            <li> This products works well. I purchased the tummy tuck belt and use it twice a day with the belt. I also do the 10 minute exercise by contracting my abdominal muscles.&lt;br /&gt;My tummy is now firm and my clothes fit well. I would recommend this product to anyone. I just turned 60 and look great with my firm tummy.</li>
            <li> There is not much product in this tube &amp; I know I probably need to use it for a longer period of time, but it&#x27;s been about a month and I have not noticed any difference at all.  Will try one more tube and if I see a change will update my review</li>

            <li> this product is something that I had been looking for, and I can see the results when I put it on every day, because my stomach was bigger than what it is right now it look like I was 6-7 months pregnant, and I am not the only thing is that you have to constantly keep putting it on in order for it to work.</li>

            <li> Okay I used this cream but bought another one so I let my husband use it. His abs are firmer but he thinks about losing weight he does so I cant call this one so it gets a 4star.</li>
            <li> It was sticky, gooey and did nothing at all but stain my clothes. Like anyone who is desperate to get rid of jelly belly, I tried it. No luck and unless you are willing to run around unclothed for 30 minutes while it dries, it really is a waste of time</li>
            <li> I saw all the great reviews which empowered me to buy this! But i used it twice a day, did ab exercises, and using the cream, I got no results. I was really disappointed because I wanted to see results like other reviews...BUT I DIDNT SO.. O WELL.</li>
