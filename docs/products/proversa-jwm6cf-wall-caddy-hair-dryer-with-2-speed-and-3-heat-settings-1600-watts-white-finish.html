            <li>This is a great compromise.</li>
            <li>It does the job and works great in the camper.</li>
            <li>This dryer is great to hang on the wall, saving space on the countertops.</li>
            <li>Looks great.</li>
            <li>Seems to be great.  </li>
            <li>When it wore out I was so happy to find Amazon had the identical item.</li>
            <li>The 2 speed 3 heat settings are great.</li>
            <li>Its compact and has great power.</li>
            <li>...for this great wall-unit hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>This was perfect, I opened it, and placed it on the mounted bracket, perfect fit.  </li>
            <li>LOVE!!</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>After years of having my hair dryer clutter up the vanity, I now have a very nice dryer attached to the wall.  </li>
            <li>Very handy.</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>I have one in each of our bathrooms and are very handy and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li>Very Handy.</li>
            <li>This item is very handy because you don&#x27;t have to have a cord and dryer on the counter or put it in a cabinet when you&#x27;re done.  </li>
            <li>She loved it and it does a great job drying</li>
            <li>Great product, good price.</li>
            <li>This product was easy to mount on the wall and works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>The best part is easy access since it it is attached to wall by my sink.</li>
            <li>It hangs easily and is one of the best dryers we have owned!</li>
            <li>Good value for the $$.</li>
            <li>The cord was fairly short--and could be shortened by winding inside the wall mount, which we did.   </li>
            <li>It is a good dryer for the cost</li>
            <li>I saw this at my sister in laws, she has one in each bathroom and loved it.</li>
            <li>My husband took it apart and the cord inside was black,not good.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve owned one of these before and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Install it once (took 5 minutes) and it&#x27;s good to go.  </li>
            <li>The price was fair and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Is it not as good as the $50 model we have but for $20 and hangs on the wall</li>
            <li>This is a good solution when you want a wall mounted hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a good quality product.  </li>
            <li>One good deal.</li>
            <li>The ProVersa unit fit perfectly on the existing wall mount, so I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I loved it...while it worked.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mounted in the guest bathroom and everyone who has stayed with us have commented how great it is and how nice it looks.</li>
            <li>its a good hair dryer</li>
            <li>I think everyone should have one--good looks and good power.  </li>
            <li>I was gone a good portion of that time, as I&#x27;m often out of town for work, and I just returned from about 10 days out of town.</li>
            <li>arrived good, after 6 months in used, broked......  </li>
            <li>Easy to install and works real nice with lots of air for drying your hair.</li>
            <li>Very light weight and a great space saver.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product and with Amazon&#x27;s system.</li>
            <li>Was very pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>, we are very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the hairdryer.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the service and response that I have received using Amazon.</li>
            <li>We are very pleased with this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I may try one more as I have a friend who has had one for 6 years and it still runs great.  </li>
            <li>great product have used these fo many years and although style has changed still works as well would recomend to others</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and is so convenient to have right on the bathroom wall.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps not as fancy as the more exspensive units, but for the most part it is very good .I</li>
            <li>good product, very easy to install.</li>
            <li>Buy more than one, and give as a gift !</li>
            <li>It might&#x27;ve been best using some heat to weaken the flap first.</li>
            <li>love it !</li>
            <li>Abolutely love this!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price and now I have a lot more counter space!</li>
            <li>works great, was easy to install - i love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to install and works great.</li>
            <li>It is a good design, but the quality could be better when it comes to that fan.  </li>
            <li>The hairdryer is attached to the wall-mount and has its own cord from the wall-mount to the hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>and I really liked it</li>
            <li>It mounts nicely out of the way.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s always handy.  </li>
            <li>Never in the way since it has it&#x27;s own place.</li>
            <li>Nice touch is the removable screen that catches air born dust.</li>
            <li>wish the coiled cord is longer and it would have been nice if it had a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; air shot in addition to hot/warm air settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very powerful and works great.  </li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!!</li>
            <li>Easy to get in and out of the holder and SUPER handy to install!!</li>
            <li>Amazon C/S was great to look up measurements for me to make sure it would fit in the space we had.  </li>
            <li>It was just what I needed, got here quick, and works great.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer is very easy to install.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to mount on the wall.</li>
            <li>The unit is very easy to install.  </li>
            <li>Jerdon 1600 was by far the best choice for me.  </li>
            <li>Loved the wall mount design, as well as the light weight of the dryer -</li>
            <li>So far this dryer is working great!  </li>
            <li>Puts out pretty good heat and a good amount of air.</li>
            <li>It worked great, and I knew right then that I needed one of these.  </li>
            <li>It is however compact and attractive enough to have as a wall mount, and it is great for overnight guests.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Replacement for the first one, which had the fan blade fly apart during use.  </li>
            <li>Great product, price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Amazon was great about refunding my money quickly, and I have been happy again with the new version of Oster/Sunbeam, which has two speeds and two wattage settings.  </li>
            <li>It burned out but we liked the style and easy of use</li>
            <li>I liked it because it was easy to install on the wall.</li>
            <li>Nice hair dryer, mounted on the wall, clearing counter space and easily acceptable.  </li>
            <li>love this dryer I put in our 5th wheel  and its so handy where we put it and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Amazon was great refunding my money as I certainly didn&#x27;t want a replacement.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit noisy but the air volume and heat make it worthwhile</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I selected this one.  </li>
            <li>Today, there is more room on the counter with the dryer safe on the wall.  </li>
            <li>This may make more sense if you read about dryer #2 below.     </li>
            <li>While I love the convenience of this dryer mounted to the wall, which is why I bought it, it lacks power.  </li>
            <li>I love the Jerdon 1600W wall hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I deduct one more star (3 stars now).</li>
            <li>The company shipped it fast and all transactions have been great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll replace it under warranty, but why would I spend $10 in shipping for a $20 product to get what would probably be a refurbished model?</li>
            <li>guests love them</li>
            <li>Thank you for being such a great seller!</li>
            <li>I purchased this model hoping for more power.  </li>
            <li>I love the convenience of a walled mounted hair dryer .</li>
            <li>This hair-dryer has more watts, so more power.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the convenience  of the wall hanging.  </li>
            <li>My latest \\&quot;Jerdon\\&quot; stopped working after 6 months.</li>
            <li>They both came in a most timely fashion.</li>
            <li>Both appropriately matched.</li>
            <li>Love this dryer.</li>
            <li>Have one in every bathroom and gifted one to my daughter.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>daily use... worked great!  </li>
            <li>love this unit : )  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also pleased with my business with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought one for home and one for vacation home..</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied every  time.  </li>
            <li>I used a Sunbeam wall-mount dryer for many years.</li>
            <li>I have owned one for many years, so when the fan went out I bought another one.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of not having a dryer in a drawer or on a counter.  </li>
            <li>I could not find one in the local stores and found the best price on Amazon.com</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this wall caddy hair dryer.</li>
            <li>My wife used one in a motel (Holiday Inn Express and fell in love with this.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the item.  </li>
            <li>100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>We love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>, i would not recomend this dryer to any one go for the sumbeam/oster a much better product</li>
            <li>It seems to leak from the plastic ring around the top.  </li>
            <li>You will love this product.</li>
            <li>Love that part.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I love the wall mount feature.  </li>
            <li>Trust me when I say you will enjoy!</li>
            <li>We have not found a wall-mount dryer that works better or lasts longer than this one.  </li>
            <li>OK, it&#x27;s just a hair dryer</li>
            <li>Yes, I love it.  </li>
            <li>This unit is even better than the ones we&#x27;ve used at hotels.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I love the wall mount hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>I have bought these as gifts and people just love them.  </li>
            <li>I love the wall mount feature, it doesnt take up space.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>so i was able to use all settings as needed.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>FOR MANY YEARS.</li>
            <li>Convenient to have on the wall and quality is OK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fully satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>We liked its clean and symmetric design better than its competitors.  </li>
            <li>Keeps counter space clean, but yet the dryer is handy to use.</li>
            <li>but I still have my hair dryer from college that works beautifully (although a bit bulky) and its 30 years old.</li>
            <li>I think they are of pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>Right, but the great thing about this dryer is it not only works great, it neatly hangs on the wall out of the way.</li>
            <li>When I switch to the high setting I get very warm air</li>
            <li>(except for some kind of mild plastic/silicone smell)     </li>
            <li>A perfect fit for my short hair.</li>
            <li>These hair dryers look great, are easy to mount, and are well-designed -- repeated grabbing and replacing the blower section has no effect and these units still look new.  </li>
            <li>Cheap plastic fan blade where metal would be much better.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to have found this to replace an old burnt out</li>
            <li>Was so glad they were still available as my family loves this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is available whenever you need to use it</li>
            <li>I love this light weight hair dryer that has lots of power.</li>
            <li>but I like the clutter free counter top in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>They blow nicely warmed air and are quite powerful, despite their petite size.  </li>
            <li>The wife loved the one i have in my bathroom so much that i ordered this one for her bathroom</li>
            <li>Nice and powerful, strong wall anchoring</li>
            <li>The temperature settings are easy to select and change.</li>
            <li>More powerful and much better priced</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact and easy to install on the wall.</li>
            <li>It was easy to install and will be easy to replace hair dryer</li>
            <li>It drys my hair super fast, light weight, is up and out of the way,  and a great price.  </li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly...</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Mounting is quite easy, and it frees up counter/drawer space.  </li>
            <li>Insertion into and release from wall mount easy.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to find a place for it.</li>
            <li>So easy and so reliable.</li>
            <li>Easy access,</li>
            <li>The lint screen is detachable for easy cleaning and there is a wall mount.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and hangs on the wall out of the way.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>So easy to use, so convenient, so out of the way.</li>
            <li>I like  the easy access of the dryer hanging on the wall rather than stored in the vanity drawer.</li>
            <li>Lastly, it&#x27;s easy to install.</li>
            <li>Mounting is easy and just plug it in.</li>
            <li>It is easy to hang, easy to use and now has three speeds.</li>
            <li>liked it so much that we purchased two more as replacements in case</li>
            <li>This works well and is easy to use,</li>
            <li>AFTER 4 YEARS ITS STILL GOING STRONG</li>
            <li>but were just not as strong as this unit</li>
            <li>I liked it when it worked, but now it doesn&#x27;t have very much power.</li>
            <li>I could only ever have a wall mount which is very handy and safe.</li>
            <li>It is so handy and ready to go when ever we need to use it!</li>
            <li>The end result looks pretty nice</li>
            <li>Most importantly (to me) the bathroom looks clean and uncluttered and I can use the countertop once again.  </li>
            <li>I had one of these for a number of years and loved it, However the new one I just purchased broke within one week.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it should work fine.</li>
            <li>However, the medium setting is cooler and works fine for me.</li>
            <li>Both units are fine and show no sign of loosening.</li>
            <li>Does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>The style is fine.</li>
            <li>I bought a new one and it fit the old bracket on the wall just perfect.  </li>
            <li>No problem with anything else, just that cheap plastic fan blade, in my case anyway.</li>
            <li>This is the second one that I have and it works great.</li>
            <li>It is light weight for her to use.</li>
            <li>fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I had happily used a Oster/Sunbeam wall mount dryer for several years.  </li>
            <li>A wall dryer is a great convenience, but only if you buy a product which is reliable.</li>
            <li>The product looks perfect when it comes, have it mounted on the wall immediately and had no problem using it everyday.</li>
            <li>Cheap and works well for someone who just dries hair with it.  </li>
            <li>It was mounted in an upstairs bathroom and lightly used.</li>
            <li>I like this unit because it&#x27;s fairly easy to mount on wall and run the power wire inside the wall.&lt;br /&gt;Result clean hotel appearance with no plug wire</li>
            <li>This one fit on the existing bracket.</li>
            <li>These tabs are so flimsy that they do not maintain the spacing to fit into both tabs.  </li>
            <li>would like it replaced for free....</li>
            <li>design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to unlatch and latch securely to the wall mount.</li>
            <li>Some units also come with a night light built in.</li>
            <li>Great for smaller bathrooms!!</li>
            <li>Happy female family with this.</li>
            <li>This item seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The parts sound like they are grinding together.</li>
            <li>feels cheap in the hand.</li>
            <li>&quot; It&#x27;s good enough for kids and most adults.</li>
            <li>The replaced hairdryer is working so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good, have owned this for a month.</li>
            <li>At any rate, great service and a very economical price considering the logevity of the units with proper care and cleaning of the filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>+ per year!)we were very pleased with the longevity and the features of the unit, and are buying a new one as a replacement.</li>
            <li>Very powerful for its size</li>
            <li>Very powerful and compact.</li>
            <li>It Looks like the Sunbeam 1200 model that we have had forever, &amp; that is found in most hotel rooms, but not near as good.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it arrived and it works just as good as the first one.  </li>
            <li>very easy to install and works very well,</li>
            <li>These are well worth the price!</li>
            <li>They look great and work well as long as they work.</li>
            <li>Does an excellent job of making my lazy crew cut stand up.</li>
            <li>The wall mount keeps it out of the way, but readily accessible when needed.  </li>
            <li>It burned out yesterday, January 31, 2013 (significant note,</li>
            <li>Out of the way when not in use, easy and powerful.</li>
            <li>Web site description adequate and accurate.</li>
            <li>We do clean the filter regularly---they still burn out in 12 to 18 months--</li>
            <li>Design is clean and I like it.</li>
            <li>It is handy, but VERY loud.</li>
            <li>was easy - it just slipped right onto the original bracket.  </li>
            <li>I loved being able to push it back onto the wall without stopping to turn it off first.  </li>
            <li>So far I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use the screw provided instead by special drywall screws</li>
            <li>But this time, I&#x27;ll do the right thing and get the 1632 instead!</li>
            <li>yet right there when you need it!</li>
            <li>My husband was more than happy to install this (a couple of screws) since it meant no more hair dryers laying on the bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li>We both liked it so much that he even suggested that I go ahead and buy another one and have it on hand for when the first one wore out.  </li>
            <li>Love this for organization, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Overall rating, Good</li>
            <li>After reading mixed reviews on this product I decided to take a chance since the price seemed good.  </li>
            <li>We had one of these for years, replaced it with a different design, but returned to this one because it&#x27;s just a superior</li>
            <li>Got it fast and have enjoyed it</li>
            <li>I bought this product about 6-7 years ago at a local store and loved it.  </li>
            <li>My last one, also a wall mount, lasted a good five years.</li>
            <li>heat settings are good enough.  </li>
            <li>It works good,it is easy to use, and looks better than the old one.  </li>
            <li>Attached it to the wall easily and found it to work exactly as we wanted.</li>
            <li>The wall mounted hairdryers (2) arrived very quick and were exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what I wanted it to do and easy to mount on the wall.  </li>
            <li>Added bonus - more wattage with the new one!</li>
            <li>I continued to use it for a few more months until it croaked for good.    </li>
            <li>Installed quickly as well.</li>
            <li>On the MED setting it does have more velocity than my older model</li>
            <li>The hair dryers that I ordered were exactly what I was looking for and their description and picture was precise.</li>
            <li>the time period to return it expired on January 31); it would not blow and the element burnt very hot.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product: easy installation, lasting quality and a good price.</li>
            <li>I like the wall mount hair dryers and will gladly buy a new one of these every two-three years.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and the force of the hot air dries my hair very fast.</li>
            <li>The first one we bought was a Sunbeam, in 2000, and it lasted us until September 2010!  </li>
            <li>This thing is HOT!</li>
            <li>I think this is the machine that was originally made for Sunbeam/Oster and was used in lots of hotel rooms, which is where I first saw one years ago....</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it seems that the new model is quite a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li>Great for a tight situation.</li>
            <li>This is a great little hair dryer.</li>
            <li>These little dryers are just great in my room and the guest room.</li>
            <li>great little hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Great little dryer.  </li>
            <li>We ordered 3 more because the remaining two of the orignal units MAY finally quit, although they seem to be doing just fine.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy my Jerdon wall mount hair dryer and would recommend it very highly.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: It&#x27;s now been 9 months since I purchased and installed these in our rental home, and they still, after heavy usage, work great.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had our Jerdon 1600 for a few months now and it still works great.</li>
            <li>It only had one speed in the end, but it looks much better than most of the wall mount driers out there, and it provides a reasonable bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as I remember or as powerful as the hand held 1600 watt I have.</li>
            <li>We have used the old one lots and have been perfectly satisfied</li>
            <li>but overall it is a nice machine-lots of power.  </li>
            <li>It has lots of power for no bigger than it is and just a nice addition to my bathroom, convenient but out of the way also.</li>
            <li>Hey, for twenty bucks I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>, that was the same kind, so I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a convenient and effective hairdryer that will serve well.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is powerful for it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li>Handy to see your way into the bathroom in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li>The medium and high settings are too strong a speed for me to</li>
            <li>Had the first one for many years and now replacing it with new one.</li>
            <li>We own five vacation homes in the Orlando, area right outside Walt Disney World.  </li>
            <li>Dries super fast!  </li>
            <li>Despite sometimes heavy usage, this one has met our needs very nicely.  </li>
            <li>And the other for our friends that loved the convience.  </li>
            <li>I must unpluged the power cord right away.</li>
            <li>They are right on target with price and shipment.</li>
            <li>Always  Right  there  </li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>The first choice is far better quality.  </li>
            <li>It never fails to operate, is effective, and simple to use.  </li>
            <li>I might not be satisfied, as some previous reviewers seem to feel, but for my everyday usage it is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Great way to save counter space, well constucted hair dryer, high speed is fast and hot, makes for a quick dry.</li>
            <li>After the first exact same model stopped working after 18 months, I bought another since my wife liked the style.</li>
            <li>And the blower on the high setting is very powerful.  </li>
            <li>Kind of strange.</li>
            <li>This is a great little unit and much nicer than it&#x27;s predecessor.</li>
            <li>My previous Jerdon dryer had a night light which I miss on this one, but wouldn&#x27;t give a good hair dryer up simply for a night light.      </li>
            <li>Found the dryer we wanted, paid a reasonable price , and received it quickly.</li>
            <li>It was reasonably priced, and quickly shipped.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more powerful than the larger, bulkier dryer we did have</li>
            <li>Very nice for a small space.</li>
            <li>showing.&lt;br /&gt;Several people have commented on the clean mounting and high end look when installed this</li>
            <li>I love them mounted right next to the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>When the new one came, it fit the bracket exactly as the first.  </li>
            <li>Jerdon was no longer manufacturing them when the original one went out (also to avoid putting new holes in the wall).</li>
            <li>The wall-mount installation was extremely easy, since I was able to reuse the metal mounting plate from my previous blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>When I first purchased this hair blower, I had doubts as the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>The airflow is quite high and quite warm on all settings except low.</li>
            <li>The cord now goes from the mount to the first plug in.  </li>
            <li>But this does make me weary of its quality, and that more things may break later on.</li>
            <li>I think the first one lasted 2 years and this one just died after 2 years.</li>
            <li>To my surprise it is $10 more today than it was back in 2011.</li>
            <li>and I am not sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li>I have used a wall mounted hair blower for over 20 years, the first being one made by Sears &amp; then an Oster (I still use this one.)    </li>
            <li>The Sears &amp; Oster are better made but look very similar to the Jerdon.  </li>
            <li>The first one sent by Amazon had a defective button so they immediately replaced it.    </li>
            <li>This one also doesn&#x27;t get so hot that it dries my hair out.</li>
            <li>The hairdryer fits exactly on the wall-mount that we installed for our Sears hair-dryer.  </li>
            <li>I bought our first Jerdon 1600W wall mount 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>First bought a Jerdon wall mount about two years ago.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased the Wall Mount hair dryer for our 5th wheel, and since I have installed them in two bathrooms in our home,    </li>
            <li>After install it&#x27;s very convienent, too!</li>
            <li>My first Jerdon hair dryer lasted 10 years and we used it every day.  </li>
            <li>and I see why I bought it in the first place.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is supposed to do, and I like it.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;the curly cord from the unit to handle is way to short - will not reach more than 2 1/2 feet</li>
            <li>Needed 2 more for second home.</li>
            <li>The only thing that some people might like better is the heat level.</li>
            <li>The first lasted about 6 years until the speed/Temperatue switch in the handle burned out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this brand of wall hair dryer for many years and recently bought this one for a vacation home bath.  </li>
            <li>As for durability:  the first one I bought lasted about 6-7 years before I had to replace it.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted over 6 yrs.  </li>
            <li>The actual unit seems OK but we consider the mount a no go and would not buy this item again.</li>
            <li>I had an electrician come the next day to make sure it was not my electric outlet or circuits</li>
            <li>First one lasted&lt;br /&gt;over</li>
            <li>but leakes as you try to pour the coffee from the pot when it is hot.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2 more , 1 to replace the bathrooms that was used by 4 girls constantly!!</li>
            <li>And the dim night light is a bonus.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted 8 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it 2-3 years now, and exactly what I wanted for vanity and not take up counter space.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to have someone hold the dryer mount on the wall so you can hold it and use it as if drying your hair to make sure it is in the proper place and you will never look at drying your hair in the same way!  </li>
            <li>I probably do not need all this power, but there is a low setting so that makes it better.  </li>
            <li>Within 12 months the first one died.  </li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t be used as hot as I wished.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer is exactly what we&#x27;ve been looking for and this is the only place we were able to find it.  </li>
            <li>We purchased the first Jerdon wall mount dryer about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>Love it because it is conveniently wall mounted and has just enough power and choice of heat settings for my hair.</li>
            <li>It is too noisy when you go to the higher speeds.</li>
            <li>I am still keeping this and not using the higher speeds.</li>
            <li>9 years ago we bought 3 of these units (one for each bath room) and we are just now having to replace the first one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same as the one I had used for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient, easy to use, powerful enough, and doesn&#x27;t add clutter the countetops.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had the dryer installed for less than a month, but so far it is working great.  </li>
            <li>design is ugly, cord to electic outlet is great lenght, heat settings are fine, setting for blowing are fine</li>
            <li>Ample settings... gets hot which I like... blows strong enough...</li>
            <li>The catches that clip in the handset part don&#x27;t latch positively like the Sunbeam did.</li>
            <li>A long time ago, this dryer was in a favorite hotel chain.  </li>
            <li>The double buttons make it easy to use, too.</li>
            <li>It still worked and I was able to dry my hair</li>
            <li>Easy to set up and simple to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install and very solid against the wall.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to order, and the shipping time was short.  </li>
            <li>It is also very, very noisy on the high setting.  </li>
            <li>I installed it shortly after and it worked fine for about 10 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Drys hair in little time and handles nicely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a clean boxy look instead of the usual elongated hair dryer shape and that looks better on my wall as well.</li>
            <li>First it quit working on high</li>
            <li>It is very loud, hence the start deduction, but I have fine hair that dries quickly, so don&#x27;t have to hear it for very long.</li>
            <li>May be a little noisy, but is powerful, on-off switch and holder are convenient, and the night light feature is useful.</li>
            <li>Perhaps my wife will be happy with it and forgive the few extra holes in the bathroom wall from repositioning.</li>
            <li>and really does the job.</li>
            <li>Very neat.  </li>
            <li>The reason I have not retured it is because the postage cost would be so much.</li>
            <li>I really like the three speeds .</li>
            <li>It very convenient and compact.</li>
            <li>Thanks heaven that it&#x27;s within 30 days and Amazon provide an overnight shipping of a replacement.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t feel it was so short that I couldn&#x27;t comfortably stand away from the dryer to be in front of the mirror.</li>
            <li>However it did not have as much air velocity as I wanted.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets dryer much quicker.  </li>
            <li>Very convienient.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to use.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>The earlier model also had a built in night light which this one does not, to my disapointment.    </li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this.</li>
            <li>This item has a wall mount with two flimsy plastic tabs that must fit into slots as the unit is put back into the wall mount.  </li>
            <li>It does have coils that stretch out and hasn&#x27;t really been a problem.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>It is wall mounted which makes it very convenient.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>SO  very  convenient,  </li>
            <li>,  Ready  </li>
            <li>Ready to use at anytime without have to untangle cords or put it away.</li>
            <li>My hand held dryer never made that much noise,</li>
            <li>The unit is always ready to use and it doesn&#x27;t take up space.</li>
            <li>Always plugged in and ready to go.</li>
            <li>Click and it is ready to use and click it is put away.</li>
            <li>I really like having the wall mount design</li>
            <li>When it was finially installed, it worked very well.</li>
            <li>It fits my space very well</li>
            <li>We bought this for our rental property and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>but I wonder if it really is putting out 1600w at max.  </li>
            <li>IT FITS MY SPACE VERY WELL AND OPERATES VERY SATISFACTORILY.</li>
            <li>/&gt;THE VERY AFFORDABLE PRICE.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with hair dryers.</li>
            <li>Nice unit, give it five stars if it would just last longer in daily use.</li>
            <li>Be sure to have near plug in as the cord is short.  </li>
            <li>Those three heat settings each had their own speeds, low for low heat, med.</li>
            <li>wife also has one of the aforementioned original models, but only uses it for her hair, and it continues to work just fine.</li>
            <li>By the time I was able to get on line the end of February (because of personal issues) to find out how to return it, it was too late to get free shipping and a full refund, so</li>
            <li>We decided to buy an exact replacement unit since we really like the design and performance, but for a hotel-style unit I would expect more robust build quality for such a critical component.</li>
            <li>Dry&#x27;s my hair fast and mounts easily.</li>
            <li>I just bought three more, one for work (I am a barber) one for my other bathroom and a spare.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the other Jerdon 1600W dryer that Amazon sells at $34.95 is any better(?).</li>
            <li>- in fact better than some of my other &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>The medium and high settings for heat are both on very high speeds.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>guess is the ability to mount as I did somehow has justified the pricing to seller, but does it?&lt;br /&gt;If unit were 20% less costly would have given 5 Stars.&lt;br /&gt;There are better hair dryers out there for the same cost, but I wanted one I could neatly mount on wall.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, medium thickness, and is long</li>
            <li>It can fit in small spaces leaving the bath counter free for our guests.</li>
            <li>So far so good on the second one, which has been used daily for for a month so far.  </li>
            <li>Kind of pointless purchase now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to just slip the new one on the old bracket, which is much easier than mounting a new bracket for a different hair</li>
            <li>Works well, replaced an older Jerdon wall mount that died.</li>
            <li>Changed my rating because I had more problems with this 2nd one and only lasted 6 months.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed getting my hairdryer off the countertop, but I&#x27;ll have to do it with a different brand in the future.</li>
            <li>is most likely chinese made as well</li>
            <li>I bought an older version some years ago after using one in a hotel.</li>
            <li>This product came to me already broken and is make of many cheap plastic parts.  </li>
            <li>installed this product mainly to save the space,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>I had this particular hairdryer before and it had gotten broke.</li>
            <li>But she has mentioned several times that she finds this particular product noisier than she liked or expected.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>High heat setting is practically automatic (don&#x27;t have to wait for it to heat up).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recomend this hair blower</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone for your home or rental property.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li>for med heat and high for high heat</li>
            <li>It does but the heat settings are fixed to certain speeds.</li>
            <li>I love this little blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought one of these for the convenience of a wall mounted, smallish dryer powerful enough to dry my and my wife&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Not too bad, not too great!  </li>
            <li>The product works very well and is priced modestly.  </li>
            <li>I made the repair because it was more trouble to reship to the product company.</li>
            <li>It was heavily used by my teen daughter and, under those circumstances, lasting 5 years is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It works better than my normal heavy duty 1875</li>
            <li>I suggest spending a few more bucks and getting a quality item.</li>
            <li>Have had it a few months now and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Not fantastic, just OK, but the&lt;br /&gt;price dictates that.</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t give it five stars because the cord is too short if you are right handed and need to install it on a right-hand wall (or if you are left-handed and want to install it on the left-hand wall).  </li>
            <li>Since I now have one for parts other than the fan, and the hair dryer fit</li>
            <li>I like a wall mount because it leaves my counter free for other items.  </li>
            <li>I can imagine folks with thick and long hair requiring more blow power, will want to consider other models that are more powerful.</li>
            <li>I have had goldfish live longer.</li>
            <li>I hope they still make them when the new one stops working.  </li>
            <li>This new version adds a removable screen on the air intake for cleaning and the GFI is incorporated inside the unit rather than at the plug.</li>
            <li>so I ordered this new version.</li>
            <li>with a new one....not a re-serviced one....</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;anxiously waiting for the new one.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll be looking for a new one.</li>
            <li>They look very nice, the only draw back is they only last a few years, but that is the same with most hair dryers.</li>
            <li>I never thought of actually owning one in my own home until I visited my sister a few years ago, and she had this one mounted on her guest bathroom wall.  </li>
            <li>This unit began to self destruct this morning discharging internal shrapnal and vibrating while releasing a death sound.&lt;br /&gt;Despite being treated with the utmost respect it will join the pile of cheap Chinese junk I have accumulated over the years</li>
            <li>so we expect the same performance from this new unit, also, the new one looks so much better, 10yr old hair dryers loose their looks too.  </li>
            <li>It is very loud.</li>
            <li>use.&lt;br /&gt;This unit replaced a very old one that was a Sears.  </li>
            <li>The only difference is that the new one is noisier than the first one.  </li>
            <li>It is the only dryer I have used that has both a low and a high fan volume on the cool setting in addition to the heat settings.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>On Feb 1 of 2006 this dryer sent out sparks and the coils inside were red hot.  </li>
            <li>exact replacement for one I had that finally died.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love the fact that it is so small hanging on the wall and out of the way.</li>
            <li>for a wall unit its pretty good.this is the only my wife</li>
            <li>Well, about 6 1/2 years later, the first one stopped working - after warning us with a burning smell.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the Sunbeam one and even used same mounting plate already on the wall.</li>
            <li>Fortunately my wife figured out how to press the panic button and shut them down.</li>
            <li>Drying is quick, and the only criticism I have for this appliance is that it is quite loud, especially on its Medium &amp; High settings.</li>
            <li>Once I placed the new one on the old plate</li>
            <li>When the first one broke my wife had to go back to the bulky old one she had until I found this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It works great, lots of power, dried my hair quickly - and that&#x27;s saying something since my hair is usually slow to dry.</li>
            <li>Medium and high heat settings are on high speed only.</li>
            <li>Keeps bathroom neat and counter clear.</li>
            <li>wanted far too much  for the same item.      </li>
            <li>is very short and you must install it very close to the outlet.</li>
            <li>Purchased this as a direct replacement of the unit mounted in my motorhome from factory.  </li>
            <li>This is a direct replacement even though the motorhome is 10 years old.  </li>
            <li>we decide to order the same unit again, thanks</li>
            <li>I will probably reinstall the old one.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted a long time</li>
            <li>so when my old hair dryer quit working</li>
            <li>It sparked then stopped completely.</li>
            <li>Paid twice this price for my old one.</li>
            <li>Had to order one for a friend after she saw my old one.</li>
            <li>Just over a year old</li>
            <li>na last much longer&amp;#34</li>
            <li>So far it is just like the old one, but with improvements.</li>
            <li>Lovin&#x27; it so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m stuck with these after doing a modified direct wire job in the bathrooms.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace an old wall-mount hairdryer that I had used for 15+ years until it just stopped working one day.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it needs to be so loud.  </li>
            <li>Have used this dryer in hotels and when my old dryer died, I purchased this one.  </li>
            <li>This slid onto the attachment I had on my wall, so it was a seamless transition.  </li>
            <li>Bought this to replace an old Sunbeam that burned out.</li>
            <li>I purchased 2 of these and installed 1 so far.  </li>
            <li>and this is powerful enough for daily use.  </li>
            <li>Given how long previous hair dryers have lasted, we were pleased with that life</li>
            <li>My bathromm is small and I like it hanging on the wall within easy reach since I have no drawer space.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, easy to use</li>
            <li>I have severe arthritis and like how much power is available in such a small, lightweight, wall mountable unit.</li>
            <li>Very similar if not almost the same exact thing as an old Sunbeam I had for years.</li>
            <li>Most seem to last only half that time.</li>
            <li>Only the low heat switch of the hairdryer was burned out the first time I turned it on.  </li>
            <li>Fearing that they might have ruined the classic model, I bought this one instead because it looked in the picture like the former Sunbeam design.    </li>
            <li>It is the only dryer I have been able to find that fits the small space on my bathroom wall</li>
            <li>Purchased to replace an older model that finally died.  </li>
            <li>low, med, and high and</li>
            <li>If I had paid a little more and bought locally, I would have gotten my money back or another item.</li>
            <li>It is easy to install; I put it next to my bathroom vanity mirror with the outlet just a few inches away.</li>
            <li>It is VERY noisy, but you don&#x27;t have to have it on as long, so I guess it evens out the pros and the cons.</li>
            <li>I owned a Jerdon 1600W wall-mount dryer for 4 years till it finally died of every day normal usage.</li>
            <li>I live the various speeds: low, med, high.</li>
            <li>Not hard to install and is solidly mounted in holder.</li>
            <li>You cannot have high speed with low heat or low speed with high heat, only high heat with high speed or low heat with low speed etc.</li>
            <li>Fabulous little dryer will never go back to another type.</li>
            <li>It has a little red light, almost like a night light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I ordered a new one the same as I had but improved.  </li>
            <li>This is the 2nd new Jerdon  </li>
            <li>Wish I had it years ago,saves so much time,I can have my hair dry in the time it takes to get the others out of the drawer.</li>
            <li>but it seems that only the low setting is of a speed that is not too high to use!  </li>
            <li>I will buy no other.</li>
            <li>I like how this particular brand hide extra wire length by wrapping within the back of the fixture before mounting to the wall.</li>
            <li>This is the second jerdon I purchased mainly because I wanted to keep the same holes in the wall.</li>
            <li>My old unit works great, but latch was starting to fail and handset would fall when traveling, creating possibilities of damage to other parts of bath.  </li>
            <li>The dryer doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting, only high, med, and low, plus the electrical cord</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also as loud as you would expect from regular hair dryers.    </li>
            <li>The GFI feature apparently malfunctioned so you can&#x27;t reset the button and get power to the unit.  </li>
            <li>Ours lasted only a couple weeks until one of the tabs broke off completely.  </li>
            <li>I had one of these hairdryers for several years and had to get another when the old one quit.  </li>
            <li>It performed well until about a month ago when I burned it out by putting it on high and using it to dry inside a sweatshirt, where it couldn&#x27;t get enought air flow.  </li>
            <li>I ordered two more this time based on, in my opinion, the short length of time before failure only because my wife likes it.</li>
            <li>This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve had the first one last for quite a few years highly recommend</li>
            <li>The first one lasted less than a year</li>
            <li>The first had a slight problem with hanging it up and this one seems to have a problem with connecting on the switch</li>
            <li>The hairdryer comes straight in and out, so not a left-handed or right-handed dryer (unlike the other that I purchased).      </li>
            <li>Only minor problem is when putting it back in the holder, it sometimes wants to turn itself back on, and you have to shut it off again.</li>
            <li>The 2 previous ones (from different manufacturers) only had low speed with very low heat and high speed with very high heat.  </li>
            <li>I love that it goes on the wall, has cording just long enough to reach the outlet, and yet long enough for me to dry my hair upside down if I want.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought they were both DEAD</li>
            <li>In fact, the dryer is so hot, it CAUGHT ON FIRE after we owned it less than a year!    </li>
            <li>This is our third drier, the first lasted about 10 years, the second less than one year.</li>
            <li>however the air is only lukewarm and does not dry all that well.  </li>
            <li>It is very loud, and I expected three heat settings.  </li>
            <li>This is because if you are right-handed, you usually hold the drier in your left hand and the brush in your right hand.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not hot enough on high.  </li>
            <li>I have short, thick, coarse hair and it dries it quickly.</li>
            <li>The only thing that seems a little strange in my home bathroom (rather than a hotel) is that \\&quot;First Class\\&quot; is printed on the handle (as can be seen in the photo).</li>
            <li>It has a very short cord that runs to the outlet which can be good for some and bad for others.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> LOVE!!</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> After years of having my hair dryer clutter up the vanity, I now have a very nice dryer attached to the wall.  </li>
            <li> Very handy.</li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> I have one in each of our bathrooms and are very handy and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li> Very Handy.</li>
            <li> This item is very handy because you don&#x27;t have to have a cord and dryer on the counter or put it in a cabinet when you&#x27;re done.  </li>
            <li> She loved it and it does a great job drying</li>
            <li> Great product, good price.</li>
            <li> This product was easy to mount on the wall and works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> The best part is easy access since it it is attached to wall by my sink.</li>
            <li> It hangs easily and is one of the best dryers we have owned!</li>
            <li> Good value for the $$.</li>
            <li> The cord was fairly short--and could be shortened by winding inside the wall mount, which we did.   </li>
            <li> It is a good dryer for the cost</li>
            <li> I saw this at my sister in laws, she has one in each bathroom and loved it.</li>
            <li> My husband took it apart and the cord inside was black,not good.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve owned one of these before and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Install it once (took 5 minutes) and it&#x27;s good to go.  </li>
            <li> The price was fair and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> and I loved it.  </li>
            <li> Is it not as good as the $50 model we have but for $20 and hangs on the wall</li>
            <li> This is a good solution when you want a wall mounted hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a good quality product.  </li>
            <li> One good deal.</li>
            <li> The ProVersa unit fit perfectly on the existing wall mount, so I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I loved it...while it worked.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mounted in the guest bathroom and everyone who has stayed with us have commented how great it is and how nice it looks.</li>
            <li> its a good hair dryer</li>
            <li> I think everyone should have one--good looks and good power.  </li>
            <li> I was gone a good portion of that time, as I&#x27;m often out of town for work, and I just returned from about 10 days out of town.</li>
            <li> arrived good, after 6 months in used, broked......  </li>
            <li> Easy to install and works real nice with lots of air for drying your hair.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and a great space saver.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product and with Amazon&#x27;s system.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> , we are very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the service and response that I have received using Amazon.</li>
            <li> We are very pleased with this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I may try one more as I have a friend who has had one for 6 years and it still runs great.  </li>
            <li> great product have used these fo many years and although style has changed still works as well would recomend to others</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and is so convenient to have right on the bathroom wall.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps not as fancy as the more exspensive units, but for the most part it is very good .I</li>
            <li> good product, very easy to install.</li>
            <li> Buy more than one, and give as a gift !</li>
            <li> It might&#x27;ve been best using some heat to weaken the flap first.</li>
            <li> love it !</li>
            <li> Abolutely love this!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and now I have a lot more counter space!</li>
            <li> works great, was easy to install - i love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to install and works great.</li>
            <li> It is a good design, but the quality could be better when it comes to that fan.  </li>
            <li> The hairdryer is attached to the wall-mount and has its own cord from the wall-mount to the hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> and I really liked it</li>
            <li> It mounts nicely out of the way.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always handy.  </li>
            <li> Never in the way since it has it&#x27;s own place.</li>
            <li> Nice touch is the removable screen that catches air born dust.</li>
            <li> wish the coiled cord is longer and it would have been nice if it had a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; air shot in addition to hot/warm air settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very powerful and works great.  </li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!!</li>
            <li> Easy to get in and out of the holder and SUPER handy to install!!</li>
            <li> Amazon C/S was great to look up measurements for me to make sure it would fit in the space we had.  </li>
            <li> It was just what I needed, got here quick, and works great.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is very easy to install.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to mount on the wall.</li>
            <li> The unit is very easy to install.  </li>
            <li> Jerdon 1600 was by far the best choice for me.  </li>
            <li> Loved the wall mount design, as well as the light weight of the dryer -</li>
            <li> So far this dryer is working great!  </li>
            <li> Puts out pretty good heat and a good amount of air.</li>
            <li> It worked great, and I knew right then that I needed one of these.  </li>
            <li> It is however compact and attractive enough to have as a wall mount, and it is great for overnight guests.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Replacement for the first one, which had the fan blade fly apart during use.  </li>
            <li> Great product, price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Amazon was great about refunding my money quickly, and I have been happy again with the new version of Oster/Sunbeam, which has two speeds and two wattage settings.  </li>
            <li> It burned out but we liked the style and easy of use</li>
            <li> I liked it because it was easy to install on the wall.</li>
            <li> Nice hair dryer, mounted on the wall, clearing counter space and easily acceptable.  </li>
            <li> love this dryer I put in our 5th wheel  and its so handy where we put it and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Amazon was great refunding my money as I certainly didn&#x27;t want a replacement.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit noisy but the air volume and heat make it worthwhile</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I selected this one.  </li>
            <li> Today, there is more room on the counter with the dryer safe on the wall.  </li>
            <li> This may make more sense if you read about dryer #2 below.     </li>
            <li> While I love the convenience of this dryer mounted to the wall, which is why I bought it, it lacks power.  </li>
            <li> I love the Jerdon 1600W wall hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I deduct one more star (3 stars now).</li>
            <li> The company shipped it fast and all transactions have been great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll replace it under warranty, but why would I spend $10 in shipping for a $20 product to get what would probably be a refurbished model?</li>
            <li> guests love them</li>
            <li> Thank you for being such a great seller!</li>
            <li> I purchased this model hoping for more power.  </li>
            <li> I love the convenience of a walled mounted hair dryer .</li>
            <li> This hair-dryer has more watts, so more power.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the convenience  of the wall hanging.  </li>
            <li> My latest \\&quot;Jerdon\\&quot; stopped working after 6 months.</li>
            <li> They both came in a most timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Both appropriately matched.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer.</li>
            <li> Have one in every bathroom and gifted one to my daughter.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> daily use... worked great!  </li>
            <li> love this unit : )  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also pleased with my business with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought one for home and one for vacation home..</li>
            <li> and I am satisfied every  time.  </li>
            <li> I used a Sunbeam wall-mount dryer for many years.</li>
            <li> I have owned one for many years, so when the fan went out I bought another one.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of not having a dryer in a drawer or on a counter.  </li>
            <li> I could not find one in the local stores and found the best price on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this wall caddy hair dryer.</li>
            <li> My wife used one in a motel (Holiday Inn Express and fell in love with this.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love the item.  </li>
            <li> 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> We love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> , i would not recomend this dryer to any one go for the sumbeam/oster a much better product</li>
            <li> It seems to leak from the plastic ring around the top.  </li>
            <li> You will love this product.</li>
            <li> Love that part.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I love the wall mount feature.  </li>
            <li> Trust me when I say you will enjoy!</li>
            <li> We have not found a wall-mount dryer that works better or lasts longer than this one.  </li>
            <li> OK, it&#x27;s just a hair dryer</li>
            <li> Yes, I love it.  </li>
            <li> This unit is even better than the ones we&#x27;ve used at hotels.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I love the wall mount hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> I have bought these as gifts and people just love them.  </li>
            <li> I love the wall mount feature, it doesnt take up space.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> so i was able to use all settings as needed.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> FOR MANY YEARS.</li>
            <li> Convenient to have on the wall and quality is OK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fully satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> We liked its clean and symmetric design better than its competitors.  </li>
            <li> Keeps counter space clean, but yet the dryer is handy to use.</li>
            <li> but I still have my hair dryer from college that works beautifully (although a bit bulky) and its 30 years old.</li>
            <li> I think they are of pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> Right, but the great thing about this dryer is it not only works great, it neatly hangs on the wall out of the way.</li>
            <li> When I switch to the high setting I get very warm air</li>
            <li> (except for some kind of mild plastic/silicone smell)     </li>
            <li> A perfect fit for my short hair.</li>
            <li> These hair dryers look great, are easy to mount, and are well-designed -- repeated grabbing and replacing the blower section has no effect and these units still look new.  </li>
            <li> Cheap plastic fan blade where metal would be much better.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to have found this to replace an old burnt out</li>
            <li> Was so glad they were still available as my family loves this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it is available whenever you need to use it</li>
            <li> I love this light weight hair dryer that has lots of power.</li>
            <li> but I like the clutter free counter top in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> They blow nicely warmed air and are quite powerful, despite their petite size.  </li>
            <li> The wife loved the one i have in my bathroom so much that i ordered this one for her bathroom</li>
            <li> Nice and powerful, strong wall anchoring</li>
            <li> The temperature settings are easy to select and change.</li>
            <li> More powerful and much better priced</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact and easy to install on the wall.</li>
            <li> It was easy to install and will be easy to replace hair dryer</li>
            <li> It drys my hair super fast, light weight, is up and out of the way,  and a great price.  </li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly...</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Mounting is quite easy, and it frees up counter/drawer space.  </li>
            <li> Insertion into and release from wall mount easy.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to find a place for it.</li>
            <li> So easy and so reliable.</li>
            <li> Easy access,</li>
            <li> The lint screen is detachable for easy cleaning and there is a wall mount.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and hangs on the wall out of the way.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> So easy to use, so convenient, so out of the way.</li>
            <li> I like  the easy access of the dryer hanging on the wall rather than stored in the vanity drawer.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it&#x27;s easy to install.</li>
            <li> Mounting is easy and just plug it in.</li>
            <li> It is easy to hang, easy to use and now has three speeds.</li>
            <li> liked it so much that we purchased two more as replacements in case</li>
            <li> This works well and is easy to use,</li>
            <li> AFTER 4 YEARS ITS STILL GOING STRONG</li>
            <li> but were just not as strong as this unit</li>
            <li> I liked it when it worked, but now it doesn&#x27;t have very much power.</li>
            <li> I could only ever have a wall mount which is very handy and safe.</li>
            <li> It is so handy and ready to go when ever we need to use it!</li>
            <li> The end result looks pretty nice</li>
            <li> Most importantly (to me) the bathroom looks clean and uncluttered and I can use the countertop once again.  </li>
            <li> I had one of these for a number of years and loved it, However the new one I just purchased broke within one week.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it should work fine.</li>
            <li> However, the medium setting is cooler and works fine for me.</li>
            <li> Both units are fine and show no sign of loosening.</li>
            <li> Does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> The style is fine.</li>
            <li> I bought a new one and it fit the old bracket on the wall just perfect.  </li>
            <li> No problem with anything else, just that cheap plastic fan blade, in my case anyway.</li>
            <li> This is the second one that I have and it works great.</li>
            <li> It is light weight for her to use.</li>
            <li> fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I had happily used a Oster/Sunbeam wall mount dryer for several years.  </li>
            <li> A wall dryer is a great convenience, but only if you buy a product which is reliable.</li>
            <li> The product looks perfect when it comes, have it mounted on the wall immediately and had no problem using it everyday.</li>
            <li> Cheap and works well for someone who just dries hair with it.  </li>
            <li> It was mounted in an upstairs bathroom and lightly used.</li>
            <li> I like this unit because it&#x27;s fairly easy to mount on wall and run the power wire inside the wall.&lt;br /&gt;Result clean hotel appearance with no plug wire</li>
            <li> This one fit on the existing bracket.</li>
            <li> These tabs are so flimsy that they do not maintain the spacing to fit into both tabs.  </li>
            <li> would like it replaced for free....</li>
            <li> design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to unlatch and latch securely to the wall mount.</li>
            <li> Some units also come with a night light built in.</li>
            <li> Great for smaller bathrooms!!</li>
            <li> Happy female family with this.</li>
            <li> This item seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The parts sound like they are grinding together.</li>
            <li> feels cheap in the hand.</li>
            <li> &quot; It&#x27;s good enough for kids and most adults.</li>
            <li> The replaced hairdryer is working so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good, have owned this for a month.</li>
            <li> At any rate, great service and a very economical price considering the logevity of the units with proper care and cleaning of the filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> + per year!)we were very pleased with the longevity and the features of the unit, and are buying a new one as a replacement.</li>
            <li> Very powerful for its size</li>
            <li> Very powerful and compact.</li>
            <li> It Looks like the Sunbeam 1200 model that we have had forever, &amp; that is found in most hotel rooms, but not near as good.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it arrived and it works just as good as the first one.  </li>
            <li> very easy to install and works very well,</li>
            <li> These are well worth the price!</li>
            <li> They look great and work well as long as they work.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job of making my lazy crew cut stand up.</li>
            <li> The wall mount keeps it out of the way, but readily accessible when needed.  </li>
            <li> It burned out yesterday, January 31, 2013 (significant note,</li>
            <li> Out of the way when not in use, easy and powerful.</li>
            <li> Web site description adequate and accurate.</li>
            <li> We do clean the filter regularly---they still burn out in 12 to 18 months--</li>
            <li> Design is clean and I like it.</li>
            <li> It is handy, but VERY loud.</li>
            <li> was easy - it just slipped right onto the original bracket.  </li>
            <li> I loved being able to push it back onto the wall without stopping to turn it off first.  </li>
            <li> So far I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the screw provided instead by special drywall screws</li>
            <li> But this time, I&#x27;ll do the right thing and get the 1632 instead!</li>
            <li> yet right there when you need it!</li>
            <li> My husband was more than happy to install this (a couple of screws) since it meant no more hair dryers laying on the bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> We both liked it so much that he even suggested that I go ahead and buy another one and have it on hand for when the first one wore out.  </li>
            <li> Love this for organization, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Overall rating, Good</li>
            <li> After reading mixed reviews on this product I decided to take a chance since the price seemed good.  </li>
            <li> We had one of these for years, replaced it with a different design, but returned to this one because it&#x27;s just a superior</li>
            <li> Got it fast and have enjoyed it</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 6-7 years ago at a local store and loved it.  </li>
            <li> My last one, also a wall mount, lasted a good five years.</li>
            <li> heat settings are good enough.  </li>
            <li> It works good,it is easy to use, and looks better than the old one.  </li>
            <li> Attached it to the wall easily and found it to work exactly as we wanted.</li>
            <li> The wall mounted hairdryers (2) arrived very quick and were exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what I wanted it to do and easy to mount on the wall.  </li>
            <li> Added bonus - more wattage with the new one!</li>
            <li> I continued to use it for a few more months until it croaked for good.    </li>
            <li> Installed quickly as well.</li>
            <li> On the MED setting it does have more velocity than my older model</li>
            <li> The hair dryers that I ordered were exactly what I was looking for and their description and picture was precise.</li>
            <li> the time period to return it expired on January 31); it would not blow and the element burnt very hot.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product: easy installation, lasting quality and a good price.</li>
            <li> I like the wall mount hair dryers and will gladly buy a new one of these every two-three years.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and the force of the hot air dries my hair very fast.</li>
            <li> The first one we bought was a Sunbeam, in 2000, and it lasted us until September 2010!  </li>
            <li> This thing is HOT!</li>
            <li> I think this is the machine that was originally made for Sunbeam/Oster and was used in lots of hotel rooms, which is where I first saw one years ago....</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it seems that the new model is quite a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li> Great for a tight situation.</li>
            <li> This is a great little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> These little dryers are just great in my room and the guest room.</li>
            <li> great little hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Great little dryer.  </li>
            <li> We ordered 3 more because the remaining two of the orignal units MAY finally quit, although they seem to be doing just fine.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy my Jerdon wall mount hair dryer and would recommend it very highly.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: It&#x27;s now been 9 months since I purchased and installed these in our rental home, and they still, after heavy usage, work great.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had our Jerdon 1600 for a few months now and it still works great.</li>
            <li> It only had one speed in the end, but it looks much better than most of the wall mount driers out there, and it provides a reasonable bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as I remember or as powerful as the hand held 1600 watt I have.</li>
            <li> We have used the old one lots and have been perfectly satisfied</li>
            <li> but overall it is a nice machine-lots of power.  </li>
            <li> It has lots of power for no bigger than it is and just a nice addition to my bathroom, convenient but out of the way also.</li>
            <li> Hey, for twenty bucks I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> , that was the same kind, so I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a convenient and effective hairdryer that will serve well.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is powerful for it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li> Handy to see your way into the bathroom in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> The medium and high settings are too strong a speed for me to</li>
            <li> Had the first one for many years and now replacing it with new one.</li>
            <li> We own five vacation homes in the Orlando, area right outside Walt Disney World.  </li>
            <li> Dries super fast!  </li>
            <li> Despite sometimes heavy usage, this one has met our needs very nicely.  </li>
            <li> And the other for our friends that loved the convience.  </li>
            <li> I must unpluged the power cord right away.</li>
            <li> They are right on target with price and shipment.</li>
            <li> Always  Right  there  </li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> The first choice is far better quality.  </li>
            <li> It never fails to operate, is effective, and simple to use.  </li>
            <li> I might not be satisfied, as some previous reviewers seem to feel, but for my everyday usage it is perfect.  </li>
            <li> Great way to save counter space, well constucted hair dryer, high speed is fast and hot, makes for a quick dry.</li>
            <li> After the first exact same model stopped working after 18 months, I bought another since my wife liked the style.</li>
            <li> And the blower on the high setting is very powerful.  </li>
            <li> Kind of strange.</li>
            <li> This is a great little unit and much nicer than it&#x27;s predecessor.</li>
            <li> My previous Jerdon dryer had a night light which I miss on this one, but wouldn&#x27;t give a good hair dryer up simply for a night light.      </li>
            <li> Found the dryer we wanted, paid a reasonable price , and received it quickly.</li>
            <li> It was reasonably priced, and quickly shipped.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more powerful than the larger, bulkier dryer we did have</li>
            <li> Very nice for a small space.</li>
            <li> showing.&lt;br /&gt;Several people have commented on the clean mounting and high end look when installed this</li>
            <li> I love them mounted right next to the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> When the new one came, it fit the bracket exactly as the first.  </li>
            <li> Jerdon was no longer manufacturing them when the original one went out (also to avoid putting new holes in the wall).</li>
            <li> The wall-mount installation was extremely easy, since I was able to reuse the metal mounting plate from my previous blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> When I first purchased this hair blower, I had doubts as the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> The airflow is quite high and quite warm on all settings except low.</li>
            <li> The cord now goes from the mount to the first plug in.  </li>
            <li> But this does make me weary of its quality, and that more things may break later on.</li>
            <li> I think the first one lasted 2 years and this one just died after 2 years.</li>
            <li> To my surprise it is $10 more today than it was back in 2011.</li>
            <li> and I am not sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have used a wall mounted hair blower for over 20 years, the first being one made by Sears &amp; then an Oster (I still use this one.)    </li>
            <li> The Sears &amp; Oster are better made but look very similar to the Jerdon.  </li>
            <li> The first one sent by Amazon had a defective button so they immediately replaced it.    </li>
            <li> This one also doesn&#x27;t get so hot that it dries my hair out.</li>
            <li> The hairdryer fits exactly on the wall-mount that we installed for our Sears hair-dryer.  </li>
            <li> I bought our first Jerdon 1600W wall mount 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li> First bought a Jerdon wall mount about two years ago.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased the Wall Mount hair dryer for our 5th wheel, and since I have installed them in two bathrooms in our home,    </li>
            <li> After install it&#x27;s very convienent, too!</li>
            <li> My first Jerdon hair dryer lasted 10 years and we used it every day.  </li>
            <li> and I see why I bought it in the first place.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to do, and I like it.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the curly cord from the unit to handle is way to short - will not reach more than 2 1/2 feet</li>
            <li> Needed 2 more for second home.</li>
            <li> The only thing that some people might like better is the heat level.</li>
            <li> The first lasted about 6 years until the speed/Temperatue switch in the handle burned out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brand of wall hair dryer for many years and recently bought this one for a vacation home bath.  </li>
            <li> As for durability:  the first one I bought lasted about 6-7 years before I had to replace it.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted over 6 yrs.  </li>
            <li> The actual unit seems OK but we consider the mount a no go and would not buy this item again.</li>
            <li> I had an electrician come the next day to make sure it was not my electric outlet or circuits</li>
            <li> First one lasted&lt;br /&gt;over</li>
            <li> but leakes as you try to pour the coffee from the pot when it is hot.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 more , 1 to replace the bathrooms that was used by 4 girls constantly!!</li>
            <li> And the dim night light is a bonus.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted 8 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 2-3 years now, and exactly what I wanted for vanity and not take up counter space.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to have someone hold the dryer mount on the wall so you can hold it and use it as if drying your hair to make sure it is in the proper place and you will never look at drying your hair in the same way!  </li>
            <li> I probably do not need all this power, but there is a low setting so that makes it better.  </li>
            <li> Within 12 months the first one died.  </li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be used as hot as I wished.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer is exactly what we&#x27;ve been looking for and this is the only place we were able to find it.  </li>
            <li> We purchased the first Jerdon wall mount dryer about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Love it because it is conveniently wall mounted and has just enough power and choice of heat settings for my hair.</li>
            <li> It is too noisy when you go to the higher speeds.</li>
            <li> I am still keeping this and not using the higher speeds.</li>
            <li> 9 years ago we bought 3 of these units (one for each bath room) and we are just now having to replace the first one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same as the one I had used for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient, easy to use, powerful enough, and doesn&#x27;t add clutter the countetops.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had the dryer installed for less than a month, but so far it is working great.  </li>
            <li> design is ugly, cord to electic outlet is great lenght, heat settings are fine, setting for blowing are fine</li>
            <li> Ample settings... gets hot which I like... blows strong enough...</li>
            <li> The catches that clip in the handset part don&#x27;t latch positively like the Sunbeam did.</li>
            <li> A long time ago, this dryer was in a favorite hotel chain.  </li>
            <li> The double buttons make it easy to use, too.</li>
            <li> It still worked and I was able to dry my hair</li>
            <li> Easy to set up and simple to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to install and very solid against the wall.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to order, and the shipping time was short.  </li>
            <li> It is also very, very noisy on the high setting.  </li>
            <li> I installed it shortly after and it worked fine for about 10 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Drys hair in little time and handles nicely.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a clean boxy look instead of the usual elongated hair dryer shape and that looks better on my wall as well.</li>
            <li> First it quit working on high</li>
            <li> It is very loud, hence the start deduction, but I have fine hair that dries quickly, so don&#x27;t have to hear it for very long.</li>
            <li> May be a little noisy, but is powerful, on-off switch and holder are convenient, and the night light feature is useful.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my wife will be happy with it and forgive the few extra holes in the bathroom wall from repositioning.</li>
            <li> and really does the job.</li>
            <li> Very neat.  </li>
            <li> The reason I have not retured it is because the postage cost would be so much.</li>
            <li> I really like the three speeds .</li>
            <li> It very convenient and compact.</li>
            <li> Thanks heaven that it&#x27;s within 30 days and Amazon provide an overnight shipping of a replacement.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t feel it was so short that I couldn&#x27;t comfortably stand away from the dryer to be in front of the mirror.</li>
            <li> However it did not have as much air velocity as I wanted.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets dryer much quicker.  </li>
            <li> Very convienient.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> The earlier model also had a built in night light which this one does not, to my disapointment.    </li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this.</li>
            <li> This item has a wall mount with two flimsy plastic tabs that must fit into slots as the unit is put back into the wall mount.  </li>
            <li> It does have coils that stretch out and hasn&#x27;t really been a problem.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> It is wall mounted which makes it very convenient.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> SO  very  convenient,  </li>
            <li> ,  Ready  </li>
            <li> Ready to use at anytime without have to untangle cords or put it away.</li>
            <li> My hand held dryer never made that much noise,</li>
            <li> The unit is always ready to use and it doesn&#x27;t take up space.</li>
            <li> Always plugged in and ready to go.</li>
            <li> Click and it is ready to use and click it is put away.</li>
            <li> I really like having the wall mount design</li>
            <li> When it was finially installed, it worked very well.</li>
            <li> It fits my space very well</li>
            <li> We bought this for our rental property and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> but I wonder if it really is putting out 1600w at max.  </li>
            <li> IT FITS MY SPACE VERY WELL AND OPERATES VERY SATISFACTORILY.</li>
            <li> /&gt;THE VERY AFFORDABLE PRICE.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Nice unit, give it five stars if it would just last longer in daily use.</li>
            <li> Be sure to have near plug in as the cord is short.  </li>
            <li> Those three heat settings each had their own speeds, low for low heat, med.</li>
            <li> wife also has one of the aforementioned original models, but only uses it for her hair, and it continues to work just fine.</li>
            <li> By the time I was able to get on line the end of February (because of personal issues) to find out how to return it, it was too late to get free shipping and a full refund, so</li>
            <li> We decided to buy an exact replacement unit since we really like the design and performance, but for a hotel-style unit I would expect more robust build quality for such a critical component.</li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;s my hair fast and mounts easily.</li>
            <li> I just bought three more, one for work (I am a barber) one for my other bathroom and a spare.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the other Jerdon 1600W dryer that Amazon sells at $34.95 is any better(?).</li>
            <li> - in fact better than some of my other &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> The medium and high settings for heat are both on very high speeds.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> guess is the ability to mount as I did somehow has justified the pricing to seller, but does it?&lt;br /&gt;If unit were 20% less costly would have given 5 Stars.&lt;br /&gt;There are better hair dryers out there for the same cost, but I wanted one I could neatly mount on wall.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, medium thickness, and is long</li>
            <li> It can fit in small spaces leaving the bath counter free for our guests.</li>
            <li> So far so good on the second one, which has been used daily for for a month so far.  </li>
            <li> Kind of pointless purchase now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to just slip the new one on the old bracket, which is much easier than mounting a new bracket for a different hair</li>
            <li> Works well, replaced an older Jerdon wall mount that died.</li>
            <li> Changed my rating because I had more problems with this 2nd one and only lasted 6 months.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed getting my hairdryer off the countertop, but I&#x27;ll have to do it with a different brand in the future.</li>
            <li> is most likely chinese made as well</li>
            <li> I bought an older version some years ago after using one in a hotel.</li>
            <li> This product came to me already broken and is make of many cheap plastic parts.  </li>
            <li> installed this product mainly to save the space,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I had this particular hairdryer before and it had gotten broke.</li>
            <li> But she has mentioned several times that she finds this particular product noisier than she liked or expected.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> High heat setting is practically automatic (don&#x27;t have to wait for it to heat up).  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recomend this hair blower</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone for your home or rental property.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> for med heat and high for high heat</li>
            <li> It does but the heat settings are fixed to certain speeds.</li>
            <li> I love this little blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought one of these for the convenience of a wall mounted, smallish dryer powerful enough to dry my and my wife&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Not too bad, not too great!  </li>
            <li> The product works very well and is priced modestly.  </li>
            <li> I made the repair because it was more trouble to reship to the product company.</li>
            <li> It was heavily used by my teen daughter and, under those circumstances, lasting 5 years is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It works better than my normal heavy duty 1875</li>
            <li> I suggest spending a few more bucks and getting a quality item.</li>
            <li> Have had it a few months now and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Not fantastic, just OK, but the&lt;br /&gt;price dictates that.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t give it five stars because the cord is too short if you are right handed and need to install it on a right-hand wall (or if you are left-handed and want to install it on the left-hand wall).  </li>
            <li> Since I now have one for parts other than the fan, and the hair dryer fit</li>
            <li> I like a wall mount because it leaves my counter free for other items.  </li>
            <li> I can imagine folks with thick and long hair requiring more blow power, will want to consider other models that are more powerful.</li>
            <li> I have had goldfish live longer.</li>
            <li> I hope they still make them when the new one stops working.  </li>
            <li> This new version adds a removable screen on the air intake for cleaning and the GFI is incorporated inside the unit rather than at the plug.</li>
            <li> so I ordered this new version.</li>
            <li> with a new one....not a re-serviced one....</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;anxiously waiting for the new one.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll be looking for a new one.</li>
            <li> They look very nice, the only draw back is they only last a few years, but that is the same with most hair dryers.</li>
            <li> I never thought of actually owning one in my own home until I visited my sister a few years ago, and she had this one mounted on her guest bathroom wall.  </li>
            <li> This unit began to self destruct this morning discharging internal shrapnal and vibrating while releasing a death sound.&lt;br /&gt;Despite being treated with the utmost respect it will join the pile of cheap Chinese junk I have accumulated over the years</li>
            <li> so we expect the same performance from this new unit, also, the new one looks so much better, 10yr old hair dryers loose their looks too.  </li>
            <li> It is very loud.</li>
            <li> use.&lt;br /&gt;This unit replaced a very old one that was a Sears.  </li>
            <li> The only difference is that the new one is noisier than the first one.  </li>
            <li> It is the only dryer I have used that has both a low and a high fan volume on the cool setting in addition to the heat settings.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> On Feb 1 of 2006 this dryer sent out sparks and the coils inside were red hot.  </li>
            <li> exact replacement for one I had that finally died.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love the fact that it is so small hanging on the wall and out of the way.</li>
            <li> for a wall unit its pretty good.this is the only my wife</li>
            <li> Well, about 6 1/2 years later, the first one stopped working - after warning us with a burning smell.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the Sunbeam one and even used same mounting plate already on the wall.</li>
            <li> Fortunately my wife figured out how to press the panic button and shut them down.</li>
            <li> Drying is quick, and the only criticism I have for this appliance is that it is quite loud, especially on its Medium &amp; High settings.</li>
            <li> Once I placed the new one on the old plate</li>
            <li> When the first one broke my wife had to go back to the bulky old one she had until I found this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It works great, lots of power, dried my hair quickly - and that&#x27;s saying something since my hair is usually slow to dry.</li>
            <li> Medium and high heat settings are on high speed only.</li>
            <li> Keeps bathroom neat and counter clear.</li>
            <li> wanted far too much  for the same item.      </li>
            <li> is very short and you must install it very close to the outlet.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a direct replacement of the unit mounted in my motorhome from factory.  </li>
            <li> This is a direct replacement even though the motorhome is 10 years old.  </li>
            <li> we decide to order the same unit again, thanks</li>
            <li> I will probably reinstall the old one.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted a long time</li>
            <li> so when my old hair dryer quit working</li>
            <li> It sparked then stopped completely.</li>
            <li> Paid twice this price for my old one.</li>
            <li> Had to order one for a friend after she saw my old one.</li>
            <li> Just over a year old</li>
            <li> na last much longer&amp;#34</li>
            <li> So far it is just like the old one, but with improvements.</li>
            <li> Lovin&#x27; it so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stuck with these after doing a modified direct wire job in the bathrooms.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace an old wall-mount hairdryer that I had used for 15+ years until it just stopped working one day.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it needs to be so loud.  </li>
            <li> Have used this dryer in hotels and when my old dryer died, I purchased this one.  </li>
            <li> This slid onto the attachment I had on my wall, so it was a seamless transition.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an old Sunbeam that burned out.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these and installed 1 so far.  </li>
            <li> and this is powerful enough for daily use.  </li>
            <li> Given how long previous hair dryers have lasted, we were pleased with that life</li>
            <li> My bathromm is small and I like it hanging on the wall within easy reach since I have no drawer space.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, easy to use</li>
            <li> I have severe arthritis and like how much power is available in such a small, lightweight, wall mountable unit.</li>
            <li> Very similar if not almost the same exact thing as an old Sunbeam I had for years.</li>
            <li> Most seem to last only half that time.</li>
            <li> Only the low heat switch of the hairdryer was burned out the first time I turned it on.  </li>
            <li> Fearing that they might have ruined the classic model, I bought this one instead because it looked in the picture like the former Sunbeam design.    </li>
            <li> It is the only dryer I have been able to find that fits the small space on my bathroom wall</li>
            <li> Purchased to replace an older model that finally died.  </li>
            <li> low, med, and high and</li>
            <li> If I had paid a little more and bought locally, I would have gotten my money back or another item.</li>
            <li> It is easy to install; I put it next to my bathroom vanity mirror with the outlet just a few inches away.</li>
            <li> It is VERY noisy, but you don&#x27;t have to have it on as long, so I guess it evens out the pros and the cons.</li>
            <li> I owned a Jerdon 1600W wall-mount dryer for 4 years till it finally died of every day normal usage.</li>
            <li> I live the various speeds: low, med, high.</li>
            <li> Not hard to install and is solidly mounted in holder.</li>
            <li> You cannot have high speed with low heat or low speed with high heat, only high heat with high speed or low heat with low speed etc.</li>
            <li> Fabulous little dryer will never go back to another type.</li>
            <li> It has a little red light, almost like a night light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I ordered a new one the same as I had but improved.  </li>
            <li> This is the 2nd new Jerdon  </li>
            <li> Wish I had it years ago,saves so much time,I can have my hair dry in the time it takes to get the others out of the drawer.</li>
            <li> but it seems that only the low setting is of a speed that is not too high to use!  </li>
            <li> I will buy no other.</li>
            <li> I like how this particular brand hide extra wire length by wrapping within the back of the fixture before mounting to the wall.</li>
            <li> This is the second jerdon I purchased mainly because I wanted to keep the same holes in the wall.</li>
            <li> My old unit works great, but latch was starting to fail and handset would fall when traveling, creating possibilities of damage to other parts of bath.  </li>
            <li> The dryer doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting, only high, med, and low, plus the electrical cord</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also as loud as you would expect from regular hair dryers.    </li>
            <li> The GFI feature apparently malfunctioned so you can&#x27;t reset the button and get power to the unit.  </li>
            <li> Ours lasted only a couple weeks until one of the tabs broke off completely.  </li>
            <li> I had one of these hairdryers for several years and had to get another when the old one quit.  </li>
            <li> It performed well until about a month ago when I burned it out by putting it on high and using it to dry inside a sweatshirt, where it couldn&#x27;t get enought air flow.  </li>
            <li> I ordered two more this time based on, in my opinion, the short length of time before failure only because my wife likes it.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve had the first one last for quite a few years highly recommend</li>
            <li> The first one lasted less than a year</li>
            <li> The first had a slight problem with hanging it up and this one seems to have a problem with connecting on the switch</li>
            <li> The hairdryer comes straight in and out, so not a left-handed or right-handed dryer (unlike the other that I purchased).      </li>
            <li> Only minor problem is when putting it back in the holder, it sometimes wants to turn itself back on, and you have to shut it off again.</li>
            <li> The 2 previous ones (from different manufacturers) only had low speed with very low heat and high speed with very high heat.  </li>
            <li> I love that it goes on the wall, has cording just long enough to reach the outlet, and yet long enough for me to dry my hair upside down if I want.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought they were both DEAD</li>
            <li> In fact, the dryer is so hot, it CAUGHT ON FIRE after we owned it less than a year!    </li>
            <li> This is our third drier, the first lasted about 10 years, the second less than one year.</li>
            <li> however the air is only lukewarm and does not dry all that well.  </li>
            <li> It is very loud, and I expected three heat settings.  </li>
            <li> This is because if you are right-handed, you usually hold the drier in your left hand and the brush in your right hand.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not hot enough on high.  </li>
            <li> I have short, thick, coarse hair and it dries it quickly.</li>
            <li> The only thing that seems a little strange in my home bathroom (rather than a hotel) is that \\&quot;First Class\\&quot; is printed on the handle (as can be seen in the photo).</li>
            <li> It has a very short cord that runs to the outlet which can be good for some and bad for others.</li>
            <li> I had the mounting bracket on my newly remodeled bedroom wall that I didn&#x27;t want to take down.  </li>
            <li> The Jerdon is clearly a poor knockoff of the original Sunbeam.</li>
            <li> This is our second wall mount hair dryer and hopefully this brand will last us just as long.</li>
            <li> A few days ago, the switch stopped working for medium and high settings.</li>
            <li> The Jerdon is a little noisy, the reset buttons on the side of the unit are hard to work but the hairblower seems to be working fine.  </li>
            <li> The switch seems really sensitive, unlike the previous one that I had (which was the same brand).  </li>
            <li> I really like having a mounted hair dryer in my small space</li>
            <li> but it took a long time before I actually saw the replacement.</li>
            <li> They seem to work well, but I don&#x27;t know how long they will last, with renters.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Did not last that long had to replace it with another brand.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with unit otherwise but lowered rating due to not being able to change heat and speed settings independently.</li>
            <li> It takes longer to dry my short hair</li>
            <li> It frees up counter space in crowded bathrooms and provides enough air and heat to dry hair.</li>
            <li> Extremely difficult to get the hairdyer to fit back into it&#x27;s holder.</li>
            <li> I hang it near an outlet, tucked in as much cord as I can behind the unit.  </li>
            <li> Power cord is long enough but not too long.</li>
            <li> At the time, the Jerdon 1600W had all good reviews and was one of the least expensive options.  </li>
            <li> The only difference I can see between this new one and that one is a small night lite (that I never used anyway).</li>
            <li> This particular hair dryer takes very little wall space and fits in between the mirror and corner of the wall.    </li>
            <li> I looked at other ones, but decided to go with the same model - installation for the second one</li>
            <li> Will not last forever, but will last as long as any other electronic devices of today.</li>
            <li> For around 18 bucks these powerful dryers are tough.</li>
            <li> way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative side is the cost is high for what is a very basic hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Inconvenient for me but not horrible, and if you don&#x27;t already have the wall mount</li>
            <li> It has a long cord -- but remember that it is also the cord that \\&quot;plugs\\&quot; into the electrical outlet.    </li>
            <li> but the design should long outlast generics</li>
            <li> It is mounted on the bathroom wall, not far from the sink and mirror, and I use it after I shower and wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> My box is long gone in the garbage</li>
            <li> I even bought an extra one for my kids&#x27; bathroom--and you know how kids can be rough.</li>
            <li> We will see how long this one lasts-  </li>
            <li> When it cooled down, only the low setting would work.  </li>
            <li> Only con is the cord from the wall mount to the dryer is a little short and confining.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement hair dryer for us and we purchased the same one when the other quit working.</li>
            <li> the other burned up in a short time.</li>
            <li> This dryer seems to dry my hair a lot faster, but......when doing the sides, it sounds like a jet airplane.  </li>
            <li> so if someone sleeps well you dry hair maybe not for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this brand since the other more expensive brand lasted less than a year and had no warranty.</li>
            <li> I almost always use the high setting, and my hair is dried in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I had a previous version of this hair dryer that lasted several years, then shut off and sparked twice to die!</li>
            <li> Perhaps if I had long, lush , thick hair</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because it is a little noisier that I would like .&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Mine lasted a little over a year...thought it should last longer then</li>
            <li> The dryer only worked for a few days.  </li>
            <li> It is compact and performs as expected.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as I expected it to for the money.  </li>
            <li> the old one broken, it should last longer.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I chose the Jerdon wall mount hair dryer because I had one previously and it lasted a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Typically you are limited to one wall or the other by where the outlets are placed.  </li>
            <li> My granddaughter told me the other day that she needs one of these.  </li>
            <li> There is a separate cord that goes from the wall mount to the hair dryer that is in front of the other cord.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order another for our other bathroom.</li>
            <li> The inner spring popped out and a small plastic tab from the button cracked.</li>
            <li> To save lives of my family, I pull off the other one and don&#x27;t want to use it, also re-call the rest from my friends whom I gave to.</li>
            <li> I suggest you look at other options, which is what I&#x27;m going to do now.</li>
            <li> The other internet  places we looked  </li>
            <li> Noise level comparable to other mfgrs&#x27; units I&#x27;ve used at my gym.</li>
            <li> It is a knockoff that works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Also, I am not able to mount this in studs, so I was concerned that the constant off and on might loosen this unit on the wall.</li>
            <li> I put three of these in a rental and two have held up well, the other one still works but plastic parts</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not quieter than any other hair dryer I owned</li>
            <li> It is difficult to pull the dryer far enough from the wall to reach</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Not powerful</li>
            <li> I even dried 2 small dogs with it regularly.  </li>
            <li> Small enough to be out of the way but plenty of power to dry my thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> It arrived with the rear filter already broken, and it seems less well made than the old Oster.  </li>
            <li> I wrote down the model number and went online to buy one as soon as I returned home.  </li>
            <li> So now we have to take down the plate, repair the wall,</li>
            <li> Has never let me down.</li>
            <li> The cord is a little short and also thick and tight  </li>
            <li> arrived with the retaining spring half off.</li>
            <li> We have had this hairdryer slightly over a month</li>
            <li> No signs of wear and tear or less power or any problems to report.</li>
            <li> My previous wall mounted</li>
            <li> I owned a Jerdon previously and it had worked well.  </li>
            <li> In service less than 1 month so can&#x27;t comment on durability.</li>
            <li> Now the blowdryer is one less thing taking up space in our bathroom</li>
            <li> I bought another brand, and it lasted less than a year.  </li>
            <li> One less thing to pack</li>
            <li> Have purchased previously.</li>
            <li> and I have never had any problems previously.....</li>
            <li> I have used this model before and typically get 2 to 4 years life.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase another one, and in less than a year the motor died.  </li>
            <li> I had hung it on the wall in my bathroom and used it for less than two months.</li>
            <li> I received the hair dryer, installed in on the wall, and had used it less than two months when the blower went out.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed to find this product had no night light.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, after a long cool-down it went back in the box and was returned.  </li>
            <li> Previously I purchased this Hair Dryer and it lasted quite a few years.  </li>
            <li> Previously and they would not fit.  </li>
            <li> It works well plus takes up little space.</li>
            <li> lots of power in this little dryer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s little, but efficient.  </li>
            <li> You first mount a flat metal plate to the wall and then the base unit attaches to that plate.  </li>
            <li> We bought one which lasted 3-1/2 years of fairly tough use from various family members.  </li>
            <li> if you have children or seniors who have difficulty holding heavy dryers for any length of time - this is one of the lightest weight units we found.</li>
            <li> My family has used this product for approximately 8 years - daily - with no problems.  </li>
            <li> motor dead around 5 month</li>
            <li> yes I use it everyday</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has 3 speeds, is compact, and is held in it&#x27;s base securely when not in use.</li>
            <li> When it died, I tried to save a few dollars buying the Jerdon 1600W, partly because I thought it was made by Sunbeam.  </li>
            <li> A few days ago it broke (December 2010)</li>
            <li> Well, I finally got tired of the \\&quot;clutter\\&quot; associated with my wife&#x27;s hair dryer on the bathroom counter and started looking for wall mounted units.  </li>
            <li> This unit overheated and blew out within a few uses.  </li>
            <li> the jerdan dryer has given us a broken switch after just a couple months of use  (has done this with 3 different dryers)</li>
            <li> Bought this item a few years ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure they make coffee pots that don&#x27;t leak down the carafe when pouring the coffee into the cups.  </li>
            <li> Now this is one less hazard that I don&#x27;t have to regret not doing!    </li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer to replace a previous, different brand that was beginning to fail.  </li>
            <li> Due to a glitch in Amazon&#x27;s computer system, I was unable to complete the return/replacement procedure, so I am stuck with a broken appliance.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a small bathroom so this hair dryer is perfect--it doesn&#x27;t take up any counter space</li>
            <li> To me, this product is no safe at all.</li>
            <li> Used them in hotels in the past.  </li>
            <li> The wall- mounted hairdryer is convenient and a space saver for a small bathroom.    </li>
            <li> small and convenient.  </li>
            <li> I bought two just over a year ago and have had both of them fail after what I think is a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> Compact,not noisy as some small dryers, doesn&#x27;t take up alot of room, always close at hand.  </li>
            <li> Our master bathroom is small which is why I wanted a wall mount.  </li>
            <li> no more looking around trying to find a place for your hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> and it is past my return refund date.</li>
            <li> Not sure why,</li>
            <li> it stays in place well, take up small amount of space, it does make a lot of noise</li>
            <li> small</li>
            <li> We have purchased at least 3 Jerdon wall mount blow dryers in the past few years.  </li>
            <li> The holder broke and now its hard to put in and out of the Wall Mount.</li>
            <li> The one that died needed to be replaced after almost 2 years of hard work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I should have ordered two just in case they stop making this design type... hard to find.</li>
            <li> I hardly used the one that malfunctioned.</li>
            <li> The switch is hard to slide.</li>
            <li> *UPDATE* 1 week into use, inserting dryer back to the base unit seems harder as the plastic pieces on the mounting shell that insert into the dryer&#x27;s handle start to bend.</li>
            <li> This dryer is a piece of junk and should have lasted for a couple years at least.</li>
            <li> Too late to ask for a replacementWill not purchase</li>
            <li> not loving it.</li>
            <li> Takes two hands to insert the dryer back into the holder, which is kinda awkward.</li>
            <li> It drys my thick, medium length,colored hair</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to get the unit back into the mount.  </li>
            <li> The base (i.e. wall-mounted) unit contains the ground fault circuit interrupter, so the cord itself looks just like a normal cord.  </li>
            <li> Although some of the reviews that I saw were less than favorable on this product, I took a chance on it AND LOST!!!  </li>
            <li> thats ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I had to take it off the wall and take it outside as it was smoking so bad.  </li>
            <li> Last one went bad after 6 weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good idea to purchase electrical items on Amazon......</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> Too Bad, I hate all the cheap plastic that are put in products anymore.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> is replace one just like it that was broken.  </li>
            <li> Must be poor quality materials.</li>
            <li> but it is annoying, especially in the morning.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one to replace the broken one,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to take apart to repair because of the odd screws, holding it together.</li>
            <li> the cord from the base to the drier could be a little longer</li>
            <li> because they both failed to start when I pushed the start button.  </li>
            <li> And unfortunately the return/exchange period has passed.     </li>
            <li> The Sears is no longer made and the Oster has a reset on the plug which made it difficult to use in this case.    </li>
            <li> so I am unable to hang it up anymore.</li>
            <li> not impressed with amazon&#x27;s service....</li>
            <li> but so powerfull cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I doubt I&#x27;ll purchase another one from this company.</li>
            <li> Not happy!  </li>
            <li> thats crazy.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, this one will not be disappointing.</li>
            <li> also with that it had a cold blast</li>
            <li> These are not a quality product and are even dangerous.</li>
            <li> No dangling cords, and difficult to drop and break it!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it appears that the company shortened the AC cord as well as the cord from the hand held unit to the wall base itself, requiring me to re position the wall mount.</li>
            <li> We are totally disappointed and just now ordered another brand through Amazon.</li>
            <li> We bought these for a vacation rental and appreciate the fact that the power cord is attached to the base unit and not the hair dryer itself.  </li>
            <li> If it is on when you try to hang it onto the wall base, it automatically flips the switch to the &#x27;off&#x27; position.  </li>
            <li> The length of the plug cord can be adjusted by winding it on the backside of the base unit before sliding the unit onto its mounting plate.  </li>
            <li> Another piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Bad idea!</li>
            <li> So was very disappointed.</li>

            <li> AFTER 4 YEARS ITS STILL GOING STRONG</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 ,they work great!</li>
            <li> Now on our third Jerdon hair drier.  Seem to last a bit over two years with daily use. Very powerful for its size and really does the job. It is a bit noisy but the air volume and heat make it worthwhile I guess. Not hard to install and is solidly mounted in holder. Nice unit, give it five stars if it would just last longer in daily use.</li>
            <li> arrived with the retaining spring half off. I made the repair because it was more trouble to reship to the product company.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a small bathroom so this hair dryer is perfect--it doesn&#x27;t take up any counter space yet it is close at hand.</li>
            <li> This product was easy to mount on the wall and works perfectly.  The temperature settings are easy to select and change.</li>
            <li> Replacement for the first one, which had the fan blade fly apart during use.  Cheap plastic fan blade where metal would be much better.  It was out of warranty, and because I took the case apart to check for the problem, they would neither fix it or sell me the part to repair it.  Since I now have one for parts other than the fan, and the hair dryer fit so well where I had it hung, I went ahead and bought another one.  It is a good design, but the quality could be better when it comes to that fan.  No problem with anything else, just that cheap plastic fan blade, in my case anyway.</li>
            <li> This is a great little hair dryer. They mount on the wall and stay out of the way. They look very nice, the only draw back is they only last a few years, but that is the same with most hair dryers. These are well worth the price!</li>
            <li> We own five vacation homes in the Orlando, area right outside Walt Disney World.  We wanted to mount a hair dryer in every bathroom, but with 4 or 5 bathrooms per home (19 total) we needed to find a sturdy, yet cost-effective model to use.  Despite sometimes heavy usage, this one has met our needs very nicely.  Mark (Owner/Operator of RomancingtheMouse)</li>
            <li> Purchased this Dryer to replace another.  WOW! what a replacement.  More powerful and much better priced then the last one I bought.  I&#x27;m glad I selected this one.  Drys hair in little time and handles nicely.  Would buy another.</li>
            <li> Works well, replaced an older Jerdon wall mount that died. No dangling cords, and difficult to drop and break it!</li>
            <li> A long time ago, this dryer was in a favorite hotel chain.  I loved being able to push it back onto the wall without stopping to turn it off first.  Today, there is more room on the counter with the dryer safe on the wall.  The cord stays out of the sink, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought that the wall-mounted hair dryers in hotel rooms were a great idea.  They don&#x27;t take up space on your bathroom counter, you don&#x27;t have to wrap the cord around and around your hair dryer (which can eventually lead to internal wire damage), and you don&#x27;t have to find a separate place to store it.  I never thought of actually owning one in my own home until I visited my sister a few years ago, and she had this one mounted on her guest bathroom wall.  It worked great, and I knew right then that I needed one of these.  I wrote down the model number and went online to buy one as soon as I returned home.  My husband was more than happy to install this (a couple of screws) since it meant no more hair dryers laying on the bathroom sink.  We both liked it so much that he even suggested that I go ahead and buy another one and have it on hand for when the first one wore out.  My granddaughter told me the other day that she needs one of these.  Guess I know what she&#x27;s getting for Christmas this year.</li>
            <li> I originally bought one of these for the convenience of a wall mounted, smallish dryer powerful enough to dry my and my wife&#x27;s hair. Worked well for a couple of years then it would overheat when my wife used it. \\&quot;Not powerful enough\\&quot; she declared and gave up on it. I continued to use it for a few more months until it croaked for good.    In looking for a replacement, I still determined that my best bet would be to buy an identical model so that I could use the existing wall mount. Unfortunately, it appears that the company shortened the AC cord as well as the cord from the hand held unit to the wall base itself, requiring me to re position the wall mount. Inconvenient for me but not horrible, and if you don&#x27;t already have the wall mount it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.    On the plus side, it seems that the new model is quite a bit more powerful. Perhaps my wife will be happy with it and forgive the few extra holes in the bathroom wall from repositioning. I recommend it. Good value for the $$.</li>
            <li> I bought it in Nov. of 2010 and it expired in July of 2011. I have had goldfish live longer. I was using it and it suddenly started smelling like burning rubber. I immediately turned it off. Now only the low setting works.I have very short hair and it was not used daily. Hmm.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several of these now. They look great and work well as long as they work. The first one lasted less than a year and I got a replacement under warranty - but it took a long time before I actually saw the replacement. The second one has lasted a number of years now. It only had one speed in the end, but it looks much better than most of the wall mount driers out there, and it provides a reasonable bang for the buck. It&#x27;s easy to just slip the new one on the old bracket, which is much easier than mounting a new bracket for a different hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a difference with this one, though. It says Pro Versa on the side and the box makes a promise that I found it doesn&#x27;t deliver. It says &amp;#34;Be a style goddess.&amp;#34; No matter what I do, I&#x27;m still not a style goddess.</li>
            <li> I like the design of the Jerdon Wall Mount Hair Dryer. It&#x27;s compact and easy to install on the wall. The double buttons make it easy to use, too. The cons? The dryer doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting, only high, med, and low, plus the electrical cord is very short and you must install it very close to the outlet.</li>
            <li> Ordered two different wall mount hair dryers so I would have a choice.  Jerdon 1600 was by far the best choice for me.  It was easy to install and will be easy to replace hair dryer if/when it needs replaced.  The cord was fairly short--and could be shortened by winding inside the wall mount, which we did.   The cord now goes from the mount to the first plug in.  Very neat.  The hairdryer comes straight in and out, so not a left-handed or right-handed dryer (unlike the other that I purchased).      Number 1 choice:  This hair dryer has a wall mount and then the cord goes from the bottom of it to the electrical plug in.  There is a separate cord that goes from the wall mount to the hair dryer that is in front of the other cord.  The hairdryer is attached to the wall-mount and has its own cord from the wall-mount to the hairdryer.  One cannot take this hairdryer out and to another room -- it is permanent (which is what I wanted).  This may make more sense if you read about dryer #2 below.     Number 2 choice:  This wall-mount is just that -- it is a holder that is on the wall and the hair-dryer snaps into it.  You can take this hairdryer anywhere -- the wall-mount simply is a holder to snap the hairdryer in.  It has a long cord -- but remember that it is also the cord that \\&quot;plugs\\&quot; into the electrical outlet.    Just depends upon what you want.  The first choice is far better quality.  Also, when you hang it up in the mount, it will automatically turn off.</li>
            <li> While I love the convenience of this dryer mounted to the wall, which is why I bought it, it lacks power.  It is also very, very noisy on the high setting.  There was no warranty either.  If it wasn&#x27;t such a hassle, I&#x27;d try to return it.  It was the cheapest - you get what you pay for sometimes.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was purchased as a Christmas gift to replace one we have had for several years.  I could not locate one locally so I order from Amazon. The dryer only worked for a few days.  Nothing I do will make it work again.  The reason I have not retured it is because the postage cost would be so much.</li>
            <li> I love the Jerdon 1600W wall hair dryer.  This is the second one that I have and it works great.</li>
            <li> This dryer was purchased to replace a like dryer.    I was extremely disappointed to find this product had no night light.</li>
            <li> These were purchased for a vacation home. I wanted something that could be mounted off counter - like in a hotel.  They seem to work well, but I don&#x27;t know how long they will last, with renters. Only time will tell.</li>
            <li> Great price and it works great too.  Keeps bathroom neat and counter clear. It has a very short cord that runs to the outlet which can be good for some and bad for others. I really like the three speeds . I&#x27;m going to order another for our other bathroom.</li>
            <li> this is a great product - i wish i had bought it years ago!  works great, was easy to install - i love it!</li>
            <li> I moved and left my hair dryer so I ordered a new one the same as I had but improved.  It works good,it is easy to use, and looks better than the old one.  Clark</li>
            <li> I bought two of these and they work great.  They blow nicely warmed air and are quite powerful, despite their petite size.  At first I thought they were both DEAD ON ARRIVAL because they both failed to start when I pushed the start button.  But after hitting the \\&quot;reset\\&quot; button on the side of the unit, they both started up and are working great.  But I can&#x27;t give it five stars because the cord is too short if you are right handed and need to install it on a right-hand wall (or if you are left-handed and want to install it on the left-hand wall).  This is because if you are right-handed, you usually hold the drier in your left hand and the brush in your right hand.  The cord is too short when installing on the right-hand wall and holding the drier with your left hand.  Typically you are limited to one wall or the other by where the outlets are placed.  The manufacturer needs to add about 1 foot of cord to get five stars.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works well.  It definitely helps keep clutter off of the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> My husband brought this for me in November and by April it died on me.  It had sparks flying out from it.  It had not over heated, but continued to sparks if turned on.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product and with Amazon&#x27;s system. Found the dryer we wanted, paid a reasonable price , and received it quickly. Attached it to the wall easily and found it to work exactly as we wanted.</li>
            <li> We have had this hairdryer slightly over a month and now it only works at low speed. When it worked, it worked great. But just a month before a problem? Unacceptable at any price.</li>
            <li> We bought one which lasted 3-1/2 years of fairly tough use from various family members.  Loved the wall mount design, as well as the light weight of the dryer - if you have children or seniors who have difficulty holding heavy dryers for any length of time - this is one of the lightest weight units we found. For the price, (We paid about $14.00 for it at the time - so averages out to about $3+ per year!)we were very pleased with the longevity and the features of the unit, and are buying a new one as a replacement. [[ASIN:B0008ENT8I Jerdon 1600W Wall Mount Hair Dryer]]</li>
            <li> My family has used this product for approximately 8 years - daily - with no problems.  I even dried 2 small dogs with it regularly.  My mother in her 70s has one, too. It is light weight for her to use. I no longer have a hair dryer or cord all over the counter. It very convenient and compact. The filaments finally burned out, and I am buying another one.  I hope they still make them when the new one stops working.  I figure it to be a $1.00 a year of value, not to mention convenient - nothing to get out or put away!!!</li>
            <li> fantastic product. I feel like I&#x27;m in a hotel when I shower. The price was incredible also.</li>
            <li> motor dead around 5 month</li>
            <li> I love this little blow dryer.  It drys my hair super fast, light weight, is up and out of the way,  and a great price.  Buy more than one, and give as a gift !</li>
            <li> I received the hair dryer Nov 15 and by the end of January \\&quot;high\\&quot; had totally quit working.  By the time I was able to get on line the end of February (because of personal issues) to find out how to return it, it was too late to get free shipping and a full refund, so guess I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with this purchase.  The profile is slim and looks well to hang on wall.  It has different speeds with pleases me.  Very happy to have purchased this as a replacement  for one I had for years.  Jerdon 1600W Wall Mount Hair Dryer</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used a wall mount hair dryer for years.  The first one we bought was a Sunbeam, in 2000, and it lasted us until September 2010!  This is our second wall mount hair dryer and hopefully this brand will last us just as long.</li>
            <li> I was happy to have found this to replace an old burnt out Jerdon 1600W Wall Mount Hair Dryer I had years ago but it doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as I remember or as powerful as the hand held 1600 watt I have. It takes longer to dry my short hair and it&#x27;s not hot enough on high.  It is however compact and attractive enough to have as a wall mount, and it is great for overnight guests.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product yet as I bought this is replace one just like it that was broken.  Once I placed the new one on the old plate I realized the Jerdon company had shortened the power cord and it&#x27;s too short to reach the outlet.  So now we have to take down the plate, repair the wall, the move it over.</li>
            <li> I had your typical(non-wall mounted) hair dryer in kids bathroom for years, and it always scare the heck out of me since it&#x27;s always next to the sink and wires always drop in the sink. Of course this despite me knowing both the outlet and the hair dryer itself has GFI popper to protected.    Finally I decided to get a wall mount like the ones in the hotels. I like how this particular brand hide extra wire length by wrapping within the back of the fixture before mounting to the wall. This exposes minimum length required to get to the power outlet. Now this is one less hazard that I don&#x27;t have to regret not doing!    As for the blow power of the dryer, it&#x27;s not something that will \\&quot;blow me down!\\&quot; It&#x27;s good enough for kids and most adults. I can imagine folks with thick and long hair requiring more blow power, will want to consider other models that are more powerful. It&#x27;s also as loud as you would expect from regular hair dryers.    *UPDATE* 1 week into use, inserting dryer back to the base unit seems harder as the plastic pieces on the mounting shell that insert into the dryer&#x27;s handle start to bend. I had to try to bend them back, and broke one flap. It might&#x27;ve been best using some heat to weaken the flap first. I deduct one start from this problem (4 stars now)    *UPDATE* 3 weeks into use, one of the push in button (to release the dryer) broke off! The inner spring popped out and a small plastic tab from the button cracked. Thanks heaven that it&#x27;s within 30 days and Amazon provide an overnight shipping of a replacement. But this does make me weary of its quality, and that more things may break later on. I deduct one more star (3 stars now).</li>
            <li> This is my second one. Had the first one for many years and now replacing it with new one. Was so glad they were still available as my family loves this blow dryer. It is so handy and ready to go when ever we need to use it! LOVE!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a rental house we have, but used it myself when I installed it. It works great, lots of power, dried my hair quickly - and that&#x27;s saying something since my hair is usually slow to dry. Installed quickly as well. I thought the cord could be a titch longer but I didn&#x27;t feel it was so short that I couldn&#x27;t comfortably stand away from the dryer to be in front of the mirror. Overall, a great product for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It&#x27;s now been 9 months since I purchased and installed these in our rental home, and they still, after heavy usage, work great. No signs of wear and tear or less power or any problems to report.</li>
            <li> This is the second jerdon I purchased mainly because I wanted to keep the same holes in the wall. I won&#x27;t buy another one. I think the first one lasted 2 years and this one just died after 2 years. thats crazy. yes I use it everyday but I still have my hair dryer from college that works beautifully (although a bit bulky) and its 30 years old. This hair dryer lasted 2 years!! thats ridiculous.</li>
            <li> i bought some of this model in Nov 2010 and used only 2 for my self, the rest I made it as gift of christmas gift to local friends. just happened last couple days when I used it, it fired up in my hand. I tried to switch to turn off, but it did not turn off. I must unpluged the power cord right away. If this happen to my kid, I don&#x27;t know how they can handle this situation. To save lives of my family, I pull off the other one and don&#x27;t want to use it, also re-call the rest from my friends whom I gave to. To me, this product is no safe at all.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a direct replacement of the unit mounted in my motorhome from factory.  This is a direct replacement even though the motorhome is 10 years old.  My old unit works great, but latch was starting to fail and handset would fall when traveling, creating possibilities of damage to other parts of bath.  We have used the old one lots and have been perfectly satisfied so we expect the same performance from this new unit, also, the new one looks so much better, 10yr old hair dryers loose their looks too.  The company shipped it fast and all transactions have been great, we are very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is our third drier, the first lasted about 10 years, the second less than one year. Bought the third because of convience and performace.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one of these I have owned.  The first had a slight problem with hanging it up and this one seems to have a problem with connecting on the switch but overall it is a nice machine-lots of power.  Changed my rating because I had more problems with this 2nd one and only lasted 6 months.</li>
            <li> My previous wall mounted hair dryer lasted around 10 years.  This junk didn&#x27;t make it to 10 months.  The GFI feature apparently malfunctioned so you can&#x27;t reset the button and get power to the unit.  I don&#x27;t know who Jerdon is but I wish Sunbeam still existed.</li>
            <li> I bought this back in April of 2011. It worked great and had no issues, until today. I went to go turn it on and I heard something that sounded like an electrical arc and a puff of white smoke blew out of the dryer. It still worked and I was able to dry my hair but I am reluctant to use it again after today. So I came back to Amazon to check my order history so I can just order the same one again. To my surprise it is $10 more today than it was back in 2011. Lets hope there has been some improvement over the years to warrant the extra $10 so my next one will last longer than 2 years.</li>
            <li> This is just what a hair dryer should be. Out of the way when not in use, easy and powerful. I just bought three more, one for work (I am a barber) one for my other bathroom and a spare.</li>
            <li> Used one of these at a hotel we stayed in last summer...loved it...had to have one.  It arrived very quickly...great service.</li>
            <li> i had ordered one about a year ago.  It burned out but we liked the style and easy of use we decide to order the same unit again, thanks</li>
            <li> This dryer was purchased in August 2010 and the contriol button became stuck in October2011 and the company won&#x27;t fix or replace. This dryer is a piece of junk and should have lasted for a couple years at least. Called company and got no help at all. Will not buy Jerdon products again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed getting my hairdryer off the countertop, but I&#x27;ll have to do it with a different brand in the future. I purchased this unit 9 months ago. A few days ago, the switch stopped working for medium and high settings. I sent a note to the company via their website asking for assistance and haven&#x27;t heard back from them. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll replace it under warranty, but why would I spend $10 in shipping for a $20 product to get what would probably be a refurbished model? I suggest you look at other options, which is what I&#x27;m going to do now.</li>
            <li> This is the best wall mounted hair dryer I have owned. The 2 previous ones (from different manufacturers) only had low speed with very low heat and high speed with very high heat.  This hair dryer has 3 speeds, is compact, and is held in it&#x27;s base securely when not in use.</li>
            <li> These little dryers are just great in my room and the guest room. Small enough to be out of the way but plenty of power to dry my thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;My guests love them</li>
            <li> Got this Jerdon from Amazon to replace an Oster with the same wattage. This dryer seems to dry my hair a lot faster, but......when doing the sides, it sounds like a jet airplane.  It is VERY noisy, but you don&#x27;t have to have it on as long, so I guess it evens out the pros and the cons. I would recommend this to a friend, but, I would advise them about the loudness of the dryer.  It is a good dryer for the cost and I am not sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> The wall mounted hairdryers (2) arrived very quick and were exactly as advertised.  Thank you for being such a great seller!</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd new Jerdon  Wall mount hairdryer we have had in our home and we would recommend it to others. It&#x27;s convienent, don&#x27;t have to put it away after use, no cords to wrap up.</li>
            <li> This unit began to self destruct this morning discharging internal shrapnal and vibrating while releasing a death sound.&lt;br /&gt;Despite being treated with the utmost respect it will join the pile of cheap Chinese junk I have accumulated over the years&lt;br /&gt;It almost made it to it&#x27;s second birthday. Pitiful&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a Panasonic and a seperate wall bracket as a replacement&lt;br /&gt;It is most likely chinese made as well but the design should long outlast generics</li>
            <li> I saw this at my sister in laws, she has one in each bathroom and loved it. Its out of the way and always neat looking. It has lots of power for no bigger than it is and just a nice addition to my bathroom, convenient but out of the way also. Power cord is long enough but not too long. Love it, love it, love it!!</li>
            <li> Avoid this hair dyer!  It caught fire only after a couple of months use.</li>
            <li> We had the dryer for a very short time when the switch would no longer work. It is almost impossible to take apart to repair because of the odd screws, holding it together. We are totally disappointed and just now ordered another brand through Amazon. Hopefully, this one will not be disappointing.</li>
            <li> I like the simple design and compact size of this hair dryer. Only the low heat switch of the hairdryer was burned out the first time I turned it on.  The replaced hairdryer is working so far so good.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up and simple to use.  Would suggest this item to a friend to purchase.</li>
            <li> I had happily used a Oster/Sunbeam wall mount dryer for several years.  When it died, I tried to save a few dollars buying the Jerdon 1600W, partly because I thought it was made by Sunbeam.  It arrived with the rear filter already broken, and it seems less well made than the old Oster.  Amazon was great about refunding my money quickly, and I have been happy again with the new version of Oster/Sunbeam, which has two speeds and two wattage settings.  A wall dryer is a great convenience, but only if you buy a product which is reliable.</li>
            <li> I have purchased four Jerdon wall mount hair dryers - one for my home and three for our lake house. They are dependable and affordably priced.</li>
            <li> I owned a Jerdon previously and it had worked well.  However it did not have as much air velocity as I wanted.  I purchased this model hoping for more power.  On the MED setting it does have more velocity than my older model however the air is only lukewarm and does not dry all that well.  When I switch to the high setting I get very warm air but the velocity drops by 10 or 15%.  I will probably reinstall the old one.  Otherwise it should work fine.</li>
            <li> Bought it in Sept 2010. The product looks perfect when it comes, have it mounted on the wall immediately and had no problem using it everyday. (except for some kind of mild plastic/silicone smell)     A few days ago it broke (December 2010), basically it doesnt turn on anymore. I tried the test button on the side and it doesnt seem to do anything. I am assuming some fuzz has burnt out inside. And unfortunately the return/exchange period has passed.     I have it removed from the wall and now have to deal with the holes I drilled 3 months ago.     I would not recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a long-lasting hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased two of these a couple of years ago as clearance items from Penny&#x27;s site. One in master bath started running like it had a short. Hey, for twenty bucks I got my money&#x27;s worth. I like the wall mount hair dryers and will gladly buy a new one of these every two-three years.</li>
            <li> I have used a wall mounted hair blower for over 20 years, the first being one made by Sears &amp; then an Oster (I still use this one.)    The Sears is no longer made and the Oster has a reset on the plug which made it difficult to use in this case.    The Sears &amp; Oster are better made but look very similar to the Jerdon.  The first one sent by Amazon had a defective button so they immediately replaced it.    The Jerdon is a little noisy, the reset buttons on the side of the unit are hard to work but the hairblower seems to be working fine.  I have only had it for 3 weeks so time will tell if it holds up.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the hairdryer. I liked it because it was easy to install on the wall.</li>
            <li> I recieved this hair dryer last night and this morning it does not work.  The heating element came on,  but no air.</li>
            <li> This is the second Jerdon 1600W hair dryer I have owned.I love the convenience of a walled mounted hair dryer . This one also doesn&#x27;t get so hot that it dries my hair out. The first one lasted a long time and I hope this one will too.</li>
            <li> good product, very easy to install. Don&#x27;t use the screw provided instead by special drywall screws otherwise we are very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The hairdryer fits exactly on the wall-mount that we installed for our Sears hair-dryer.  This hair-dryer has more watts, so more power.  My hair gets dryer much quicker.  A very good product and can&#x27;t beat the price.  I was searching this product and this price was the cheapest.</li>
            <li> I bought our first Jerdon 1600W wall mount 5 years ago.  It was heavily used by my teen daughter and, under those circumstances, lasting 5 years is pretty good.  When it finally died, I wanted to replace with same, since the holes were already in the wall, plus it helps reduce counter clutter to have a wall-mounted hairdryer.  So far so good on the second one, which has been used daily for for a month so far.  I expect to get another 5 years out of this one.</li>
            <li> Years ago my husband and I were @ a motel that had a Jerdon wall mount hair dryer and I really liked it so when my old hair dryer quit working I found this one on-line and to my surprise, that was the same kind, so I bought it.  I use it every morning and I love it. It mounts nicely out of the way.</li>
            <li> First bought a Jerdon wall mount about two years ago.  It performed well until about a month ago when I burned it out by putting it on high and using it to dry inside a sweatshirt, where it couldn&#x27;t get enought air flow.  User error.  The only difference I can see between this new one and that one is a small night lite (that I never used anyway). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mounting is quite easy, and it frees up counter/drawer space.  My only wish is that it had individual settings for heat and speed.  Medium and high heat settings are on high speed only. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My wife also has one of the aforementioned original models, but only uses it for her hair, and it continues to work just fine.</li>
            <li> Regular hair dryer that mounts on the wall. It&#x27;s out of the way, but with-in reach. Very convienient.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth time I have ordered these.  Love the convenience  of the wall hanging.  No clutter on the countertops.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer for my husband for X-mas it worked well for about 2 months and then started to spark at the cord. My husband took it apart and the cord inside was black,not good. Thank goodness it didn&#x27;t start a fire!!</li>
            <li> My last one was a Sunbeam, it lasted 2-3 years. My latest \\&quot;Jerdon\\&quot; stopped working after 6 months. Bummer. It sparked then stopped completely. the dryer didnt have anything preventing it from working (no build up). I plugged it in recently and the lightest setting works but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> We  were looking  for  this  make &amp; model for sometime.  No stores stocked it.  The other internet  places we looked  wanted far too much  for the same item.      We are happy with the dryer, the price and the service.</li>
            <li> This is the third one of this model I have owned.  Very convenient to use.  Will not last forever, but will last as long as any other electronic devices of today.</li>
            <li> I first purchased the Wall Mount hair dryer for our 5th wheel, and since I have installed them in two bathrooms in our home,    The wife loves them!</li>
            <li> I have had three of these hair dryers, and they last me about two years.  I like the convenience of having them on my bathroom wall.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve owned one of these before and loved it.  It hangs on the wall in our bathroom so it&#x27;s always handy.  When the first one broke my wife had to go back to the bulky old one she had until I found this on Amazon. Easiest way to make a wife happy!</li>
            <li> The product works very well and is priced modestly.  I like having it mounted on the wall and then it isn&#x27;t on the counter.  It has three heat settings and two speeds. This is the second Jerdon wall mount hair dryer I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the service and response that I have received using Amazon. The hair dryers that I ordered were exactly what I was looking for and their description and picture was precise. They both came in a most timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Web site description adequate and accurate. Delivery timely. Mounting straight-forward. Lo-speed &amp; Lo-heat; Hi speed &amp; Hi heat. Both appropriately matched. Insertion into and release from wall mount easy. Noise level comparable to other mfgrs&#x27; units I&#x27;ve used at my gym. In service less than 1 month so can&#x27;t comment on durability. Does an excellent job of making my lazy crew cut stand up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to install and works great. It&#x27;s slim so it&#x27;s easy to find a place for it. Now the blowdryer is one less thing taking up space in our bathroom</li>
            <li> Love this dryer. Have one in every bathroom and gifted one to my daughter. So easy and so reliable. Has never let me down.</li>
            <li> I looked all over for a replacement blow dryer. I had the mounting bracket on my newly remodeled bedroom wall that I didn&#x27;t want to take down.  This was perfect, I opened it, and placed it on the mounted bracket, perfect fit.  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Great product, price and fast shipping! Easy to install and works real nice with lots of air for drying your hair. After install it&#x27;s very convienent, too!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. It&#x27;s convenient, easy to use, powerful enough, and doesn&#x27;t add clutter the countetops. No hassles with tangled cords, or setup.  Install it once (took 5 minutes) and it&#x27;s good to go.  Great product!</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is very easy to install.  You first mount a flat metal plate to the wall and then the base unit attaches to that plate.  We bought these for a vacation rental and appreciate the fact that the power cord is attached to the base unit and not the hair dryer itself.  While this may not be convenient or preferred for home use, in a vacation rental it keeps them in one place.</li>
            <li> My first Jerdon hair dryer lasted 10 years and we used it every day.  I bought another brand, and it lasted less than a year.  I just purchased another Jerdon Hair Dryer and I see why I bought it in the first place.  It is a terrific hair dryer!  I will buy no other.</li>
            <li> This is great.  Used them in hotels in the past.  Convenient, always know where it is and it works great.</li>
            <li> works just great.  I bought a new one and it fit the old bracket on the wall just perfect.  Cheap and works well for someone who just dries hair with it.  Cord is too short for anything too fancy.</li>
            <li> The wall- mounted hairdryer is convenient and a space saver for a small bathroom.    I would rate this product as a 5 star. The airflow is quite high and quite warm on all settings except low. I have short hair, so I use only the low setting.  I am thinking of purchasing another one for my vacation  condo rental  bathroom.</li>
            <li> Purchased March &#x27;11... daily use... worked great!  Finally died today and going to order another ... love this unit : )  Ample settings... gets hot which I like... blows strong enough... small and convenient.  Would not change a thing.</li>
            <li> Well, I finally got tired of the \\&quot;clutter\\&quot; associated with my wife&#x27;s hair dryer on the bathroom counter and started looking for wall mounted units.  At the time, the Jerdon 1600W had all good reviews and was one of the least expensive options.  We liked its clean and symmetric design better than its competitors.  Anyhow, after 6 weeks of daily use, it still works fine--according to my wife.  It has plenty of power and does have a switch on the handle for off/low/med/high.  If it is on when you try to hang it onto the wall base, it automatically flips the switch to the &#x27;off&#x27; position.  Most importantly (to me) the bathroom looks clean and uncluttered and I can use the countertop once again.  The only thing that seems a little strange in my home bathroom (rather than a hotel) is that \\&quot;First Class\\&quot; is printed on the handle (as can be seen in the photo).</li>
            <li> So far this dryer is working great!  Another brand didn&#x27;t last 1 year so I hope this one lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for about four years now, and have no quarrel with it at all.  It is mounted on the bathroom wall, not far from the sink and mirror, and I use it after I shower and wash my hair.  It never fails to operate, is effective, and simple to use.  Perhaps if I had long, lush , thick hair I might not be satisfied, as some previous reviewers seem to feel, but for my everyday usage it is perfect.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do, and I like it.  It was reasonably priced, and quickly shipped.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th. one.  I have them in both my homes.  I have them in my Florida winter cottage, and when I have friends visit, I tell them do not bring a hair blower.  One less thing to pack</li>
            <li> I bought two just over a year ago and have had both of them fail after what I think is a short period of time.  My wife loves the way it dries her hair and she likes that they are mounted on the wall.  I ordered two more this time based on, in my opinion, the short length of time before failure only because my wife likes it.</li>
            <li> After years of having my hair dryer clutter up the vanity, I now have a very nice dryer attached to the wall.  Be sure to have near plug in as the cord is short.  Love this for organization, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Saw some marginal comments on this product AFTER I bought it and became concerned. Frankly, my unit works as well as my Sunbeam did. It is a knockoff that works extremely well. Have had it for a couple of months with no isssues.</li>
            <li> I chose the Jerdon wall mount hair dryer because I had one previously and it lasted a very long time.  I like a wall mount because it leaves my counter free for other items.  This particular hair dryer takes very little wall space and fits in between the mirror and corner of the wall.    My previous Jerdon dryer had a night light which I miss on this one, but wouldn&#x27;t give a good hair dryer up simply for a night light.      I enjoy my Jerdon wall mount hair dryer and would recommend it very highly.    I&#x27;m also pleased with my business with Amazon.  They are right on target with price and shipment.</li>
            <li> design is ugly, cord to electic outlet is great lenght, heat settings are fine, setting for blowing are fine&lt;br /&gt;the curly cord from the unit to handle is way to short - will not reach more than 2 1/2 feet&lt;br /&gt;hard to reach mirror and dryer is handing on wall only 1 inch from the mirror</li>
            <li> This unit overheated and blew out within a few uses.  When it cooled down, only the low setting would work.  I don&#x27;t plan on buying another to replace it.</li>
            <li> I owned a Jerdon 1600W wall-mount dryer for 4 years till it finally died of every day normal usage. I then bought this $16.99 model from Amazon that was received DOA. My replacement dryer from Amazon lasted only one week till it went \\&quot;pop\\&quot; and smoked in my hand! Amazon won&#x27;t send a third replacement but they did refund my credit card. I don&#x27;t know if the other Jerdon 1600W dryer that Amazon sells at $34.95 is any better(?).</li>
            <li> So far I love this hair dryer! It works better than my normal heavy duty 1875 but it&#x27;s only a fraction of the size. Very easy to mount on the wall. Just like the ones at hotels!</li>
            <li> I bought this Jerdon Wall Mount Hair Dryer to save space and for company convenience. It was mounted in an upstairs bathroom and lightly used. The Jerdon hair dryer was purchased in August 2010 and quit working in March 2011. It&#x27;s not a good idea to purchase electrical items on Amazon......After 60 days NO RETURN! If I had paid a little more and bought locally, I would have gotten my money back or another item. Sometimes when you think you are saving money, you&#x27;re not. I lost all the way around. I will not purchase electrical items from Amazon in the future. Bad idea!</li>
            <li> Owned one for years. Paid twice this price for my old one. Needed 2 more for second home. Had to order one for a friend after she saw my old one. Keeps dryer always accessable. Never in the way since it has it&#x27;s own place. Ordered 3 this time.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer. Compact,not noisy as some small dryers, doesn&#x27;t take up alot of room, always close at hand.  Glad I bought one for home and one for vacation home..</li>
            <li> Real nice to have,shuts off when placed in holder. 3 speeds. Wish I had it years ago,saves so much time,I can have my hair dry in the time it takes to get the others out of the drawer.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchase this product and I am satisfied every  time.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Delivered promtly after my order. Works as advertised but a bit noisy. Overall rating, Good</li>
            <li> I used a Sunbeam wall-mount dryer for many years. When it died, I looked to find a replacement, but saw that Sunbeam had changed the design a bit. Fearing that they might have ruined the classic model, I bought this one instead because it looked in the picture like the former Sunbeam design.    What a mistake. The Jerdon is clearly a poor knockoff of the original Sunbeam. It&#x27;s bulkier and heavier. The catches that clip in the handset part don&#x27;t latch positively like the Sunbeam did. Just about everything about this dryer seems inferior to the Sunbeam.    The only thing that some people might like better is the heat level. This thing is HOT! If you&#x27;re one who likes to start the day with a singe on your scalp, this is the dryer for you! In fact, the dryer is so hot, it CAUGHT ON FIRE after we owned it less than a year!    So here I am on Amazon again to buy another dryer. But this time, I&#x27;ll do the right thing and get the 1632 instead!</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer in July of 2005.  On Feb 1 of 2006 this dryer sent out sparks and the coils inside were red hot.  I used this once a day almost every day.  I will not be buying another Jerdon hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The cord is a little short and also thick and tight  It is difficult to pull the dryer far enough from the wall to reach</li>
            <li> Fabulous little dryer will never go back to another type. Great settings lots of power! Hangs out of the way yet right there when you need it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife for Christmas.  I installed it shortly after and it worked fine for about 10 weeks.  Now it sounds like the fan is about to fall out.  Must be poor quality materials.</li>
            <li> We purchased the Jerdon 1600W hair dryer-wall mountable so we and members of our family would not have to each pack a hair dryer when visiting our weekend retreat.  The hair dryer meets our expectations.  It is compact and performs as expected.  We would not hesitate to purchase another Jerson product, or from Amazon, in the future.</li>
            <li> When the description said 2 speeds and 3 heat setting I was thinking that I could use them in any combination. NOPE .... there are 3 choices ... low, med, and high and the heat settings are preset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also with that it had a cold blast button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I like the size and the fact that it stays out of the way so I kept it.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Jerdon 1600W Wall Mounted hair dryer I&#x27;ve owned.  The first lasted about 6 years until the speed/Temperatue switch in the handle burned out.  The earlier model also had a built in night light which this one does not, to my disapointment.    Overall this is a convenient and effective hairdryer that will serve well.</li>
            <li> I have owned one for many years, so when the fan went out I bought another one. It&#x27;s compact and last a long time.</li>
            <li> This unit caught on fire within 3 months of purchase</li>
            <li> love it ! exact replacement for one I had that finally died.</li>
            <li> This is the handiest hair dryer I have ever owned! No more worrying about the cord getting in the water or where to put it when it is hot. Easy to get in and out of the holder and SUPER handy to install!!</li>
            <li> Thank you for your excellent service.  The item was damaged and was returned.  I immediately received a replacement.  This was for the Jerdon 1600 Wall Mount Hair Dryer.  I have had one for years and it finally stopped working.  I searched for the same model and found Amazon to be the only company to have it and the price was wonderful.  It is a great dryer and so convenient to hang on the wall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brand of wall hair dryer for many years and recently bought this one for a vacation home bath.  I love the convenience of not having a dryer in a drawer or on a counter.  The two speeds and 3 heat settings work well - in fact better than some of my other &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; hair dryers.  The unit is very easy to install.  As for durability:  the first one I bought lasted about 6-7 years before I had to replace it.  I looked at other ones, but decided to go with the same model - installation for the second one was easy - it just slipped right onto the original bracket.  I would highly recommend this product: easy installation, lasting quality and a good price.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and so convenient to hang on the wall.  This is my second one and it took me a while to find it.  I never did find it in a store.  I wanted to hang it on the same bracket so I wouldn&#x27;t make extra holes in my walls.</li>
            <li> I like this unit because it&#x27;s fairly easy to mount on wall and run the power wire inside the wall.&lt;br /&gt;Result clean hotel appearance with no plug wire showing.&lt;br /&gt;Several people have commented on the clean mounting and high end look when installed this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative side is the cost is high for what is a very basic hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;My guess is the ability to mount as I did somehow has justified the pricing to seller, but does it?&lt;br /&gt;If unit were 20% less costly would have given 5 Stars.&lt;br /&gt;There are better hair dryers out there for the same cost, but I wanted one I could neatly mount on wall.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the same model hair dryer.  The first one lasted over 6 yrs.  I like the convenience of having it mounted on the wall rather than taking space on the counter.  I could not find one in the local stores and found the best price on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Just over a year old and it started burning up, should have lasted quite a bit longer considering we did not use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this. Got it in the mail. Plugged it in and it did not work. I am sending it back.</li>
            <li> I used this every day.  Our master bathroom is small which is why I wanted a wall mount.  Works perfectly and installed in minutes.</li>
            <li> The wife loved the one i have in my bathroom so much that i ordered this one for her bathroom</li>
            <li> I have short, thick, coarse hair and it dries it quickly. My bathromm is small and I like it hanging on the wall within easy reach since I have no drawer space. If you&#x27;ve ever used on in a hotel, same thing.</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy access, no more looking around trying to find a place for your hair dryer.  Great selection of drying speeds.</li>
            <li> Very good product at the best</li>
            <li> Very handy. I replaced one like it that died after several years of use. This one fit on the existing bracket. This new version adds a removable screen on the air intake for cleaning and the GFI is incorporated inside the unit rather than at the plug. Very nice. My wife uses it and prefers it over any of her portable hair dryers.</li>
            <li> A perfect fit for my short hair. The best part is easy access since it it is attached to wall by my sink.</li>
            <li> I had on of these for 12 years.  It finally gave up the ghost.  Works perfectly and is so convenient to have right on the bathroom wall.  Added bonus - more wattage with the new one!</li>
            <li> A  holder piece  inside o f the holder  broke in a month so I am unable to hang it up anymore. Too late to ask for a replacementWill not purchase anotherfrom this maker..</li>
            <li> This item has a wall mount with two flimsy plastic tabs that must fit into slots as the unit is put back into the wall mount.  These tabs are so flimsy that they do not maintain the spacing to fit into both tabs.  It is very difficult to get the unit back into the mount.  Ours lasted only a couple weeks until one of the tabs broke off completely.  The actual unit seems OK but we consider the mount a no go and would not buy this item again.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is powerful for it&#x27;s size. I have one in each of our bathrooms and are very handy and unobtrusive. The price was fair and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Keeps counter space clean, but yet the dryer is handy to use.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair dryer the begining of August 2010 and it now only works on low speed.  My box is long gone in the garbage and it is past my return refund date. Help!</li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer to replace a previous, different brand that was beginning to fail.  The wall-mount installation was extremely easy, since I was able to reuse the metal mounting plate from my previous blow dryer.  The base (i.e. wall-mounted) unit contains the ground fault circuit interrupter, so the cord itself looks just like a normal cord.  The length of the plug cord can be adjusted by winding it on the backside of the base unit before sliding the unit onto its mounting plate.  Drying is quick, and the only criticism I have for this appliance is that it is quite loud, especially on its Medium &amp; High settings.</li>
            <li> I bought an older version some years ago after using one in a hotel. Used it every day. It finally started making a &amp;#34;not gonna last much longer&amp;#34; noise so I ordered this new version. So far it is just like the old one, but with improvements. The lint screen is detachable for easy cleaning and there is a wall mount. Only con is the cord from the wall mount to the dryer is a little short and confining. It does have coils that stretch out and hasn&#x27;t really been a problem. Lovin&#x27; it so far.</li>
            <li> Too noisy  would not buy again</li>
            <li> Great product. Have purchased previously. It lasts about 4-5 years for me. Love this wall caddy hair dryer.</li>
            <li> very easy to install and works very well, Better than expected. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because it is a little noisier that I would like .&lt;br /&gt;But its great.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t owned this 10 days when it created an electrical issue......the fire department had to come ...I had an electrician come the next day to make sure it was not my electric outlet or circuits and he assured me it was not my electric outlet....he believes it is the dryer.....I would like to return but now am being told by amazon that my \\&quot;window\\&quot; to return has expired.....not impressed with amazon&#x27;s service....I should add that this is my third one by jerdon....and I have never had any problems previously.....obviously a lemon....would like it replaced for free....with a new one....not a re-serviced one....some one should agree to do that....</li>
            <li> I am currently waiting for a replacement of this item. This was my second purchase of this dryer.  First one lasted&lt;br /&gt;over ten years and I loved it.  It is the only dryer I have been able to find that fits the small space on my bathroom wall&lt;br /&gt;plus the speeds are perfect.  This one stopped working after two uses so I had to return it.  After two weeks I am&lt;br /&gt;anxiously waiting for the new one.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> After the first exact same model stopped working after 18 months, I bought another since my wife liked the style. When the new one came, it fit the bracket exactly as the first.  The only difference is that the new one is noisier than the first one.  Not sure why, but it is annoying, especially in the morning.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for a number of years and loved it, However the new one I just purchased broke within one week. The holder broke and now its hard to put in and out of the Wall Mount. Another piece of crap.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had our Jerdon 1600 for a few months now and it still works great. Is it not as good as the $50 model we have but for $20 and hangs on the wall this is excellent. Puts out pretty good heat and a good amount of air.</li>
            <li> This is a good solution when you want a wall mounted hair dryer. It frees up counter space in crowded bathrooms and provides enough air and heat to dry hair. Nice touch is the removable screen that catches air born dust. I have used this model before and typically get 2 to 4 years life.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a good quality product.  Convenient because of the wall mounting.  I was concerned because I&#x27;d read that it doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting.  However, the medium setting is cooler and works fine for me.</li>
            <li> I have had 3 of these hair dryers. It is wall mounted which makes it very convenient. I really like it.</li>
            <li> I like the Jerdon wall mount Hair dryer.  The only drawback is it only lasted for 3 years.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Does exactly what I wanted it to do and easy to mount on the wall.  Perfect for guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> Installed this in a medicine cabinet to be out of site.  Works well and is compact.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Rv it stays in place well, take up small amount of space, it does make a lot of noise so if someone sleeps well you dry hair maybe not for you.</li>
            <li> Nice hair dryer, mounted on the wall, clearing counter space and easily acceptable.  Varied during speed....great little hairdryer.</li>
            <li> One good deal. This is the second one. My wife used one in a motel (Holiday Inn Express and fell in love with this. It is easy to use and hangs on the wall out of the way.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stuck with these after doing a modified direct wire job in the bathrooms. I just don&#x27;t want to do the wall repair and re-paint. I&#x27;ve gone through several. Two of the units actually started to burn up when the internal switches sparked and smoke came out. Fortunately my wife figured out how to press the panic button and shut them down.</li>
            <li> BUY  THIS  NOW  PLEASE  ,  I  will  never  GO  BACK .  SO  very  convenient,  Always  Right  there  ,  Ready  to  GO  !</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend this hairdryer to anyone.  I bought it to replace an old wall-mount hairdryer that I had used for 15+ years until it just stopped working one day.  The ProVersa unit fit perfectly on the existing wall mount, so I purchased it.  Although some of the reviews that I saw were less than favorable on this product, I took a chance on it AND LOST!!!  Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> I had one of these hairdryers for several years and had to get another when the old one quit.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Purchased to replace an older model that finally died.  This is a great little unit and much nicer than it&#x27;s predecessor.</li>
            <li> I had purchased one for my wife to replace another brand that had quit after two years. She loved it and it does a great job drying hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have added another one on my side of the bathroom so we don&#x27;t have to share. You&#x27;ll love the fact that it is so small hanging on the wall and out of the way. Ready to use at anytime without have to untangle cords or put it away. It becomes part of your bathroom accessories. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great, solved my problem of misplacing my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I loved it...while it worked.  It lasted about six months before it just ... died.  First it quit working on high and then it quit working all together.  I really like having a mounted hair dryer in my small space so I&#x27;ll be looking for a new one. It simply won&#x27;t be another one of these.</li>
            <li> Love the item.  100% satisfied. I recommend that each household should have this installed in their bathroom... Very Handy.</li>
            <li> We love this product. Very powerful and compact. We have them in our home and summer house.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I was staying in a motel room and noticed the comfort features that motel rooms have. One of the things it had was a wall mounted hair dryer. I purchased this wall mounted hair dryer and installed it in my bathroom. I love it. So easy to use, so convenient, so out of the way.Great product, good price.</li>
            <li> Mine lasted a little over a year...thought it should last longer then that</li>
            <li> I like  the easy access of the dryer hanging on the wall rather than stored in the vanity drawer. It works well plus takes up little space.</li>
            <li> the jerdan dryer has given us a broken switch after just a couple months of use  (has done this with 3 different dryers), i would not recomend this dryer to any one go for the sumbeam/oster a much better product</li>
            <li> After reading mixed reviews on this product I decided to take a chance since the price seemed good.  Upon reciept I plugged it in and the element overheated immediately.  The fan did not work and smoke started coming out of it.  Needless to say, after a long cool-down it went back in the box and was returned.  Amazon was great refunding my money as I certainly didn&#x27;t want a replacement.  How it got a UL rating I&#x27;ll never know.  I suggest spending a few more bucks and getting a quality item.</li>
            <li> This product came to me already broken and is make of many cheap plastic parts.  It perks coffee well but leakes as you try to pour the coffee from the pot when it is hot.  It seems to leak from the plastic ring around the top.  I&#x27;m not sure they make coffee pots that don&#x27;t leak down the carafe when pouring the coffee into the cups.  Too Bad, I hate all the cheap plastic that are put in products anymore.</li>
            <li> We replaced a Sunbeam with this unit. Purchased this unit February 18, 2013 . It lasted 18 months before it shorted out.</li>
            <li> It is handy, but VERY loud. I don&#x27;t know why it needs to be so loud.  My hand held dryer never made that much noise,</li>
            <li> Bought this item a few years ago and it&#x27;s still in great working order.  This item is very handy because you don&#x27;t have to have a cord and dryer on the counter or put it in a cabinet when you&#x27;re done.  My hair is fine, medium thickness, and is long and this is powerful enough for daily use.  It is easy to install; I put it next to my bathroom vanity mirror with the outlet just a few inches away. You will love this product.</li>
            <li> lots of power in this little dryer</li>
            <li> This is a great unit to organize the bathroom. I&#x27;m not a fan of stowing the hair dryer away in a cabinet or drawer and taking it out for every use and I&#x27;m not a fan of having it sit on the counter all of the time. This is a great compromise. The unit is always ready to use and it doesn&#x27;t take up space. Also, I am not able to mount this in studs, so I was concerned that the constant off and on might loosen this unit on the wall. There&#x27;s no problem with that. I even bought an extra one for my kids&#x27; bathroom--and you know how kids can be rough. Both units are fine and show no sign of loosening. Lastly, it&#x27;s easy to install. Love that part. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these dryers. Love them.</li>
            <li> I liked it when it worked, but now it doesn&#x27;t have very much power.</li>
            <li> for a wall unit its pretty good.this is the only my wife will use.so small but so powerfull cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> May be a little noisy, but is powerful, on-off switch and holder are convenient, and the night light feature is useful.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve had the first one last for quite a few years highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love the wall mount feature.  Easy to install and very solid against the wall.  It is very loud, and I expected three heat settings.  There are a tually two.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as I expected it to for the money.  Not too bad, not too great!  It does the job and works great in the camper.</li>
            <li> Great little dryer.  Very light weight and a great space saver.  I saw one in a hotel and had to have one.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has a lot of power.  The wall mount keeps it out of the way, but readily accessible when needed.  This is a replacement hair dryer for us and we purchased the same one when the other quit working.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is perfect.  It&#x27;s small, easy to use and you just hang it back on the wall!!  It doesn&#x27;t take up any counter space it and it&#x27;s always within your reach.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 more , 1 to replace the bathrooms that was used by 4 girls constantly!! And the other for our friends that loved the convience.  For around 18 bucks these powerful dryers are tough. The one that died needed to be replaced after almost 2 years of hard work. Remember there not just practicle but safer with kids! And the dim night light is a bonus. (I am now thinking about selling these on the street). &lt;JUST KIDDING  Trust me when I say you will enjoy! Banb</li>
            <li> Previously I purchased this Hair Dryer and it lasted quite a few years.  I decided to purchase another one, and in less than a year the motor died.  Needless to say, I doubt I&#x27;ll purchase another one from this company.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is just like you&#x27;d get in a resort or hotel.  It&#x27;s little, but efficient.  I love that it goes on the wall, has cording just long enough to reach the outlet, and yet long enough for me to dry my hair upside down if I want.  I almost always use the high setting, and my hair is dried in just a few minutes.  It&#x27;s got a clean boxy look instead of the usual elongated hair dryer shape and that looks better on my wall as well.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer make and model is a replacement  of a product that I have been using for several years.  This dryer is great to hang on the wall, saving space on the countertops.</li>
            <li> It Looks like the Sunbeam 1200 model that we have had forever, &amp; that is found in most hotel rooms, but not near as good.  The dryer doesn&#x27;t snap in like it should.</li>
            <li> We had one of these for years, replaced it with a different design, but returned to this one because it&#x27;s just a superior design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to unlatch and latch securely to the wall mount. Excellent performance in drying hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have ordered two just in case they stop making this design type... hard to find.</li>
            <li> Have used this dryer in hotels and when my old dryer died, I purchased this one.  Have had it a few months now and absolutely love it.  It is the only dryer I have used that has both a low and a high fan volume on the cool setting in addition to the heat settings. It&#x27;s mounted in the guest bathroom and everyone who has stayed with us have commented how great it is and how nice it looks.</li>
            <li> We have purchased at least 3 Jerdon wall mount blow dryers in the past few years.  They tend to burn out quickly---a disappointment---but the convenience of the wall mount and the smaller size keeps us coming back.  We have not found a wall-mount dryer that works better or lasts longer than this one.  The wall-mount reduces our vanity clutter.  We do clean the filter regularly---they still burn out in 12 to 18 months--may be 24.</li>
            <li> Got it fast and have enjoyed it</li>
            <li> Did not last that long had to replace it with another brand. The heat element died too soon I thought.</li>
            <li> This is just what we wanted.  No need to pull out dryer, plug in, use and then have to put away.  i feel like i&#x27;m in a luxury hotel every day!</li>
            <li> The switch seems really sensitive, unlike the previous one that I had (which was the same brand).  When I put it back in the holder, it turns on again, but at the lower setting.  Kind of strange.</li>
            <li> OK, it&#x27;s just a hair dryer right. Right, but the great thing about this dryer is it not only works great, it neatly hangs on the wall out of the way. Always plugged in and ready to go. Don&#x27;t have to roll up a cord and put it away in a draw, only have to pull out later and untangle the cord to plug in. Some units also come with a night light built in. Handy to see your way into the bathroom in the middle of the night. This is our second one. The first one lasted 8 years. Most seem to last only half that time. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this hair dryer.  Love the fact that it is available whenever you need to use it but you don&#x27;t have to have it cluttering up your vanity.  Great for smaller bathrooms!!</li>
            <li> I have bought this same or very similar dryer for each of my last three houses. I love them mounted right next to the bathroom sink. It works well and for the money I think they are of pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> Looks great. Durable for either home or beach rental.  Have one at home and second time purchased one for our rental condos.</li>
            <li> We are very pleased with this hair dryer.  It fits perfectly as planned, and does a good job drying.  Only minor problem is when putting it back in the holder, it sometimes wants to turn itself back on, and you have to shut it off again.</li>
            <li> Yes, I love it.  It is so easy to use and the force of the hot air dries my hair very fast.</li>
            <li> Happy female family with this.</li>
            <li> Nice and powerful, strong wall anchoring</li>
            <li> I had a previous version of this hair dryer that lasted several years, then shut off and sparked twice to die! This slid onto the attachment I had on my wall, so it was a seamless transition.  It is very loud, hence the start deduction, but I have fine hair that dries quickly, so don&#x27;t have to hear it for very long. Does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> its a good hair dryer but you are tethered to the spot. I would have preferred to have found the cordless one with rechargeable plate.</li>
            <li> High heat setting is practically automatic (don&#x27;t have to wait for it to heat up).  And the blower on the high setting is very powerful.  This unit is even better than the ones we&#x27;ve used at hotels.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 2-3 years now, and exactly what I wanted for vanity and not take up counter space.  I think everyone should have one--good looks and good power.  Oh, and if it ever stops on you some time--don&#x27;t complain--use the re-set button!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.  Be sure to have someone hold the dryer mount on the wall so you can hold it and use it as if drying your hair to make sure it is in the proper place and you will never look at drying your hair in the same way!  I plan on buying another one for our RV.  The holder/mount lets the dryer snap into place securely enough to drive done the bumpy roads!</li>
            <li> Dries super fast!  Tucks neatly away when done!  Very safe with built in GFCI!</li>
            <li> Extremely difficult to get the hairdyer to fit back into it&#x27;s holder. So we just leave it hanging now. Kind of pointless purchase now.</li>
            <li> We bought two of these, one for a bathroom used by two teenagers, and one for a less-used bathroom.  These hair dryers look great, are easy to mount, and are well-designed -- repeated grabbing and replacing the blower section has no effect and these units still look new.  After a couple of years, however, the switch gave out on the heavy-use unit -- the contacts were severely pitted.  We decided to buy an exact replacement unit since we really like the design and performance, but for a hotel-style unit I would expect more robust build quality for such a critical component.</li>
            <li> So far so good, have owned this for a month. I bought this brand since the other more expensive brand lasted less than a year and had no warranty. I live the various speeds: low, med, high. I could only ever have a wall mount which is very handy and safe.</li>
            <li> Seems to be great.  I think this is the machine that was originally made for Sunbeam/Oster and was used in lots of hotel rooms, which is where I first saw one years ago....</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had the dryer installed for less than a month, but so far it is working great.  It&#x27;s more powerful than the larger, bulkier dryer we did have and I like that it lives on the wall....no taking up drawer or counter space.</li>
            <li> I love the wall mount hair dryers.  You always know where it is and it is never in the way. Click and it is ready to use and click it is put away.</li>
            <li> This item did not work out of the box. I returned it. Should be no stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 6-7 years ago at a local store and loved it.  When it wore out I was so happy to find Amazon had the identical item. I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it arrived and it works just as good as the first one.  I really like having the wall mount design and it&#x27;s simple to use. A great price for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Abolutely love this! It hangs easily and is one of the best dryers we have owned!</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this hair blower, I had doubts as the price was very reasonable. When it was finially installed, it worked very well. Perhaps not as fancy as the more exspensive units, but for the most part it is very good .I highly recomend this hair blower</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these. One still works well the other burned up in a short time. The one in my bath doesn&#x27;t work any longer but the one in the guest bath does. I hardly used the one that malfunctioned. So was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Fits well in the RV, works but have not been on a trip yet to use it.  Amazon C/S was great to look up measurements for me to make sure it would fit in the space we had.  I had ordered 2. Previously and they would not fit.  Vendors need to put measurements of units in descriptions.</li>
            <li> I probably do not need all this power, but there is a low setting so that makes it better.  It fits my space very well</li>
            <li> It was a replacement for a similar dryer that died...It was just what I needed, got here quick, and works great.</li>
            <li> I bought it to use when I got to my vacation home in Florida.  I have used it 3 times (make that 2 1/2 times).  The 3rd time I used it, it burned up.  I had to take it off the wall and take it outside as it was smoking so bad.  I may try one more as I have a friend who has had one for 6 years and it still runs great.  Hopefully this was just a fluke.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and works great.  We have these in all bathrooms. I have bought these as gifts and people just love them.  Mounting is easy and just plug it in.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer will suck your hair into the air intake.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these in March of 2011.  Within 12 months the first one died.  This morning, after 32 months of use, the second one caught fire in my wife&#x27;s hand.  These are not a quality product and are even dangerous.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be used as hot as I wished.  Seems that the engine would not bear the temperature.  Design is clean and I like it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item on Dec. 13, 2012.  It burned out yesterday, January 31, 2013 (significant note, the time period to return it expired on January 31); it would not blow and the element burnt very hot.  I had hung it on the wall in my bathroom and used it for less than two months. I was gone a good portion of that time, as I&#x27;m often out of town for work, and I just returned from about 10 days out of town. Not happy!  My last one, also a wall mount, lasted a good five years.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research. This is the narrowest one. The 2 speed 3 heat settings are great. Very nice for a small space.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is exactly what we&#x27;ve been looking for and this is the only place we were able to find it.  It was easy to order, and the shipping time was short.  I will probably order again from amazon.com.</li>
            <li> great product have used these fo many years and although style has changed still works as well would recomend to others</li>
            <li> I ordered this one to replace the broken one,&lt;br /&gt;I installed this product mainly to save the space,&lt;br /&gt;but it is not durable, the spring latch and circuit&lt;br /&gt;in the old one broken, it should last longer.&lt;br /&gt;But overall, this product saves space.</li>
            <li> This style has been around for awhile. Probably because it works so well. It is easy to hang, easy to use and now has three speeds.</li>
            <li> I had this particular hairdryer before and it had gotten broke. I looked everywhere to replace it. I love the wall mount feature, it doesnt take up space. Its compact and has great power. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This item seems cheaply made. The switch is hard to slide. It is very loud. The parts sound like they are grinding together.</li>
            <li> love this dryer I put in our 5th wheel  and its so handy where we put it and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this light weight hair dryer that has lots of power. I had someone else install it which seemed involved.</li>
            <li> Great for a tight situation.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our rental property and it works very well.  I would highly recommend it to anyone for your home or rental property.</li>
            <li> We purchased the first Jerdon wall mount dryer about 10 years ago. I have severe arthritis and like how much power is available in such a small, lightweight, wall mountable unit. It drys my thick, medium length,colored hair very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We liked it so much that we purchased two more as replacements in case Jerdon was no longer manufacturing them when the original one went out (also to avoid putting new holes in the wall). Well, about 6 1/2 years later, the first one stopped working - after warning us with a burning smell. My husband said I should have kept the air intake a bit cleaner. Given how long previous hair dryers have lasted, we were pleased with that life span.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We just finished remodeling our master bathroom and no longer want a wall-mountable unit, so it is being installed in the guest bathroom. It can fit in small spaces leaving the bath counter free for our guests. I highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> Great way to save counter space, well constucted hair dryer, high speed is fast and hot, makes for a quick dry.</li>
            <li> Its okay but I wonder if it really is putting out 1600w at max.  But it does the job-  We will see how long this one lasts-  Last one went bad after 6 weeks</li>
            <li> The only setting i can use is the low setting.  The medium and high settings for heat are both on very high speeds.&lt;br /&gt;I read that this item had 2 speeds but it seems that only the low setting is of a speed that is not too high to use!  The medium and high settings are too strong a speed for me to use.&lt;br /&gt;This unit replaced a very old one that was a Sears.  Those three heat settings each had their own speeds, low for low heat, med. for med heat and high for high heat but were just not as strong as this unit so i was able to use all settings as needed.&lt;br /&gt;Just not loving it.</li>
            <li> THIS REPLACES THE SAME MODEL WHICH SERVED ME WELL FOR MANY YEARS. IT FITS MY SPACE VERY WELL AND OPERATES VERY SATISFACTORILY. I RECOMMEND IT FOR ITS QUALITY AND FOR&lt;br /&gt;THE VERY AFFORDABLE PRICE.</li>
            <li> . . . feels cheap in the hand. Takes two hands to insert the dryer back into the holder, which is kinda awkward.</li>
            <li> I received the hair dryer, installed in on the wall, and had used it less than two months when the blower went out. Due to a glitch in Amazon&#x27;s computer system, I was unable to complete the return/replacement procedure, so I am stuck with a broken appliance. Won&#x27;t buy this item again, and probably won&#x27;t buy anything like this from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> arrived good, after 6 months in used, broked......  It&#x27;s a shamed that product didn&#x27;t last...Shamed on you&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;tt have the ticket anymore.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer only worked for 2 months before burning out. I purchased another and same thing happened. Not a good product.</li>
            <li> Very similar if not almost the same exact thing as an old Sunbeam I had for years. It finally broke so I&lt;br /&gt;replaced it with this one. Convenient to have on the wall and quality is OK. Not fantastic, just OK, but the&lt;br /&gt;price dictates that. This one should last some time as well.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an old Sunbeam that burned out. Looks exactly like the Sunbeam one and even used same mounting plate already on the wall. Nice!!</li>
            <li> Burned up just out of warranty</li>
            <li> Love it because it is conveniently wall mounted and has just enough power and choice of heat settings for my hair. Have one in my vacation home too and recommended it to a friend who bought it immediately!</li>
            <li> The style is fine. There are enough heat and power controls for my liking. It is too noisy when you go to the higher speeds. I am still keeping this and not using the higher speeds.</li>
            <li> I have two of those purchased 8 years ago. One of them finally died. I will order another one, same brand.</li>
            <li> ...for this great wall-unit hair dryer.  9 years ago we bought 3 of these units (one for each bath room) and we are just now having to replace the first one.  We ordered 3 more because the remaining two of the orignal units MAY finally quit, although they seem to be doing just fine.  At any rate, great service and a very economical price considering the logevity of the units with proper care and cleaning of the filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We definitely recommend these units.</li>
            <li> This works well and is easy to use, the cord from the base to the drier could be a little longer</li>
            <li> This is what I like. It&#x27;s the same as the one I had used for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> I put three of these in a rental and two have held up well, the other one still works but plastic parts broke.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with hair dryers. That&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s responsibility! But she has mentioned several times that she finds this particular product noisier than she liked or expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fully satisfied with this product. Can&#x27;t beat the price and now I have a lot more counter space! Dry&#x27;s my hair fast and mounts easily.</li>
            <li> it dries your hair in record time, and then you just hang it up, and it is out of the way!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this for everyone.</li>
            <li> gave 3 stars because it is advertised as having 2 speeds and 3 heat settings. It does but the heat settings are fixed to certain speeds. You cannot have high speed with low heat or low speed with high heat, only high heat with high speed or low heat with low speed etc. Wanted to control heat and speed separately. Nothing wrong with unit otherwise but lowered rating due to not being able to change heat and speed settings independently. Returned for refund.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these and installed 1 so far.  I have studs on the wall so all I needed were the 3 screws to attach the metal to the wall.  Then snap the unit onto the metal plate.  I hang it near an outlet, tucked in as much cord as I can behind the unit.  The end result looks pretty nice I thought.&lt;br /&gt;The heat settings are good enough.  You can put the hair dryer back on the cradle without turning it off and it will shut of then.  It has a little red light, almost like a night light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the coiled cord is longer and it would have been nice if it had a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; air shot in addition to hot/warm air settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not quieter than any other hair dryer I owned but I like the clutter free counter top in the bathroom.  It will collect some lint and will require some cleaning on the vent to avoid overheating.</li>
