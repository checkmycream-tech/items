            <li>Great item for the price.</li>

            <li>This was a great transaction.</li>

            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>Best feature is the large face of this mirror.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is also as brutally honest as the mirror on the wall was to Maleficent.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is not only perfect for its purpose, but is great quality.</li>
            <li>However, it fits so nicely on my bathroom counter</li>
            <li>It has excellent clarity of the glass, a very strong magnification and large face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m REALLY happy about is to discover that the reflective color of this Danielle mirror is true.  </li>
            <li>This makes it very easy for me to apply my make-up.</li>
            <li>This one fit the bill at a good price.  </li>
            <li>It was a great surprise to get it so fast!</li>
            <li>The magnification on it is very nice, it shows every pore on your face (not always a positive thing :) ).</li>
            <li>So glad I got this</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with my order.</li>
            <li>The 10x magnification side is awesome, especially when tweezing my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it here b</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>And I love the 10x</li>
            <li>I needed a vanity mirror for better makeup application and this one fits the bill.</li>
            <li>fantastic, large curved mirror that promotes a great angle</li>
            <li>The mirror was well packaged and easy to assemble, it&#x27;s also very study and of good quality.</li>
            <li>well made mirror but too strong for intended use.</li>
            <li>It has been said that one can only be as beautiful as the mirror used to beautify oneself.  </li>
            <li>Overall I would say this is a pretty awesome mirror</li>
            <li>No excuses now to look anything less than flawless!</li>
            <li>will say the mirror is nice and large.</li>
            <li>The mirror is held to the stem by a cheap screw attachment.  </li>
            <li>If makeup color is important to you, use the Danielle mirror.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a great mirror for the price.</li>
            <li>I love the large face of the mirror!</li>
            <li>The normal side of the mirror is great when putting on make-up or just doing normal day-to-day things.  </li>
            <li>Such a good investment.</li>
            <li>--it shows you all those things you really don&#x27;t want to see--but need to see.  :-)  </li>
            <li>It is also very handy to set near a window to see how your makeup looks in natural daylight.</li>
            <li>The one and only downfall is the lack of a light, but my low-powered bathroom light works just fine.</li>
            <li>, the reflection on the magnified side will show all details of your face, fine lines, pores and scars the image is a clear reflection and enlarged, which allow you to see what changes are going on with your skin.</li>
            <li>better, this mirror shipped to me within 2 days of purchase - and I ordered standard shipping.</li>
            <li>I bought this mirror for my wife and she REALLY likes it!</li>
            <li>Exactly as I imagined it would be.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it better is if it were lighted, but then you&#x27;d have to worry about a cord and the price would be much higher.  </li>
            <li>I got exactly what I was hoping for and then some.</li>
            <li>It is super clear and sturdy!  </li>
            <li>This mirror is very heavy, sturdy and good looking.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to assemble - comes in two pieces (the stand and the face/stem) and only requires an east twist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to assemble and it is a lot bigger</li>
            <li>the only thing is their isn&#x27;t a light built into it</li>
            <li>but I find that I must get very close to it to see what I want.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and heavy, very well made.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>We all need this side after looking at our skin up close and personal with the magnified side ;).  </li>
            <li>At first when this mirror arrived, I thought it seemed way too big!  </li>
            <li>To be certain my eyes weren&#x27;t playing tricks on me, I held a perfectly white piece of paper up and looked at it through both mirrors.  </li>
            <li>the mirror itself has so much real estate that your entire face can be seen</li>
            <li>Sure enough, it was true white in the Danielle mirror but slightly off-color in the other one.  </li>
            <li>The 10X side is just the right magnification to catch stray eyebrow hairs, flaky skin, and other imperfections.</li>
            <li>This mirror is crazy amazing!  </li>
            <li>However the quality of the product is very good; the base is weighted and sturdy, and both mirrors are clear and distortion-free.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s base is not only sturdy but it is also very beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I placed this mirror and my other makeup mirror both on the windowsill as I tested some new makeup foundation in the natural daylight.  </li>
            <li>The base is pretty sturdy and the finish looks nice too.</li>
            <li>My main criteria was to find a mirror tall enough that I would not have to slump over or look down at it.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> At first, I was shocked by how big it was, but it turns out to be very useful -</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to see that my other makeup mirror actually has a slight amber cast and my foundation looked too orange in tone.  </li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I first found it on another website ridiculously priced at $145, but when I googled the name of the mirror</li>
            <li> I was rather surprised how heavy duty it was.</li>
            <li> When readjusting up and down, it actually stays put!  </li>

            <li> Firm stand, magnifying is</li>
            <li> I knew the dimensions listed would mean this mirror is a bit larger than I wanted for my small vanity, but unfortunately its not available in a smaller size.  </li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with this purchase at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /c BB&amp;B has similiar ones at ridiculous prices.</li>
            <li> You wont miss a single eyebrow hair with this bad boy!  </li>
            <li> The heavy base stabilizes the mirror as you apply make-up or pluck those stubborn eyebrows using the 10x magnification side.  </li>

            <li> Wow!  This mirror is great!  It&#x27;s base is not only sturdy but it is also very beautiful.  It has been said that one can only be as beautiful as the mirror used to beautify oneself.  This mirror is also as brutally honest as the mirror on the wall was to Maleficent.  The magnification leaves nowhere for clogged pores to hide.  If you are looking to get up close and personal with your face, this mirror is for you.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied with my order! This mirror is not only perfect for its purpose, but is great quality. It is so easy to assemble - comes in two pieces (the stand and the face/stem) and only requires an east twist. It&#x27;s durable and heavy duty - you definitely get what you pay for with this piece.

            <li> I like this mirror the only thing is their isn&#x27;t a light built into it and you have to have your face close to see your image on the magnified side of the mirror, the reflection on the magnified side will show all details of your face, fine lines, pores and scars the image is a clear reflection and enlarged, which allow you to see what changes are going on with your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for my wife and she REALLY likes it! It&#x27;s easy to assemble and it is a lot bigger then other mirrors usually. The magnification on it is very nice, it shows every pore on your face (not always a positive thing :) ). I can definitely recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> I like this mirror because I use it to watch tv when I&#x27;m on the computer. The magnetic side is kind of hard to see into and needs to be taken down a few notches.</li>
            <li> Wonderful purchase!  The 10x magnification side is awesome, especially when tweezing my eyebrows.  The normal side of the mirror is great when putting on make-up or just doing normal day-to-day things.  I also like that the mirror is heavy duty.  When readjusting up and down, it actually stays put!  Glad I purchased this product!</li>
            <li> Now I can see! It&#x27;s nice and heavy, very well made. If it&#x27;s not real chrome then it&#x27;s a great plating job. It&#x27;s so shiney and the mirror itself has so much real estate that your entire face can be seen so make up can be applied. I&#x27;m so glad I found it here b/c BB&amp;B has similiar ones at ridiculous prices. I LOVE AMAZON!!</li>
            <li> The mirror is held to the stem by a cheap screw attachment.  It broke off when I was putting it together.</li>
            <li> This mirror is very heavy, sturdy and good looking. Looks great in the bathroom. I would recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> This mirror is crazy amazing!  Love it!  Firm stand, magnifying is fantastic, large curved mirror that promotes a great angle anyway you use it. You wont miss a single eyebrow hair with this bad boy!  My husband even loves to use it to locate slivers in his hands.  Thrilled with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I knew the dimensions listed would mean this mirror is a bit larger than I wanted for my small vanity, but unfortunately its not available in a smaller size.  However the quality of the product is very good; the base is weighted and sturdy, and both mirrors are clear and distortion-free.  Lightning-fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Exactly as I imagined it would be. Perfect.</li>
            <li> I once had a large 10X mirror with stand, unfortunately I lost it in a traveling accident. This mirror I received said it was 10X also but I find that I must get very close to it to see what I want.  I have no desire to go through the return process so it remains with me. I am not satisfied with this purchase at all.&lt;br /&gt;I will say the mirror is nice and large.</li>
            <li> Price was a lot more than I wanted to spend for a vanity mirror, but it&#x27;s a great product. Love it.</li>
            <li> Wow!  What a great mirror!  The finish is shiny and sleek.  The heavy base stabilizes the mirror as you apply make-up or pluck those stubborn eyebrows using the 10x magnification side.  The opposite side is a standard mirror without magnification.  We all need this side after looking at our skin up close and personal with the magnified side ;).  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this mirror.  The only thing that would make it better is if it were lighted, but then you&#x27;d have to worry about a cord and the price would be much higher.  Great item for the price.</li>
            <li> At first when this mirror arrived, I thought it seemed way too big!  However, it fits so nicely on my bathroom counter and I absolutely love it!  It is super clear and sturdy!  It doesn&#x27;t tip over or even move when I switch it from regular magnification to the 10x.  And I love the 10x--it shows you all those things you really don&#x27;t want to see--but need to see.  :-)  Overall I would say this is a pretty awesome mirror and I am extremely happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> My main criteria was to find a mirror tall enough that I would not have to slump over or look down at it.  This one fit the bill at a good price.  As a matter of fact, I first found it on another website ridiculously priced at $145, but when I googled the name of the mirror I found the same thing on Amazon priced reasonably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m REALLY happy about is to discover that the reflective color of this Danielle mirror is true.  I placed this mirror and my other makeup mirror both on the windowsill as I tested some new makeup foundation in the natural daylight.  I was very surprised to see that my other makeup mirror actually has a slight amber cast and my foundation looked too orange in tone.  However when I looked into the Danielle mirror, the foundation color looked great.

Sure enough, it was true white in the Danielle mirror but slightly off-color in the other one.  If makeup color is important to you, use the Danielle mirror.</li>
            <li> well made mirror but too strong for intended use.</li>
            <li> Perfect magnification mirror. You won&#x27;t need you glasses for makeup.</li>
            <li> This was a great transaction. it shipped literally overnight and was received in two days. The quality of the mirror is exceptional. It has excellent clarity of the glass, a very strong magnification and large face. I got exactly what I was hoping for and then some. Thank you for such quality service and a quality product.</li>
            <li> This mirror was the perfect addition to my bathroom. I needed a vanity mirror for better makeup application and this one fits the bill. It is also very handy to set near a window to see how your makeup looks in natural daylight. The 10X side is just the right magnification to catch stray eyebrow hairs, flaky skin, and other imperfections. No excuses now to look anything less than flawless! The base is pretty sturdy and the finish looks nice too. Overall, it is a great mirror for the price.</li>
            <li> Best feature is the large face of this mirror.  This makes it very easy for me to apply my make-up.</li>
