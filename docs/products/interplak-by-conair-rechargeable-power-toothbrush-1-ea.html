            <li>Great all around brush.  </li>
            <li>Hope this helps someone thinking about returning this great brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my dental check ups show the great results.  </li>
            <li>It is a great toothbrush</li>
            <li>Great for my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But nonetheless it is a great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great on the gums as well as the teeth.</li>
            <li>always a great report with my dentist and no issues whatsoever.</li>
            <li>This works great with my gel Colgate toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It cleans your teeth amazingly well!</li>
            <li>I was thrilled!</li>
            <li>Works like a good flossing.  </li>
            <li>Is it as good as a Sonicare?</li>
            <li>I’m delighted with this routine and with my purchase of this item.  </li>
            <li>and then my dentist the best product to buy in this category and everyone of them before I had this available to review said &#x27;pick the Conair&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>but the quality isn&#x27;t nearly as good.</li>
            <li>I always loved my Interplak from before.</li>
            <li>Your teeth and gums will thank you for the wise choice.</li>
            <li>So good to have the Interplak as part of my oral health program.</li>
            <li>So happy to see that this toothbrush is still available!</li>
            <li>I was very glad to see this on the market again--my very favorite electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>am so happy I bought 3 more, just in case they stop making them...</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li>I rarely had a cavity while using them, plus it gave a great gum massage!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled to see this tooth brush made it back!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth quickly and feels great while it works.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s unique about this brush is that each tuft of bristles on the brush head revolves separately, and it truly does do a good job.</li>
            <li>Like many others, I was delighted that this tooth brush is once again available.  </li>
            <li>Better at getting between teeth then my ultrasonic brush.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this brush for more than 20 years and</li>
            <li>and I am pleased to be the owner of another one.</li>
            <li>No pain, no bleeding gums, no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush handle is well balanced and feels ok in my hand,</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s OK...)</li>
            <li>and I wish it had more than one speed.</li>
            <li>I am a plaque maker &amp; this has kept my gums healthy &amp; reduced pockets.</li>
            <li>It was my favorite that I purchased from my Periodontist.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE mine.</li>
            <li>A friend gifted me a Phillips Sonic care.</li>
            <li>I have tried the Smilex and the Emmi-dent ultrasonic toothbrushes but for me this toothbrush is my favorite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;what makes it more deceptive is the pictured charging stand</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom Line - You can spend a lot more, but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a better brush.</li>
            <li>Then buy one or two more to let Conair know that they should not abandon this product.</li>
            <li>No power to speak of, the $9 spin toothbrush have WAY more power than this .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both Sonicare and Spinbrush for many years.</li>
            <li>It works, and better than alternatives -- but, yes, under powered, as others have reported.  </li>
            <li>Now my dentist keeps telling me that I need to floss more.  </li>
            <li>: I tried it again today to make sure I did not miss any thing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve missed it for many years...</li>
            <li>I’ve had one of the old Braun Interplak versions of this toothbrush for many years and always thought it the very best kind of toothbrush, really getting in where it matters.  </li>
            <li>A good intro toothbrush for those who are interested in rechargeable toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>So I did and have since then had amazing results with teeth cleanliness, fresh breath, and fighting tartar/plaque build up.  </li>
            <li>love the way it leaves my teeth feeling dentist appointment clean.</li>
            <li>: I prefer batteries that are easily replaceable with AA rechargeables.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li>For those who have loved their old Interplak, all I can say is make sure this is the identical model to what you used before.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I have no idea how it could be better than my other rotating toothbrush, but it feels great on my gums and I feel that my teeth are refreshingly clean after using</li>
            <li>This is actually my first electric toothbrush of any kind, so I am testing it without comparison to any others on the market.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes work like no other, the counter-rotating bristles are very effective.</li>
            <li>I have  work just fine.</li>
            <li>They say that replacements should be available sometime this month, in April.</li>
            <li>and she informed me that it was once again available on the Internet.</li>
            <li>However, there are much better toothbrushes out there, many of which have &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; vibration mode for gentle brushing, and I&#x27;d recommend those instead.  </li>
            <li>not as good as my old one.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to get the Conair Interplak Rechargeable.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already seeing a significant improvement there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brush is powered with a rechargeable nickel cadmium battery (non-replaceable), make sure to charge the unit for 24 hours before first time use.  </li>
            <li>It was originally recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the only thing I miss, but I am sure am glad to have to have it!</li>
            <li>So if you do buy this item it will clean your teeth for three months</li>
            <li>I charged the toothbrush full (almost 24 hours and the light turned off to tell me it is full charged) and tried.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel so clean after brushing with this.</li>
            <li>Aside from that, I loved it, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d be willing to buy a new one every time the bristles wear out.</li>
            <li>I did receive this product through Amazon Vine, but I try to read and write my reviews as if I had paid the full purchase price,</li>
            <li>for I feel that is only fair for those who read and rely on reviews.</li>
            <li>the straight gear that drives the bristles comes in and out of the top of the head.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t even buy new brush heads and give this to my kids to use as I really don&#x27;t think it does a satisfactory job in providing good oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li>Setup is easy - unpackage it, plug it in, and charge it for 24 hours before the first use.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s true that the brushing action is more important than the POWER, per se.  </li>
            <li>When you use a rechargeable tooth brush with a fresh brush head, you almost always feel like you just walked out of a dental office since your teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li>A month or more ago, I did see replacements, but they cost more than twice the price of the entire toothbrush, and I didn&#x27;t see them for sale at the Conair website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As said above, your dental health provider may be able to recommend something better.</li>
            <li>I will buy several more, as funds permit, to make sure I&#x27;m covered well into the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Braun brush with the one round head does an OK job, but not as good as the NT11.</li>
            <li>the brush head was defective and fell apart within two months but was quickly replaced.</li>
            <li>the charger is at fault; I charged it on an older model and it seems to have more power.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After use, you should rinse it thoroughly while it is running, and shake it dry, to keep it in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My new Interplak is just as good as the old one with the exception of no 2 minute shut off...</li>
            <li>How they claim that this tooth brush is as effective as a manual tooth brush AND flossing is simply beyond my comprehension.  </li>
            <li>This tooth brush didn&#x27;t work right when we got.</li>
            <li>The product recharges quickly and never a hesitation that it will be ready to use when I need it.</li>
            <li>However, now that I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks, I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think most adults would find it works well enough.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li>The downside is that they seem to be pretty pricey when compared to the cost of this unit, so that&#x27;s a bit</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s back in production  -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad they are back</li>
            <li>SOOOOOOO glad they brought it back, and now w/ replaceable battery.</li>
            <li>I first bought one in 1997 and replaced it in 2005.  </li>
            <li>You need to charge it for 24 hours before using it the first time.  </li>
            <li>About the only interesting thing about this powered toothbrush have is its rotating brushes.</li>
            <li>This is actually a good toothbrush - but the manufacture skimped on a few things.</li>
            <li>The shafts on the both the Sonicare and Spinbrush on the other hand are thinner, hence less invasive and provide for a a more pleasant brushing experience.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not buy this unless you can find replacement brushes at a reasonable price first.</li>
            <li>There’s a slight slowing if you press, but the brushes continue to do their job perfectly nicely.  </li>
            <li>I attribute that, in large part, to the Interplak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was glad to see a new model and replacement heads were back on the market this summer (2015).  </li>
            <li>The actual unit feels very light - perhaps even a bit cheap feeling - but that&#x27;s to be expected at this price</li>
            <li>Although probably not a substitute for flossing (as with all consumer health products, ask your health provider for her or his recommendations), they&#x27;re very well designed.  </li>
            <li>I use a Waterpik to get food debris out from between my teeth, then this fellow to deal with plaque, and lastly a regular round-headed electric toothbrush to give the gums a light massage.  </li>
            <li>too much$$$.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the Conair NT11.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, if you apply too much pressure, this brush will stop.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush was better than expected.  </li>
            <li>I contacted Conair, the manufacturer, and they confirmed that currently no brush heads are availble for this model..</li>
            <li>Basiicly what i wanted--counter rotating brushes and reasonable rpm, ie.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Original review follows: Do not buy this unless you can find replacement brushes at a reasonable price first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a gentle electric tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, my first new unit in July 2015 was defective.  </li>
            <li>A new brush head cost the same price or more than the cost of a brand new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>other con is that the replacement heads cost more then the whole brush:/ ???</li>
            <li>This power toothbrush is unique that it works with each tuft rotates individually.</li>
            <li>at maximum, I see two sets of sharp metal teeth sticking out of the top.</li>
            <li>It definitely gets the teeth clean and does not irritate gums while doing it.  </li>
            <li>I have nursed my old NT7 along for a many years, and rebuilt the heads with brushes from older models, but finally it was time to get a new one.</li>
            <li>If I cannot easily or inexpensively replace the brush head, then I&#x27;ll be back to the old school manual toothbrush in 90 days.</li>
            <li>Going lightly, nightly brushing takes about 3-4 minutes, leaving my teeth feeling dentist-visit-clean, and that doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit since it saves me from those long and expensinve visits to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our old one worked fine for about 5 years but the battery finally wore out.</li>
            <li>I have a problem area around an older crown</li>
            <li>And the older brushes heads</li>
            <li>She said the main thing she missed was the timer that indicated when it was time to move to another section in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>So I am set and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Soon after we got this original one it would loose power and stall on us.</li>
            <li>for some reason you want an extremely gentle toothbrush that may not brush your entire mouth without stopping a few times, and you don&#x27;t want to replace the only thing good about the product (the brush heads)</li>
            <li>This brush has 8 counter-rotating small brushes that do a great job of cleaning your teeth, and since they are small, they get between your teeth very well, too!</li>
            <li>but I bought two new ones so that I will always have one--and of course, the new ones rotate faster.  </li>
            <li>The main drawback so far is that at its website they recommend replacing the brushhead every three months, BUT they DONT MAKE or SELL replacement brushheads.</li>
            <li>I am fortunate to have purchased extra brushes several years ago.</li>
            <li>It may be appropriate for a small child with small teeth (in the brush head is small) as it has a more gentle brushing action (check with your dentist to make sure).  </li>
            <li>The battery runs out too fast, its WAY OVERPRICED TO GET A REPLACEMENT, but it works like no other toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Frankly unless you have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>no excessive vibration there either</li>
            <li>I have suffered gum disease in the past and need more rigorous cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I kept thinking it wasn&#x27;t charged enough but even on first using each night it slows and is sluggish.</li>
            <li>You have to keep the pressure very light - press too hard</li>
            <li>You can buy an Oral-B Vitality for the same price (or less) and get a product that is 10x more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Basically when you twist the head onto the body, it makes it fit to tight and will stop the heads from spinning with the slightest pressure.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s OK with me, as it just reminds me I&#x27;m pressing too hard.</li>
            <li>The unit does effectively clean the teeth, altho the number of bristles is fewer than previous models.</li>
            <li>seeing my Mother have similar drama over the years, it has been a reasonable concern.</li>
            <li>Unlike the dual action of the spin brush, you get just one stroke direction.  </li>
            <li>In comparison to my current rechargeable tooth brush - this one is REALLY substandard.  </li>
            <li>I am actually surprised that they used ni-cad which is susceptible to memory</li>
            <li>My bleeding gums have healed and the dentist has noticed a marked improvement with my teeth.</li>
            <li>Then I showed her my \\&quot;old new\\&quot; tooth brush!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really wish it came with an extra brush head--</li>
            <li>The Conair has none of that, or I did not have a complete brushing session to know.</li>
            <li>I told her how I missed my old Interplak</li>
            <li>It seemed a little loud in a quiet house, but not annoyingly so.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The nice non-wired contact charger at the base is nice because the unit can get wet with use.</li>
            <li>and then you will be using a bacterial laden brush or you will throw it out and buy a new entire unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are the same as new brushes.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a big blue button on the handle that turns it on and off, so it really couldn&#x27;t be easier.</li>
            <li>brushes, as with most power toothbrushes, are expensive, though the unit itself is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I tried the best selling brand and found it to vibrate too much and cause miserable tickling on the inside of the front uppers.  </li>
            <li>Also, I noticed during the first use that the power seemed a lot lower than my other one, but I made sure it was fully charged and tried it again with the same result - slow and ineffective.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require much pressure to use this toothbrush, but any more than slight pressure causes the brushes to slow or stop altogether.</li>
            <li>my Oral-B Vitality eventually stops working (and I might add my last one lasted over 10-years before it stopped recharging), I would NEVER buy this product as there are simply too many negative aspects to it.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that the brush is much shorter and just a tad harder.  </li>
            <li>I had this toothbrush back in early 90&#x27;s (paid over $100)</li>
            <li>That may be because I use them gently along with careful use of dilute hydrogen peroxide and baking soda.</li>
            <li>There is nothing more frustrating than stalling electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re serious about dental health, I would strongly recommend the Sonicare over this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get enough of this toothbrush, no other tooth brush comes close to comparison.</li>
            <li>This rechargeable toothbrush is REALLY below average.  </li>
            <li>contacted Conair about the apparent lack of replacement brush heads for this toothbrush (because I wasn&#x27;t going to buy them from the Amazon seller who was gouging the public at $79)</li>
            <li>To remedy this you just have to slide the head onto the body straight down.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s underpowered at full charge, and only comes with a single small brush head.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> so I can brush with this wonderful instrument after each meal.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush EVER!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, she is very happy with the toothbrush and now that I know where to get replacement brush heads</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m very happy with this tooth brush as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the cleanliness you feel after brushing is priceless.</li>
            <li> It was the best</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very good rechargeable toothbrush for the price.</li>
            <li> Conair stops making them, they are THAT good!</li>
            <li> That being said, after using this Conair Interplak brush four times consecutively, I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Great all around brush.  </li>
            <li> Hope this helps someone thinking about returning this great brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my dental check ups show the great results.  </li>
            <li> It is a great toothbrush</li>
            <li> Great for my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But nonetheless it is a great product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s great on the gums as well as the teeth.</li>
            <li> always a great report with my dentist and no issues whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This works great with my gel Colgate toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It cleans your teeth amazingly well!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled!</li>
            <li> Works like a good flossing.  </li>
            <li> Is it as good as a Sonicare?</li>
            <li> I’m delighted with this routine and with my purchase of this item.  </li>
            <li> and then my dentist the best product to buy in this category and everyone of them before I had this available to review said &#x27;pick the Conair&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> but the quality isn&#x27;t nearly as good.</li>
            <li> I always loved my Interplak from before.</li>
            <li> Your teeth and gums will thank you for the wise choice.</li>
            <li> So good to have the Interplak as part of my oral health program.</li>
            <li> So happy to see that this toothbrush is still available!</li>
            <li> I was very glad to see this on the market again--my very favorite electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> am so happy I bought 3 more, just in case they stop making them...</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> I rarely had a cavity while using them, plus it gave a great gum massage!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled to see this tooth brush made it back!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth quickly and feels great while it works.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s unique about this brush is that each tuft of bristles on the brush head revolves separately, and it truly does do a good job.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I was delighted that this tooth brush is once again available.  </li>
            <li> Better at getting between teeth then my ultrasonic brush.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this brush for more than 20 years and</li>
            <li> and I am pleased to be the owner of another one.</li>
            <li> No pain, no bleeding gums, no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush handle is well balanced and feels ok in my hand,</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s OK...)</li>
            <li> and I wish it had more than one speed.</li>
            <li> I am a plaque maker &amp; this has kept my gums healthy &amp; reduced pockets.</li>
            <li> It was my favorite that I purchased from my Periodontist.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE mine.</li>
            <li> A friend gifted me a Phillips Sonic care.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Smilex and the Emmi-dent ultrasonic toothbrushes but for me this toothbrush is my favorite.</li>
            <li> /&gt;what makes it more deceptive is the pictured charging stand</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom Line - You can spend a lot more, but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a better brush.</li>
            <li> Then buy one or two more to let Conair know that they should not abandon this product.</li>
            <li> No power to speak of, the $9 spin toothbrush have WAY more power than this .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both Sonicare and Spinbrush for many years.</li>
            <li> It works, and better than alternatives -- but, yes, under powered, as others have reported.  </li>
            <li> Now my dentist keeps telling me that I need to floss more.  </li>
            <li> : I tried it again today to make sure I did not miss any thing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve missed it for many years...</li>
            <li> I’ve had one of the old Braun Interplak versions of this toothbrush for many years and always thought it the very best kind of toothbrush, really getting in where it matters.  </li>
            <li> A good intro toothbrush for those who are interested in rechargeable toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> So I did and have since then had amazing results with teeth cleanliness, fresh breath, and fighting tartar/plaque build up.  </li>
            <li> love the way it leaves my teeth feeling dentist appointment clean.</li>
            <li> : I prefer batteries that are easily replaceable with AA rechargeables.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li> For those who have loved their old Interplak, all I can say is make sure this is the identical model to what you used before.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I have no idea how it could be better than my other rotating toothbrush, but it feels great on my gums and I feel that my teeth are refreshingly clean after using</li>
            <li> This is actually my first electric toothbrush of any kind, so I am testing it without comparison to any others on the market.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes work like no other, the counter-rotating bristles are very effective.</li>
            <li> I have  work just fine.</li>
            <li> They say that replacements should be available sometime this month, in April.</li>
            <li> and she informed me that it was once again available on the Internet.</li>
            <li> However, there are much better toothbrushes out there, many of which have &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; vibration mode for gentle brushing, and I&#x27;d recommend those instead.  </li>
            <li> not as good as my old one.</li>
            <li> and I was excited to get the Conair Interplak Rechargeable.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already seeing a significant improvement there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush is powered with a rechargeable nickel cadmium battery (non-replaceable), make sure to charge the unit for 24 hours before first time use.  </li>
            <li> It was originally recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the only thing I miss, but I am sure am glad to have to have it!</li>
            <li> So if you do buy this item it will clean your teeth for three months</li>
            <li> I charged the toothbrush full (almost 24 hours and the light turned off to tell me it is full charged) and tried.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel so clean after brushing with this.</li>
            <li> Aside from that, I loved it, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d be willing to buy a new one every time the bristles wear out.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product through Amazon Vine, but I try to read and write my reviews as if I had paid the full purchase price,</li>
            <li> for I feel that is only fair for those who read and rely on reviews.</li>
            <li> the straight gear that drives the bristles comes in and out of the top of the head.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t even buy new brush heads and give this to my kids to use as I really don&#x27;t think it does a satisfactory job in providing good oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li> Setup is easy - unpackage it, plug it in, and charge it for 24 hours before the first use.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s true that the brushing action is more important than the POWER, per se.  </li>
            <li> When you use a rechargeable tooth brush with a fresh brush head, you almost always feel like you just walked out of a dental office since your teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li> A month or more ago, I did see replacements, but they cost more than twice the price of the entire toothbrush, and I didn&#x27;t see them for sale at the Conair website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As said above, your dental health provider may be able to recommend something better.</li>
            <li> I will buy several more, as funds permit, to make sure I&#x27;m covered well into the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Braun brush with the one round head does an OK job, but not as good as the NT11.</li>
            <li> the brush head was defective and fell apart within two months but was quickly replaced.</li>
            <li> the charger is at fault; I charged it on an older model and it seems to have more power.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After use, you should rinse it thoroughly while it is running, and shake it dry, to keep it in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My new Interplak is just as good as the old one with the exception of no 2 minute shut off...</li>
            <li> How they claim that this tooth brush is as effective as a manual tooth brush AND flossing is simply beyond my comprehension.  </li>
            <li> This tooth brush didn&#x27;t work right when we got.</li>
            <li> The product recharges quickly and never a hesitation that it will be ready to use when I need it.</li>
            <li> However, now that I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks, I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think most adults would find it works well enough.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> The downside is that they seem to be pretty pricey when compared to the cost of this unit, so that&#x27;s a bit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s back in production  -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad they are back</li>
            <li> SOOOOOOO glad they brought it back, and now w/ replaceable battery.</li>
            <li> I first bought one in 1997 and replaced it in 2005.  </li>
            <li> You need to charge it for 24 hours before using it the first time.  </li>
            <li> About the only interesting thing about this powered toothbrush have is its rotating brushes.</li>
            <li> This is actually a good toothbrush - but the manufacture skimped on a few things.</li>
            <li> The shafts on the both the Sonicare and Spinbrush on the other hand are thinner, hence less invasive and provide for a a more pleasant brushing experience.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not buy this unless you can find replacement brushes at a reasonable price first.</li>
            <li> There’s a slight slowing if you press, but the brushes continue to do their job perfectly nicely.  </li>
            <li> I attribute that, in large part, to the Interplak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was glad to see a new model and replacement heads were back on the market this summer (2015).  </li>
            <li> The actual unit feels very light - perhaps even a bit cheap feeling - but that&#x27;s to be expected at this price</li>
            <li> Although probably not a substitute for flossing (as with all consumer health products, ask your health provider for her or his recommendations), they&#x27;re very well designed.  </li>
            <li> I use a Waterpik to get food debris out from between my teeth, then this fellow to deal with plaque, and lastly a regular round-headed electric toothbrush to give the gums a light massage.  </li>
            <li> too much$$$.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the Conair NT11.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, if you apply too much pressure, this brush will stop.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was better than expected.  </li>
            <li> I contacted Conair, the manufacturer, and they confirmed that currently no brush heads are availble for this model..</li>
            <li> Basiicly what i wanted--counter rotating brushes and reasonable rpm, ie.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original review follows: Do not buy this unless you can find replacement brushes at a reasonable price first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a gentle electric tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, my first new unit in July 2015 was defective.  </li>
            <li> A new brush head cost the same price or more than the cost of a brand new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> other con is that the replacement heads cost more then the whole brush:/ ???</li>
            <li> This power toothbrush is unique that it works with each tuft rotates individually.</li>
            <li> at maximum, I see two sets of sharp metal teeth sticking out of the top.</li>
            <li> It definitely gets the teeth clean and does not irritate gums while doing it.  </li>
            <li> I have nursed my old NT7 along for a many years, and rebuilt the heads with brushes from older models, but finally it was time to get a new one.</li>
            <li> If I cannot easily or inexpensively replace the brush head, then I&#x27;ll be back to the old school manual toothbrush in 90 days.</li>
            <li> Going lightly, nightly brushing takes about 3-4 minutes, leaving my teeth feeling dentist-visit-clean, and that doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit since it saves me from those long and expensinve visits to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Our old one worked fine for about 5 years but the battery finally wore out.</li>
            <li> I have a problem area around an older crown</li>
            <li> And the older brushes heads</li>
            <li> She said the main thing she missed was the timer that indicated when it was time to move to another section in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> So I am set and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Soon after we got this original one it would loose power and stall on us.</li>
            <li> for some reason you want an extremely gentle toothbrush that may not brush your entire mouth without stopping a few times, and you don&#x27;t want to replace the only thing good about the product (the brush heads)</li>
            <li> This brush has 8 counter-rotating small brushes that do a great job of cleaning your teeth, and since they are small, they get between your teeth very well, too!</li>
            <li> but I bought two new ones so that I will always have one--and of course, the new ones rotate faster.  </li>
            <li> The main drawback so far is that at its website they recommend replacing the brushhead every three months, BUT they DONT MAKE or SELL replacement brushheads.</li>
            <li> I am fortunate to have purchased extra brushes several years ago.</li>
            <li> It may be appropriate for a small child with small teeth (in the brush head is small) as it has a more gentle brushing action (check with your dentist to make sure).  </li>
            <li> The battery runs out too fast, its WAY OVERPRICED TO GET A REPLACEMENT, but it works like no other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Frankly unless you have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> no excessive vibration there either</li>
            <li> I have suffered gum disease in the past and need more rigorous cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I kept thinking it wasn&#x27;t charged enough but even on first using each night it slows and is sluggish.</li>
            <li> You have to keep the pressure very light - press too hard</li>
            <li> You can buy an Oral-B Vitality for the same price (or less) and get a product that is 10x more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Basically when you twist the head onto the body, it makes it fit to tight and will stop the heads from spinning with the slightest pressure.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s OK with me, as it just reminds me I&#x27;m pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> The unit does effectively clean the teeth, altho the number of bristles is fewer than previous models.</li>
            <li> seeing my Mother have similar drama over the years, it has been a reasonable concern.</li>
            <li> Unlike the dual action of the spin brush, you get just one stroke direction.  </li>
            <li> In comparison to my current rechargeable tooth brush - this one is REALLY substandard.  </li>
            <li> I am actually surprised that they used ni-cad which is susceptible to memory</li>
            <li> My bleeding gums have healed and the dentist has noticed a marked improvement with my teeth.</li>
            <li> Then I showed her my \\&quot;old new\\&quot; tooth brush!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really wish it came with an extra brush head--</li>
            <li> The Conair has none of that, or I did not have a complete brushing session to know.</li>
            <li> I told her how I missed my old Interplak</li>
            <li> It seemed a little loud in a quiet house, but not annoyingly so.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The nice non-wired contact charger at the base is nice because the unit can get wet with use.</li>
            <li> and then you will be using a bacterial laden brush or you will throw it out and buy a new entire unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are the same as new brushes.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a big blue button on the handle that turns it on and off, so it really couldn&#x27;t be easier.</li>
            <li> brushes, as with most power toothbrushes, are expensive, though the unit itself is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I tried the best selling brand and found it to vibrate too much and cause miserable tickling on the inside of the front uppers.  </li>
            <li> Also, I noticed during the first use that the power seemed a lot lower than my other one, but I made sure it was fully charged and tried it again with the same result - slow and ineffective.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require much pressure to use this toothbrush, but any more than slight pressure causes the brushes to slow or stop altogether.</li>
            <li> my Oral-B Vitality eventually stops working (and I might add my last one lasted over 10-years before it stopped recharging), I would NEVER buy this product as there are simply too many negative aspects to it.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the brush is much shorter and just a tad harder.  </li>
            <li> I had this toothbrush back in early 90&#x27;s (paid over $100)</li>
            <li> That may be because I use them gently along with careful use of dilute hydrogen peroxide and baking soda.</li>
            <li> There is nothing more frustrating than stalling electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re serious about dental health, I would strongly recommend the Sonicare over this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this toothbrush, no other tooth brush comes close to comparison.</li>
            <li> This rechargeable toothbrush is REALLY below average.  </li>
            <li> contacted Conair about the apparent lack of replacement brush heads for this toothbrush (because I wasn&#x27;t going to buy them from the Amazon seller who was gouging the public at $79)</li>
            <li> To remedy this you just have to slide the head onto the body straight down.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s underpowered at full charge, and only comes with a single small brush head.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The older heads for a similar model sell for a few dollars each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rotation of the bristles, combined with holding it a little farther from your teeth than a normal toothbrush, makes for a lot of splashing.  </li>
            <li> I have found that Interplak brushes last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I had a very deep pocket in my upper jaw area due to an aggressive hygienist attempting deep cleaning, had got infected so instead of surgery</li>
            <li> Actually, if I had the money, I would purchase the rights to this brush from Conair and establish the NT11 as a serious competitor to the Sonic brushes that have so much more corporate money behind them.</li>
            <li> The charger is lightweight and easy to knock over if you have a small vanity area, but it does have a very small footprint.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not terribly loud.</li>
            <li> In addition, the shaft is too wide, especially on the end closer to the handle.</li>
            <li> As a long time Sonicare user, I can tell you this: Forget this one and buy the Sonicare instead.</li>
            <li> In fact, after a few uses I went back to my old (other name brand) brush.</li>
            <li> Although it is an affordable product - it can&#x27;t hold a candle to some other name brand (similarly priced) rechargeable toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I have had more expensive power toothbrushes and this one beats them all!</li>
            <li> The power level when fully charged is poor and it&#x27;s much louder than my current rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> However, when an electric toothbrush is so weak that it stops when it accidentally rubs against your  inner mouth, when it&#x27;s so weak that it barely moves when used with toothpaste, when it&#x27;s so weak that you don&#x27;t feel you&#x27;re really getting your teeth clean...</li>
            <li> And like other reviewers, I’ve been afraid recently that it might be no longer available.  </li>
            <li> so I tried a half dozen different models including the sonic variety, but nothing worked well</li>
            <li> When brushing, you don&#x27;t have to put much pressure on the brush head before the rotating bristles REALLY slow down</li>
            <li> Glad they finally started making these again, it was getting frustrating buying heads off of eBay for my old model, they were getting very expensive.</li>
            <li> I only use a little baking soda, so tooth paste.</li>
            <li> well, there&#x27;s not much point in buying</li>
            <li> I do like the non-slip rubbery grip of the handle although it could feel heavy and big for kids.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She kept measuring a few times and was amazed and asked me what was I doing different....</li>
            <li> It does not feature ultrasound as other models do.  </li>
            <li> Other sources of information suggest they will be, but that is NOT what the supervisor of customer service  said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then, a few years ago, no replacement heads where available, so I discarded the old base.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve avoided the electric toothbrushes due to very sensitive gums and a fear of irritating them or causing outright pain -after</li>
            <li> To get them to stop altogether, you have to press absurdly hard, and I would think Conair would have health and safety issues if they were making a product that allowed people to scrub into their gums at such pressure.  </li>
            <li> The thick shaft make brushing the back teeth feel invasive.</li>
            <li> doesnt give the annoying vibrations most do.  </li>
            <li> I gave the replacement unit only 3 stars because it has a very weak motor and the speed is slow compared my two older Interplak models!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RMM</li>
            <li> As some reviewers have mentioned, It does bog down.  </li>
            <li> Doing as described makes it work as it should, without bogging down.  </li>
            <li> It does, indeed, reach down between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> But this one I think I&#x27;ve had for a week now, charged it for 3 days and it still acts like the battery is dying and slows down when I start brushing, even almost stops.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will agree with other reviewers that it is a little bit underpowered</li>
            <li> But rotating brush head is also its major weakness: It is so underpowered that if you press it a little hard (very little) to your teeth and the thing stops.</li>
            <li> Well, I don&#x27;t know if Conair will discontinue this brush anytime soon, and I don&#x27;t want to be stuck settling for less.</li>
            <li> Other brands with a round brush do not adequately clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just too little</li>
            <li> This makes the handle a little bulgy.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush stopped with just a little bit of pressure.</li>
            <li> It took me a few days to get used to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really messy.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush was not made for a few years.</li>
            <li> My trouble area are my lower front teeth.</li>
            <li> I contacted customer service and NO they are not available.</li>
            <li> I wasted money on the purchase of two of these .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conair seems to not care about customer service - calling to find a replacement head, the agent just said they are not available - And won&#x27;t be.  </li>
            <li> So, I bought a Sonic Care system and have been using that for the past few years.  </li>
            <li> It does slow down when using tooth paste.</li>
            <li> and my teeth are very tight.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed at the low power of the battery, as it sounds as if it is only half charged, but 48 hours is no better than 24.  </li>
            <li> When I use this toothbrush, however, even a small amount of pressure will cause the device to stall.  </li>
            <li> I use a small amount of toothpaste with it and haven&#x27;t had any issues with clogging or stalling.</li>
            <li> Although the charging base has a location for 2 extra brush heads (which I like), the brush heads themselves do not come with any type of a band (like the Oral-B does) to designate a different color for each user.  </li>
            <li> Tartar and plaque are hard to remove unless the brush can reach between the teeth.</li>
            <li> The rotation slows if you press the gum/teeth too hard with it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what Conair was thinking, but this is the worst toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used, with the possible exception of some completely flimsy manual one the dentist hand out when we were kids.  </li>
            <li> am living proof on how it works at least, for me!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was forced to find another brush</li>
            <li> No, in my opinion it&#x27;s not, but it&#x27;s also significantly less expensive.</li>
            <li> I hate those vibrating ones they dont work at all.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem is they dont have replacements sometimes and when they do they are clearly trying to gouge us...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Forget about the Sonic brushes... I tried one when they first came out, and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Even worse, I can find a place to buy substitute brush heads</li>
            <li> My biggest disappointment is having trouble locating replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> He was not happy they stopped making them.</li>
            <li> it looses charge after 3-4 days if left off the base.</li>
            <li> This in additional to expensive and tough to find brush head (as I heard) make the Conair not a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad they&#x27;re saddled with such a bad motor.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it has become difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that this rechargeable toothbrush could replace my Arm &amp; Hammer battery operated spin brush, but unfortunately it can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I’m posting this review to say that, having bought one of these Conair models now, I find nothing at all wrong with the motor.  </li>
            <li> It is also hard to remove from base.</li>
            <li> So I was disappointed when it re-appeared, but with some users complaining of too weak a motor.  </li>
            <li> my teeth do feel cleaner, so that can&#x27;t be bad.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are simply a bad design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The area has improved a lot and now it is no longer painful to chew.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the performance of the Conair NT11.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed, if you use it correctly.</li>
            <li> base has a place for two toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> I HATE FLOSSING.  </li>
            <li> It should be noted that you have to keep it on the base at all times...</li>
            <li> and I hated the noise and vibration...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great all around brush.  Better at getting between teeth then my ultrasonic brush.  As some reviewers have mentioned, It does bog down.  Mine  would stop with the pressure from my cheeks.  I was going to return it but got to tinkering with it.  What I found should help some others.  Basically when you twist the head onto the body, it makes it fit to tight and will stop the heads from spinning with the slightest pressure.  To remedy this you just have to slide the head onto the body straight down.  Do not turn(screw) the head.  Doing as described makes it work as it should, without bogging down.  Hope this helps someone thinking about returning this great brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only other con is that the replacement heads cost more then the whole brush:/ ???</li>
            <li> For those who have loved their old Interplak, all I can say is make sure this is the identical model to what you used before.  I don&#x27;t know what Conair was thinking, but this is the worst toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used, with the possible exception of some completely flimsy manual one the dentist hand out when we were kids.  There&#x27;s just too little power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it&#x27;s true that the brushing action is more important than the POWER, per se.  We&#x27;re not talking horsepower here.  However, when an electric toothbrush is so weak that it stops when it accidentally rubs against your  inner mouth, when it&#x27;s so weak that it barely moves when used with toothpaste, when it&#x27;s so weak that you don&#x27;t feel you&#x27;re really getting your teeth clean...well, there&#x27;s not much point in buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this toothbrush is the eight-bristle brush-one of the best I&#x27;ve used. It does, indeed, reach down between your teeth.  Although probably not a substitute for flossing (as with all consumer health products, ask your health provider for her or his recommendations), they&#x27;re very well designed.  Too bad they&#x27;re saddled with such a bad motor.  Even worse, I can find a place to buy substitute brush heads The ones pictured here on Amazon.com aren&#x27;t the same as the 8-bristle brush that comes with this.  A month or more ago, I did see replacements, but they cost more than twice the price of the entire toothbrush, and I didn&#x27;t see them for sale at the Conair website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If for some reason you want an extremely gentle toothbrush that may not brush your entire mouth without stopping a few times, and you don&#x27;t want to replace the only thing good about the product (the brush heads), you might want to purchase this. However, there are much better toothbrushes out there, many of which have &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; vibration mode for gentle brushing, and I&#x27;d recommend those instead.  As said above, your dental health provider may be able to recommend something better.</li>
            <li> Best plaque remover on the market.  Whirling bristles get between teeth and below gum line.  Works like a good flossing.  Have been using this brush for more than 20 years and my dental check ups show the great results.  Unfortunately it has become difficult to find.  Best Mechanical Toothbrush on the Market</li>
            <li> Hurrah, my Interplak toothbrush arrived at my door today which made me very happy.  It is a great toothbrush and I am pleased to be the owner of another one.</li>
            <li> This is actually my first electric toothbrush of any kind, so I am testing it without comparison to any others on the market. I&#x27;ve avoided the electric toothbrushes due to very sensitive gums and a fear of irritating them or causing outright pain -after seeing my Mother have similar drama over the years, it has been a reasonable concern. That being said, after using this Conair Interplak brush four times consecutively, I am very pleased! The vibration is not so severe that the machine is scouring my gums, but the bristles rotate in opposing directions so it definitely cleans thoroughly. No pain, no bleeding gums, no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush handle is well balanced and feels ok in my hand, no excessive vibration there either and it&#x27;s not terribly loud. The charger is lightweight and easy to knock over if you have a small vanity area, but it does have a very small footprint. I like this brush and I will continue to use it - my teeth do feel cleaner, so that can&#x27;t be bad. My only caveat (and one star deduction) is the seeming difficulty in locating replacement brush heads in the future. I looked on Amazon and at two local stores this morning and saw none yet. If I cannot easily or inexpensively replace the brush head, then I&#x27;ll be back to the old school manual toothbrush in 90 days.</li>
            <li> It turned out to be brushes for a toothbrush that is no longer made.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this rechargeable toothbrush could replace my Arm &amp; Hammer battery operated spin brush, but unfortunately it can&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s underpowered at full charge, and only comes with a single small brush head.  Unlike the dual action of the spin brush, you get just one stroke direction.  It does not feature ultrasound as other models do.  Frankly unless you have very sensitive teeth I don&#x27;t think most adults would find it works well enough.  It may be appropriate for a small child with small teeth (in the brush head is small) as it has a more gentle brushing action (check with your dentist to make sure).  I have suffered gum disease in the past and need more rigorous cleaning.  When I use this toothbrush, however, even a small amount of pressure will cause the device to stall.  There is nothing more frustrating than stalling electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned but I like it a lot. A dental office recommended that I get an electric toothbrush and I was excited to get the Conair Interplak Rechargeable. It cleans my teeth quickly and feels great while it works. I use Tom&#x27;s toothpaste which doesn&#x27;t feel gritty at all and washes away with no residue. It seemed a little loud in a quiet house, but not annoyingly so.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it leaves my teeth feeling dentist appointment clean. My biggest disappointment is having trouble locating replacement brushes. Even the ones on the con air site didn&#x27;t look like the one that came with this brush. Aside from that, I loved it, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d be willing to buy a new one every time the bristles wear out.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush provides thorough cleaning and leaves teeth feeling great! What&#x27;s unique about this brush is that each tuft of bristles on the brush head revolves separately, and it truly does do a good job. Setup is easy - unpackage it, plug it in, and charge it for 24 hours before the first use. There&#x27;s a big blue button on the handle that turns it on and off, so it really couldn&#x27;t be easier. The actual unit feels very light - perhaps even a bit cheap feeling - but that&#x27;s to be expected at this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush only comes with one brush head, so you&#x27;ll need to invest in replacements soon after your initial purchase. The downside is that they seem to be pretty pricey when compared to the cost of this unit, so that&#x27;s a bit disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good rechargeable toothbrush for the price. Is it as good as a Sonicare? No, in my opinion it&#x27;s not, but it&#x27;s also significantly less expensive. A good intro toothbrush for those who are interested in rechargeable toothbrushes. I did receive this product through Amazon Vine, but I try to read and write my reviews as if I had paid the full purchase price, for I feel that is only fair for those who read and rely on reviews.</li>
            <li> It took me a few days to get used to this toothbrush. You have to keep the pressure very light - press too hard and it stops working. The rotation of the bristles, combined with holding it a little farther from your teeth than a normal toothbrush, makes for a lot of splashing.  However, now that I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks, I like it very much. The Conair Interplak is excellent at cleaning between teeth and just under the gum line.  I have a problem area around an older crown and I&#x27;m already seeing a significant improvement there. I use a small amount of toothpaste with it and haven&#x27;t had any issues with clogging or stalling.</li>
            <li> This rechargeable toothbrush is REALLY below average.  You can buy an Oral-B Vitality for the same price (or less) and get a product that is 10x more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of my disappointments with this product are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The power level when fully charged is poor and it&#x27;s much louder than my current rechargeable toothbrush.  When brushing, you don&#x27;t have to put much pressure on the brush head before the rotating bristles REALLY slow down (I swear I though they were going to stop rotating).  How they claim that this tooth brush is as effective as a manual tooth brush AND flossing is simply beyond my comprehension.  The power level puts me to mind of what you would expect from a battery operated tooth brush that is beginning to run out of juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. There is not a 2-minute timer on this tooth brush (Once you have a timer where the toothbrush vibrates to notify you that you reached your recommended brushing time - you&#x27;ll NEVER want an electric toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t have this feature).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Although the charging base has a location for 2 extra brush heads (which I like), the brush heads themselves do not come with any type of a band (like the Oral-B does) to designate a different color for each user.  Unless you write the user&#x27;s name on the brush head with a Sharpie, you&#x27;ll never know which brush head belongs to which family member (Gross!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  It&#x27;s really messy.  When you brush your front teeth, the bristles spray toothpaste foam/saliva because of a hole in the front of the bristle head (Again - Gross).  I never had this problem with my Oral-B.  The brush heads are simply a bad design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  In comparison to my current rechargeable tooth brush - this one is REALLY substandard.  When you use a rechargeable tooth brush with a fresh brush head, you almost always feel like you just walked out of a dental office since your teeth feel so clean.  This product simply does not deliver the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my Oral-B Vitality eventually stops working (and I might add my last one lasted over 10-years before it stopped recharging), I would NEVER buy this product as there are simply too many negative aspects to it.  I won&#x27;t even buy new brush heads and give this to my kids to use as I really don&#x27;t think it does a satisfactory job in providing good oral hygiene.  Although it is an affordable product - it can&#x27;t hold a candle to some other name brand (similarly priced) rechargeable toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this toothbrush, no other tooth brush comes close to comparison. Cleans my teeth like I just came from the dentist..love it</li>
            <li> I’ve had one of the old Braun Interplak versions of this toothbrush for many years and always thought it the very best kind of toothbrush, really getting in where it matters.  And like other reviewers, I’ve been afraid recently that it might be no longer available.  So I was disappointed when it re-appeared, but with some users complaining of too weak a motor.  I’m posting this review to say that, having bought one of these Conair models now, I find nothing at all wrong with the motor.  There’s a slight slowing if you press, but the brushes continue to do their job perfectly nicely.  To get them to stop altogether, you have to press absurdly hard, and I would think Conair would have health and safety issues if they were making a product that allowed people to scrub into their gums at such pressure.  I use a Waterpik to get food debris out from between my teeth, then this fellow to deal with plaque, and lastly a regular round-headed electric toothbrush to give the gums a light massage.  I’m delighted with this routine and with my purchase of this item.  (Later note:  Well, as the battery charge lowers, there does begin to be a problem.  But it&#x27;s OK...)</li>
            <li> Well made, sturdy.  Does excellent job of cleaning</li>
            <li> The battery runs out too fast, its WAY OVERPRICED TO GET A REPLACEMENT, but it works like no other toothbrush. I hate those vibrating ones they dont work at all.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem is they dont have replacements sometimes and when they do they are clearly trying to gouge us...too much$$$.</li>
            <li> Glad they finally started making these again, it was getting frustrating buying heads off of eBay for my old model, they were getting very expensive. These toothbrushes work like no other, the counter-rotating bristles are very effective. Great for my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will agree with other reviewers that it is a little bit underpowered and I wish it had more than one speed. But nonetheless it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the performance of the Conair NT11.  I let it go over my teeth and do not press, however, it stops and starts a lot. I would never buy these again</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush EVER!  I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s back in production  - that I bought 3.  You can order replacement heads from Conair for $29.95/ package of two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this daily - since 1980&#x27;s! I&#x27;ve tried all of the big brands out there &amp; they can&#x27;t compare to the cleaning you get with the Interplak with this style toothbrush. This is different than the InterPlak OptiClean. I am a plaque maker &amp; this has kept my gums healthy &amp; reduced pockets. Using this for 2 weeks changed one of my children&#x27;s visits from a periodontal scaling to a regular cleaning. I won&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
            <li> This power toothbrush is unique that it works with each tuft rotates individually. I noticed that the brush is much shorter and just a tad harder.  Honestly, I have no idea how it could be better than my other rotating toothbrush, but it feels great on my gums and I feel that my teeth are refreshingly clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is powered with a rechargeable nickel cadmium battery (non-replaceable), make sure to charge the unit for 24 hours before first time use.  This makes the handle a little bulgy.  I do like the non-slip rubbery grip of the handle although it could feel heavy and big for kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base has a place for two toothbrush heads.  It came with only one brush head.  You can buy an extra head if you want or you may need another one for another user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I prefer batteries that are easily replaceable with AA rechargeables.  This brush would need to be replaced when the battery dies.  I am actually surprised that they used ni-cad which is susceptible to memory effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;120V only. Made in China.</li>
            <li> I asked two dental hygienist and then my dentist the best product to buy in this category and everyone of them before I had this available to review said &#x27;pick the Conair&#x27;.  So I did and have since then had amazing results with teeth cleanliness, fresh breath, and fighting tartar/plaque build up.  The product recharges quickly and never a hesitation that it will be ready to use when I need it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this brush. In fact, after a few uses I went back to my old (other name brand) brush. The cap over the brush doesn&#x27;t stay put and doesn&#x27;t cover the brush well enough to keep crud out. Also, I noticed during the first use that the power seemed a lot lower than my other one, but I made sure it was fully charged and tried it again with the same result - slow and ineffective.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to have enough power when in your mouth. It almost shuts off if your mouth closes at all.</li>
            <li> Soon after we got this original one it would loose power and stall on us. I kept thinking it wasn&#x27;t charged enough but even on first using each night it slows and is sluggish.It is also hard to remove from base. It looks like the ones we  have bought for years but the quality isn&#x27;t nearly as good.Our old one worked fine for about 5 years but the battery finally wore out.</li>
            <li> I always loved my Interplak from before. But this one I think I&#x27;ve had for a week now, charged it for 3 days and it still acts like the battery is dying and slows down when I start brushing, even almost stops. I only use a little baking soda, so tooth paste. It must be defective.</li>
            <li> The Interplak works wonders on my teeth! I have had more expensive power toothbrushes and this one beats them all! It cleans your teeth amazingly well!</li>
            <li> Using this product makes my teeth feel like I just had a periodontal cleaning.  I have been using this product for well over 30 years, having to replace it only twice. It was originally recommended by my dentist. When I could no longer find it at my local pharmacy I panicked and was relieved to find it on Amazon.com.  I&#x27;m tempted to purchase a second unit to prepare for the future, in case Conair stops making them, they are THAT good!</li>
            <li> the straight gear that drives the bristles comes in and out of the top of the head. at maximum, I see two sets of sharp metal teeth sticking out of the top. this is gonna hurt someone, sooner or later. I had this toothbrush back in early 90&#x27;s (paid over $100) but back then it had 10 bristles, now it has 8.  it almost looks like they reduced the bristle count but not shortened the gear to reduce cost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;scary conair. fix it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was not made for a few years. It was my favorite that I purchased from my Periodontist. He was not happy they stopped making them. I&#x27;m so glad they are back and I LOVE mine. And the older brushes heads I have  work just fine. So I am set and highly recommend it. A friend gifted me a Phillips Sonic care. I much prefer the Conair NT11.&lt;br /&gt;Happy dance from me!</li>
            <li> have to keep adjusting brush head so it will keep running. not as good as my old one.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Smilex and the Emmi-dent ultrasonic toothbrushes but for me this toothbrush is my favorite. The toothbrush cleans my teeth on all sides and under the gums. My trouble area are my lower front teeth. Tartar and plaque are hard to remove unless the brush can reach between the teeth. The counter rotating bristle tufts is a wonderful invention and solves that problem. My bleeding gums have healed and the dentist has noticed a marked improvement with my teeth. I had a very deep pocket in my upper jaw area due to an aggressive hygienist attempting deep cleaning, had got infected so instead of surgery I used my Smilex brush and Conair. The area has improved a lot and now it is no longer painful to chew. I wish this brush continues to available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife saw it and she wanted one for her implants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush works best with just water.</li>
            <li> I love the way my teeth feel so clean.  I credit it to the 8 individual rotating tufts.  I was a bit disappointed at the low power of the battery, as it sounds as if it is only half charged, but 48 hours is no better than 24.  But if this one died, I&#x27;d buy another.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, you will spend no time in the dentist chair using this toothbrush.  My Hygienist thinks it&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great on the gums as well as the teeth. I&#x27;ve used this brush for about 10 years and there is nothing close to it on the market that cleans your teeth, massage your gums and keeps the plaque off like this brush does.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!  They finally brought it back.&lt;br /&gt;I now eat 10 meals a day so I can brush with this wonderful instrument after each meal.</li>
            <li> The unit does effectively clean the teeth, altho the number of bristles is fewer than previous models. The main drawback so far is that at its website they recommend replacing the brushhead every three months, BUT they DONT MAKE or SELL replacement brushheads. I contacted customer service and NO they are not available. I even wrote the vice-president of marketing an actual snail mail letter and havent had a reply in two weeks. So if you do buy this item it will clean your teeth for three months and then you will be using a bacterial laden brush or you will throw it out and buy a new entire unit.&lt;br /&gt;what makes it more deceptive is the pictured charging stand shows two cutouts for storing two brusheads, which arent supplied and cant be purchased.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. They don&#x27;t make replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> So happy to see that this toothbrush is still available! I have nursed my old NT7 along for a many years, and rebuilt the heads with brushes from older models, but finally it was time to get a new one. Saw the NT11 here on Amazon and bought TWO!! Why two? Well, I don&#x27;t know if Conair will discontinue this brush anytime soon, and I don&#x27;t want to be stuck settling for less. I will buy several more, as funds permit, to make sure I&#x27;m covered well into the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget about the Sonic brushes... I tried one when they first came out, and was very disappointed. The Braun brush with the one round head does an OK job, but not as good as the NT11. This brush has 8 counter-rotating small brushes that do a great job of cleaning your teeth, and since they are small, they get between your teeth very well, too! I use Pepsondent tootpaste and load the brush with it. Yes, if you apply too much pressure, this brush will stop. That&#x27;s OK with me, as it just reminds me I&#x27;m pressing too hard. Going lightly, nightly brushing takes about 3-4 minutes, leaving my teeth feeling dentist-visit-clean, and that doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit since it saves me from those long and expensinve visits to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After use, you should rinse it thoroughly while it is running, and shake it dry, to keep it in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line - You can spend a lot more, but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a better brush. Go ahead and buy one... You won&#x27;t be disappointed, if you use it correctly. Then buy one or two more to let Conair know that they should not abandon this product. Actually, if I had the money, I would purchase the rights to this brush from Conair and establish the NT11 as a serious competitor to the Sonic brushes that have so much more corporate money behind them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at all. No power to speak of, the $9 spin toothbrush have WAY more power than this . I wasted money on the purchase of two of these . I don&#x27;t like wasting money!</li>
            <li> I was very glad to see this on the market again--my very favorite electric toothbrush. Shipping was fast. the brush head was defective and fell apart within two months but was quickly replaced.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush EVER! I have used EVERY form of power/manual toothbrush from rotary, to sonic to side to side vibration. NONE have left the cleanliness of this toothbrush! SOOOOOOO glad they brought it back, and now w/ replaceable battery. You can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both Sonicare and Spinbrush for many years. Compared to these toothbrushes, I find this Conair Interplak Toothbrush woefully under-powered. In addition, the shaft is too wide, especially on the end closer to the handle. The thick shaft make brushing the back teeth feel invasive. The shafts on the both the Sonicare and Spinbrush on the other hand are thinner, hence less invasive and provide for a a more pleasant brushing experience. If you&#x27;re serious about dental health, I would strongly recommend the Sonicare over this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It works, and better than alternatives -- but, yes, under powered, as others have reported.  Maybe not the battery, but the charger is at fault; I charged it on an older model and it seems to have more power.  Still recommend it and hope manufacturers read our comments and continue production. Yep, I&#x27;d purchase another.</li>
            <li> I started using Interplak years ago.  My dentist couldn&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t floss.  He said, &amp;#34;whatever you&#x27;re doing, keep doing it&amp;#34;.  One day my battery wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore and I discovered that they no longer made Interplak.  So, I bought a Sonic Care system and have been using that for the past few years.  Now my dentist keeps telling me that I need to floss more.  I HATE FLOSSING.  I still have my wisdom teeth and my teeth are very tight.  Please bring back the Interplak!!!</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled to see this tooth brush made it back!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am living proof on how it works at least, for me!!!&lt;br /&gt;I use to have this toothbrush back when Bausch and Lomb manufactured it... Then they sold the tooth brush section to Conair...&lt;br /&gt;I bought one years ago and it died and I thought, well this is it!!&lt;br /&gt;So I started looking for a replacement!!&lt;br /&gt;All the tooth brushes that said rotating were NOT!!!&lt;br /&gt;So recently I looked again, because I have periodontal disease and I need a rotating brush.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it ten days ago and when I went to have my teeth cleaned, the hygienist could not believe it!! Some of my deep pockets (6 and 7 ) were now 3 and 4!! Yes!! She kept measuring a few times and was amazed and asked me what was I doing different....Then I showed her my \\&quot;old new\\&quot; tooth brush!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I bought 3 more, just in case they stop making them...&lt;br /&gt;I called the company and I was told they do sell the head brushes and YES the toothbrush is on production!!!&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone out there with my same \\&quot;problem\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Hint: I use water only with this tooth brush, and tooth paste with a different one ( a manual or a vibrating tooth brush It does slow down when using tooth paste. Some times I use a mixture of water and peroxide, but never tooth paste!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was better than expected.  The dual brushes helped the cleaning in between of my son&#x27;s braces with no problem. Very satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> I contacted Conair, the manufacturer, and they confirmed that currently no brush heads are availble for this model.. They say that replacements should be available sometime this month, in April. Trust but verify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, it&#x27;s not for brushing like a regular toothbrush. It doesn&#x27;t require much pressure to use this toothbrush, but any more than slight pressure causes the brushes to slow or stop altogether. Seems to work well if used with care.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I was delighted that this tooth brush is once again available.  I tried the best selling brand and found it to vibrate too much and cause miserable tickling on the inside of the front uppers.  Other brands with a round brush do not adequately clean my teeth.  The two Interplaks I bought 10 years ago are still working but I bought two new ones so that I will always have one--and of course, the new ones rotate faster.  I am told by my hygienist that my mouth is &amp;#34;impeccably clean.&amp;#34;  I attribute that, in large part, to the Interplak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional brushes, as with most power toothbrushes, are expensive, though the unit itself is reasonably priced.  I am fortunate to have purchased extra brushes several years ago. They are the same as new brushes. I have found that Interplak brushes last a long time.  That may be because I use them gently along with careful use of dilute hydrogen peroxide and baking soda. I also use floss and a gum stimulator.</li>
            <li> Basiicly what i wanted--counter rotating brushes and reasonable rpm, ie. doesnt give the annoying vibrations most do.  However, the battery seems a bit underpowered.</li>
            <li> This is actually a good toothbrush - but the manufacture skimped on a few things. It is under powered - probably should run at twice the voltage. (I plan to modify mine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair seems to not care about customer service - calling to find a replacement head, the agent just said they are not available - And won&#x27;t be.  Other sources of information suggest they will be, but that is NOT what the supervisor of customer service  said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears that they are discontinuing this unit and have no replacement in the works.  They have no problem selling the unit and leaving their customers without supplies.</li>
            <li> I first bought one in 1997 and replaced it in 2005.  I rarely had a cavity while using them, plus it gave a great gum massage!  Then, a few years ago, no replacement heads where available, so I discarded the old base.  I was glad to see a new model and replacement heads were back on the market this summer (2015).  HOWEVER, my first new unit in July 2015 was defective.  I returned it and got replacement.  I gave the replacement unit only 3 stars because it has a very weak motor and the speed is slow compared my two older Interplak models!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RMM</li>
            <li> Update review: 3/17/15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Conair about the apparent lack of replacement brush heads for this toothbrush (because I wasn&#x27;t going to buy them from the Amazon seller who was gouging the public at $79) and they got back to me and told me that this tooth brush, the NT8, takes the same brush heads as the NT11.  The compatible brush heads are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00OPENLOY Conair NT11BC Interplak By Conair Rechargeable Power Toothbrush Replacement Brush Heads]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses this tooth brush and likes it a lot.  She started using it when her Philips E-Series died.  She said the main thing she missed was the timer that indicated when it was time to move to another section in your mouth.  Otherwise, she is very happy with the toothbrush and now that I know where to get replacement brush heads, I&#x27;m very happy with this tooth brush as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review follows: Do not buy this unless you can find replacement brushes at a reasonable price first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I have to review this based upon the availability of replacement brush heads.  A new brush head cost the same price or more than the cost of a brand new toothbrush.  This makes this a disposable toothbrush which is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older heads for a similar model sell for a few dollars each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this unless you can find replacement brushes at a reasonable price first.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle electric tooth brush.  It definitely gets the teeth clean and does not irritate gums while doing it.  You need to charge it for 24 hours before using it the first time.  It works, charges with no hassle at all.  I really wish it came with an extra brush head--you get just one and you are supposed to replace it regularly.</li>
            <li> As a long time Sonicare user, I can tell you this: Forget this one and buy the Sonicare instead. Your teeth and gums will thank you for the wise choice. About the only interesting thing about this powered toothbrush have is its rotating brushes. But rotating brush head is also its major weakness: It is so underpowered that if you press it a little hard (very little) to your teeth and the thing stops. The tooth brush does not have enough power to keep rotating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Sonicare, you have quarter-pause and 2-minute timer. Every 30 seconds Sonicare tells you to switch side and your brushing session always last 2 minutes. And the cleanliness you feel after brushing is priceless. The Conair has none of that, or I did not have a complete brushing session to know. I charged the toothbrush full (almost 24 hours and the light turned off to tell me it is full charged) and tried. It only took 15 seconds for me to know that this doesn&#x27;t work for me and probably never will. I kept having to move the toothbrush aways from my teeth for it to contiue working. This in additional to expensive and tough to find brush head (as I heard) make the Conair not a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/12/15 UPDATE: I tried it again today to make sure I did not miss any thing. I left it plugged in for longer 24 hrs to ensure the battery is fully charged. Then squeezed a pea size toothpaste on it. Same result! The toothbrush stopped with just a little bit of pressure. It now definitely will be retired to the garage waiting for a trip to Goodwill.</li>
            <li> So good to have the Interplak as part of my oral health program. Teeth feel so clean after brushing with this. I, personally, don&#x27;t put toothpaste on the Interplak brush, rather I put it on my manual brush, brush around my teeth, then use the Interplak. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love it! Years ago I used an Interplak electric toothbrush until I couldn&#x27;t find replacement brushes or the brush itselff anymore.... figured it went off the market. It was the best and I&#x27;ve missed it for many years... always a great report with my dentist and no issues whatsoever. I was forced to find another brush so I tried a half dozen different models including the sonic variety, but nothing worked well and I hated the noise and vibration... gave them all away and went back to a manual brush. Then on my last visit to the dentist the hygenist said I was showing wear from my manual brush. I told her how I missed my old Interplak and she informed me that it was once again available on the Internet. I was thrilled! Immediately bought 3 of them... don&#x27;t want to take a chance of doing without again. My new Interplak is just as good as the old one with the exception of no 2 minute shut off... that&#x27;s the only thing I miss, but I am sure am glad to have to have it!</li>
            <li> This tooth brush didn&#x27;t work right when we got. But we finally got it working some what.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Had been looking for this toothbrush for awhile.  Have to order replacement heads.</li>
            <li> This works great with my gel Colgate toothpaste. The rotation slows if you press the gum/teeth too hard with it so I guess it self regulates the pressure. The nice non-wired contact charger at the base is nice because the unit can get wet with use. It should be noted that you have to keep it on the base at all times...it looses charge after 3-4 days if left off the base.</li>
