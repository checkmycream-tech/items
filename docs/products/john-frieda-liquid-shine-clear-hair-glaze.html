            <li>And it was fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I thought conditioner was going to leave my hair really smooth</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I ordered this thinking it was going to be a glaze that&#x27;s applied similarly to an at home hair dye, but I was happily suprised to find that it&#x27;s applied just like shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair came out smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I love this color glaze, it rinses out easily and really adds shine to my hair.  </li>

            <li>My hair is so soft and manageable and vey healthy!  </li>
            <li>Noticed a difference right away!  </li>
            <li>A GREAT find and money well spent!</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair super shiny.  </li>
            <li>This is best used once or twice a month, before shampooing, where you let it set in slightly damp hair for 45 minutes; Then rinse out and shampoo and condition as normal.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>This keeps my often slightly frizzy hair under control and also gives it a great shine.</li>

            <li>I love that it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li>Will need try the rest of the bottle to see if it is worth it to buy again.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and no harsh smells / chemicals.</li>

            <li>I really wanted to like this but be aware that the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; that this gives your hair is from tiny bits of glitter.</li>
            <li>At first I used it a couple times a week, but now I only use it every couple of weeks.  </li>

            <li> I am a believer in this product and will no long have to pay the added cost to have it done in the salon.,</li>
            <li> I decided to try it first after washing/conditioning and let stay on for just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I finally stopped coloring my prematurely grey hair and wanted to bring some shine and life to my silver strands.</li>
            <li> I tend to use it on dry hair and leave it in during the day and then wash it out later.</li>
            <li> But it definitely makes your hair shinier if you leave on for 20 to 30 minutes when your hair is dry and then wash it out, for the weekly treatment.  </li>
            <li> I have very coarse, dry curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> The first bottles I used had unpleasant odor, and the glaze was dull, but the latest bottles of glaze</li>
            <li> Was cautiously optimistic but wanted some oomph for my grey hair.</li>
            <li> If you color and your hair is already dry, I think you will have a problem.  </li>
            <li> My hair tend to be dry</li>
            <li> There are instructions for a once a week application in which you put it on dry hair and leave it on 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I had dry, damaged, fly-away hair before I used it.  </li>
            <li> I applied to dry hair and waited 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I apply to dry hair, leave it on for 20 minutes per the instructions.  </li>
            <li> but I prefer to do the weekly on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I could not live without it now.</li>
            <li> brunette color glaze version was a disaster - made my hair terribly dry and tangled!.</li>
            <li> I opted to put it on my dry hair and leave it on about 20 minutes before washing it, and what an improvement!  </li>
            <li> I can buy the product for a lot less than the drug and beauty stores locally even with the shipping fees included!  </li>
            <li> I really like the product, just not happy with the supplier.</li>
            <li> I use a quarter-sized amount in the shower after briefly rinsing out my conditioner, leaving it in for a few minutes while I wash up.  </li>
            <li> Be careful you don&#x27;t get it in your eyes, though.</li>
            <li> so I am putting it on wet, after conditioning, each time I wash.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t give me the glaze I expected.  </li>
            <li> it can be used on wet hair every time</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to blow dry or curl it anymore, just comb it and let it dry with a little Matrix Sleek Look conditioner.</li>
            <li> I had gone through a home coloring period in my 20&#x27;s that was not pretty.  </li>
            <li> but it was the other way around.  </li>
            <li> One bottle will last me 2 uses I have medium short hair but very thick.</li>
            <li> Since I have fairly thin hair the extra body it gives without extra weight makes me look like my hair is fuller.</li>
            <li> I usually need a lot to make my wet hair dry shiny, but when I do, it works.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff. It makes my hair smooth, soft, silky and shiny. Since I have fairly thin hair the extra body it gives without extra weight makes me look like my hair is fuller. I have been using it for 3 years at least, and it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for me!</li>
            <li> I was supposed to receive a pack of two.  I received an open pack of 1.  I wrote to the company and they were very nice and said that would resend a new shipment to me.  As of today, I still have not received the replacement shipment.  I really like the product, just not happy with the supplier.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST thing I have ever found for my hair. I could not live without it now. Leaves my hair soft and shiny. We have hard water and this product has totally changed my hair. I love it.</li>
            <li> weighted down hair....a lot of product build up....never produced any shine</li>
            <li> love this product!  I read a review of it on Paula&#x27;s Choice, and have used it now for about a year on my color-treated hair.  Makes my humidity-affected hair sleek and smooth.  I use a quarter-sized amount in the shower after briefly rinsing out my conditioner, leaving it in for a few minutes while I wash up.  A brief rinse (5-10 seconds) and I&#x27;m outta there!</li>
            <li> This product was very drying to my hair and it did nothing to make it shine.  If you color and your hair is already dry, I think you will have a problem.  At least I did.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week and gives my hair the shine it desperately needs!</li>
            <li> I love this color glaze, it rinses out easily and really adds shine to my hair.  Be careful you don&#x27;t get it in your eyes, though.</li>
            <li> Amazing product for my previously unmanageable gray hair! Tames it and makes it shiny. I don&#x27;t even have to blow dry or curl it anymore, just comb it and let it dry with a little Matrix Sleek Look conditioner.</li>
            <li> Felt like gummy glue left in my hair.  Also made my hair greasy and didn&#x27;t help with static.  I saw no difference in shine.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Left it in my hair for an hour and when I rinsed it off and blow dried it was very shiny ! In my case the &amp;#34;glossy&amp;#34; look only lasted one week. One bottle will last me 2 uses I have medium short hair but very thick.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the $45 glaze treatment at my salon. Works best if you use an unlined shower cap and apply heat with blower dryer. It&#x27;s not a miracle, I still also mist my hair with shine spray when I want extra shine.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price as there are two bottles.  I tend to use it on dry hair and leave it in during the day and then wash it out later. Does not dry out my hair.  My hair tend to be dry and I do have highlights.  The highlights pop again and it perks up my roots as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that it would add shine and body to my hair.  It has worked exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I had gone to a new salon and forgot to ask for a clear glaze when I had my root touch up.  I noticed that my hair color looked dull.  Rather than make another appointment, I thought I would read reviews about glazes that I could apply at home.  I had my doubts.  I had gone through a home coloring period in my 20&#x27;s that was not pretty.  But, I read great reviews about this clear glaze.  I still would not try to add or subtract color myself, but this just adds shine and manageability.  I have fine hair and use Bumble &amp; Bumble thickening shampoo &amp; conditioner, which are miracle products&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to add anything that would make my hair limp.  The first time I used the product, I followed directions exactly and left my conditioner on 3 minutes and the glaze on 3 minutes.  And it was fabulous.  Had my volume, but added smoothness (no flyaways) and shine.  The second time I got busy &amp; left my conditioner on about 10 minutes and the glaze on about 15.  No bueno.  My hair was stiff and flyaway.  This time I repeated the first time and its all good.  I only wash my hair about twice a week so I am putting it on wet, after conditioning, each time I wash.  There are instructions for a once a week application in which you put it on dry hair and leave it on 20 minutes.  I haven&#x27;t tried that method.  I am a believer in this product and will no long have to pay the added cost to have it done in the salon.,</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make a change in your hair at all and it smells pretty bad. There are much better products out there</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference in the shine or gloss of my hair. For me this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t give me the glaze I expected.  Beauty products are always hit or miss and trial and error. Thanks for the effort though!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to notice a sheen on gray hair but, at least my hair doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;dull gray&amp;#34;.  Easy to use so I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> I thought conditioner was going to leave my hair really smooth but it was the other way around.  My hair looks and feels horrible.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice texture to my hair. I use in place of conditioner after I shampoo.</li>
            <li> Does a great job adding shine.</li>
            <li> Gives my newly silver hair a glorious shine!</li>
            <li> This seller sent me the brunette color glaze instead of the clear one so I guess this review is about the colored glaze - I&#x27;m wondering if the clear one would have done a better job! I was mad enough that I got the wrong product, but nothing could have prepared me for the result! :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brunette color glaze version was a disaster - made my hair terribly dry and tangled!. I followed the instructions to a tee, so I&#x27;m really wondering how smtg like this can still be so heavily marketed when it can actually damage your hair that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that devastating experience, I did some research to try and find a glaze that would actually IMPROVE the appearance of my hair instead of worsening it (!) and tried the Sebastian&#x27;s cellophane hair treatment - omg that was a life-saver!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was absolutely thrilled to see that that product actually DOES coat your hair and gives it a silky feel and look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is having to sit for 15 min with the hairdryer in your hand - but this is the only product that has returned my hair to a healthier look so to me, it&#x27;s still worth the pain and the price - around 25$ per tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be trying the Sebastian tinted version next - fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> I love this product it gives my gray hair the perfect smoothness and shine that I&#x27;m looking for. Instead of dull gray my hair looks shiney silvery.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff. I use it every day. I have very dull dry hair. I get lots of compliments about how shinny and healthy it looks</li>
            <li> I love this glaze. Makes my hair soft and shiny. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff the BEST! It makes my hair so smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it was going to be a glaze that&#x27;s applied similarly to an at home hair dye, but I was happily suprised to find that it&#x27;s applied just like shampoo.  I use it in the shower about 3 times a week and it makes my hair shiny and glossy without making it greasy and stringy.  I&#x27;m very glad I got the 2 pack.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Received as promised. Product is great as well as the price!</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  Maybe it&#x27;s my hair, but this didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Really repairs my hair and makes it shiny.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference right away!  Easy to use and no harsh smells / chemicals.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Added shine and softness to my hair.  Will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t like this product.  Didn&#x27;t really make my hair shiny - just kind of lifeless.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Dried out my hair. Didn&#x27;t condition or add shine. I would not recommend this product to a friend. Try another brand if looking for a glaze.</li>
            <li> I like to use this glaze between hair appointments. It helps keep my hair soft and shiny. Plus it helps with frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it makes my hair super shiny, but there is a little glossiness to it and it feels smooth. Will probably give it another shot, plus I can only find it online and never in stores!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims. Imparts a nice shine and as a bonus, manageability.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and have started straightening it in the last year.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that will give that sleek smooth shiny finish and this definitely works.  I am a regular and will continue to use this product</li>
            <li> I really like this product. the smell is a bit strong but it disappears on your hair. it leaves my hair nice and silky. I use it everyday. leave it in for 3 minutes or so and rinse out. I find my hair very manageable and no frizzies - which is the best part!!</li>
            <li> This glaze is the best.  I love that it&#x27;s clear so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it staining your skin.  Great to use in the shower.  Leaves my hair super shiny.  Great price.</li>
            <li> I followed directions, and this product left my fine hair with a very dry feel - even after lots of conditioner.  Won&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much a difference in shine when used daily after shampoo and conditioner.  But it definitely makes your hair shinier if you leave on for 20 to 30 minutes when your hair is dry and then wash it out, for the weekly treatment.  Will need try the rest of the bottle to see if it is worth it to buy again.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought I would order it....I tried it and saw no difference at all...Maybe I need to try it again and I will I have more product left.</li>
            <li> clear coating but it really does not fight frizz but it does help seal hair</li>
            <li> Great product especially for humid summers here in New England. This is best used once or twice a month, before shampooing, where you let it set in slightly damp hair for 45 minutes; Then rinse out and shampoo and condition as normal.  No lingering weird smells, no slimy feel, no color transfer as this is a clear glaze, and no damage to colored hair.  This keeps my often slightly frizzy hair under control and also gives it a great shine. This is my second or third order; getting two bottles at once is a bargain at this price. Great value; thanks again Amazon.</li>
            <li> I applied this to my hair in the morning before I showered and left it on for twenty minutes. Then I took a shower, and washed my hair as usual. My hair was smoother instantly, not necessarily &amp;#34;shiny.&amp;#34; I have color treated hair (which this product is recommended for). Two days later, my hair was noticably shiny. I&#x27;ve only used this product one time so far.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until after I used this product that I learned it was voted one of the best new products for 2012! I had dry, damaged, fly-away hair before I used it.  I opted to put it on my dry hair and leave it on about 20 minutes before washing it, and what an improvement!  At first I used it a couple times a week, but now I only use it every couple of weeks.  My hair is so soft and manageable and vey healthy!  I also have received many compliments!  I wouldn&#x27;t pay attention to other bad reviews until you actually use it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Amazon.com I can buy the product for a lot less than the drug and beauty stores locally even with the shipping fees included!  A GREAT find and money well spent!</li>
            <li> Have been looking for a great product to give my hair shine and body.  Found it!</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, dry curly/wavy hair. The only times my hair dries shiny is either when I use a box dye, a box glaze or this product. I usually need a lot to make my wet hair dry shiny, but when I do, it works. My hair, even though it still is coarse and dry, maintains a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Was cautiously optimistic but wanted some oomph for my grey hair. I finally stopped coloring my prematurely grey hair and wanted to bring some shine and life to my silver strands. This product delivered on first try. I applied to dry hair and waited 20 minutes. I have sensitive skin, so was prepared to wash out immediately if necessary. I had no problems and I love the smell of this product. I rinsed and washed/conditioned as usual. My hair came out smooth and shiny. Kissed my dull hair fair well and am enjoying shine &amp; bounce. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have very curly coarse hair and it works really well.  I wash and condition and then put it on and leave for three minutes and then I use John Frieda gloss and &amp;#34;don&#x27;t&amp;#34; comb my hair.  Very pretty.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite product for my hair. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years and love it. leaves my hair soft, silky and very shine. Highly recommended. The order and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked this worked as well as it did! I&#x27;ve been growing out my gray hair and after using this product once, my hair is gorgeous and not frizzy at all! I decided to try it first after washing/conditioning and let stay on for just a few minutes. Now I&#x27;m anxious to see what the next few times will be like!</li>
            <li> Hmmm... I really wanted to like this but be aware that the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; that this gives your hair is from tiny bits of glitter. I like the consistency and the way it makes my hair feel but not what it may be doing to the environment. Also not too sure I want tiny bits of glitter all over.</li>
            <li> I love this for my blonde hair. It really does make it shine</li>
            <li> I use this weekly.  I apply to dry hair, leave it on for 20 minutes per the instructions.  shampoo.  &amp; there is a noticeable difference.  it can be used on wet hair every time you shampoo-- but I prefer to do the weekly on dry hair.  I&#x27;ve used it for over a year &amp; it is as good or better than a salon glossing.  my hair is right above my shoulders, colored, (brunette w/highlights), straight, and somewhat fine.&lt;br /&gt;  this product adds a great boost of shine.</li>
            <li> The first bottles I used had unpleasant odor, and the glaze was dull, but the latest bottles of glaze I recently received smell much nicer. The glaze lasts a couple of days, then I have to wash hair again, because it makes my hair look a tad oily. I still like the product. Just do not use too much at a time, and do leave on for 2-3 minutes before rinsing. I have very short hair(pixie cut), and color my hair platinum. Then I allow the color to grow out some, about a month, and it blends well with the roots of my graying brunette hair color. The glaze gives my hair a little lift, also, at least for a couple of days.</li>
