            <li>This is easy to use and looks elegant in your hair when wearing a bun.</li>
            <li>She thought it was very unusual and liked a lot.</li>
            <li>And it is so pretty and fits so nice in your hair.</li>
            <li>and it performs just fine.</li>
            <li>My problem for me is that the leaves get stuck in my fine textured hair.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>It is cheap</li>
            <li>Really pretty!!</li>

            <li>First off I may say I&#x27;m in love with this headband.</li>
            <li>very pretty.</li>
            <li>It was very pretty while it lasted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a cute idea!</li>
            <li>Its worth the price I payed.</li>
            <li>It did break the first 3 times I put it in</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>broke the first time i used it</li>
            <li>Feels pretty flimsy</li>
            <li>It is pretty.</li>
            <li>I was broke on first use, i lost  my money</li>
            <li>It looks great and hasn&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>Love it and received it sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>She is going into real estate and needs to do something a little more upscale with it.  </li>
            <li>Slightly cheaper quality than I hoped, but for the price it&#x27;s okay</li>

            <li>I look forward to a thin width, but still looks super cute.</li>
            <li>but I just attach it right back together</li>
            <li>it arrived early but was busted.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s for a gift ... will do as one buyer suggest and put a coat of natural nail polish on it</li>
            <li>It came it early.</li>
            <li>The combs sometimes will get caught in my hair, but once it&#x27;s in place, it adds a little something special to every outfit.</li>
            <li>I am not sure on how to improve and keep the item light (which it is and I like).</li>
            <li>A good and whimsical hair ornament that I have been complimented on several times!</li>
            <li>At least it was literally cheap.</li>
            <li>but it looks like it would of broken easily anyways.</li>

            <li> At first I was afraid it would be too small, my head, because I come from other Asian hair band before ordered, often a little &#x27;small, but health is perfect.</li>
            <li> but if you take care of this it will last you a long time!</li>
            <li> Came earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> Took a very long time to have it delivered.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i get compliments every single time i wear this chain whether my hair be up or down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not high quality, but that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re paying for.</li>
            <li> I will wear this and consider looking at others that are beads or less likely to get stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li> An okay quality/not bad</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m careful with it when I wear it</li>
            <li> Got it almost three weeks before expected.</li>
            <li> Tangles super bad in my hair.</li>
            <li> but combs are plain.</li>
            <li> I mean I paid less than 5 bucks</li>
            <li> It makes me feel like a princess, the combs are just tight enough to hold in my crazy thick hair but it doesn&#x27;t yank, or hurt.</li>
            <li> Some reviews said it came broken</li>
            <li> and the head band was broken into 3 pieces.</li>

            <li> Gift for my daughter who has waist length hair.  She is going into real estate and needs to do something a little more upscale with it.  She thought it was very unusual and liked a lot.</li>
            <li> very pretty. will wear for next event</li>
            <li> Slightly cheaper quality than I hoped, but for the price it&#x27;s okay and it performs just fine.</li>
            <li> It is not high quality, but that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re paying for. It looks great and hasn&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
            <li> Great item for the price!!!! It looks beautiful on my daughter&#x27;s hair!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it. At first I was afraid it would be too small, my head, because I come from other Asian hair band before ordered, often a little &#x27;small, but health is perfect. Every time I wear give praise. I look forward to a thin width, but still looks super cute.</li>
            <li> It broke the second I was putting it in, and I was not being rough with it because I could tell it was delicate (cheap). At least it was literally cheap.</li>
            <li> adorable!!!! is fashion!</li>
            <li> It tarnished after one wear...</li>

            <li> I absolutely love it! I get compliments every time that I wear it!</li>
            <li> Really pretty!! Came earlier than I expected. Some reviews said it came broken so I ordered 2 just in case one broke. They both came unbroken so I gave my sister one. Love it but it does pull hair a bit, especially my curly hair. But it stays in and looks great.</li>
            <li> Very cool! I love the color and ease of using it! You can wear it across your forehead or across the back of your hair since it&#x27;s just combs in goes in either way!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a cute idea! I love it. It did break the first 3 times I put it in but I just attach it right back together and it works like a charm. I mean I paid less than 5 bucks so I can&#x27;t expect much. All&lt;br /&gt;My friends says it&#x27;s cute on!</li>
            <li> Broke when I was looking at it before I even used it.  Took a very long time to have it delivered.</li>

            <li> Cheap. Tangles super bad in my hair. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Love it and received it sooner than expected. I would&#x27;ve given it a 5 but combs are plain.</li>
            <li> quality looks better in the picture</li>
            <li> So cute!! Everyone loves my hair jewelry!!!! It makes me feel like a princess, the combs are just tight enough to hold in my crazy thick hair but it doesn&#x27;t yank, or hurt.</li>
            <li> Cute! No problems with the combs staying in but then, I have an Afro lol Nice on my up-do&#x27;s and doesn&#x27;t snag which I&#x27;m thankful for.</li>
            <li> Very nice you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>

            <li> Super cute to wear, stays in well, and it has a million uses! Feels pretty flimsy so I&#x27;m careful with it when I wear it and I have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> It was very pretty while it lasted. It is a lot shorter than I had thought it would be, and it broke on me after about three wears. Very pretty while it lasts, but I definitely won&#x27;t be repurchasing. Shame, it&#x27;s gorgeous in the picture.</li>
            <li> An okay quality/not bad (it&#x27;s okay). I am not sure on how to improve and keep the item light (which it is and I like).

            <li> I was very excited to wear this headband however when it arrived the package had holes in it and the head band was broken into 3 pieces.</li>
            <li> Cute even though it slips out of my hair sometimes. Hair spray however helps the problem.</li>
            <li> Super cute! Now just trying to find the perfect occasion to debut it!</li>
            <li> It came it early. And it&#x27;s so cute. Its worth the price I payed.</li>
