    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great product !</li>
            <li>Makes your scalp and hair feel great !</li>
            <li>This shampoo is FREAKIN&#x27; AWESOME.  </li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo for about 5 years now and still feel it cleans my hair the best.  </li>
            <li>Tonic is great for hair that tends to be oily or for scalp problems (itchy!)</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>Smells great and the tea tree oil helped my husband with breakouts on his scalp.</li>
            <li>so they contributed to the great results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tried many simliar products, and this is the best I&#x27;ve found&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also has a pronounced medicinal odor-not the pleasant tea tree oil odor</li>
            <li>Feels good.</li>
            <li>I ordered both the Tonic and the Seaweed Bumble&amp;Bumble shampoo and found the Tonic superior on my hair.</li>
            <li>When your hair needs a rest from conditioner build up, you want and need a good cleaning, and to stimulate the scalp, this shampoo is very refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Best shampoo &amp; worth every cent.</li>
            <li>Love this Shampoo!</li>
            <li>and I must say I love it!</li>
            <li>but I love it!</li>
            <li>It smells nice and there&#x27;s a satisfying tingle, too!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Cleans ok though.  </li>
            <li>Its ok</li>
            <li>but kind of like a cheap hospital product.</li>
            <li>I also love the cooling menthol, and the shampoo does not leave a residue or strip my hair of moisture.</li>
            <li>All the shampoos have a nice smell and get your hair clean without feeling stripped.</li>
            <li>It rinses very clean.  </li>
            <li>I have a problem with very oily hair and this Tonic shampoo gives me a great tingly clean once a week.</li>
            <li>more importantly *feels</li>
            <li>I like the shampoo, and it does a good job at cleaning my hair, but I really dislike the smell.  </li>
            <li>I was previously using Crew for Men tea tree shampoo and had excellent results but cant seem to find it anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;Straight&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Seaweed&amp;#34; and both were fine.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product if you have oily skin/hair like I do.</li>
            <li>The smell was kinda strong at first, but I&#x27;ve grown to love it.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure the bottle was filled with another shampoo.</li>
            <li>It did not smell like the original product at all</li>
            <li>This is definitely a &amp;#34;tonic&amp;#34; shampoo - the tea tree oil contributes to a pleasant tingling sensation.  </li>
            <li>this stuff smells super medicinal -- sort of like original (brown) Listerine.  </li>
            <li>The first bottle I used was fine.  </li>
            <li>definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>I returned it right away</li>
            <li>and now I just order it from Bumble and Bumble directly - they always have deals on their site and often have free shipping, so it&#x27;s probably worth it to know you are getting the correct product and that it hasn&#x27;t been tampered with.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>This is the only thing I have found to work on seborrheic dermatitis and even better than prescription alternatives.</li>
            <li>I combine with Super Rich conditioner on my ends only.   </li>
            <li>I use Tonic along with the Super Rich conditioner on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s safe for long-term use on color-treated hair, but once in a while is probably fine.  </li>
            <li>I still get a little itchy and flaky on the top of my head, but overall this product is better than everything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My hair is usually really oily to the point that I get acne on my head and this clears up all the oil and nixed the problem.</li>
            <li>like it really cleans your hair.</li>
            <li>But I do know that I replaced both bottles with two new ones directly from Bumble &amp; Bumble, and the new bottles are just fine.</li>
            <li>Love my other B&amp;B products (Sunday shampoo and Coco shampoo/conditioner), but for the price I don&#x27;t find much to rave about with this product.  </li>
            <li>It was stimulating and gave a sensation of extra clean without the harshness of a medicated shampoo.</li>
            <li>I opened a new bottle today, and noticed it was an inch down from the top, and the outside of the bottle did not seem clean.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like it when the mosquitoes have had a field day with my scalp, or when I&#x27;ve been playing in the dust.  </li>
            <li>Bottles with most of the writing coming off the outside, doesn&#x27;t smell like tonic shampoo &amp; different texture than normal.  </li>
            <li>Good product, but arrived with a loose cap and much of the product had leaked out in transit and made for somewhat of a mess and lost quantity.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Fresh scent, cleans my oily asian hair without overdrying or causing shampo/scalp buildup.  </li>
            <li>Ive used B&amp;B for over 5 years now and normally would rate them 4 to 5 stars, this product tho is a 3 star.</li>
            <li>Normally I like tea tree oil shampoos and their fragrance,</li>
            <li>these were new products.</li>
            <li>Effective and not as badly scented as many dandruff shampoo is our</li>
            <li>I make sure to leave it on for at least 3-5 minutes and really work it into all parts of my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>It leaves you with a slight tingle while using it and has a clean smell that you don&#x27;t really smell after drying your hair.</li>
            <li>, I never thought to open all bottles when I first received them to check the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Slight scent is OK, but don&#x27;t feel any real tonic action--very little if any tingling or refreshing feeling as described by other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>After use, my hair was manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>This  was either old merchandise or bogus contents .</li>
            <li>This shampoo cuts the grease and leaves his hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Wondered if this was old product - the ink label on the bottle was paritally worn away and looked old.</li>
            <li>Both worked poorly (took a lot more shampoo to lather not nearly as well), lacked the distinct fragrance of this product, and the bottles looked a bit worn.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and a lot of shampoos build up oils etc on my scalp leading to irritation and red bumps (acne).  </li>
            <li>The writing is still clear &amp; stayed on the outside of the bottle despite being in my shower for over 2 months.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The small bottle really lasts.  </li>
            <li> It will stimulate your scalp, remove unnecessary residues and LEAVES YOUR HAIR SOFT &amp; MANAGEABLE!!!!!  </li>
            <li> I opened the other 2 bottles just to check, and they are the same.  </li>
            <li> I alternate shampoos around as I find that the Tonic shampoo can be a little drying if you use it all the time.</li>
            <li> it just felt rough and sticky when you ran your fingers through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves the scent and uses it every other day, I&#x27;m not really a fan of it because it seems to make my hair oily.</li>
            <li> This product seems to really dry my hair and doesnt have the slight tingle ive come to expect from tea tree type shampoos.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY TOO!!</li>
            <li> It works well, and doesn&#x27;t smell stupid like most other products in this market.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is a bit pricey for the amount that you get.</li>
            <li> hair felt weighed down.  </li>
            <li> Also shampoo appears to be watered down...</li>
            <li> compared to the salon product, there was less foaming and cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The stuff I purchased from this seller has less of the distinctive smell and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp tingle.</li>
            <li> Amazon is refunding less than 80% of my purchase price.  </li>
            <li> I have thick very long hair that tends to be oily.   </li>
            <li> I suspect this is not genuine B&amp;B Tonic.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled and waste your time like I did.</li>
            <li> Too bad really because both of us use and like other B&amp;B products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not refreshing at all.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usual softness.</li>
            <li> Not sure what this is</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that unfortunately requires a lot of shampoo and conditioning.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does not smell like tonic shampoo - there is hardly any tea tree fragrance at all.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that&#x27;s been foiled with blond highlights.</li>
            <li> This product is an imitation (wrong smell and bottle), and I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> But my last two bottles have been bad.  </li>
            <li> Any other shampoo and my hair still feels greasy and dirty.  </li>
            <li> I realize just how crazy this sounds</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and knew immediately it was a fake!</li>
            <li> Maybe just me, but was disappointed with this purchase otherwise.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I still get a little itchy and flaky on the top of my head, but overall this product is better than everything else I&#x27;ve tried. Feels good. Smells great. I use this and the Aveeno and also some prescription stuff once a week. I cannot use regular shampoo at all.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  Can&#x27;t believe they discontinued it!!!  Get it while you can!  Fresh scent, cleans my oily asian hair without overdrying or causing shampo/scalp buildup.  Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Love this Shampoo! Smells great and the tea tree oil helped my husband with breakouts on his scalp. I don&#x27;t use it on my hair because I have blonde highlights and the tea tree oil can affect the color.</li>
            <li> Great product ! Started using this 3 years ago and have not switched to anything else. Makes your scalp and hair feel great !</li>
            <li> I have thick very long hair that tends to be oily.   This is the only shampoo I have never had build up problems with.   Any other shampoo and my hair still feels greasy and dirty.  I combine with Super Rich conditioner on my ends only.   I haven&#x27;t had the money for this shampoo for months and I can&#x27;t wait to buy it again.</li>
            <li> compared to the salon product, there was less foaming and cleaning.  would have to shampoo again. hair felt weighed down.  would not buy from amazon again.</li>
            <li> Love my other B&amp;B products (Sunday shampoo and Coco shampoo/conditioner), but for the price I don&#x27;t find much to rave about with this product.  Slight scent is OK, but don&#x27;t feel any real tonic action--very little if any tingling or refreshing feeling as described by other reviewers.  Cleans ok though.  Maybe just me, but was disappointed with this purchase otherwise.</li>
            <li> Ive used B&amp;B for over 5 years now and normally would rate them 4 to 5 stars, this product tho is a 3 star. Its ok but I cant use it every day.  I was previously using Crew for Men tea tree shampoo and had excellent results but cant seem to find it anymore. This product seems to really dry my hair and doesnt have the slight tingle ive come to expect from tea tree type shampoos. It also has a pronounced medicinal odor-not the pleasant tea tree oil odor but kind of like a cheap hospital product. After my wife remarked on the odor i decided to look elsewhere. Too bad really because both of us use and like other B&amp;B products.</li>
            <li> Because of its Tea Tree Oil content, Bumble &amp; Bumble Tonic Shampoo is my go-to product for psoriasis flare ups. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure the bottle was filled with another shampoo.</li>
            <li> My sister works in a salon and bought me this the conditioner and the tonic spray and I must say I love it! My hair is usually really oily to the point that I get acne on my head and this clears up all the oil and nixed the problem. The smell was kinda strong at first, but I&#x27;ve grown to love it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I ordered both the Tonic and the Seaweed Bumble&amp;Bumble shampoo and found the Tonic superior on my hair. I have thick, wavy hair that&#x27;s been foiled with blond highlights. After use, my hair was manageable and soft. Of course, i used Redkin conditioner and massaged in BioSilk SILK (leave-in)hair therapy (the scent is heaven!) so they contributed to the great results. I especially like Tonic for the feeling of \\&quot;a tonic\\&quot; on my scalp. It was stimulating and gave a sensation of extra clean without the harshness of a medicated shampoo.</li>
            <li> I just received this shampoo recently.  I like the shampoo, and it does a good job at cleaning my hair, but I really dislike the smell.  Normally I like tea tree oil shampoos and their fragrance, but I find this one smells like a medicated shampoo.  It&#x27;s not refreshing at all.  With this in mind I probably would not purchase this shampoo again.</li>
            <li> I suspect this is not genuine B&amp;B Tonic. The stuff I purchased from this seller has less of the distinctive smell and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp tingle.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and know what it is like.  I ordered 4 bottles from TodaysValues, I never thought to open all bottles when I first received them to check the shampoo.  The first bottle I used was fine.  The writing is still clear &amp; stayed on the outside of the bottle despite being in my shower for over 2 months.  I opened a new bottle today, and noticed it was an inch down from the top, and the outside of the bottle did not seem clean.  The shampoo does not smell like tonic shampoo - there is hardly any tea tree fragrance at all.  Also, it is thicker and a slightly lighter color than normal.  I opened the other 2 bottles just to check, and they are the same.  Bottles with most of the writing coming off the outside, doesn&#x27;t smell like tonic shampoo &amp; different texture than normal.  Despite being sealed in cellophane and then plastic.  I don&#x27;t know if it is a problem with their source, or what.  But look out.  Amazon is refunding less than 80% of my purchase price.  Out of a $74 purchase price I am getting back $55.</li>
            <li> When your hair needs a rest from conditioner build up, you want and need a good cleaning, and to stimulate the scalp, this shampoo is very refreshing.  It will stimulate your scalp, remove unnecessary residues and LEAVES YOUR HAIR SOFT &amp; MANAGEABLE!!!!!  A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY TOO!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It works well, and doesn&#x27;t smell stupid like most other products in this market.  But my last two bottles have been bad.  One was from bygonebooks and one was from Beauty Concepts, both through Amazon.  Both worked poorly (took a lot more shampoo to lather not nearly as well), lacked the distinct fragrance of this product, and the bottles looked a bit worn. Of course, I don&#x27;t know whether the product has a shelf life, or if we&#x27;re looking at something like counterfeiting.  But I do know that I replaced both bottles with two new ones directly from Bumble &amp; Bumble, and the new bottles are just fine.</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 this shampoo...if you like tea tree oil scent, defs go for this. I also love the cooling menthol, and the shampoo does not leave a residue or strip my hair of moisture. definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> Good product, but arrived with a loose cap and much of the product had leaked out in transit and made for somewhat of a mess and lost quantity.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with very oily hair and this Tonic shampoo gives me a great tingly clean once a week. My only complaint is that it is a bit pricey for the amount that you get. Some people don&#x27;t like the smell but I love it!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves the scent and uses it every other day, I&#x27;m not really a fan of it because it seems to make my hair oily.</li>
            <li> This  was either old merchandise or bogus contents . I threw i away .It did not contain the product that I have been using for years.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and a lot of shampoos build up oils etc on my scalp leading to irritation and red bumps (acne).  This shampoo is FREAKIN&#x27; AWESOME.  After using it for a couple weeks, 80% of my scalp issues have cleared up.  This is a fantastic product if you have oily skin/hair like I do.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo from \\&quot;ezee llc\\&quot; which now seems to have the name \\&quot;lindasproperties\\&quot; and it was NOT the correct product that I have been using from Bumble and Bumble for years.  It did not smell like the original product at all and it had a different color and texture to it.  I returned it right away and now I just order it from Bumble and Bumble directly - they always have deals on their site and often have free shipping, so it&#x27;s probably worth it to know you are getting the correct product and that it hasn&#x27;t been tampered with.</li>
            <li> i have used this shampoo for years. after prolonged use the letters on the bottle start to wash away... all the bottles showed up like this. Also shampoo appears to be watered down... I realize just how crazy this sounds but I was under the impression these were new products.</li>
            <li> Be warned-- this stuff smells super medicinal -- sort of like original (brown) Listerine.  It smells, and, more importantly *feels* like it really cleans your hair. (It smells like it disinfects it too). It rinses very clean.  Big thumbs up.</li>
            <li> This is not a Bumble &amp; Bumble shampoo.  Been using this product for years and knew immediately it was a fake!</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for about 5 years now and still feel it cleans my hair the best.  a must have for me!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo &amp; worth every cent.</li>
            <li> We use only Bumble and Bumble shampoo in our house.  The small bottle really lasts.  All the shampoos have a nice smell and get your hair clean without feeling stripped.</li>
            <li> This product is an imitation (wrong smell and bottle), and I&#x27;m returning it. Don&#x27;t be fooled and waste your time like I did.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that unfortunately requires a lot of shampoo and conditioning. I had stopped using B&amp;B&#x27;s regular products (including this one) and found that a ton of gunk had accumulated on my hair-- it just felt rough and sticky when you ran your fingers through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one use my hair was back to it&#x27;s usual softness. I make sure to leave it on for at least 3-5 minutes and really work it into all parts of my hair and scalp. It smells nice and there&#x27;s a satisfying tingle, too!</li>
            <li> If you have never had the chance to experience and B&amp;B product, I feel for you. I was introduced to this product line about 5 years ago and I have been a faithful user since. I use Tonic along with the Super Rich conditioner on a regular basis. Tonic is great for hair that tends to be oily or for scalp problems (itchy!) and I tend to have both! It leaves you with a slight tingle while using it and has a clean smell that you don&#x27;t really smell after drying your hair. I alternate shampoos around as I find that the Tonic shampoo can be a little drying if you use it all the time. I wash my hair once every 5 days and you would never know...</li>
            <li> Effective and not as badly scented as many dandruff shampoo is our</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I have found to work on seborrheic dermatitis and even better than prescription alternatives.</li>
            <li> Delivery was on time, and as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works will most/all hair types&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried many simliar products, and this is the best I&#x27;ve found&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well, and does not aggravate my allergies</li>
            <li> Not sure what this is but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same B and B product I by at the salon. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell at all. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a &amp;#34;tonic&amp;#34; shampoo - the tea tree oil contributes to a pleasant tingling sensation.  I particularly like it when the mosquitoes have had a field day with my scalp, or when I&#x27;ve been playing in the dust.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s safe for long-term use on color-treated hair, but once in a while is probably fine.  My husband&#x27;s hair is, well, NOT color-treated, but tends to be oily.  This shampoo cuts the grease and leaves his hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is a bit medicinal.  I&#x27;ve used &amp;#34;Straight&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Seaweed&amp;#34; and both were fine.  Wondered if this was old product - the ink label on the bottle was paritally worn away and looked old.</li>
