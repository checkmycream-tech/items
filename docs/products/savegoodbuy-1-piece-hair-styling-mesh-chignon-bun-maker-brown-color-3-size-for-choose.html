            <li>but I love it!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>This thing is truly amazing because&lt;</li>
            <li>She really liked her style and asked the passerby, how she got her hair in a bun</li>
            <li>She liked it.</li>
            <li>This is the best one I have used so far.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite hair accessories because of how easy it is to use!</li>
            <li>I find it best to put the bun next to your scalp and the fold the hair over.</li>
            <li>I love this wear it almost every day, it&#x27;s so helpful</li>
            <li>and I reccomend it to any bun lovers :)</li>
            <li>It looks absolutely adorable</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I use this</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so easy to do</li>
            <li>Its so easy to fix your hair with this&lt;</li>
            <li>Plus, because it is a larger bun maker it makes it appear that I have a great deal more hair than I do.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, material allows bobby pins to be stuck into it for a tighter hold.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light (I have a lot of thick hair) and it distributes it in a perfect bun that feels weightless.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>I liked mine so much I ended up buying another for a friend.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted to keep my long hair away from my face and in a beautiful up-do.</li>
            <li>it makes huge buns which is exactly what i love to wear.</li>
            <li>The bun maker makes her hair looks full.</li>
            <li>It is SO easy and quick to use and the size makes a nice, big bun.  </li>
            <li>Creates a nice size larger bun.</li>
            <li>I have hair just past my should and the biggest bun works great.</li>
            <li>This bun is going to be for women who have long hair because it is pretty huge and you would need alot of hair to wrap it around!</li>
            <li>easy to do a updo when your short on time.</li>
            <li>People always ask me how I get my hair to look a certain way</li>
            <li>This came in the mail pretty quickly, it is a high quiality product</li>
            <li>As my hair has gotten longer I&#x27;ve been leaving my standard sized buns aside, also I recently went blonde, but this brown bun still works great</li>
            <li>I have thick, slightly longer than shoulder length hair and this size is perfect.</li>
            <li>These keep your hair from unrolling or slipping like regular socks do and the large size works great for long</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wrap my hair from the top down.</li>
            <li>Same flimsy material, falls apart quickly</li>
            <li>This particular one is dense, and doesn&#x27;t unravel like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I just wished bun maker was bigger since it was described as large.</li>
            <li>After struggling with an old scrunchie for months to create a bun, I saw this on Amazon and since it was so affordable, I thought &amp;#34;Why</li>
            <li>an will never go back to the old school sock bun using an actual sock</li>
            <li>I bought the largest size and will probably buy the next size down since my hair isn&#x27;t all that large</li>
            <li>It was a little too large for my taste and could not get my waist length hair around it properly, so I gave it away to someone with shorter hair.  </li>

            <li> My friend and I were talking about a passerby&#x27;s hair. She really liked her style and asked the passerby, how she got her hair in a bun like she did. Answer: a sock bun. So sitting there, we bought one on the Amazon App. Days later it arrived. Weeks later, she is still pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
