            <li>Am a huge fan of NEEM and this is a great mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I really liked it.</li>
            <li>I have to say, after reading all the great ingredients this mouthwash has, I was so happy I finally found it.</li>
            <li>This product, as all TheraNeem products are excellent to promote a healthy gum, teeth and a general mouth</li>
            <li>I love my neem toothpaste and shampoo (both also TheraNeem products), so I was sure I&#x27;d love this mouthwash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does seem to freshen breath well overnight when used before bedtime, and I love the qualities of neem.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is better.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I am about to order more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure soon I will have none in my throat</li>
            <li>Perhaps its better with the toothpaste which I have not tried yet.</li>
            <li>so make sure that the product is somewhat nutritious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried many &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; grade oral hygiene products in a vain attempt to restore health to my teeth and gums  </li>
            <li>I love this mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>Really love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell too.</li>
            <li>so I knew I&#x27;d love this too.</li>
            <li>but this is much more pleasant, natural and just as effective or more for my breath.  </li>
            <li>Both in my household agreed it tastes a bit like you just drank strong, medicinal herbal tea.</li>
            <li>I tried The Natural Dentist mouthwash for gingivitis, but it didn&#x27;t really work that great (or maybe it just felt to mild to be working) and the taste wasn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>I like the light mint taste too.</li>
            <li>Theraneem mouthwash (mint or cinnamon) is a great product for the entire family.</li>
            <li>She reported back that his stuff ws great.  </li>
            <li>It is a good mouthwash and works well for being natural.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, though, is that it leaves my mouth so extremely fresh without the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; from alcohol.</li>
            <li>This particular mouthwash is amazing because all of the ingredients within it are nutritious and digestible.  </li>
            <li>After I brush my teeth, this mouth wash makes my mouth feel so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>I originally got this at the suggestion of my Vegetarian Times magazine.  </li>
            <li>I am much more satisfied using the TheraNeem than any other mouthwash, including all the popular name brands.  </li>
            <li>It helped clean up infections in my mouth and gums.</li>
            <li>The taste is really good, better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special, just some nice natural mouthwash.</li>
            <li>We now know that this product is superior to any commercial mouth wash in the market (period).</li>
            <li>but this is SUPER sweet.</li>
            <li>Taste is really good without being a harsh, burning feeling that so many others on the market have.</li>
            <li>Since there do not seem to be any studies (unless someone can point me in the right direction, hint, hint) on the efficacy of Neem in dental care, I just take on faith and my personal experience of cured gingivitis that Neem is as good for me as the legend of thousands of years of use in the East.</li>
            <li>Really makes my mouth feel fresh, makes my teeth feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>tried this once a day for few weeks saw great improvements in curing the Tonsil stones.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>color is actually a really nice golden yellow--</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and the freshness lingers longer than the Listerine/Crest/Colgate products.  </li>
            <li>I feel fresh and cleaned out after rinsing with this.</li>
            <li>Neem has the cleanest taste and this mouthwash makes my teeth and mouth feel so fresh.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh and again....</li>
            <li>but I will admit it is worth every cent.</li>
            <li>and I can smile again without that embarrassment.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh smell.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product I strongly suggest purchasing a Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser and using the Theraneem Mouthwash as a solution in the reservoir.</li>
            <li>I would like to see a better cap design since the label recommends pouring into the cap and not drinking straight from the bottle, but I can certainly live with it.</li>
            <li>Buyers beware: customers should try to purchas this product whole sale or in bulk; it tends to run out quickly, and the expense may be a deterent for those on a budget like my self, but it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>The taste lingers until you spit it out, and for a few seconds after, and then fades to a pleasant not-sweet herbally mintiness.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a particularly strong sweet tooth, so this is a lot for me to get over, but I guess it can be a plus for someone who&#x27;s big on candy.</li>
            <li>I needed it for dental protection and am using the first bottle</li>
            <li>I ordered a burdock and neem shampoo in the past and loved the smell</li>
            <li>Neem is proven to have many strong natural capabilities, and when coupled with the Neem toothpaste, I have found to have much less problems with my dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken to diluting it with a little warm water, also partly because of the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can really feel it working.  </li>
            <li>I really like the taste of this stuff</li>
            <li>very good.will buy again soon..</li>
            <li>I have noticed my gums have improved, the color going from bright red to normal pink.  </li>
            <li>I was really expecting a chinese herbal minty taste without any of the sweetness, but it actually tastes so much better.</li>
            <li>The texture is much less liquid and much more syrup; it pours like viscous cough syrup</li>
            <li>I brushed my teeth well, flossed regularly, brushed my tongue, used mouth wash, but no product or regimen would make me feel truly clean, and none have caused my wife to comment on how fresh my breath now smells.</li>
            <li>Love this mouthwash and their toothpaste which a tiny bit is enough to do the job and also whitens your teeth.</li>
            <li>a little on the sweet side, but a worthy companion to neem toothpaste.</li>
            <li>another note, try High Vitamin Butter Oil + Cod Liver Oil for cavities.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>That does not mean that it&#x27;s lacking in strength, however.  </li>
            <li>A gentle, healing mouthwash for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could find this locally and am resigned to pay for the shipping, but this product is worth it.</li>
            <li>It makes you feel good to know you are using a mouthwash that does not have the dangerous chemicals most commercial brands have.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash is not your standard alcohol ridden, mint fresh type.</li>
            <li>This particular mouthwash is the only one that completely stopped the bleeding and eradicated the mild halitosis.  </li>
            <li>I live in a city that has fluoride add to the water and use fluoride toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as typical mouthwash, so you need to rinse with it every day.</li>
            <li>no chemicals, it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li>It does not burn, sting, or cause discomfort life many other commercial brands.</li>
            <li>It really leaves your entire mouth feeling and smelling fresh for an entire day, even after eating or drinking.</li>
            <li>If you are looking at this product it is because you are probably aware of the adverse effects Flouride and Chlorine can have on your bodily tissues and bones.  </li>
            <li>After using this mouthwash you get a very different (better) feeling as compared to other non-herbal mouthwash that you see in general stores.</li>
            <li>I also found that the neem helps de-sensitive my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>Non-alcohol based so helps with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>There is not fluoride for those that are sensitive.</li>
            <li>It is a bit different than a normal mouthwash</li>
            <li>This product is not so bad, and the taste is not that great.  </li>
            <li>Tastes great freshness breath but artificial sweetener is not natural</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients kill multiple mouth</li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth very fresh smelling, There is no overwhelming burning from the mouthwash and it gets the job done!</li>
            <li>Kills the bad bacteria but leaves the good stuff.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> a little on the sweet side, but a worthy companion to neem toothpaste. not something i use every day.</li>
            <li> Really makes my mouth feel fresh, makes my teeth feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny.  Works great.  My teeth are whiter and stronger than ever and my gums feel wonderful.  I like the light mint taste too.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash tastes great and feels great. Leaves my mouth very fresh smelling, There is no overwhelming burning from the mouthwash and it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I wish I could find this locally and am resigned to pay for the shipping, but this product is worth it. Since there do not seem to be any studies (unless someone can point me in the right direction, hint, hint) on the efficacy of Neem in dental care, I just take on faith and my personal experience of cured gingivitis that Neem is as good for me as the legend of thousands of years of use in the East. I swear by Neem products and highly recommend them, especially for anyone like me that is very skeptical about putting ANY chemicals in their body, and wants to go green/organic/natural in every facet of their life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat is that some of the suppliers take a little to long to get their shipments out.</li>
            <li> A gentle, healing mouthwash for sensitive teeth.  Taste is really good without being a harsh, burning feeling that so many others on the market have.</li>
            <li> I love my neem toothpaste and shampoo (both also TheraNeem products), so I was sure I&#x27;d love this mouthwash. I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol (which has been linked to the development of oral cancers) or iffy chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is actually a really nice golden yellow--I know that&#x27;s a random thing to comment on, but if anyone&#x27;s tried the neem toothpaste, you know it can be a factor. The texture is much less liquid and much more syrup; it pours like viscous cough syrup and I find that makes it a bit awkward to swish around, too. I&#x27;ve taken to diluting it with a little warm water, also partly because of the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how nobody&#x27;s commented on this, but this is SUPER sweet. We&#x27;re talking mouthful of honey (or in this case, sorbitol). I don&#x27;t have a particularly strong sweet tooth, so this is a lot for me to get over, but I guess it can be a plus for someone who&#x27;s big on candy. The taste lingers until you spit it out, and for a few seconds after, and then fades to a pleasant not-sweet herbally mintiness. Both in my household agreed it tastes a bit like you just drank strong, medicinal herbal tea. We like this a lot; you might not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to freshen breath well overnight when used before bedtime, and I love the qualities of neem. We&#x27;ll see how I feel about it by the end of the bottle!</li>
            <li> Dentist told me I had gum disease Id lose my teeth if I didn&#x27;t get an expensive gum surgery. I&#x27;m taking neem capsules, using the neem toothpaste and mouthwash. Teeth are no longer loose. Must be working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, try High Vitamin Butter Oil + Cod Liver Oil for cavities.</li>
            <li> I am using this mouthwash in conjunction with the toothpaste from the same manufacturer, and it&#x27;s too soon to tell if the neem in the product will help heal my gum condition, but never mind that yet, there are other pluses so far:    There is no alcohol in this mouthwash, which is a really good thing.  No industrial chemicals, either.  That does not mean that it&#x27;s lacking in strength, however.  You can really feel it working.  As for the taste - excellent!</li>
            <li> I ordered the TheraNeem Mouthwash-Mint Orgaix South and what I got was cinnamon flavored Mouth-Wash. I needed it for dental protection and am using the first bottle but it is not the same as what I had before with the Mint mouthwash. Any suggestions. I really do not feel like boxing it up and taking it to be ship returned?</li>
            <li> This product, as all TheraNeem products are excellent to promote a healthy gum, teeth and a general mouth well being. My wife has been using it for a few months now and here gums, teeth and general mouth health has improved 100%. We now know that this product is superior to any commercial mouth wash in the market (period).</li>
            <li> Great to use this minty mouthwash.  It makes you feel good to know you are using a mouthwash that does not have the dangerous chemicals most commercial brands have.</li>
            <li> Tastes great freshness breath but artificial sweetener is not natural so I am disappointed about that being in this mouthwash</li>
            <li> I originally got this at the suggestion of my Vegetarian Times magazine.  It is a bit different than a normal mouthwash but I have been using it for a while now and it is rather tasty.</li>
            <li> I used to use Listerine but this is much more pleasant, natural and just as effective or more for my breath.  So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Very refreshing without using alcohol.  Kills the bad bacteria but leaves the good stuff.  Would recommend to friends.  I like it.</li>
            <li> I really like the taste of this stuff but I didn&#x27;t get it for taste, I got it because a friend recommended it for helping with Gingivitis.  His wife had some incredible results so I&#x27;m hoping to have the same experience.  Will try to get back after a while and edit this to include my actual experience with it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the taste. I ended up giving it away.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month and do not really see any results for mouth sores being any less frequent. It is a good mouthwash and works well for being natural.</li>
            <li> I have chronic dry mouth from using a CPAP machine at night.  This is very refreshing to use.  I sometimes get up in the middle of the night and swish a little around in my mouth.  The taste is very different from your usual mouthwashes but my mouth feels cleaner and fresher than with the  usual mouthwashes made for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> The quality is very good.  The taste is really good, better than I expected.  I have noticed my gums have improved, the color going from bright red to normal pink.  This was recommended to me by a friend in the health field as she uses nothing but Neem and it meets all expectations.  I am much more satisfied using the TheraNeem than any other mouthwash, including all the popular name brands.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like this and would use it again. It helped clean up infections in my mouth and gums. It did taste horrible but it worked really well.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, just some nice natural mouthwash. The toothpaste is better.</li>
            <li> not overly minty. neem products are great</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;ve grown up with Listerine, I was a little wary; but I wanted something organic that was healthier for my mouth.  I love this.  It&#x27;s fresh and the freshness lingers longer than the Listerine/Crest/Colgate products.  The taste is very pleasant and I wasn&#x27;t put off by the slightly syrupy liquid.  I also found that the neem helps de-sensitive my sensitive teeth.  I will be buying more of this!</li>
            <li> I have to say, after reading all the great ingredients this mouthwash has, I was so happy I finally found it. However, the liquid its yellow, so that means bad news for any person who pay a lot of money for tooth whitening, because yes it will stain your tooth. For me, this product is a no, no.:(</li>
            <li> This mouthwash does seem to freshen breath.  And, my mouth feels cleaner after using it.</li>
            <li> I feel fresh and cleaned out after rinsing with this. It doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as typical mouthwash, so you need to rinse with it every day.</li>
            <li> I brushed my teeth well, flossed regularly, brushed my tongue, used mouth wash, but no product or regimen would make me feel truly clean, and none have caused my wife to comment on how fresh my breath now smells. This does. It doesn&#x27;t burn, it&#x27;s made of good stuff. I would like to see a better cap design since the label recommends pouring into the cap and not drinking straight from the bottle, but I can certainly live with it.</li>
            <li> Neem has the cleanest taste and this mouthwash makes my teeth and mouth feel so fresh.  Excellent ingredients.  I am about to order more.</li>
            <li> I have never used Neem products before and am really impressed at how much I do love everything about the product.  My mouth feels fresh and again....no chemicals, it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li> I use nothing else though I supplement it with a fluoride rinse.</li>
            <li> I was unsure that I wanted to pay the price for a mouthwash but I will admit it is worth every cent. Theraneem mouthwash (mint or cinnamon) is a great product for the entire family. It does not burn, sting, or cause discomfort life many other commercial brands. It really leaves your entire mouth feeling and smelling fresh for an entire day, even after eating or drinking. This product get five stars. Buyers beware: customers should try to purchas this product whole sale or in bulk; it tends to run out quickly, and the expense may be a deterent for those on a budget like my self, but it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have tried Therabreath Tonsil Stone kit and it was just waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this once a day for few weeks saw great improvements in curing the Tonsil stones. I&#x27;m seeing the less number of stones now and I still see some but they are small. I&#x27;m sure soon I will have none in my throat and I can smile again without that embarrassment.</li>
            <li> Am a huge fan of NEEM and this is a great mouthwash. I vary between it and my fluoride one.</li>
            <li> This product is not so bad, and the taste is not that great.  Perhaps its better with the toothpaste which I have not tried yet.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is not your standard alcohol ridden, mint fresh type. It has a type of herbal taste which I&#x27;ve gotten used to. Most importantly, though, is that it leaves my mouth so extremely fresh without the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; from alcohol. Neem is proven to have many strong natural capabilities, and when coupled with the Neem toothpaste, I have found to have much less problems with my dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dental hygienist.  Non-alcohol based so helps with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Best mouth wash I  have every had.</li>
            <li> Love this mouthwash and their toothpaste which a tiny bit is enough to do the job and also whitens your teeth.</li>
            <li> I gave this mouthwash 4 stars so everyone would read it. I don&#x27;t read 5 star reviews. I am an individual who has used this mouthwash for about 8 year when I found out I had gum disease. Along with my dentist good advice I still have my teeth. I researched mouthwashes and chose this one because:&lt;br /&gt;1. It has Neem leaf in it.&lt;br /&gt;2. It has spearmint and peppermint oil which coat your gums and keep this and other healing properties in the mouthwash working longer on your gums.&lt;br /&gt;3. It does not have alcohol which will dry out your gums.&lt;br /&gt;4. The natural ingredients kill multiple mouth bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;5. There is not fluoride for those that are sensitive. I live in a city that has fluoride add to the water and use fluoride toothpaste. I have enough.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know anything about Neem until my gums started giving my trouble. I use this along with Neem toothpaste and have seen a great improvement in my gums. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you are looking at this product it is because you are probably aware of the adverse effects Flouride and Chlorine can have on your bodily tissues and bones.  But we&#x27;ll save that conversation for another day.  This particular mouthwash is amazing because all of the ingredients within it are nutritious and digestible.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how well you gargle, if you use chemical based oral hygiene products you will swallow some of the product so make sure that the product is somewhat nutritious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I am an ex-cigar smoker that exposed my teeth and gums to 4 years of punishment.  I tried many &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; grade oral hygiene products in a vain attempt to restore health to my teeth and gums  and they all had a limited effect.  This particular mouthwash is the only one that completely stopped the bleeding and eradicated the mild halitosis.  I use this alongside the TheraNeem toothpaste with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product I strongly suggest purchasing a Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser and using the Theraneem Mouthwash as a solution in the reservoir.</li>
            <li> Sent this back, as it has ingredients not acceptable to me.</li>
            <li> very good.will buy again soon..</li>
            <li> I ordered this product through Amazon. After I brush my teeth, this mouth wash makes my mouth feel so fresh and clean! I intend to continue to purchase this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Patricia</li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash.  Sometimes I use it instead of toothpaste.  Cleans just as well.  I also use TheraNeem toothpaste and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It cleans plaque and refreshes breath. It has a fresh smell. I use it with Neem toothpaste.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who was having some gum issues.  She reported back that his stuff ws great.  Cured her issue.</li>
            <li> I really liked it. After using this mouthwash you get a very different (better) feeling as compared to other non-herbal mouthwash that you see in general stores.</li>
            <li> Really love this product.  Just wish price was lower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an organic mouthwash. I tried The Natural Dentist mouthwash for gingivitis, but it didn&#x27;t really work that great (or maybe it just felt to mild to be working) and the taste wasn&#x27;t as good. I felt this mouthwash tasted great! I love the smell too. I ordered a burdock and neem shampoo in the past and loved the smell so I knew I&#x27;d love this too. I was really expecting a chinese herbal minty taste without any of the sweetness, but it actually tastes so much better. It&#x27;s minty, sweet-ish, and has a spice flavor to it. Already a fan after the 1st use.</li>
