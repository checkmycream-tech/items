            <li>Make sure to use this in a ventilated area because it does have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I have tried every brand available to me in my town--</li>

            <li>It bonds like no other.</li>

            <li> The glue isn&#x27;t very long lasting</li>
            <li> The last two bottles that i bought have not held my nails on for very long.</li>
            <li> It only takes about 15 seconds for it to fully dry.</li>
            <li> But i think it would last longer for some people due to their daily activities.</li>
            <li> Does not come as pictured, much smaller, and I&#x27;m curious to find out if there&#x27;s even anything in the bottle...</li>
            <li> , i suggest you do it slowly and gently, i ripped my nail off</li>
            <li> So I spent $5 for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried it on a broken  nail and it really did not work.</li>
            <li> but i believe that is because i was too rough with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glue not strong enough</li>
            <li> Other brands seem to lose their, well, stick, within a couple of days, but Kiss never lets me down, and the bottle never gets glued shut like some other brands.</li>
            <li> EVEN HALF WAY</li>
            <li> I went through a bottle in less than a month</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t mastered the mess out of using it yet.</li>
            <li> This little bottle will be gone in no time.</li>
            <li> UNLESS YOU WANT A USED DRIED UP BOTTLE  </li>
            <li> DRIED UP</li>
            <li> The glue bottle inside the bubble packaging was cracked -- and, of course, the glue in the bottle was dried and hardened.  </li>
            <li> It a waste of my money for it.</li>
            <li> works but not enough for a project other perhaps than gluing on fake finger nails.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> kinda hard to squeeze out</li>
            <li> Useless.  </li>
            <li> I AM SOOO MAD DO NOT BUY THIS</li>
            <li> I am a false nail addict!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best nail glue I have tried. It bonds like no other. If you are looking for the best, then try this product because you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I only wish it came in a larger bottle. This little bottle will be gone in no time. Glue sticks quickly. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way the glue comes out. It&#x27;s like I had to force a drop to come out. It&#x27;s not smooth but it is strong.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, which is why it has a two star rating instead of one... Does not come as pictured, much smaller, and I&#x27;m curious to find out if there&#x27;s even anything in the bottle...</li>
            <li> Glue not strong enough</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used product yet because my nails HAVENT come in but seems nice, bottle is smaller than I excpected though, pretty pricey for the size</li>
            <li> I work 2 retail jobs, it holds up but still looking for something stronger. if I wasn&#x27;t so hard on my nails this would still be a  great product.</li>
            <li> Love it, dries within seconds</li>
            <li> it is great glue BUT you have to be careful and don&#x27;t leave any glue on the top when you&#x27;re done or it will glue shut.</li>
            <li> Best nail glue ever. I gave up on doing my own because all the glues I tried didn&#x27;t last more than 2 or 3 days. Tried this &amp; my nail tips have been on for 8 days now. I just ordered more so I don&#x27;t run out. Beats going to the salon &amp; spending $55.00 on what I can now do myself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far and lasts and lasts. Stronger than a regular super glue for sure. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.. Fantastic glue, especially as I do my own gel nails and when one cracks or breaks it&#x27;s a perfect glue to fix a broken nail or stick on a new tip *thumbs up* :)</li>
            <li> Good.  A little too liquid and have to use more  at times.</li>
            <li> this glue is awesome! It holds so good its much better then the glue that comes in the  nail pack and the holding power is amazing</li>
            <li> It works great. Tried it put fimo slices on , y nails amd its great I reccomd it . Great for naile</li>
            <li> Dries super fast, arrived early. Great buy, costs more in stores.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it to glue on rhinestones and it dries very very quickly and holds great!</li>
            <li> The glue does not hold very well, but it does dry fast. It came with dries glue already in the bottle before use, which I was kind of unhappy about, but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. The last thing about this glue is it comes out really fast; Does not allow me control of the amount of glue I use.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this: No I wouldn&#x27;t. I uses this glue for acrylic nails but maybe it might work for something else. :/</li>
            <li> Best glue! works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I like to wear press-on nails alot and this nail glue holds up the longest. It only takes about 15 seconds for it to fully dry. The glue isn&#x27;t very long lasting so i have re-apply about 1 or 2 times a day. But i think it would last longer for some people due to their daily activities. This did not damage my natural nails at all and the glue was easy to remove. Please make sure not to get this glue on your skin or in your eyes. Make sure to use this in a ventilated area because it does have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> works but not enough for a project other perhaps than gluing on fake finger nails.</li>
            <li> I AM SOOO MAD DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU WANT A USED DRIED UP BOTTLE  I PUT THE BOTTLE UP NEXT TO THE SUN AND IT WASENT EVEN HALF WAY AND I TESTED IT AND IT WAS ALL DRIED UP DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PERSON😡😡😡</li>
            <li> The glue bottle inside the bubble packaging was cracked -- and, of course, the glue in the bottle was dried and hardened.  Useless.  And now it seems it can be mailed TO me, but can&#x27;t be returned BY me, because it&#x27;s hazardous.  So I spent $5 for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> Faster than most glues, but still a bit on the thin side.  I haven&#x27;t mastered the mess out of using it yet.</li>
            <li> Rite when I get this glue I can tell that there nothing in it. I shake it n test it out if there any glue but nope. It a waste of my money for it.</li>
            <li> This worked ok for the intended purpose.</li>
            <li> used once then the top was glued on, not impressed with the product.</li>
            <li> Tried it on a broken  nail and it really did not work.</li>
            <li> According to this website on amount of toxins in makeup products, this one had the lowest risks and toxins for nail glue.  [...]</li>
            <li> This is a superior product.  Good hold, easy to use, and hold lasts a long, long time. I love this product and have used it for years.  I intend to purchase again.</li>
            <li> Product works like it&#x27;s described.</li>
            <li> This took about 1 week to get to my house.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it the day i got it, and it works very well and very fast.&lt;br /&gt;if you are going to file your nails after applying this, i suggest you do it slowly and gently, i ripped my nail off but i believe that is because i was too rough with it.&lt;br /&gt;not the best i&#x27;ve ever tried, not the worst.&lt;br /&gt;also, its a little hard to squeeze out of the bottle</li>
            <li> Kiss nail glue is THE BEST. I have tried every brand available to me in my town-- I am a false nail addict!! Other brands seem to lose their, well, stick, within a couple of days, but Kiss never lets me down, and the bottle never gets glued shut like some other brands.</li>
            <li> I use to love this nail glue but I don&#x27;t know what happened to it. The last two bottles that i bought have not held my nails on for very long. I have used this glue for over 20 years and all of a sudden, something changed. I went through a bottle in less than a month and i&#x27;m almost 1/2 way through my second bottle. Did you change the formula? If so, please change it back!!</li>
            <li> This glue dries extremely fast ,and can be messy if not applied right. It keeps my nails on though!</li>
            <li> This glue is awesome it gives me some really great hold. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is by far the very best, fastest drying, most effective nail glue created! I had never purchased this before from the store,  but I decided to take a chance and I&#x27;m so glad!! I will never buy another nail glue except this one, on AMAZON!</li>
            <li> love this glue for putting on nail tips. the only issue is you have to be careful to wipe the top or the bottle will glue shut.</li>
            <li> This is the strongest glue I&#x27;ve found to keep my nails on all week. I highly recommend it. I buy it in bulk so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Great product - works fast!</li>
            <li> Works great in my circumstances, I handle heavy boxes during work, and when I come home and do the dishes they don&#x27;t fall off ! Great glue even when getting my hands dirty, and gentle on my nails:) Love!!</li>
            <li> This works really fast and absolutely saves your nail.</li>
            <li> this glue is kinda watery and it comes out 1 drop at a time. kinda hard to squeeze out but you only need one drop or 2 per nail so that&#x27;s fine. It dries HELLA FAST but thats good too! Its very strong also A+++</li>
