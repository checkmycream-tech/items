            <li>The product works GREAT!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing !!!!!!!</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, when you use all the mascara, this case will work perfectly as an eyeglass case, which is what I plan to do.</li>
            <li>And the packaging is so attractive!  </li>
            <li>Simply a great invention!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the brand name 3D mascara, very impressive it is and no joke on the length and volume it produces.  </li>
            <li>It works great!!</li>
            <li>The best mascara ever!</li>
            <li>This product works great!</li>
            <li>so if you want any fiber mascara to work for you, you must apply it correctly (mascara, fiber, mascara etc) until you achieve the perfect amount for you.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li>So great for the price too!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best you can get for $5</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m a mascara freak, and I am so happy with the outcome.</li>
            <li>Worked great for about 3 days until the fibers ran out..</li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>Great product but the seller posts a photo of a case as well.</li>
            <li>But it was a good price for something so good!</li>
            <li>so glad i did!!  </li>
            <li>Love!!</li>
            <li>I like the condition it came in, very nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>Very Happy, so happy I bought it two more times for family.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Honestly I thought this fiber mascera sucked!</li>
            <li>Its okay not the greatest thing in the world</li>
            <li>The mascara alone is really nice too!</li>
            <li>I got it in two days which is wonderful :)</li>
            <li>it was ok not the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price. !!!!</li>
            <li>does a great job and lashes look amazing</li>
            <li>I am so happy with the fiber lasher they are amazing..</li>
            <li>Younique is good</li>
            <li>This was a good purchase though the fibers gt in my eye sometimes.</li>
            <li>It is good to get what you want in a product.</li>
            <li>Looked good for 20 mins</li>
            <li>I told her that her lashes were gorgeous, and asked what mascara she used.</li>
            <li>I tried hers out and loved them, but when I went to buy some from Younique, I did not like the price.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with my results and in addition the customer service provided was fantastic; amazon&#x27;s website indicated my product should arrive in 2 weeks</li>
            <li>The gel is good but the fibers are almost like powder or dust.</li>
            <li>It works really good.</li>
            <li>Loved it took a Lil while to get here</li>
            <li>This product is great, but I assumed it would come in the nice &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; that it shows in the photo.  </li>
            <li>but when I got it I loved it</li>
            <li>For the price, this is a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s just as good as the younique brand.</li>
            <li>Again, I am happy with my decision to buy this mascara eye lash makeup &#x27;kit&#x27; because the case that houses the mascara and fiber is very strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara, everything is great except for one thing, the fibers fall off onto your face.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it to me to avoid wrinkles as best as I can.</li>
            <li>and i knew i would be able to find a 3D mascara just as great.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara!  </li>
            <li>Already ordered more!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>but the price makes it much better!</li>

            <li>Now I am in love with the product!  </li>
            <li>I love the transplanting gel, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>Love this product and the price!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>, I LOVE this mascara!</li>
            <li>I love this product, I read the reviews before I bought it, and was prepared for the fibers, but had NO idea the amount that winds up in your eye!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It arrived fairly quickly and the look is elegant and BEAUTIFUL!!</li>
            <li>It make my eyes look amazing</li>
            <li>works amazing</li>
            <li>If you put it on both sides it elongated amazingly.</li>
            <li>And looked amazing.</li>
            <li>I did it twice and was blown away by how amazing my lashes looked.</li>
            <li>Works amazing just use one coat of any water proof mascara and it stays on all day.</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>This mascara is seriously amazing</li>
            <li>oh these fiber lashes are so amazing...</li>
            <li>the results are amazing</li>
            <li>These are absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>great price...perfect packaging and most of all the most amazing results:</li>
            <li>It works amazing.</li>
            <li>I ended up having to use my own mascara to get an even coat.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>good value, would have given more stars but it shows a case and it DOESN&#x27;T come with a case.</li>
            <li>I believe in sharing beauty products with my loved ones so we can all look sexy.</li>
            <li>so I had to kind of go off how the name brand had been used in YouTube videos.</li>
            <li>They come in a cuter case than the picture looks like and the tubes themselves are really nice.</li>
            <li>she liked it.</li>
            <li>Not as nice if you&#x27;re giving it as a gift.  </li>
            <li>everything came packaged nice n neat with safety seals...</li>
            <li>I thought I had read the correct steps were to apply your own mascara, then the gel, then the fiber, then another coat of gel.  </li>
            <li>and they were nicely packaged</li>
            <li>This is the best mascara by far!!</li>
            <li>pro is that the customer service was great and they refunded my order in full.</li>
            <li>great price and works pretty well!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, my eyelashes have never looked better.</li>
            <li>Even for a lady without any natural lashes this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cute and nice.</li>
            <li>so I decided to apply my own mascara on top</li>
            <li>it comes off So easy!</li>
            <li>love love love this!</li>
            <li>Not only does this company have great customer service but a great product.</li>
            <li>if used properly great great product this will be the only fiber mascara I will buy</li>
            <li>Works great for the first three uses, then you run out of fibers.</li>
            <li>Love it, Brings out my eyes</li>
            <li>Lovely, Better price than you see on Face Book.  </li>
            <li>Younique is not any better, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara bc</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>love it it seems to work</li>
            <li>I wonder if it was written by a bunch of teenagers that didn&#x27;t know better?</li>
            <li>Was hoping for a better result.  </li>
            <li>im so in love with these.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>And what I like more about it is the price.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product</li>
            <li>I found this one and when i tried it on i instantly fell in love with it!!!!</li>
            <li>so glad i came across this one.</li>
            <li>Maybe the fibers would stick better had the mascara been more &amp;quot;wet.&amp;quot;</li>
            <li>Better than pricey fiber lashes that I bought at Ulta.</li>
            <li>The setting gel is better off by itself.</li>
            <li>But already love the product</li>
            <li>I love the service  </li>
            <li>The more you apply the 2 steps the longer and thicker</li>
            <li>I just love this stuff.</li>
            <li>im about out :)  </li>
            <li>Works ok but fibers fall off</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I found a Dior product I like better</li>
            <li>I love this volumiser</li>
            <li>I love the mascara.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something like this that would help my mom feel better about her lashes because she just beat cancer and the chemotherapy.  </li>
            <li>Found it worked better than yonique</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>That was when I found the Love Alpha brand.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with this product for the price and would recommend trying it.</li>
            <li>but I love the mascara.</li>
            <li>Then more adhesive gel.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, it works magic on my eyes</li>
            <li>Thank you! :)</li>
            <li>and I am in love with this masara.  </li>
            <li>I have already ordered more.  </li>
            <li>A suggestion to some that are having issues with the fibers:  I have been putting a coat of the transplanting gel over the top of the fibers to hold them in place.  </li>
            <li>The gel was okay, sort of like a low-quality mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I will give a better star rating once i use the mascara.</li>
            <li>Some reviews mentioned you could layer your own mascara at the end to secure the fibers on better</li>
            <li>I love my mascara.</li>
            <li>Even bought my 2 sisters a set for Christmas :)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it just the fibers get in my eye and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works OK for the price</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product..</li>
            <li>Overall great product!</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>MUCH better price.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my favorite makeup product.</li>
            <li>...it was an okay mascara</li>
            <li>well, for lack of a better word, gloopy.</li>
            <li>I will not buy more from them.</li>
            <li>Big Beautiful Eyelashes in this bottle!!!</li>
            <li>I curl them, use the gel mascara, add the fiber and use the mascara wand again and it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>I love it,</li>
            <li>I love this product I bought it because I&#x27;ve seen it before and a YouTube review.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was buying</li>
            <li>I do suggest that you watch a YouTube video on how to apply because if you don&#x27;t know how it will lose the fibers all over what I did was place my favorite mascara one coat</li>
            <li>so this works way better.</li>
            <li>Love love mines</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it many more times thinking once I get the hang of it</li>
            <li>the results would turn out better, wasn&#x27;t the case at all.</li>
            <li>I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Although it took longer than the delivery date to get here</li>
            <li>Product is cute.</li>
            <li>mine also came with the cheetah case I love it</li>
            <li>I wanted to LOVE this product because I used to be able to buy a pre-mixed fiber mascara that was phenomenal</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t pay more for this</li>
            <li>I love the gel eye lash for mascara</li>
            <li>but the case is cute</li>
            <li>She likes it but doesn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>Also, i made sure to read the reviews before i purchased.</li>
            <li>I saw where most people didn&#x27;t get the case.</li>
            <li>I made sure to contact the seller and ask for it.</li>
            <li>Love the mascara</li>
            <li>i  love the case they come in.</li>
            <li>There are several videos to teach you how and practice makes perfect.</li>
            <li>and  I love the mascara by it</li>
            <li>Love the product but it didn&#x27;t come with the case as shown in the picture....</li>
            <li>When a vender shows me a case that will accompany the product it better come with the product.</li>
            <li>Love the mascara but didn&#x27;t receive my case that was supposed to come with it</li>
            <li>i was sure it was supposed to</li>
            <li>Love this, don&#x27;t get the fibers in your eye, hurts like hell..</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Love my love alpha mascara.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff out there and such a great price and works even better than the high priced stuff out there</li>
            <li>Very Cool Love Love Love</li>
            <li>VERY worth it!</li>
            <li>honestly nothing you can&#x27;t just clean up within seconds</li>
            <li>works just a good as Younique for a fraction of the price... if you apply regular mascara first, even better!!!  </li>
            <li>Plus, you get the super cute containers &amp; case with this brand!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and so easy to apply</li>
            <li>but I love the product makes my lashes look big and beautiful</li>
            <li>I actually ordered this stuff, this beautiful package from eBay ending up paying for it more than here</li>
            <li>plus you get the hang of applying it better and its cheap</li>
            <li>Great so far</li>
            <li>Particles easily fall in eyes and causes disturbance</li>
            <li>the gel it self was easy to use but the fibers were another story</li>
            <li>and I felt as though I moved very quickly in doing so.</li>
            <li>I actually wanted the case more than the mascara, as they are great for an eyeglass case.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>As for the fibers, I had better luck with them when I used a clean mascara brush to apply them, rather than the wand in the tube.  </li>
            <li>Of course, the kit fits easily in your purse/backpak/clutch, etc.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more, probably 5 at a time, lol.</li>
            <li>First, I used my own brand of waterproof mascara after curling my lashes.  </li>
            <li>first the gel from bottom to top of lashes then thoroughly swoosh the fibers brush in its own container and apply on the tips of my lashes, then apply the gel on the tips quickly before anything dries, then repeat.</li>
            <li>My review is this: if you are looking for slight results at a fraction of the cost, this is great!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wash it off and in the morning I am more lazy and they still look perfect</li>
            <li>love the way it lengthens my terribly small eyelashes, and the price was perfect for my budget.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Lol it was nice for those 3 days but not sure I would buy more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cute and it came pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too cheap, and too much of a skeptic to pay $30 for something I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like!</li>
            <li>I really love it it really brings out my eyes and the length of my lashes!!</li>
            <li>And the price difference is huge.  </li>
            <li>The fibers come out as huge clumps, no matter what I tried.</li>
            <li>and there was a huge difference.</li>
            <li>$6 and free shipping from China.  </li>
            <li>Actually works great ...</li>
            <li>Is this vegan &amp; cruelty free</li>
            <li>and I was kinda iffy about it because it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap and does what it says</li>
            <li>Covers of both products were crooked &amp; bent, lol, but doesn&#x27;t affect use.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product I use my regular mascara with the fibers they seem to stay in place better that way.</li>
            <li>and I got it for such a great price.</li>
            <li>Emailed the sender they apologized and they sent me the case free of charge.</li>
            <li>I liked the product, it was easy to apply and looked very good, it was comparable to the more expensive fiber eye lash mascara.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to wash off too.</li>
            <li>Came fast and works wonderful on my long eyelashes</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very easy to work with and pretty quick on shipping too.</li>
            <li>It works great, might be a little clumpy for some, but with another brush to smooth it all it, it&#x27;s FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>Definitely watch youtube tutorials on how to use and you will get amazing results!</li>
            <li>I will be ordering some more for my sister, my niece, and a friend who&#x27;s getting married in April.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>Even if I get lazy and don&#x27;t wash it off before bed, they look great in the morning!  </li>
            <li>I love it,;)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m excited to.</li>
            <li>Took about 20 days to arrive, but worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I heard about this product before I spent on a diff popular fiber mascara that costs waaaayyyyyyyy more than this one.</li>
            <li>Doesnt come with case but totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I tried it immediately, I was so excited.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome mascara and for the price even if shipping is a little bit longer, it is soooo worth it.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to start and end your original applications with your own WATERPROOF MASCARA and use an eyelash curler before starting the process.</li>
            <li>Best thing that ever came into my life, I wish I didn&#x27;t run out of the product so fast, but it was everything I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an awesome product just as good as the expensive brands!</li>
            <li>Great product, but the fiber lashes dry out quick</li>
            <li>, so worth it...not a huge hassle like you might think.  </li>
            <li>WOW its so amazing.</li>
            <li>Very upset I got more fibers in my eye than on my lashes..</li>
            <li>Not as good as last time I ordered them.</li>
            <li>It is ok but not what I was really wanting</li>
            <li>For under $7 this was a definite good buy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.</li>
            <li>that is only immediately and once thats cleared away, your good.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing about this purchase was the case that it came in.</li>
            <li>I absolute love ❤</li>
            <li>it has my lashes soft, but very long this is great!!!</li>
            <li>but they quickly gave me a refund.</li>
            <li>but I just add another layer of water proof mascara quickly to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The seller was quick to respond to emails.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy that I got to try out for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>She knows how much I love mascara and try so many different brands.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to seal in the fibers with a top coat of either your regular mascara or the transplant gel to keep from having fibers fall on your face.</li>
            <li>The transplanting gel is super...</li>
            <li>I am a makeup junkie, but mostly I stick to high end brands from Sephora.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look good, lots of volume n long......</li>
            <li>but my grand daughter bought the same one and her eyes are beautiful, lashes are very long.</li>
            <li>(Who wants to go from wow to empty eyes when the evening is just getting started and even more important, I want to look as great in the morning as I did the night before.)  </li>
            <li>Extra volume is always nice,  just wish it gave more length since that&#x27;s what it mainly advertises.</li>
            <li>Love it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>And it work even better when u use ur Favorite regular mascara first along with the transplanting gel, fiber by repeating the process to make it pop.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend and buy more from this seller!</li>
            <li>but first impression sucked !</li>
            <li>Really works!!</li>
            <li>So worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the amount you spend.</li>
            <li>, I imagine it is really similar to the $30 kind although I have not tried it.  </li>
            <li>but I think I will have fun with theses</li>
            <li>the $35 price tag was well worth it</li>
            <li>but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>It is soooo worth it.</li>
            <li>Only comes off with warm water.</li>
            <li>Your own regular mascara 2.</li>
            <li>well worth the wait for the 3-4 weeks to ship from overseas.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It would also be nice if the directions for use were in English.</li>
            <li>this was worth a try</li>
            <li>Worth it</li>
            <li>Shipping took forever, over a month, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>So worth the wait</li>
            <li>Its better than what I expected very good price compared to other fiber mascaras.</li>
            <li>When I wash my face, I gently pick the fibers right off and it comes off smooth and does not pull at your lashes like waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>it works great and much cheaper than all the other ones like it.</li>
            <li>It did give u the curl look, length when u put it on right  but not the thickness.</li>
            <li>Right now I will not buy it cause</li>
            <li>Apply the fibers right afterwards.</li>
            <li>All the reviews are so right on.</li>
            <li>Got it right away.</li>
            <li>Once I got it right,  </li>
            <li>You will get beautiful, literally better than false lashes!</li>
            <li>The fibers stick really well to your lashes and makes them look amazing and much longer, love the case that it came in, got it way sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>This came to me fast in the mail, and I love this product so much, I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad I ordered I will be ordering more in the near future!!!</li>
            <li>The delivery wait was kind of long</li>
            <li>Got it a whole lot earlier than I was expecting so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>so I found this and ordered it hoping it would be half as good as the stuff I had</li>
            <li>It gives you sexy eyes with super long lashes.</li>
            <li>And the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>did not get it to apply nicely or correctly seemed very dry</li>
            <li>Very good for the price but the fibers on the fiber applicator get into you eyes and become irritating</li>
            <li>I wore it for the first time and man,</li>
            <li>First the gel then the fibers then seal with gel.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase this mascara at first but then figured what the heck..</li>
            <li>The first time i applied it i did get some of the fibers that fell in my eye</li>
            <li>first of all, it took forever to get delivered.</li>
            <li>, I actually think this one worked better on my eyes.</li>
            <li>This will last quite a while for many applications</li>
            <li>But works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>It is not only better than the 3d fiberlashes by Younique</li>
            <li>But I love the leopard double eyeliners</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the gel stuff you put on first</li>
            <li>I just apply 2 coats of reg masscara and with the second one I use the fibers :-)</li>
            <li>I first heard of fiber lashes when my sister was visiting from out of state in May.</li>
            <li>Shipping does take a while since it is coming overseas but the product was exactly as described</li>
            <li>I coated my lashes with the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; first, then with the fiber.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes after you first put it on, fibers will fall beneath your eyes but</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to pay for the upkeep of eyelash extensions and sure as hell can&#x27;t afford the $40 version of this product, then you should definitely try this out.</li>
            <li>and she says it worked the first 3 times and then just stopped.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad it finally got here!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product and am here to purchase it for the 3rd time.</li>
            <li>will absolutely buy again and again!</li>
            <li>Instructions are not in English so make sure you know to use 1.</li>
            <li>Was going to order some from Younique, but decided to try this first</li>
            <li>The first time it was lost</li>
            <li>I am very upset!</li>
            <li>I did experience the fibers falling out as the day went on the first day</li>
            <li>Love the product my only problem is that it didn&#x27;t come with the case like it is shown.</li>
            <li>Really comes out like 3d!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s it...and with practice it starts to become more simple.  </li>
            <li>Reading the description I was to believe that it would increase length, volume better then a regular mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love it, Just wish it last longer!!</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying this brand</li>
            <li>but overall I am satisfied they did make somewhat of a difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li>No one knew what was quite different about me, but they liked the new look.  </li>
            <li>The mascara and fibers both came in unsealed tubes in just a ziploc type bag (no seal), which is really not something that is good for a product that is going to be used so near my eyes (which I happen to value!)  </li>
            <li>My advice...take your time, if you feel the need to apply to lower lashes then make certain to coat them with regular mascara after to avoid the top snd bottom from sticking together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never use any other kind.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works as well as the $30 kind from Younique.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Black Leopard brand since I hadyet to try any other brands of fiber mascara and the price was great!</li>
            <li>A wonderful look for special nights, but a little too much work for everyday.  </li>
            <li>This is an easy fix though if you add one more application of the transplanting gel to hold fibers in place, that will work or simply use a different brand of mascara and that works just as well too. 1.</li>
            <li>You can repeat the process for even thicker, longer lashes just make sure the first application is completely dry.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, makes the length of my eyes lashes super long.</li>
            <li>For the price I am satisfied I just wish it would have worked better, the fibers don&#x27;t really go on and there are hardly any fibers at all</li>
            <li>Other than that for the price its more than worth it.</li>
            <li>I love how long my lashes look when I use fiber mascara.</li>
            <li>Love long lashes.  </li>
            <li>I applied this mascara to one eye at a time: first transplanting gel, then fibers, then transplanting gel, then fibers again, and one last top coat of my normal mascara.  </li>
            <li>Its as good if not better then</li>
            <li>Subtle, yet impressive and so much better than true false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I could be okay with the black fuzz everywhere if my lashes looked amazing, but thats the real problem: my lashes stuck together in huge messy globs.</li>
            <li>I feel like there was more transplanting gel vs fibers as far as tubes go, and sticking it back in the tube for more doesn&#x27;t help, the instructions were in Chinese</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easily removed too and I never get raccoon eyes as other reviews have stated</li>
            <li>Its was pretty good just late</li>
            <li>I was hoping that this would be a good alternative to the much more expensive original, but it is DEFINITELY not!  </li>
            <li>Also the fiber wand is large and hold fibers</li>
            <li>It came earlier than the expected delivery date that was a pleasant surprise for me.</li>
            <li>it really works on my nonexistent lashes .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but not what I expected,  </li>
            <li>The mascara dries up fast</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t much of a risk.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and I work 10 hours days, running around our warehouse, and in very humid conditions (Oklahoma)</li>
            <li>However the mascara works very well .</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>Did not give results that I was looking for, but shipped and received fast.</li>
            <li>: finish off with a waterproof/smudge proof mascara to set the whole thing.</li>
            <li>i really like this product</li>
            <li>The price is way reasonable.  </li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>it works very well.</li>
            <li>it dosnt do much</li>
            <li>This works really well</li>
            <li>and they worked just as well as the very pricey ones.</li>
            <li>Tried them on my daughter who has very find eyelashes</li>
            <li>I was really unsure of this fiber mascara, but the brand name one is around $37, so I thought why not?</li>
            <li>Yes it does work real goog</li>
            <li>The product works ok, the container for the fibers does not twist closed all the way.  </li>
            <li>I just use the gel, micro fibers not so much.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping - product as described.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>There is NO WAY this mascara can compare to Younique but for $5 you can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>It makes it seem as if I have REAL eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It is so much cheaper than Younique and works so well.</li>
            <li>but I paid so much for it</li>
            <li>I didnt really want to barrow it to her</li>
            <li>but it flaked too much to continue using.</li>
            <li>The fibers don&#x27;t really stay on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much have</li>
            <li>I just threw the whole damn thing away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap product and you definitely get what you pay for with this.</li>
            <li>But over all it works really well</li>
            <li>so eh doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really like the fiber tube</li>
            <li>then go straight to the fiber</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast..</li>
            <li>This worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>This product works really well, my lashes are noticeable longer.</li>
            <li>I could have bought myself a whole years supply with the money I spend on extensions.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I love it for it&#x27;s price</li>
            <li>Other than that I love the case and may try using this again one day.</li>
            <li>I would rate this better than the Benefit brand due to the ease of removal and the price.</li>
            <li>Well needless to say I tried it and loved it!</li>
            <li>Worked better than I expected!</li>
            <li>This mascara is very similar to the famous 3D Fiber Lash one, it works the exact same way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to keep from getting the fibers on your face at first</li>
            <li>It is true about needing to have everything open and ready to apply at once.  </li>
            <li>Despite the ridiculously long delivery time, cant really complain because shipping was free.</li>
            <li>So far I am super surprised at the results.</li>
            <li>The case was a little messed up but overall, good condition.</li>
            <li>not as great as the reviews says the fibers get in your eyes and your lashes look pretty much the same not happy with the product</li>
            <li>I live this product it really works</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that the more in practice applying it, the less this will be a problem.</li>
            <li>Swooshing it thoroughly in its container was the trick for me...then apply only about the tips of the lashes quickly followed by the transplanting gel and repeat.</li>
            <li>Tried it several times but the length was not any better then a regular mascara.  </li>
            <li>I normally use Younique 3d fiber mascara and hands down I like this one a lot better.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the results of this generic product and found it was waterproof enough to last over 24 hours, including sleeping in it.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product with high hopes after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>it makes my eyelashes look long and full and had no issues whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Would waste my money on it even if it is cheap!</li>
            <li>I think most of this product was dried out or something when I go</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not hard to figure out</li>
            <li>It took some practice to get it right with the application, I have VERY short eye lashes! !</li>
            <li>Made my eyelashes super long and fibers stayed in place.</li>
            <li>I bought next from different vendor &amp; it was fine</li>
            <li>For girls who don&#x27;t like false lashes such as myself i highly recommend because the formula is easy to apply on and i get so many compliments on.my lashes..</li>
            <li>I told her about my new mascara</li>
            <li>It came with the case which was sealed and brand new.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my lashes look extra long!!!</li>
            <li>By far the least effective fiber mascara of the 4 brands I have used.</li>
            <li>Also I received product earlier than expected with free shipping!</li>
            <li>Except after a while you have fiber on your cheeks and it can only be removed by a tissue or makeup remover tissues which is not good.. other than that they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li>I also use one coat of my old regular mascara to make sure the fibers do not come loose throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>But it came very early</li>
            <li>She used it once and then went right back to her old mascara.  </li>
            <li>Also, arrived early than the estimated date!</li>
            <li>Bought second and not finished with first yet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly the same if you use it correctly!</li>
            <li>You want to do one eye at a time and first put on your regular mascara.</li>
            <li>The package arrived early!</li>
            <li>Great product only complaint directions not in English</li>
            <li>First, the instructions weren&#x27;t in English.  </li>
            <li>this is very long lasting and it can easily be wiped off.</li>
            <li>The packaging looks nice but is slightly on the cheesy side but the brush for the base/over coat is great unlike other cheaper fiber lashes I have tried.</li>
            <li>I was a little let down when I tried it, however, for the money it is a good mascara.</li>
            <li>Kind of dissapointed that mine didn&#x27;t come with the cute case :-(</li>
            <li>Long looking eyelashes for such a cheap price?</li>
            <li>it about kills me every time even if im super careful</li>
            <li>This is a cute product, the only down fall is it cakes up</li>
            <li>I have more volume and less clumpiness with my regular mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that I love fiber mascara in general, since I find that the fibers sometimes make my eyelashes a little more clumpy than regular mascara</li>
            <li>I have short straight old woman eye lashes&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t even get the fibers on fast enough</li>
            <li>but i feel like removed some ofmy natural lashes over time, and I dont get that flases look lik</li>
            <li>So simple,Arived early.</li>
            <li>FIRST USE THE TRANSPLANTING GEL (LONG TUBE).</li>
            <li>I am far from a beginner with fiber mascara, so I know what to expect.</li>
            <li>I would go ahead and spend the money for the real deal next time.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s really selfconcious about her eyelashes now because they are quite short</li>
            <li>but she used them and her eyelashes are so long and pretty with the fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li>I was very &#x27;iffy&#x27; on purchasing this product by reading the mixed reviews.  </li>
            <li>and I have had no trouble with the fibers.  </li>
            <li>I have short straight lashes.</li>
            <li>After I wear it a considerable amount of time, I will come and evaluate the product.</li>
            <li>So leopard classy.</li>
            <li>So for anyone wants to get the 3D definitely go with brand name and splurge on price</li>
            <li>Personally, i think it&#x27;s too much.. like spider legs.</li>
            <li>but so far nothing</li>
            <li>I will probably stick with regular mascara but for those who have really thin or short eyelashes or who have already tried the more expensive fiber mascaras, I think this would be a real win.  </li>
            <li>I mean I look like a princess with fabulous fluttering lashes!  </li>
            <li>It was very easy to apply, at least on a second person.</li>
            <li>I was using two faced better than false lashes, and this is basically the same thing and literally more than half the price.  </li>
            <li>First of all the instructions were in Chinese which wasn&#x27;t too big of a deal considering</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, in addition, if you don&#x27;t know the details of how to apply, DO go on youtube and google how to apply the Younique 3D mascara, same rules apply.</li>
            <li>But I was worried they would be difficult and messy but it was easy, quick and really made her eyes just pop!!</li>
            <li>It really works and makes my lashes long.</li>
            <li>It makes your lashes long and really stands out.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like it because it didn&#x27;t make my lashes long at all</li>
            <li>Arrived timely, and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>The fiber got in my eyes and based on the side effect; I personally didn’t see much of a difference from regular mascaras.</li>
            <li>I work 10+ hours/day in an industrial area and my eyelashes look the same after my long day as they did when I first put it on in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Another thing that I find noteworthy is that the mascara doesn&#x27;t have a strong icky smell--there is NO SMELL at all.  </li>
            <li>also, the fiber tube has a top and a bottom but no threading or anything to keep it closed, what a mess!</li>
            <li>This product flakes off a little bit, but is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>If your not careful you&#x27;ll have spiderleg eyes..</li>
            <li>My ten year old daughter bought this product for me for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Personally I don&#x27;t like that look, but if you are looking for a natural mascara, this is it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the military and can&#x27;t put on to much</li>
            <li>not great love the gel mascara</li>
            <li>Just as good as Younique but not near as expensive.</li>
            <li>Love this product as it looks like I am wearing false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Like many others have stated, they did NOT send the case that is pictured- which is false advertising.  </li>
            <li>Some trouble with the seller but over all the communication between us set it right.  </li>
            <li>Other than that the product works very well</li>
            <li>If you are looking to get dramatic results then you should buy a better product.</li>
            <li>Im curious how this stuff really lasts once you open it.</li>
            <li>the little box pretty</li>
            <li>Second mascara is fiber first is a black gel.</li>
            <li>You really have to get the fiber part down or your eyes will suffer.</li>
            <li>The fibers are not loose enough though, so I go back and forth using the fibers from this, and the fibers from the two faced.</li>
            <li>Finally recieved it two days ago and there is nothing but a dry brush in the natural fiber tube.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are very straight and usually fall after applying mascara even after using an eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>I have read good and bad reviews...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product was great!</li>
            <li> The product works GREAT!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, when you use all the mascara, this case will work perfectly as an eyeglass case, which is what I plan to do.</li>
            <li> And the packaging is so attractive!  </li>
            <li> Simply a great invention!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the brand name 3D mascara, very impressive it is and no joke on the length and volume it produces.  </li>
            <li> It works great!!</li>
            <li> The best mascara ever!</li>
            <li> This product works great!</li>
            <li> so if you want any fiber mascara to work for you, you must apply it correctly (mascara, fiber, mascara etc) until you achieve the perfect amount for you.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> So great for the price too!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best you can get for $5</li>

            <li> Worked great for about 3 days until the fibers ran out..</li>
            <li> Lol</li>
            <li> Great product but the seller posts a photo of a case as well.</li>
            <li> But it was a good price for something so good!</li>
            <li> so glad i did!!  </li>
            <li> Love!!</li>
            <li> I like the condition it came in, very nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> Very Happy, so happy I bought it two more times for family.</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Honestly I thought this fiber mascera sucked!</li>
            <li> Its okay not the greatest thing in the world</li>
            <li> The mascara alone is really nice too!</li>
            <li> I got it in two days which is wonderful :)</li>
            <li> it was ok not the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price. !!!!</li>
            <li> does a great job and lashes look amazing</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the fiber lasher they are amazing..</li>
            <li> Younique is good</li>
            <li> This was a good purchase though the fibers gt in my eye sometimes.</li>
            <li> It is good to get what you want in a product.</li>
            <li> Looked good for 20 mins</li>
            <li> I told her that her lashes were gorgeous, and asked what mascara she used.</li>
            <li> I tried hers out and loved them, but when I went to buy some from Younique, I did not like the price.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my results and in addition the customer service provided was fantastic; amazon&#x27;s website indicated my product should arrive in 2 weeks</li>
            <li> The gel is good but the fibers are almost like powder or dust.</li>
            <li> It works really good.</li>
            <li> Loved it took a Lil while to get here</li>
            <li> This product is great, but I assumed it would come in the nice &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; that it shows in the photo.  </li>
            <li> but when I got it I loved it</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just as good as the younique brand.</li>
            <li> Again, I am happy with my decision to buy this mascara eye lash makeup &#x27;kit&#x27; because the case that houses the mascara and fiber is very strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara, everything is great except for one thing, the fibers fall off onto your face.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it to me to avoid wrinkles as best as I can.</li>
            <li> and i knew i would be able to find a 3D mascara just as great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara!  </li>
            <li> Already ordered more!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> but the price makes it much better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m I love with it!</li>

            <li> I love the transplanting gel, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this product and the price!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> , I LOVE this mascara!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I read the reviews before I bought it, and was prepared for the fibers, but had NO idea the amount that winds up in your eye!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It arrived fairly quickly and the look is elegant and BEAUTIFUL!!</li>
            <li> It make my eyes look amazing</li>
            <li> works amazing</li>
            <li> If you put it on both sides it elongated amazingly.</li>
            <li> And looked amazing.</li>
            <li> I did it twice and was blown away by how amazing my lashes looked.</li>
            <li> Works amazing just use one coat of any water proof mascara and it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> This mascara is seriously amazing</li>
            <li> oh these fiber lashes are so amazing...</li>
            <li> the results are amazing</li>
            <li> These are absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> great price...perfect packaging and most of all the most amazing results:</li>
            <li> It works amazing.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to use my own mascara to get an even coat.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> good value, would have given more stars but it shows a case and it DOESN&#x27;T come with a case.</li>
            <li> I believe in sharing beauty products with my loved ones so we can all look sexy.</li>
            <li> so I had to kind of go off how the name brand had been used in YouTube videos.</li>
            <li> They come in a cuter case than the picture looks like and the tubes themselves are really nice.</li>
            <li> she liked it.</li>
            <li> Not as nice if you&#x27;re giving it as a gift.  </li>
            <li> everything came packaged nice n neat with safety seals...</li>
            <li> I thought I had read the correct steps were to apply your own mascara, then the gel, then the fiber, then another coat of gel.  </li>
            <li> and they were nicely packaged</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara by far!!</li>
            <li> pro is that the customer service was great and they refunded my order in full.</li>
            <li> great price and works pretty well!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, my eyelashes have never looked better.</li>
            <li> Even for a lady without any natural lashes this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute and nice.</li>
            <li> so I decided to apply my own mascara on top</li>
            <li> it comes off So easy!</li>
            <li> love love love this!</li>
            <li> Not only does this company have great customer service but a great product.</li>
            <li> if used properly great great product this will be the only fiber mascara I will buy</li>
            <li> Works great for the first three uses, then you run out of fibers.</li>
            <li> Love it, Brings out my eyes</li>
            <li> Lovely, Better price than you see on Face Book.  </li>
            <li> Younique is not any better, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara bc</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> love it it seems to work</li>
            <li> I wonder if it was written by a bunch of teenagers that didn&#x27;t know better?</li>
            <li> Was hoping for a better result.  </li>
            <li> im so in love with these.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> And what I like more about it is the price.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I found this one and when i tried it on i instantly fell in love with it!!!!</li>
            <li> so glad i came across this one.</li>
            <li> Maybe the fibers would stick better had the mascara been more &amp;quot;wet.&amp;quot;</li>
            <li> Better than pricey fiber lashes that I bought at Ulta.</li>
            <li> The setting gel is better off by itself.</li>
            <li> But already love the product</li>
            <li> I love the service  </li>
            <li> The more you apply the 2 steps the longer and thicker</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff.</li>
            <li> im about out :)  </li>
            <li> Works ok but fibers fall off</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I found a Dior product I like better</li>
            <li> I love this volumiser</li>
            <li> I love the mascara.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something like this that would help my mom feel better about her lashes because she just beat cancer and the chemotherapy.  </li>
            <li> Found it worked better than yonique</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> That was when I found the Love Alpha brand.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with this product for the price and would recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> but I love the mascara.</li>
            <li> Then more adhesive gel.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, it works magic on my eyes</li>
            <li> Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> and I am in love with this masara.  </li>
            <li> I have already ordered more.  </li>
            <li> A suggestion to some that are having issues with the fibers:  I have been putting a coat of the transplanting gel over the top of the fibers to hold them in place.  </li>
            <li> The gel was okay, sort of like a low-quality mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> I will give a better star rating once i use the mascara.</li>
            <li> Some reviews mentioned you could layer your own mascara at the end to secure the fibers on better</li>
            <li> I love my mascara.</li>
            <li> Even bought my 2 sisters a set for Christmas :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love it just the fibers get in my eye and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works OK for the price</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product..</li>
            <li> Overall great product!</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> MUCH better price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my favorite makeup product.</li>
            <li> ...it was an okay mascara</li>
            <li> well, for lack of a better word, gloopy.</li>
            <li> I will not buy more from them.</li>
            <li> Big Beautiful Eyelashes in this bottle!!!</li>
            <li> I curl them, use the gel mascara, add the fiber and use the mascara wand again and it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> I love it,</li>
            <li> I love this product I bought it because I&#x27;ve seen it before and a YouTube review.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was buying</li>
            <li> I do suggest that you watch a YouTube video on how to apply because if you don&#x27;t know how it will lose the fibers all over what I did was place my favorite mascara one coat</li>
            <li> so this works way better.</li>
            <li> Love love mines</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it many more times thinking once I get the hang of it</li>
            <li> the results would turn out better, wasn&#x27;t the case at all.</li>
            <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Although it took longer than the delivery date to get here</li>
            <li> Product is cute.</li>
            <li> mine also came with the cheetah case I love it</li>
            <li> I wanted to LOVE this product because I used to be able to buy a pre-mixed fiber mascara that was phenomenal</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t pay more for this</li>
            <li> I love the gel eye lash for mascara</li>
            <li> but the case is cute</li>
            <li> She likes it but doesn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Also, i made sure to read the reviews before i purchased.</li>
            <li> I saw where most people didn&#x27;t get the case.</li>
            <li> I made sure to contact the seller and ask for it.</li>
            <li> Love the mascara</li>
            <li> i  love the case they come in.</li>
            <li> There are several videos to teach you how and practice makes perfect.</li>
            <li> and  I love the mascara by it</li>
            <li> Love the product but it didn&#x27;t come with the case as shown in the picture....</li>
            <li> When a vender shows me a case that will accompany the product it better come with the product.</li>
            <li> Love the mascara but didn&#x27;t receive my case that was supposed to come with it</li>
            <li> i was sure it was supposed to</li>
            <li> Love this, don&#x27;t get the fibers in your eye, hurts like hell..</li>
            <li> I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Love my love alpha mascara.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff out there and such a great price and works even better than the high priced stuff out there</li>
            <li> Very Cool Love Love Love</li>
            <li> VERY worth it!</li>
            <li> honestly nothing you can&#x27;t just clean up within seconds</li>
            <li> works just a good as Younique for a fraction of the price... if you apply regular mascara first, even better!!!  </li>
            <li> Plus, you get the super cute containers &amp; case with this brand!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and so easy to apply</li>
            <li> but I love the product makes my lashes look big and beautiful</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this stuff, this beautiful package from eBay ending up paying for it more than here</li>
            <li> plus you get the hang of applying it better and its cheap</li>
            <li> Great so far</li>
            <li> Particles easily fall in eyes and causes disturbance</li>
            <li> the gel it self was easy to use but the fibers were another story</li>
            <li> and I felt as though I moved very quickly in doing so.</li>
            <li> I actually wanted the case more than the mascara, as they are great for an eyeglass case.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> As for the fibers, I had better luck with them when I used a clean mascara brush to apply them, rather than the wand in the tube.  </li>
            <li> Of course, the kit fits easily in your purse/backpak/clutch, etc.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more, probably 5 at a time, lol.</li>
            <li> First, I used my own brand of waterproof mascara after curling my lashes.  </li>
            <li> first the gel from bottom to top of lashes then thoroughly swoosh the fibers brush in its own container and apply on the tips of my lashes, then apply the gel on the tips quickly before anything dries, then repeat.</li>
            <li> My review is this: if you are looking for slight results at a fraction of the cost, this is great!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash it off and in the morning I am more lazy and they still look perfect</li>
            <li> love the way it lengthens my terribly small eyelashes, and the price was perfect for my budget.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lol it was nice for those 3 days but not sure I would buy more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cute and it came pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too cheap, and too much of a skeptic to pay $30 for something I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like!</li>
            <li> I really love it it really brings out my eyes and the length of my lashes!!</li>
            <li> And the price difference is huge.  </li>
            <li> The fibers come out as huge clumps, no matter what I tried.</li>
            <li> and there was a huge difference.</li>
            <li> $6 and free shipping from China.  </li>
            <li> Actually works great ...</li>
            <li> Is this vegan &amp; cruelty free</li>
            <li> and I was kinda iffy about it because it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap and does what it says</li>
            <li> Covers of both products were crooked &amp; bent, lol, but doesn&#x27;t affect use.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product I use my regular mascara with the fibers they seem to stay in place better that way.</li>
            <li> and I got it for such a great price.</li>
            <li> Emailed the sender they apologized and they sent me the case free of charge.</li>
            <li> I liked the product, it was easy to apply and looked very good, it was comparable to the more expensive fiber eye lash mascara.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to wash off too.</li>
            <li> Came fast and works wonderful on my long eyelashes</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very easy to work with and pretty quick on shipping too.</li>
            <li> It works great, might be a little clumpy for some, but with another brush to smooth it all it, it&#x27;s FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> Definitely watch youtube tutorials on how to use and you will get amazing results!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering some more for my sister, my niece, and a friend who&#x27;s getting married in April.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> Even if I get lazy and don&#x27;t wash it off before bed, they look great in the morning!  </li>
            <li> I love it,;)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m excited to.</li>
            <li> Took about 20 days to arrive, but worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I heard about this product before I spent on a diff popular fiber mascara that costs waaaayyyyyyyy more than this one.</li>
            <li> Doesnt come with case but totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I tried it immediately, I was so excited.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome mascara and for the price even if shipping is a little bit longer, it is soooo worth it.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to start and end your original applications with your own WATERPROOF MASCARA and use an eyelash curler before starting the process.</li>
            <li> Best thing that ever came into my life, I wish I didn&#x27;t run out of the product so fast, but it was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome product just as good as the expensive brands!</li>
            <li> Great product, but the fiber lashes dry out quick</li>
            <li> , so worth it...not a huge hassle like you might think.  </li>
            <li> WOW its so amazing.</li>
            <li> Very upset I got more fibers in my eye than on my lashes..</li>
            <li> Not as good as last time I ordered them.</li>
            <li> It is ok but not what I was really wanting</li>
            <li> For under $7 this was a definite good buy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.</li>
            <li> that is only immediately and once thats cleared away, your good.  </li>
            <li> The only good thing about this purchase was the case that it came in.</li>
            <li> I absolute love ❤</li>
            <li> it has my lashes soft, but very long this is great!!!</li>
            <li> but they quickly gave me a refund.</li>
            <li> but I just add another layer of water proof mascara quickly to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The seller was quick to respond to emails.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy that I got to try out for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> She knows how much I love mascara and try so many different brands.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to seal in the fibers with a top coat of either your regular mascara or the transplant gel to keep from having fibers fall on your face.</li>
            <li> The transplanting gel is super...</li>
            <li> I am a makeup junkie, but mostly I stick to high end brands from Sephora.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look good, lots of volume n long......</li>
            <li> but my grand daughter bought the same one and her eyes are beautiful, lashes are very long.</li>
            <li> (Who wants to go from wow to empty eyes when the evening is just getting started and even more important, I want to look as great in the morning as I did the night before.)  </li>
            <li> Extra volume is always nice,  just wish it gave more length since that&#x27;s what it mainly advertises.</li>
            <li> Love it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> And it work even better when u use ur Favorite regular mascara first along with the transplanting gel, fiber by repeating the process to make it pop.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend and buy more from this seller!</li>
            <li> but first impression sucked !</li>
            <li> Really works!!</li>
            <li> So worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the amount you spend.</li>
            <li> , I imagine it is really similar to the $30 kind although I have not tried it.  </li>
            <li> but I think I will have fun with theses</li>
            <li> the $35 price tag was well worth it</li>
            <li> but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> It is soooo worth it.</li>
            <li> Only comes off with warm water.</li>
            <li> Your own regular mascara 2.</li>
            <li> well worth the wait for the 3-4 weeks to ship from overseas.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It would also be nice if the directions for use were in English.</li>
            <li> this was worth a try</li>
            <li> Worth it</li>
            <li> Shipping took forever, over a month, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> So worth the wait</li>
            <li> Its better than what I expected very good price compared to other fiber mascaras.</li>
            <li> When I wash my face, I gently pick the fibers right off and it comes off smooth and does not pull at your lashes like waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> it works great and much cheaper than all the other ones like it.</li>
            <li> It did give u the curl look, length when u put it on right  but not the thickness.</li>
            <li> Right now I will not buy it cause</li>
            <li> Apply the fibers right afterwards.</li>
            <li> All the reviews are so right on.</li>
            <li> Got it right away.</li>
            <li> Once I got it right,  </li>
            <li> You will get beautiful, literally better than false lashes!</li>
            <li> The fibers stick really well to your lashes and makes them look amazing and much longer, love the case that it came in, got it way sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> This came to me fast in the mail, and I love this product so much, I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> and I am glad I ordered I will be ordering more in the near future!!!</li>
            <li> The delivery wait was kind of long</li>
            <li> Got it a whole lot earlier than I was expecting so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> so I found this and ordered it hoping it would be half as good as the stuff I had</li>
            <li> It gives you sexy eyes with super long lashes.</li>
            <li> And the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> did not get it to apply nicely or correctly seemed very dry</li>
            <li> Very good for the price but the fibers on the fiber applicator get into you eyes and become irritating</li>
            <li> I wore it for the first time and man,</li>
            <li> First the gel then the fibers then seal with gel.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this mascara at first but then figured what the heck..</li>
            <li> The first time i applied it i did get some of the fibers that fell in my eye</li>
            <li> first of all, it took forever to get delivered.</li>
            <li> , I actually think this one worked better on my eyes.</li>
            <li> This will last quite a while for many applications</li>
            <li> But works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> It is not only better than the 3d fiberlashes by Younique</li>
            <li> But I love the leopard double eyeliners</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the gel stuff you put on first</li>
            <li> I just apply 2 coats of reg masscara and with the second one I use the fibers :-)</li>
            <li> I first heard of fiber lashes when my sister was visiting from out of state in May.</li>
            <li> Shipping does take a while since it is coming overseas but the product was exactly as described</li>
            <li> I coated my lashes with the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; first, then with the fiber.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes after you first put it on, fibers will fall beneath your eyes but</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to pay for the upkeep of eyelash extensions and sure as hell can&#x27;t afford the $40 version of this product, then you should definitely try this out.</li>
            <li> and she says it worked the first 3 times and then just stopped.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad it finally got here!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product and am here to purchase it for the 3rd time.</li>
            <li> will absolutely buy again and again!</li>
            <li> Instructions are not in English so make sure you know to use 1.</li>
            <li> Was going to order some from Younique, but decided to try this first</li>
            <li> The first time it was lost</li>
            <li> I am very upset!</li>
            <li> I did experience the fibers falling out as the day went on the first day</li>
            <li> Love the product my only problem is that it didn&#x27;t come with the case like it is shown.</li>
            <li> Really comes out like 3d!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s it...and with practice it starts to become more simple.  </li>
            <li> Reading the description I was to believe that it would increase length, volume better then a regular mascara.  </li>
            <li> Love it, Just wish it last longer!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this brand</li>
            <li> but overall I am satisfied they did make somewhat of a difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li> No one knew what was quite different about me, but they liked the new look.  </li>
            <li> The mascara and fibers both came in unsealed tubes in just a ziploc type bag (no seal), which is really not something that is good for a product that is going to be used so near my eyes (which I happen to value!)  </li>
            <li> My advice...take your time, if you feel the need to apply to lower lashes then make certain to coat them with regular mascara after to avoid the top snd bottom from sticking together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use any other kind.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works as well as the $30 kind from Younique.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Black Leopard brand since I hadyet to try any other brands of fiber mascara and the price was great!</li>
            <li> A wonderful look for special nights, but a little too much work for everyday.  </li>
            <li> This is an easy fix though if you add one more application of the transplanting gel to hold fibers in place, that will work or simply use a different brand of mascara and that works just as well too. 1.</li>
            <li> You can repeat the process for even thicker, longer lashes just make sure the first application is completely dry.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, makes the length of my eyes lashes super long.</li>
            <li> For the price I am satisfied I just wish it would have worked better, the fibers don&#x27;t really go on and there are hardly any fibers at all</li>
            <li> Other than that for the price its more than worth it.</li>
            <li> I love how long my lashes look when I use fiber mascara.</li>
            <li> Love long lashes.  </li>
            <li> I applied this mascara to one eye at a time: first transplanting gel, then fibers, then transplanting gel, then fibers again, and one last top coat of my normal mascara.  </li>
            <li> Its as good if not better then</li>
            <li> Subtle, yet impressive and so much better than true false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I could be okay with the black fuzz everywhere if my lashes looked amazing, but thats the real problem: my lashes stuck together in huge messy globs.</li>
            <li> I feel like there was more transplanting gel vs fibers as far as tubes go, and sticking it back in the tube for more doesn&#x27;t help, the instructions were in Chinese</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easily removed too and I never get raccoon eyes as other reviews have stated</li>
            <li> Its was pretty good just late</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this would be a good alternative to the much more expensive original, but it is DEFINITELY not!  </li>
            <li> Also the fiber wand is large and hold fibers</li>
            <li> It came earlier than the expected delivery date that was a pleasant surprise for me.</li>
            <li> it really works on my nonexistent lashes .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but not what I expected,  </li>
            <li> The mascara dries up fast</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t much of a risk.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and I work 10 hours days, running around our warehouse, and in very humid conditions (Oklahoma)</li>
            <li> However the mascara works very well .</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> Did not give results that I was looking for, but shipped and received fast.</li>
            <li> : finish off with a waterproof/smudge proof mascara to set the whole thing.</li>
            <li> i really like this product</li>
            <li> The price is way reasonable.  </li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> it works very well.</li>
            <li> it dosnt do much</li>
            <li> This works really well</li>
            <li> and they worked just as well as the very pricey ones.</li>
            <li> Tried them on my daughter who has very find eyelashes</li>
            <li> I was really unsure of this fiber mascara, but the brand name one is around $37, so I thought why not?</li>
            <li> Yes it does work real goog</li>
            <li> The product works ok, the container for the fibers does not twist closed all the way.  </li>
            <li> I just use the gel, micro fibers not so much.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping - product as described.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> There is NO WAY this mascara can compare to Younique but for $5 you can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> It makes it seem as if I have REAL eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It is so much cheaper than Younique and works so well.</li>
            <li> but I paid so much for it</li>
            <li> I didnt really want to barrow it to her</li>
            <li> but it flaked too much to continue using.</li>
            <li> The fibers don&#x27;t really stay on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much have</li>
            <li> I just threw the whole damn thing away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap product and you definitely get what you pay for with this.</li>
            <li> But over all it works really well</li>
            <li> so eh doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really like the fiber tube</li>
            <li> then go straight to the fiber</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast..</li>
            <li> This worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> This product works really well, my lashes are noticeable longer.</li>
            <li> I could have bought myself a whole years supply with the money I spend on extensions.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I love it for it&#x27;s price</li>
            <li> Other than that I love the case and may try using this again one day.</li>
            <li> I would rate this better than the Benefit brand due to the ease of removal and the price.</li>
            <li> Well needless to say I tried it and loved it!</li>
            <li> Worked better than I expected!</li>
            <li> This mascara is very similar to the famous 3D Fiber Lash one, it works the exact same way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to keep from getting the fibers on your face at first</li>
            <li> It is true about needing to have everything open and ready to apply at once.  </li>
            <li> Despite the ridiculously long delivery time, cant really complain because shipping was free.</li>
            <li> So far I am super surprised at the results.</li>
            <li> The case was a little messed up but overall, good condition.</li>
            <li> not as great as the reviews says the fibers get in your eyes and your lashes look pretty much the same not happy with the product</li>
            <li> I live this product it really works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that the more in practice applying it, the less this will be a problem.</li>
            <li> Swooshing it thoroughly in its container was the trick for me...then apply only about the tips of the lashes quickly followed by the transplanting gel and repeat.</li>
            <li> Tried it several times but the length was not any better then a regular mascara.  </li>
            <li> I normally use Younique 3d fiber mascara and hands down I like this one a lot better.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the results of this generic product and found it was waterproof enough to last over 24 hours, including sleeping in it.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with high hopes after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> it makes my eyelashes look long and full and had no issues whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Would waste my money on it even if it is cheap!</li>
            <li> I think most of this product was dried out or something when I go</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not hard to figure out</li>
            <li> It took some practice to get it right with the application, I have VERY short eye lashes! !</li>
            <li> Made my eyelashes super long and fibers stayed in place.</li>
            <li> I bought next from different vendor &amp; it was fine</li>
            <li> For girls who don&#x27;t like false lashes such as myself i highly recommend because the formula is easy to apply on and i get so many compliments on.my lashes..</li>
            <li> I told her about my new mascara</li>
            <li> It came with the case which was sealed and brand new.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my lashes look extra long!!!</li>
            <li> By far the least effective fiber mascara of the 4 brands I have used.</li>
            <li> Also I received product earlier than expected with free shipping!</li>
            <li> Except after a while you have fiber on your cheeks and it can only be removed by a tissue or makeup remover tissues which is not good.. other than that they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> I also use one coat of my old regular mascara to make sure the fibers do not come loose throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> But it came very early</li>
            <li> She used it once and then went right back to her old mascara.  </li>
            <li> Also, arrived early than the estimated date!</li>
            <li> Bought second and not finished with first yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly the same if you use it correctly!</li>
            <li> You want to do one eye at a time and first put on your regular mascara.</li>
            <li> The package arrived early!</li>
            <li> Great product only complaint directions not in English</li>
            <li> First, the instructions weren&#x27;t in English.  </li>
            <li> this is very long lasting and it can easily be wiped off.</li>
            <li> The packaging looks nice but is slightly on the cheesy side but the brush for the base/over coat is great unlike other cheaper fiber lashes I have tried.</li>
            <li> I was a little let down when I tried it, however, for the money it is a good mascara.</li>
            <li> Kind of dissapointed that mine didn&#x27;t come with the cute case :-(</li>
            <li> Long looking eyelashes for such a cheap price?</li>
            <li> it about kills me every time even if im super careful</li>
            <li> This is a cute product, the only down fall is it cakes up</li>
            <li> I have more volume and less clumpiness with my regular mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I love fiber mascara in general, since I find that the fibers sometimes make my eyelashes a little more clumpy than regular mascara</li>
            <li> I have short straight old woman eye lashes&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t even get the fibers on fast enough</li>
            <li> but i feel like removed some ofmy natural lashes over time, and I dont get that flases look lik</li>
            <li> So simple,Arived early.</li>
            <li> FIRST USE THE TRANSPLANTING GEL (LONG TUBE).</li>
            <li> I am far from a beginner with fiber mascara, so I know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I would go ahead and spend the money for the real deal next time.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s really selfconcious about her eyelashes now because they are quite short</li>
            <li> but she used them and her eyelashes are so long and pretty with the fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li> I was very &#x27;iffy&#x27; on purchasing this product by reading the mixed reviews.  </li>
            <li> and I have had no trouble with the fibers.  </li>
            <li> I have short straight lashes.</li>
            <li> After I wear it a considerable amount of time, I will come and evaluate the product.</li>
            <li> So leopard classy.</li>
            <li> So for anyone wants to get the 3D definitely go with brand name and splurge on price</li>
            <li> Personally, i think it&#x27;s too much.. like spider legs.</li>
            <li> but so far nothing</li>
            <li> I will probably stick with regular mascara but for those who have really thin or short eyelashes or who have already tried the more expensive fiber mascaras, I think this would be a real win.  </li>
            <li> I mean I look like a princess with fabulous fluttering lashes!  </li>
            <li> It was very easy to apply, at least on a second person.</li>
            <li> I was using two faced better than false lashes, and this is basically the same thing and literally more than half the price.  </li>
            <li> First of all the instructions were in Chinese which wasn&#x27;t too big of a deal considering</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, in addition, if you don&#x27;t know the details of how to apply, DO go on youtube and google how to apply the Younique 3D mascara, same rules apply.</li>
            <li> But I was worried they would be difficult and messy but it was easy, quick and really made her eyes just pop!!</li>
            <li> It really works and makes my lashes long.</li>
            <li> It makes your lashes long and really stands out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like it because it didn&#x27;t make my lashes long at all</li>
            <li> Arrived timely, and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The fiber got in my eyes and based on the side effect; I personally didn’t see much of a difference from regular mascaras.</li>
            <li> I work 10+ hours/day in an industrial area and my eyelashes look the same after my long day as they did when I first put it on in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Another thing that I find noteworthy is that the mascara doesn&#x27;t have a strong icky smell--there is NO SMELL at all.  </li>
            <li> also, the fiber tube has a top and a bottom but no threading or anything to keep it closed, what a mess!</li>
            <li> This product flakes off a little bit, but is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> If your not careful you&#x27;ll have spiderleg eyes..</li>
            <li> My ten year old daughter bought this product for me for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Personally I don&#x27;t like that look, but if you are looking for a natural mascara, this is it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the military and can&#x27;t put on to much</li>
            <li> not great love the gel mascara</li>
            <li> Just as good as Younique but not near as expensive.</li>
            <li> Love this product as it looks like I am wearing false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Like many others have stated, they did NOT send the case that is pictured- which is false advertising.  </li>
            <li> Some trouble with the seller but over all the communication between us set it right.  </li>
            <li> Other than that the product works very well</li>
            <li> If you are looking to get dramatic results then you should buy a better product.</li>
            <li> Im curious how this stuff really lasts once you open it.</li>
            <li> the little box pretty</li>
            <li> Second mascara is fiber first is a black gel.</li>
            <li> You really have to get the fiber part down or your eyes will suffer.</li>
            <li> The fibers are not loose enough though, so I go back and forth using the fibers from this, and the fibers from the two faced.</li>
            <li> Finally recieved it two days ago and there is nothing but a dry brush in the natural fiber tube.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very straight and usually fall after applying mascara even after using an eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I have read good and bad reviews...</li>
            <li> i am not sure if i got an old product or if it really is that dry......</li>
            <li> I would give them a one star, except they DID answer my complaint about the case promptly and sent it right out.</li>
            <li> After you get your technique down it looks as good as false lashes with none of the trouble of applying them.</li>
            <li> True false eyelashes leave my eyes naked and not a bit flattering.  </li>
            <li> Certainly this is MUCH less expensive than the original product.</li>
            <li> Gives  your eyes a super dramatic look or you can get a natural look by just applying a  coat of wet mascara</li>
            <li> It actually makes my lashes as long as I want them to be.</li>
            <li> I expected a little bit of a mess, but this is ridiculous,as clumps I mentioned before (even after removing as many as possible from application wand) fell all over my face and neck, destroying the makeup I had already applied.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my lashes long and noticeable!</li>
            <li> you can put it on lightly for a natural look or heavy for a dramatic look it do both with no problem</li>
            <li> It is like a waste buying though the case is nice but still useless.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful but I am getting ready to buy 6 more tubes.</li>
            <li> Got my first set a few days ago and will be ordering again within the next few days to allow shipping so that I will not be without.</li>
            <li> A quick fix TIP, if you get a clump of mascara and can&#x27;t separate your lashes because it has dried, get a Q-tip, put a small amount of baby oil on it and swipe that area over &amp; over until they are separated, this is also how I remove my mascara</li>
            <li> To eliminate the need of having to open each stick to distinguish which is the fiber and which is the actual mascara, they made the fiber stick shorter and thicker than the other one.</li>
            <li> It was okay not so crazy about it.</li>
            <li> She has to use mascara with it because it doesn&#x27;t fluff up the eyelashes enough on</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t make them really long.</li>
            <li> and I have no complaints as long as the fibers are sealed.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to come in.</li>
            <li> it makes my eyelashes look to long, and when it&#x27;s time to take off my makeup</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look really long</li>
            <li> I use the tip of the brush with only minimal fibers on the tip use the gel and mascara</li>
            <li> my eyes were tearing all day long from the fibers falling into them.</li>
            <li> how long it took to ship.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long for me to learn how to apply this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara definitely works as well as younique only less expensive!</li>
            <li> I have very thin eyelashes due to them coming off from the false lashes, so this is great.</li>
            <li> Instructions only come in a foreign language.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Younique &amp; several other types of &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; mascara&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> That was a strange question!</li>
            <li> As mentioned in other reviews, the instructions are in Chinese; however, I did find a video on YouTubewhich illustrated the process.</li>
            <li> It does clump a little but comb it out and put the second or maybe even third coat with the fibers on just the tips</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have never looked so long!</li>
            <li> That one eventually began to dry out</li>
            <li> The fiber lashes are too dry.  </li>
            <li> but the fibers are to dry and just go on in al diffrent directions and then fall off even if u use the instructions on youtube</li>
            <li> This mascaras do not work at all, the are totally dry and came in a plastic bag not in the case like it shows in the picture.</li>
            <li> Mascara was probably a return, because it was dry and used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little hard to apply at first</li>
            <li> bottles were empty and dry.</li>
            <li> the future I will order from the previous supplier as I know what I am getting.</li>
            <li> The issues I have is the black specks left on my eyelids and cheeks and the time it takes to get the look I want.</li>
            <li> Like when I pulled the wand out of the tube, the black gel was stringy and actually dripped onto my shirt.  </li>
            <li> So I alternate back and forth until my lashes are as long and thick as I like..</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come packaged as I expected it , the fibers were very dry and it didn&#x27;t lengthen as well as I thought</li>
            <li> However the last 2 orders have come with little to no fibers.</li>
            <li> The mascara seemed a little old and dried out and the fibers would always get into my eyes.</li>
            <li> My eyes are not very sensitive but this product left little black fibers in my eye.</li>
            <li> Only complaint didn&#x27;t come with instructions in English</li>
            <li> I often end up spending at least $25 for one tube of &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; mascara a month between me and my 13 year old.  </li>
            <li> Be careful that the fibers don&#x27;t get in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does work</li>
            <li> did not really read everything</li>
            <li> Not even remotely like YOUNIQUE.</li>
            <li> not very helpful</li>
            <li> a coat of the wet mascara.</li>
            <li> The mascara gel and fibers are as expected.  </li>
            <li> 1timer I saw theses on Facebook and was curious</li>
            <li> It came 6days before the expected date.</li>
            <li> One being the difficulty in removing, another the fact that you had to be soooooooooo careful not to get any on your skin</li>
            <li> One set had a empty gel tube..  </li>
            <li> Not much to it at all.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re like me and never really mastered fake lashes.</li>
            <li> My lashes are short and thin naturally, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li> I like the build up type of last product but one has to be careful with this product as the fiber container leaves little black fibers on my cheeks--</li>
            <li> Personally I dont like the small fibers go inside my eyes...</li>
            <li> This product work just as well as other brands</li>
            <li> I did, however, use some of the other reviewers tips and hints.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased them before from other suppliers.  </li>
            <li> It came a week or so before expected so that is a plus!</li>
            <li> Just remember to keep your eyes closed for a minute after applying the fibers to let it &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Going to buy again!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, but I&#x27;ll keep experimenting with the product to see if I can get better results.</li>
            <li> Perhaps to other persons</li>
            <li> i was skeptical at first but not anymore one i started putting them on</li>
            <li> This works exactly the same as the expensive brand!</li>
            <li> but I looked up on YouTube how to apply other 3D fiberlash mascaras</li>
            <li> The mascara itself smelled really weird and didn&#x27;t really apply well to my lashes.</li>
            <li> it gets in your eyes and hurts, and ruins contact lenses.</li>
            <li> Was not really worth the money in my opinion</li>
            <li> and it basically mascara now not worth the 5 bucks she spend.</li>
            <li> The trick to lengthen your lashes is to make long sweeps up, past the tips, like you&#x27;re coating lashes that aren&#x27;t there, and  </li>
            <li> so you have to spread it around, and look down so the lakes don&#x27;t get in your eyes.</li>
            <li> i did them in an up and down motion as on putting the brush to my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The fiber was dry not sure if it&#x27;s suppose to be like that.</li>
            <li> I give this product one star because I can&#x27;t give it any less...</li>
            <li> The fibers fell in my eyes in less than 1 hr.</li>
            <li> My satisfaction could not be any less.</li>
            <li> Lashes sticking together, black FUZZIES all over my eyelids and IN MY EYES (ouch).</li>
            <li> There is a slight scent to the mascara</li>
            <li> but steep none the less.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is much less product in both the gel and the fibers-</li>
            <li> so I do those steps again without removing the previous day application.</li>
            <li> I cant put it down if you want long thick eyelashes get this</li>
            <li> Just makes a clumpy mess which gets into your eye.</li>
            <li> I was worried about all of the little black fibers falling into my eyes and causing irritation.  </li>
            <li> however I was a little Leary applying something</li>
            <li> and she said it looked like I had little hairs in my eyes and ducts...</li>
            <li> Leaves little fibery pieces on the cheeks of my wife.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review after she has had a chance to use it for a little while longer.  </li>
            <li> it does what it says for a little while but ends up flaking all over your eyes and face and if you wear glasses, them as well.</li>
            <li> The fiber gives a little bit of volume</li>
            <li> I like it but feel like it is a little flaky, I am still working with it.</li>
            <li> A little time to get used to the application process, but my lashes look 3 times fuller and longer.  </li>
            <li> the little fibers that fall  in my eyes</li>
            <li> It could get a little messy with the fibers but</li>
            <li> Waste of money don&#x27;t buy fiber lashes  </li>
            <li> Waste of money....</li>
            <li> It was dried up.</li>
            <li> I figured that it wouldn&#x27;t be the quality that Younique is, but the &#x27;mascara&#x27; part was almost completely dried up.</li>
            <li> A waste of money</li>
            <li> Fibers do not stick to the gel and the few that do, end up all under your eyes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it everyday since.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this mascara everyday for a week now</li>
            <li> waste your time with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found the product to be revolutionary with just a few drawbacks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy and also hurts your eyes.</li>
            <li> It was basically a waste of money</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday</li>
            <li> lengthens your lashes dramatically and gives you that falsie look without requiring actual false lashes.</li>
            <li> When you want an entire night with the man of your dreams (in my case, hubby), not removing false eyelashes is a plus.  </li>
            <li> but I found that it gave me a clumpy, stiff look which defeated the purpose.</li>
            <li> I just hated that this product takes to long to arrive, but it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li> so messy i dont even use it no more</li>
            <li> and you get long false looking lashes.  </li>
            <li> My already long lashes now have the dramatic look I&#x27;ve been trying to achieve.  </li>
            <li> I did not Receive a case, also there is very little filler....</li>
            <li> bought this because it got rave reviews and was less expensive than other brands on the market.&lt;br /&gt;The fibers in both tubes were completely dried up</li>
            <li> At 1st I was not sure that it wasn&#x27;t going to work as I read about it.</li>
            <li> Sucks I used twice and dried out</li>
            <li> but I usually sweep off with a powder brush)</li>
            <li> I have been a dedicated Benefit &amp;#34;Better Than False&amp;#34; fiber mascara fan for the past year.</li>
            <li> The base that you stuck the fibers in was not wet enough for the fibers to stick to.</li>
            <li> Waste of $$$$$&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> Weird smell but VERY similar results to Younique&lt;br</li>
            <li> Same as the expensive brand without the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so lazy</li>
            <li> Mine came with no adorable case to put the mascara in.</li>
            <li> It may be weird or difficult to apply at first but you need to practice.</li>
            <li> The other gel stuff is stringy and very hard to put on correctly.</li>
            <li> : black dust/feathers/fuzz crap that you see on the wand and think, UMMM, I am really supposed to apply THAT to my already-wet-and-slightly-clumping mascara?</li>
            <li> As a contact user it is simply not worth the risk to have an infection or worse from Casio going in my eye from this product.</li>
            <li> My brush was squished and it was hard to keep the fibers on the gel.</li>
            <li> I dont always write reviews on products,  but when I do is either because the product was horrible or it was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I would use it as regular mascara if I was ever in desperate need.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Dont waste your time !!</li>
            <li> I was expecting the hard case, was disappointed by that, when I only got an envelope with the 2 tubes in it :/</li>
            <li> The only thing I would have to say bad about it is that the fibers tend to get into your eyes and if you have allergies I would not recommend putting the product on while it eyes are irritated.</li>
            <li> Is not a good mascara.</li>
            <li> and I did recieve few compliments about my lashes to the point someone thought it was fake</li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> I am no good with false lashez</li>
            <li> The main negative thing is the awful smell of the gel and</li>
            <li> so wouldnt know if the product works or not ugh not happy</li>
            <li> On a side note, the fibers do fall off in your eye which is irritating.</li>
            <li> Package was all broken.</li>
            <li> and I ended up washing it off because it was irritating.</li>
            <li> It does give you the look of false lashes.</li>
            <li> I never have to wear false lashes again.</li>
            <li> Also the mascara alone isn&#x27;t half bad.</li>
            <li> I think in general very disappointed of chineses products.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a little disappointed about that</li>
            <li> Horrible Barely has any fiber but somewhat works</li>
            <li> I then, applied the black leopard base, immediately with the fibers.  </li>
            <li> Sad to say</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just the mascara and the fake lashes</li>
            <li> This mascara worked for one application, then looked horrible for all subsequent applications.</li>
            <li> and they say I don&#x27;t need the fake lashes on.</li>
            <li> but, it is a bit complicated to apply.</li>
            <li> Also, the instructions are all in 5 different character languages, so this product would be a terrible idea for a beginner to fiber mascara.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t any wrong with it but the fiber mascara  made me eyes itchy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so obsessed with this mascara and is way cheaper than the 3D fiber lash stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works just as well expensive brands.</li>
            <li> The fiber is weird.</li>
            <li> It is like applying pieces of fake lashes to your exsisting lashes.  </li>
            <li> I was thoroughly skeptical going into this purchase</li>
            <li> but my thought was, given the price how could I go wrong?</li>
            <li> but I think I did something wrong because I had an allergic reaction to it,  </li>
            <li> unfortunately they stopped making that mascara</li>
            <li> The worst mascara I ever purchased when it was delivered it was dried up and useless, DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> this item sucks!!!</li>
            <li> Unhappy.</li>
            <li> It gives you the look of false lashes without the annoying weight of falsies.</li>
            <li> and I hate using false eyelashes</li>
            <li> Really, really mad .</li>
            <li> I like this mascara and the fact that it wasn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> This product was a disappointment :(</li>
            <li> So bad that I had to ruin my thanksgiving eye makeup to remove it</li>
            <li> Bad really really bad ....took a month to get to my daughter</li>
            <li> It gets in your eyes and it hurts really bad.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m kinda bummed out because it did not come with the case :(</li>
            <li> :(  </li>

            <li> Not liking it, it flakes off in my eyes all day :(</li>
            <li> Does not come in sealed case very unhappy about that.</li>
            <li> but it was still very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Was doubtful but 1st use changed mind.</li>
            <li> it was annoying.</li>
            <li> that is so annoying</li>
            <li> But I bought a 3 pack, and I HATE wasting anything, so I washed my eye, and started again..</li>
            <li> Just awful hate it</li>
            <li> and i hated it.</li>
            <li> Even though I hated the product, I have to give them one star for that.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Terrible !!! There are no fibers in the tube!</li>
            <li> Love it, Brings out my eyes</li>
            <li> Lovely, Better price than you see on Face Book.  Very pleased.  Looking forward to ordering again and again.</li>
            <li> Not all that impressed, they fall off all over your face and hurt your eyes!</li>
            <li> Is not a good mascara.</li>
            <li> Waste of money don&#x27;t buy fiber lashes  just falls out like nothing</li>
            <li> Love it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> does a great job and lashes look amazing</li>
            <li> Instructions only come in a foreign language. Works great for the first three uses, then you run out of fibers. Be careful that the fibers don&#x27;t get in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does work but it doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Younique &amp; several other types of &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; mascara&#x27;s.  This is one of my favorites.  Younique is good but when you compare the prices &amp; the product. .. Younique is not any better, in my opinion.  And the price difference is huge.  This comes from China so expect to wait a while.  And my last shipment was lost but they quickly gave me a refund. .. no problem.  Great stuff!  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara bc it really works on my nonexistent lashes . However the last 2 orders have come with little to no fibers. I used it twice then there was nothing . If it was stuck in tube, I can&#x27;t say. I bought next from different vendor &amp; it was fine</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara!  I tried Younique but wasn&#x27;t impressed. My eyelashes are very straight and usually fall after applying mascara even after using an eyelash curler. Not with this product.  My already long lashes now have the dramatic look I&#x27;ve been trying to achieve.  Already ordered more!</li>
            <li> As others have said, the titling on the instructions are in English but the instructions are in Chinese...also, the fiber tube has a top and a bottom but no threading or anything to keep it closed, what a mess!</li>
            <li> bottles were empty and dry.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara in the world. I will get it again.😘😘😘😘😘</li>
            <li> I was expecting the hard case, was disappointed by that, when I only got an envelope with the 2 tubes in it :/ BUT! with THAT said, I was VERY pleased with this fiber mascara! I&#x27;m too cheap, and too much of a skeptic to pay $30 for something I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like! So this was an AWESOME offer! Can&#x27;t beat the price! Shipping was faster than I thought it&#x27;d be, ORDERED on November 6th, and got it by about the 20th or so. It took some practice to get it right with the application, I have VERY short eye lashes! ! NO joke! This looked great! Lots of volume and length! I will order AGAIN!</li>
            <li> The fiber doesn&#x27;t work but the mascara is great</li>
            <li> Sooo this review has nothing to do with the seller. Was delivered faster then eta was which I was happy about but product it self. BEWARE.&lt;br /&gt; First of all the instructions were in Chinese which wasn&#x27;t too big of a deal considering I thankfully know how to apply mascara lol however I was a little Leary applying something I didn&#x27;t know where was from or couldn&#x27;t see ingredients or warnings so close to my eye but thought ehh what the hell what&#x27;s the worst that could happen? Well I found out. The mascara itself smelled really weird and didn&#x27;t really apply well to my lashes. I ended up having to use my own mascara to get an even coat. When applying the fibers they got EVERYWHERE. now I realize that if your putting fibers to your eyes use with causion but this was out of control. So bad that I had to ruin my thanksgiving eye makeup to remove it bc my eyes were so irritated from the fibers. Sad to say but I&#x27;ll be tossing this product in the trash. Use with causion ladies.</li>
            <li> Did not come with the case shown and within 5 mins of putting it on fibers were all over my face.</li>
            <li> Love this. Works great</li>
            <li> love it it seems to work but it doesn&#x27;t come with the eyeliner did not really read everything it&#x27;s just the mascara and the fake lashes n the little box pretty</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come packaged as I expected it , the fibers were very dry and it didn&#x27;t lengthen as well as I thought</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but not what I expected,  but I thought I came with a case and I didn&#x27;t get that. The directions are in Chinese. But it came very early so I guess I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t  come in the package  that shows in the image.</li>
            <li> This was not as awesome as everyone said it was in the reviews. I wonder if it was written by a bunch of teenagers that didn&#x27;t know better? My eyes are not very sensitive but this product left little black fibers in my eye. I wore it for about a week until it was time for my yearly eye exam. My eye Dr asked me if I just got a haircut. That was a strange question! I asked why she asked that and she said it looked like I had little hairs in my eyes and ducts...I told her about my new mascara and she was horrified and told me to immediately their it out!! As a contact user it is simply not worth the risk to have an infection or worse from Casio going in my eye from this product.I give this product one star because I can&#x27;t give it any less...</li>
            <li> Waste of money.... Very upset I got more fibers in my eye than on my lashes.. They burn my eyes ... The mascara dries up fast can&#x27;t even get the fibers on fast enough ughhhhhh....  Just awful hate it</li>
            <li> I like it but i feel like removed some ofmy natural lashes over time, and I dont get that flases look lik a did at the beginning so remove carefuly</li>
            <li> Leaves little fibery pieces on the cheeks of my wife.  She used it once and then went right back to her old mascara.  She has to use mascara with it because it doesn&#x27;t fluff up the eyelashes enough on it&#x27;s own.  Was hoping for a better result.  I&#x27;ll update this review after she has had a chance to use it for a little while longer.  $6 and free shipping from China.  It wasn&#x27;t much of a risk.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara! Works great! The only problem I have is the case was not included as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> I have read good and bad reviews... Personally if you put it on properly (no need to be a genius) it is great!</li>
            <li> I wore it for the first time and man, im so in love with these. Also, arrived early than the estimated date!</li>
            <li> I got this set for my daughter and I will be reordering it for myself. It arrived fairly quickly and the look is elegant and BEAUTIFUL!! It works great, might be a little clumpy for some, but with another brush to smooth it all it, it&#x27;s FANTASTIC! A GREAT buy and a GREAT product!</li>
            <li> Its was pretty good just late</li>
            <li> good value, would have given more stars but it shows a case and it DOESN&#x27;T come with a case.</li>
            <li> Not even remotely like YOUNIQUE. Doesn&#x27;t enhance whatsoever. Just makes a clumpy mess which gets into your eye.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!!!!! At 1st I was not sure that it wasn&#x27;t going to work as I read about it. My eyelashes look good, lots of volume n long......</li>
            <li> I love this. So simple,Arived early. It make my eyes look amazing even tho I didn&#x27;t make them really long. The instructions are in another language. First the gel then the fibers then seal with gel. Repeat if you want longer lashes.</li>
            <li> I dont always write reviews on products,  but when I do is either because the product was horrible or it was fantastic. This product is amazing, my eyelashes have never looked better. I will be purchasing more. And what I like more about it is the price.</li>
            <li> Personally I dont like the small fibers go inside my eyes...</li>
            <li> Particles easily fall in eyes and causes disturbance</li>
            <li> I have short straight old woman eye lashes&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works. Bought second and not finished with first yet.</li>
            <li> It was dried up. Not as good as last time I ordered them.</li>
            <li> Its a great mascara! Although I only gave it three stars because mine didn&#x27;t come with a case and the directions and insert were all in Chinese so I looked it up on you tube to see the best way to apply. Other than that for the price its more than worth it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed ! It said box included but when i received there w no box</li>
            <li> I just got it last night. I wore it today and loved it! It gives you sexy eyes with super long lashes.</li>
            <li> Actually works great ... Only complaint didn&#x27;t come with instructions in English</li>
            <li> Love this product as it looks like I am wearing false eyelashes. I will never wear anything else!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, everything is great except for one thing, the fibers fall off onto your face. This is an easy fix though if you add one more application of the transplanting gel to hold fibers in place, that will work or simply use a different brand of mascara and that works just as well too. 1. FIRST USE THE TRANSPLANTING GEL (LONG TUBE). 2. SECOND, USE THE FIBERS (SHORT TUBE). You can repeat the process for even thicker, longer lashes just make sure the first application is completely dry. I also use an eyelash comb/safety pin after each application to separate my lashes so I don&#x27;t end up with tarantula eyes (unless that&#x27;s your desired look) but this mascara will definitely make your eyes POP and I love it. A quick fix TIP, if you get a clump of mascara and can&#x27;t separate your lashes because it has dried, get a Q-tip, put a small amount of baby oil on it and swipe that area over &amp; over until they are separated, this is also how I remove my mascara so I&#x27;m not rubbing and stretching the skin around my eyes. I do use a LOT of Q-tips using this removal method but it&#x27;s worth it to me to avoid wrinkles as best as I can. This mascara is NOT WATER-PROOF even though it says it is in the description but I just add another layer of water proof mascara quickly to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; the fibers in place and to water proof it. It lasts all day and I work 10 hours days, running around our warehouse, and in very humid conditions (Oklahoma) and I have no complaints as long as the fibers are sealed. It&#x27;s very easily removed too and I never get raccoon eyes as other reviews have stated, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Does not come in sealed case very unhappy about that. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> the gel it self was easy to use but the fibers were another story</li>
            <li> I love this! Don&#x27;t let the price fool you! It&#x27;s an awesome product just as good as the expensive brands!</li>
            <li> Sucks I used twice and dried out</li>
            <li> BUY THIS all my friends keep asking me what mascara i use but I&#x27;m not telling them 😂 this is the best mascara i have ever used and you can literally just keep building on your lashes! It&#x27;s insane!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, makes the length of my eyes lashes super long. Very Happy, so happy I bought it two more times for family.</li>
            <li> This product was a disappointment :( I figured that it wouldn&#x27;t be the quality that Younique is, but the &#x27;mascara&#x27; part was almost completely dried up.</li>
            <li> This type of mascara  have purchased before but a different brand. That one eventually began to dry out and i hated it. I found this one and when i tried it on i instantly fell in love with it!!!! No i am not an endorser for amazon or anything like that. This mascara is really great for its price. The yonique brand was way too pricey and i knew i would be able to find a 3D mascara just as great. Im so glad i came across this one.</li>
            <li> This mascara worked for one application, then looked horrible for all subsequent applications. Also, tons of fallout and marks from fallen lash pieces. Throwing away.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this item , I looked through the reviews and a lot of them said that the mascara doesn&#x27;t bother your eyes. Well Everytime I use it i always have a problem with my eyes getting irritated and it last for several hours . However the mascara works very well . But I do not believe that the fibers are made of what they say they are .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy younique!  Buy this!  It&#x27;s exactly the same if you use it correctly!</li>
            <li> Kind of dissapointed that mine didn&#x27;t come with the cute case :-(</li>
            <li> I like the condition it came in, very nicely packaged. The delivery wait was kind of long and the product wasn’t for me. The fiber got in my eyes and based on the side effect; I personally didn’t see much of a difference from regular mascaras.</li>
            <li> This product work just as well as other brands but the price makes it much better! I receved it alot quicker than i was told it would get here too.</li>
            <li> Did not come with the box.  Nd the smaller one doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Im 15&amp;it worksgreat after an amount of pratice. If your not careful you&#x27;ll have spiderleg eyes.. Other than that I love it for it&#x27;s price(:</li>
            <li> Honestly I thought this fiber mascera sucked! Didn&#x27;t do what it said it was gonna do. Does not compare to younique at all. Unhappy.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t smell like mascara should smell</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make a difference</li>
            <li> These items work like  charm! lengthens your lashes dramatically and gives you that falsie look without requiring actual false lashes. This was a good purchase though the fibers gt in my eye sometimes.</li>
            <li> It really works and makes my lashes long. I will buy it again. It came earlier than the expected delivery date that was a pleasant surprise for me.</li>
            <li> The mascara seemed a little old and dried out and the fibers would always get into my eyes. I applied the mascara and fibers one eye at a time and I felt as though I moved very quickly in doing so. Maybe the fibers would stick better had the mascara been more &amp;quot;wet.&amp;quot; Other than that I love the case and may try using this again one day.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara definitely works as well as younique only less expensive!</li>
            <li> It did give u the curl look, length when u put it on right  but not the thickness. And it work even better when u use ur Favorite regular mascara first along with the transplanting gel, fiber by repeating the process to make it pop.  But I did like the price for it and I did recieve few compliments about my lashes to the point someone thought it was fake and they say I don&#x27;t need the fake lashes on. Right now I will not buy it cause I had another 3D mascara  that will give u the length, thickness and find another one but waiting for it to come to try it on</li>
            <li> I did not Receive a case, also there is very little filler....I will not buy this again !</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy again. Great price. Better than pricey fiber lashes that I bought at Ulta. Also the mascara alone isn&#x27;t half bad.</li>
            <li> Like many others have stated, they did NOT send the case that is pictured- which is false advertising.  I actually wanted the case more than the mascara, as they are great for an eyeglass case.  They did send the case when I wrote them, but I should not have had to ask for something that should have been sent already.  The mascara and fibers both came in unsealed tubes in just a ziploc type bag (no seal), which is really not something that is good for a product that is going to be used so near my eyes (which I happen to value!)  Even though I know how to use the product properly (thank goodness, as the directions where in Chinese), the gel did not make the fibers adhere and they fell on my face all day.  I was hoping that this would be a good alternative to the much more expensive original, but it is DEFINITELY not!  I would give them a one star, except they DID answer my complaint about the case promptly and sent it right out. Even though I hated the product, I have to give them one star for that.</li>
            <li> I like the product  but the box did not come with it</li>
            <li> Bad really really bad ....took a month to get to my daughter and she said it&#x27;s crappie mom, but she didn&#x27;t want to tell me!</li>
            <li> I really like the product. It makes your lashes long and really stands out. It is good to get what you want in a product.</li>
            <li> this is the 1st fiber mascara i have ever used. it works great and much cheaper than all the other ones like it. VERY worth it!</li>
            <li> Its okay not the greatest thing in the world but, it is a bit complicated to apply.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to be as pictured.  No case of any type included.</li>
            <li> The fibers fell in my eyes in less than 1 hr. Had to work work itchy runny eyes. Horrible. Looked good for 20 mins</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this mascara at first but then figured what the heck.. im so glad i did!!  I really love it it really brings out my eyes and the length of my lashes!! The first time i applied it i did get some of the fibers that fell in my eye but now i just blow on the wand before i apply it and that seemed to help.. i definitely will be ordering this again</li>
            <li> Product as described. Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Great product, but the fiber lashes dry out quick</li>
            <li> My lashes defiantly looked fuller</li>
            <li> first of all, it took forever to get delivered. it did not work for me. very disappointed. considered sending back but that probably will take even longer to get my money back so just will take the loss.</li>
            <li> Although I did not receive the case like described and this was a gift to my daughter.You did send the case but it was all damaged.  I cleared the one star and gave you 2 stars because you refunded my money back. Thank you.</li>
            <li> works amazing but it is time consuming</li>
            <li> Did not give results that I was looking for, but shipped and received fast. Just not the product for me.</li>
            <li> By far the least effective fiber mascara of the 4 brands I have used. The setting gel is better off by itself. The fibers come out as huge clumps, no matter what I tried. I expected a little bit of a mess, but this is ridiculous,as clumps I mentioned before (even after removing as many as possible from application wand) fell all over my face and neck, destroying the makeup I had already applied. I am far from a beginner with fiber mascara, so I know what to expect. Also, the instructions are all in 5 different character languages, so this product would be a terrible idea for a beginner to fiber mascara. I truly wish I had chosen a different brand. My satisfaction could not be any less.</li>
            <li> Never got the transplanting gel only two fiber wands so wouldnt know if the product works or not ugh not happy</li>
            <li> Great product! I figured it was only $5 so whatever it is, why not try it out. I&#x27;m I love with it! My sister has Younique and I did a comparison... No difference, I actually think this one worked better on my eyes. So worth the money.</li>
            <li> Received it today.....took awhile to get But already love the product&lt;br /&gt;I would order again and would recommend to my friends</li>
            <li> It was awful. Flakes as I was putting it on and irritated eyes immediately.  Even irritation after washng off and rinsing eyes</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and so easy to apply</li>
            <li> Is this vegan &amp; cruelty free</li>
            <li> I love the service  but I didn&#x27;t like product itself. There wasn&#x27;t any wrong with it but the fiber mascara  made me eyes itchy</li>
            <li> Did not come with a case like shown pictures. Also fibers fall out from your lashes.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable! The more you apply the 2 steps the longer and thicker your lashes will get.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: finish off with a waterproof/smudge proof mascara to set the whole thing. I will 100% re-buy once this is finished.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff. I actually order it everytime im about out :)  And trust me I have tried all the mascaras out there, this one Is my fav</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be use. It is like a waste buying though the case is nice but still useless.</li>
            <li> i really like this product</li>
            <li> Works ok but fibers fall off</li>
            <li> Was doubtful but 1st use changed mind. Love this product.</li>
            <li> It is ok but not what I was really wanting</li>
            <li> I am no good with false lashez so I ordered after reading reviewz and I am glad I ordered I will be ordering more in the near future!!!</li>
            <li> Certainly this is MUCH less expensive than the original product. As mentioned in other reviews, the instructions are in Chinese; however, I did find a video on YouTubewhich illustrated the process. I would go ahead and spend the money for the real deal next time.</li>
            <li> It is like a regular mascara ! not very helpful</li>
            <li> I was going to try another (more expensive) name brand &amp;#34;false/like&amp;#34; eyelash enhancer.  I was very pleased with the results of this generic product and found it was waterproof enough to last over 24 hours, including sleeping in it.  I did, however, use some of the other reviewers tips and hints.  First, I used my own brand of waterproof mascara after curling my lashes.  I then, applied the black leopard base, immediately with the fibers.  It is true about needing to have everything open and ready to apply at once.  A wonderful look for special nights, but a little too much work for everyday.  Definitely an &amp;#34;eye&amp;#34; popping difference.  I would recommend this product. It gave me enough confidence to perhaps try the more expensive brand next time.  This will last quite a while for many applications and I received numerous compliments on my eyes.  No one knew what was quite different about me, but they liked the new look.  Subtle, yet impressive and so much better than true false eyelashes.  When you want an entire night with the man of your dreams (in my case, hubby), not removing false eyelashes is a plus.  (Who wants to go from wow to empty eyes when the evening is just getting started and even more important, I want to look as great in the morning as I did the night before.)  True false eyelashes leave my eyes naked and not a bit flattering.  Just be sure to start and end your original applications with your own WATERPROOF MASCARA and use an eyelash curler before starting the process.</li>
            <li> The product took along time to arrive as it was coming from overseas.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because it got rave reviews and was less expensive than other brands on the market.&lt;br /&gt;The fibers in both tubes were completely dried up and I couldn&#x27;t use them at all.  A waste of money</li>
            <li> I like the build up type of last product but one has to be careful with this product as the fiber container leaves little black fibers on my cheeks-- so I put a paper towel under eye as I put on the product. It&#x27;s ok esp for the price! I found a Dior product I like better and of course using Latisse has helped A LOT too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give enough praise for this eye product. This product works awesome. Even for a lady without any natural lashes this stuff is awesome. It actually makes my lashes as long as I want them to be. I will be ordering some more for my sister, my niece, and a friend who&#x27;s getting married in April. I believe in sharing beauty products with my loved ones so we can all look sexy.</li>
            <li> This mascara is AMAZING!!!!! It does clump a little but comb it out and put the second or maybe even third coat with the fibers on just the tips and you get long false looking lashes.  I&#x27;m so obsessed with this mascara and is way cheaper than the 3D fiber lash stuff.  But works pretty well.  The price is way reasonable.  Gives  your eyes a super dramatic look or you can get a natural look by just applying a  coat of wet mascara then fiber lashes then a coat of the wet mascara.</li>
            <li> I like the transplanting gel really well but the fiber lashed isnt that great it doesnt come out of the tube at all</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara by far!! It is not only better than the 3d fiberlashes by Younique but it lasts longer too!! I would reccomend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li> My eye lashes has never been longer, only problem that I have with this is the fiber..they somehow flake on your face...this is very long lasting and it can easily be wiped off. .I sleep wi th this every night and wake up with everything still in place</li>
            <li> Fibers do not stick to the gel and the few that do, end up all under your eyes. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> The mascara gel and fibers are as expected.  I have purchased them before from other suppliers.  I made this purchase because it looks like  a case is included.  There is no case.  Very disappointed at that.&lt;br /&gt;In the future I will order from the previous supplier as I know what I am getting.</li>
            <li> Works great and would buy this product again</li>
            <li> I love this volumiser it works very well. The only thing I would have to say bad about it is that the fibers tend to get into your eyes and if you have allergies I would not recommend putting the product on while it eyes are irritated. Other than that the product works very well and I would recommend it for anyone</li>
            <li> It is truly amazing!! I love the mascara. It really is wonderful.  I was looking for something like this that would help my mom feel better about her lashes because she just beat cancer and the chemotherapy.  She lost her hair and eyelashes and eyebrows. She&#x27;s really selfconcious about her eyelashes now because they are quite short but she used them and her eyelashes are so long and pretty with the fiber lash mascara. And it didn&#x27;t cost $30 like the big name brand ones. I also ordered one for myself and I could not be happier!  I would definitely recommend and buy more from this seller! Btw I looked at some videos and notice people not as happy with it because the fibers were falling and/or were not getting elongated enough. Well the fibers were falling off because the lack of transmitting gel and the lashes weren&#x27;t elongated enough because they were only putting it on the front side of their lashes. If you put it on both sides it elongated amazingly.</li>
            <li> Found it worked better than yonique</li>
            <li> Smells terrible. Does not give me the results advertised.</li>
            <li> My fiance bought this for me and I was kinda iffy about it because it&#x27;s so cheap. But I love the leopard double eyeliners so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I purchased it last month and I&#x27;ve used it everyday since. I love this product!!!! I was using two faced better than false lashes, and this is basically the same thing and literally more than half the price.  The fibers are not loose enough though, so I go back and forth using the fibers from this, and the fibers from the two faced. Super easy to wash off too. But I totally recommend this product for those who are like me and have short eyelashes. It&#x27;s worth the price. !!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It&#x27;s works just as well expensive brands. The seller was quick to respond to emails.  I will definitely do business with them again.</li>
            <li> great price and works pretty well! Not as good as Younique but gets the job done!</li>
            <li> It came a week or so before expected so that is a plus! It didnt come in the case though..its alright I guess for the price ..I don&#x27;t like the gel stuff you put on first it dosnt do much I just apply 2 coats of reg masscara and with the second one I use the fibers :-)</li>
            <li> ok but i thought the lashes were going to look bigger</li>
            <li> not as great as the reviews says the fibers get in your eyes and your lashes look pretty much the same not happy with the product</li>
            <li> I first heard of fiber lashes when my sister was visiting from out of state in May. I told her that her lashes were gorgeous, and asked what mascara she used. She told me she was using a regular mascara with Younique fiber lashes. I tried hers out and loved them, but when I went to buy some from Younique, I did not like the price. I figured, since I&#x27;m already an &amp;#34;Amazonaholic&amp;#34; that I would browse around and see what price Amazon offered. That was when I found the Love Alpha brand. At around $6, I figured I&#x27;d give them a try. I am so happy with the results! They work every bit as well as the more expensive version, at a fraction of the price. Well worth the amount you spend. Great quality, great price, great results.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have the gel applicator in it. I open it and it was basically gone.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet but my grand daughter bought the same one and her eyes are beautiful, lashes are very long.</li>
            <li> This works really well (there are some fibers under the eyes after applying but I usually sweep off with a powder brush), I imagine it is really similar to the $30 kind although I have not tried it.  I was satisfied with this product for the price and would recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> Someone bought me dime YouNique Fibre lashes and my teenager got ahold of them. So she uses those, I bought these and they worked just as well as the very pricey ones. It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> This product works just as it was described. It will have a lot of fibers on your face when done but wipe if.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with box but I love the mascara.</li>
            <li> 1timer I saw theses on Facebook and was curious it&#x27;s seemed like I waited forever for them to come in. Tried them on my daughter who has very find eyelashes and I was very impressed. It was very easy to apply, at least on a second person. I haven&#x27;t tried on myself yet and I have medium eyelashes. But I was worried they would be difficult and messy but it was easy, quick and really made her eyes just pop!! And looked amazing. I am really happy I got them. Not for a every day wear but I think I will have fun with theses</li>
            <li> it does what it says for a little while but ends up flaking all over your eyes and face and if you wear glasses, them as well. it gets in your eyes and hurts, and ruins contact lenses. this item sucks!!!</li>
            <li> I was really unsure of this fiber mascara, but the brand name one is around $37, so I thought why not? As soon as I got it I tried it out and I was blown away. I put it on one eye and did the othe with just my regular mascara and there was a huge difference. All the instructions where in Chinese so I had to kind of go off how the name brand had been used in YouTube videos. You want to do one eye at a time and first put on your regular mascara. Then the adhesive gel. Apply the fibers right afterwards. Then more adhesive gel. Repeat until you have the length you want. I did it twice and was blown away by how amazing my lashes looked. For under $7 this was a definite good buy. Plus the shipping date was July 7th, but I got it in the mail in 8 business days. Definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re like me and never really mastered fake lashes. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like it because it didn&#x27;t make my lashes long at all and the fiber didn&#x27;t get stuck om my lashes..</li>
            <li> Works amazing just use one coat of any water proof mascara and it stays on all day. love love love this!</li>
            <li> i am not sure if i got an old product or if it really is that dry......did not get it to apply nicely or correctly seemed very dry</li>
            <li> I like this product and although I have not tried the more expensive American direct-sales version, I believe this to be a very similar product for a fraction of the cost.  I&#x27;m not sure that I love fiber mascara in general, since I find that the fibers sometimes make my eyelashes a little more clumpy than regular mascara and I sometimes end up with fibers on my face.  I will probably stick with regular mascara but for those who have really thin or short eyelashes or who have already tried the more expensive fiber mascaras, I think this would be a real win.  Shipping does take a while since it is coming overseas but the product was exactly as described and I&#x27;m happy that I got to try out for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to come in. But it was a good price for something so good! So still happy</li>
            <li> This product flakes off a little bit, but is absolutely worth it. It does give you the look of false lashes. Your lashes will appear fuller and longer. Love it!</li>
            <li> My ten year old daughter bought this product for me for Christmas.  I had no idea.  She knows how much I love mascara and try so many different brands.  I often end up spending at least $25 for one tube of &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; mascara a month between me and my 13 year old.  I had no idea what to expect when I opened this box.  Everything is written in Chinese or Japanese so I didn&#x27;t know what to make of it.  I coated my lashes with the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; first, then with the fiber.  I find it works best to do one eye at a time so the gel is still sticky when you apply the fiber.  The fiber is weird. It is like applying pieces of fake lashes to your exsisting lashes.  My eyelashes have never looked so long! Im hooked. Im a crier, and I don&#x27;t know if this stuff is waterproof or not but it has never smudged, never ran.  Sometimes after you first put it on, fibers will fall beneath your eyes but that is only immediately and once thats cleared away, your good.  Even if I get lazy and don&#x27;t wash it off before bed, they look great in the morning!  When I wash my face, I gently pick the fibers right off and it comes off smooth and does not pull at your lashes like waterproof mascara. Awesome product, great price, will be buying more, so impressed.</li>
            <li> The fiber lashes are too dry.  Once you put on the transplanting gel the lashes flake off and get in your eye.  Yuck!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara it makes my eyelashes look to long, and when it&#x27;s time to take off my makeup it comes off So easy! I recommend this this mascara! 😄</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, it works magic on my eyes</li>
            <li> I just received it and I&#x27;m kinda bummed out because it did not come with the case :( I have not tried it but first impression sucked !</li>
            <li> OMG the best stuff ever I told friends at work then showed them my lashes and everyone wanted some so I had to order for them</li>
            <li> The fiber gives a little bit of volume but I haven&#x27;t noticed extra length and I&#x27;ve used it a couple of months. Extra volume is always nice,  just wish it gave more length since that&#x27;s what it mainly advertises.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Fast shipping! Ordering more for a friend! Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing I have always wanted to try it and now that I got it I cant put it down if you want long thick eyelashes get this it will work wonders!</li>
            <li> Arrived timely, and was exactly what I expected. I will definitely buy again. This is an awesome mascara and for the price even if shipping is a little bit longer, it is soooo worth it. I have bought one for my daughter, myself and a friend.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! its very good quality and lasts all day! Its better than what I expected very good price compared to other fiber mascaras. would definetly buy again.</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer but they are no thicker than without it.  :(  I prefer mascara.</li>
            <li> Does not work as described. Took over a month to receive. Smelled rotten.</li>
            <li> Yes it does work real goog</li>
            <li> It came 6days before the expected date. It was packaged well. It came with the case which was sealed and brand new. The mascara did lengthen and i am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was very &#x27;iffy&#x27; on purchasing this product by reading the mixed reviews.  I was worried about all of the little black fibers falling into my eyes and causing irritation.  I have been wearing this mascara everyday for a week now and I have had no trouble with the fibers.  I work 10+ hours/day in an industrial area and my eyelashes look the same after my long day as they did when I first put it on in the morning.  My eyelashes look really long and I am in love with this masara.  I have already ordered more.  A suggestion to some that are having issues with the fibers:  I have been putting a coat of the transplanting gel over the top of the fibers to hold them in place.  I also use one coat of my old regular mascara to make sure the fibers do not come loose throughout the day.  Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> I was thoroughly skeptical going into this purchase but my thought was, given the price how could I go wrong? I have a couple friends who sell the Younique brand Fiber mascara and this is totally comparable but NOT in price! I was very happy with my results and in addition the customer service provided was fantastic; amazon&#x27;s website indicated my product should arrive in 2 weeks and so I emailed the seller after it didn&#x27;t arrive. The response was great and they let me know amazon was mistaken and it would be arriving about 30 days after my order was shipped (to North America) from China, asked me to please keep waiting and apologized for the confusion. I highly recommend this product, in addition, if you don&#x27;t know the details of how to apply, DO go on youtube and google how to apply the Younique 3D mascara, same rules apply. Make sure to seal in the fibers with a top coat of either your regular mascara or the transplant gel to keep from having fibers fall on your face.</li>
            <li> I wish it would have came with a case</li>
            <li> This product does not coming with the case!!!</li>
            <li> i thought it worked well but the fibers did fall over my face and you could see it. it was annoying.</li>
            <li> Its an ohkay product I&#x27;ll just stick to my regular mascara</li>
            <li> Really works!! I love it,;)</li>
            <li> I love how long my lashes look when I use fiber mascara. The issues I have is the black specks left on my eyelids and cheeks and the time it takes to get the look I want.</li>
            <li> Fibers kept falling into my eyeballs !</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like how lashes looked with it clumpy</li>
            <li> Was not really worth the money in my opinion</li>
            <li> The product works ok, the container for the fibers does not twist closed all the way.  Took forever to arrive.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara and the fact that it wasn&#x27;t very expensive. However, it doesn&#x27;t come with the case like it shows.</li>
            <li> I like it but feel like it is a little flaky, I am still working with it.</li>
            <li> Yikes. I wanted this to work. I am a makeup junkie, but mostly I stick to high end brands from Sephora. I read all the instructions and even watched a youtube video. The gel was okay, sort of like a low-quality mascara. It lengthened and wasn&#x27;t too clumpy. I would use it as regular mascara if I was ever in desperate need. BUT, then comes the fibers. AKA: black dust/feathers/fuzz crap that you see on the wand and think, UMMM, I am really supposed to apply THAT to my already-wet-and-slightly-clumping mascara? Yes, it was a disaster just like I imagined it would be. Lashes sticking together, black FUZZIES all over my eyelids and IN MY EYES (ouch). I could be okay with the black fuzz everywhere if my lashes looked amazing, but thats the real problem: my lashes stuck together in huge messy globs. I even used my eyelash separator AND my extension spindle brush, and neither of them could comb out the lashes to look even halfway decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pro is that the customer service was great and they refunded my order in full. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I just use the gel, micro fibers not so much.</li>
            <li> So far I am super surprised at the results. Long looking eyelashes for such a cheap price? I was doubtful but I am getting ready to buy 6 more tubes. Yep, 6. They come in a cuter case than the picture looks like and the tubes themselves are really nice. There is a slight scent to the mascara but it isn&#x27;t overpowering like Cover Girl. If you don&#x27;t want to pay for the upkeep of eyelash extensions and sure as hell can&#x27;t afford the $40 version of this product, then you should definitely try this out. Hope this helps!!</li>
            <li> I have been a dedicated Benefit &amp;#34;Better Than False&amp;#34; fiber mascara fan for the past year. I found the product to be revolutionary with just a few drawbacks. One being the difficulty in removing, another the fact that you had to be soooooooooo careful not to get any on your skin or else you would have to scrub it off and ruin your already applied make up and the $35 price tag was well worth it but steep none the less. I decided to try the Black Leopard brand since I hadyet to try any other brands of fiber mascara and the price was great! The result? Amazing! I would rate this better than the Benefit brand due to the ease of removal and the price. The quality is equal. The over all results are phenomenol. You will get beautiful, literally better than false lashes! IF YOU ARE READING THIS REVIEW THEN TAKE THE PLUNGE AND BUY IT! My advice...take your time, if you feel the need to apply to lower lashes then make certain to coat them with regular mascara after to avoid the top snd bottom from sticking together. Good luck and enjoy!!!!</li>
            <li> so messy i dont even use it no more i throw away after 2 use</li>
            <li> not great love the gel mascara but the fibers are to dry and just go on in al diffrent directions and then fall off even if u use the instructions on youtube</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my lashes look extra long!!! Only set back is it took awhile to reach me but once I got it im in lash heaven!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to keep from getting the fibers on your face at first but it was worth it. The mascara alone is really nice too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed. I didn&#x27;t receive the case shown and no where does it say that it is not included. The gel is good but the fibers are almost like powder or dust. They go everywhere but on your lashes. My eyes were watery and itchy for like 2 hours after I put it on. Horrible horrible product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping - product as described.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff out there and such a great price and works even better than the high priced stuff out there</li>
            <li> Was supposed to come with a Case. No Case. Will Not Buy More For My Salon!!!!!</li>
            <li> This did not work at all. The base that you stuck the fibers in was not wet enough for the fibers to stick to. It was horrible !</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance and she says it worked the first 3 times and then just stopped. Then fibers don&#x27;t even get on the brush anymore and it basically mascara now not worth the 5 bucks she spend.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. It fell apart too.</li>
            <li> Price was perfect for this product, loved it.</li>
            <li> Waste of $$$$$&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have never looked so good!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It works really good. Just remember to keep your eyes closed for a minute after applying the fibers to let it &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Going to buy again!</li>
            <li> Weird smell but VERY similar results to Younique&lt;br /&gt;There is much less product in both the gel and the fibers- in comparison to the Younique- but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Got it a whole lot earlier than I was expecting so that&#x27;s nice. Case didn&#x27;t come with it and it literally looks as if I have nothing on. Personally I don&#x27;t like that look, but if you are looking for a natural mascara, this is it I guess.</li>
            <li> Took quite a while to ship to me but I&#x27;m glad it finally got here! I love this stuff it makes my eyelashes look long and full and had no issues whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Loved it took a Lil while to get here but I love the product makes my lashes look big and beautiful</li>
            <li> JUST got it in the mail today . I haven&#x27;t used it yet ,  but I&#x27;m excited to. The case was a little messed up but overall, good condition. I will give a better star rating once i use the mascara.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with high hopes after reading the reviews. I was a little let down when I tried it, however, for the money it is a good mascara. There is NO WAY this mascara can compare to Younique but for $5 you can&#x27;t really complain. My review is this: if you are looking for slight results at a fraction of the cost, this is great! If you are looking to get dramatic results then you should buy a better product. On a side note, the fibers do fall off in your eye which is irritating. Some reviews mentioned you could layer your own mascara at the end to secure the fibers on better but I found that it gave me a clumpy, stiff look which defeated the purpose. I gave this 3 stars simply based on bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product!  Works wonderfully!!!  Took about 20 days to arrive, but worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I heard about this product before I spent on a diff popular fiber mascara that costs waaaayyyyyyyy more than this one. I love my mascara. It makes it seem as if I have REAL eyelashes. I am buying this product for my sisters and bff for XMAS. If you are questioning whether you should spend the 5 dollars and wait two weeks for it..... DO IT! It is soooo worth it.</li>
            <li> This fiber mascara is great. I&#x27;ve ordered 3 of them. I&#x27;ll never use any other kind. And the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product and am here to purchase it for the 3rd time. It is so much cheaper than Younique and works so well. I also purchased to my sister and she loves it as well. Definitely watch youtube tutorials on how to use and you will get amazing results!</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this purchase was the case that it came in. It&#x27;s really cute and nice. The one stuff is called fiber and it&#x27;s like fuzz on your eyelashes. It made my eyes very red and irratetated. The other gel stuff is stringy and very hard to put on correctly. It&#x27;s messy and also hurts your eyes. I used once and then gave to a friend bc she liked it. Would waste my money on it even if it is cheap!</li>
            <li> I bought the Younique fiber mascara and my mother wanted to try it but I paid so much for it I didnt really want to barrow it to her so I found this and ordered it hoping it would be half as good as the stuff I had so I could give it to my mom. Well needless to say I tried it and loved it! Its as good if not better then the Younique mascara. Even bought my 2 sisters a set for Christmas :)</li>
            <li> Item just as described, thank you!</li>
            <li> Will order again! Instructions are in different language but it&#x27;s not hard to figure out lol.</li>
            <li> Worked better than I expected! Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love long lashes.  Same as the expensive brand without the cost.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Younique !</li>
            <li> this stuff rocks!  works just a good as Younique for a fraction of the price... if you apply regular mascara first, even better!!!  will absolutely buy again and again!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. A little time to get used to the application process, but my lashes look 3 times fuller and longer.  Plus, it does not smudge.  Only comes off with warm water.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great, but I assumed it would come in the nice &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; that it shows in the photo.  It didn&#x27;t.  It just comes as the tubes.  No carrying case.  Not as nice if you&#x27;re giving it as a gift.  I think the photo should be changed.</li>
            <li> Love it just the fibers get in my eye and that is so annoying</li>
            <li> I like that it makes my eyelashes beautiful but the thing didn&#x27;t even last a week. it is empty, but for the price I will use the brush it separate all my lashes and look natural</li>
            <li> Instructions are not in English so make sure you know to use 1. Your own regular mascara 2. The gel 3. The fibers&lt;br /&gt;Works OK for the price</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the twenty something dollar brand though it took almost a month too receive.</li>
            <li> Used as directed.  Bought 2 sets.  One set had a empty gel tube..  I&#x27;d does make your lashes fuller....but it flaked too much to continue using.</li>
            <li> For girls who don&#x27;t like false lashes such as myself i highly recommend because the formula is easy to apply on and i get so many compliments on.my lashes..</li>
            <li> everything came packaged nice n neat with safety seals...thank you</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.. it has my lashes soft, but very long this is great!!!</li>
            <li> Best thing that ever came into my life, I wish I didn&#x27;t run out of the product so fast, but it was everything I expected. Except the shipping took a while.</li>
            <li> This product was great! It works just as well as the name brand fiber lash mascara and for a cheaper price! I just hated that this product takes to long to arrive, but it&#x27;s worth the wait. Also, when I received this product it did not come with case. I emailed the seller hopefully they can figure it out. Overall great product!</li>
            <li> The fibers don&#x27;t really stay on. They were all going in my eye or flowing around my face. It did add a bit of volume. Oh well, it&#x27;s acceptable for the price.</li>
            <li> Despite the ridiculously long delivery time, cant really complain because shipping was free. The product works GREAT! Was going to order some from Younique, but decided to try this first and I love it. MUCH better price. I never have to wear false lashes again. I have very thin eyelashes due to them coming off from the false lashes, so this is great. Got my first set a few days ago and will be ordering again within the next few days to allow shipping so that I will not be without. A MUST buy.</li>
            <li> Loved it,will get more!!!</li>
            <li> Still need some practice with the application.  Pieces of fibers fall on face during the application.</li>
            <li> The fiber was dry not sure if it&#x27;s suppose to be like that. I tried it anyways and didn&#x27;t do anything to my lashes i am bummed :(</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara it&#x27;s amazing it&#x27;s my favorite makeup product. I will definitely be buying it again. They forgot to send me the case and I contacted them and they are shipping me one. They&#x27;re very easy to work with and pretty quick on shipping too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! It gives you the look of false lashes without the annoying weight of falsies.</li>
            <li> Not only does this company have great customer service but a great product. The packaging looks nice but is slightly on the cheesy side but the brush for the base/over coat is great unlike other cheaper fiber lashes I have tried. Also the fiber wand is large and hold fibers well so you don&#x27;t have to dip multiple times. This is an A+ item!!!</li>
            <li> ...it was an okay mascara</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this; but, sadly, it is lacking.  The transplanting gel is super... well, for lack of a better word, gloopy. Like when I pulled the wand out of the tube, the black gel was stringy and actually dripped onto my shirt.  As for the fibers, I had better luck with them when I used a clean mascara brush to apply them, rather than the wand in the tube.  I applied this mascara to one eye at a time: first transplanting gel, then fibers, then transplanting gel, then fibers again, and one last top coat of my normal mascara.  I saw some length and a bit of extra volume, but nothing that a tube of Maybelline couldn&#x27;t have given me.  I was disappointed, but I&#x27;ll keep experimenting with the product to see if I can get better results.</li>
            <li> The box is not included.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give 0 stars but the options did not let me. This mascaras do not work at all, the are totally dry and came in a plastic bag not in the case like it shows in the picture. Yea I give &amp;#34;0 STAR&amp;#34;. Really, really mad . I think in general very disappointed of chineses products.This s not the only product from China I regret to purchase. I will not buy more from them.</li>
            <li> Big Beautiful Eyelashes in this bottle!!!</li>
            <li> All the reviews are so right on. I have short straight lashes. I curl them, use the gel mascara, add the fiber and use the mascara wand again and it&#x27;s magic. Lasts all day, all night...I&#x27;m so lazy I don&#x27;t wash it off and in the morning I am more lazy and they still look perfect so I do those steps again without removing the previous day application. It&#x27;s life changing product for me.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing !!!!!!! I love it, my favorite mascara from now on ! I got it in two days which is wonderful :)</li>
            <li> Very good for the price but the fibers on the fiber applicator get into you eyes and become irritating</li>
            <li> Came fast and works wonderful on my long eyelashes</li>
            <li> Again, I am happy with my decision to buy this mascara eye lash makeup &#x27;kit&#x27; because the case that houses the mascara and fiber is very strong and sturdy. The case is the size of the case that holds your eyeglasses. As a matter of fact, when you use all the mascara, this case will work perfectly as an eyeglass case, which is what I plan to do. Of course, the kit fits easily in your purse/backpak/clutch, etc.  Another thing that I find noteworthy is that the mascara doesn&#x27;t have a strong icky smell--there is NO SMELL at all.  The kit contains two mascara-like, leopard print sticks placed in a loop that holds each in place. To eliminate the need of having to open each stick to distinguish which is the fiber and which is the actual mascara, they made the fiber stick shorter and thicker than the other one. So, in conclusion, this is a great buy and well worth the wait for the 3-4 weeks to ship from overseas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot speak to the mascara and its coverage yet because I just got it today. After I wear it a considerable amount of time, I will come and evaluate the product.</li>
            <li> I love this product I bought it because I&#x27;ve seen it before and a YouTube review. I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was buying but when I got it I loved it I do suggest that you watch a YouTube video on how to apply because if you don&#x27;t know how it will lose the fibers all over what I did was place my favorite mascara one coat and then the fiber glue then these fibers then the fiber glue once again and I believe I God amazing results best I have never seen my eyelashes and I hate using false eyelashes so this works way better.</li>
            <li> They soon arrived. Fibers bother me in the eyes. I do not like because the fibers break off and fall on your face. It does not work for me. Perhaps to other persons</li>
            <li> Love love mines and I got it sooner then I thought. . It&#x27;s much have</li>
            <li> No case is included. Mascara was probably a return, because it was dry and used.&lt;br /&gt;So disgusting! I just threw the whole damn thing away. This order will definitely&lt;br /&gt;give you an eye infection.</li>
            <li> Doesnt come with case but totally worth it! My eyelashes have never looked better and it stays on all day until i take a shower!</li>
            <li> it was ok not the best.</li>
            <li> The package arrived early! I tried it immediately, I was so excited. Read and fallowed the directions and was so disappointed with the results. It&#x27;s a cheap product and you definitely get what you pay for with this. I&#x27;ve used it many more times thinking once I get the hang of it the results would turn out better, wasn&#x27;t the case at all. I have more volume and less clumpiness with my regular mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Although it took longer than the delivery date to get here, it was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it lengthens my terribly small eyelashes, and the price was perfect for my budget.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing from them again when the time comes.&lt;br /&gt;And, I also ADORE the cheetah print look.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna use the case for my glasses when I&#x27;m out of product.</li>
            <li> Worst thing I ever bought. Package was all broken. Looked it was used. It was basically a waste of money</li>
            <li> Great product only complaint directions not in English</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.  The fiber one is all hairy, stuff sticking out everywhere. It gets in your eyes and it hurts really bad.  I wiped the wand off thinking this is what I should do, but it did not help.  It would also be nice if the directions for use were in English.</li>
            <li> Product is cute. Second mascara is fiber first is a black gel. this was worth a try but I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> My brush was squished and it was hard to keep the fibers on the gel. But over all it works really well and I plan on buying it again!</li>
            <li> Just as good as Younique but not near as expensive. Would order again.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but After almost 2 months I have finally recieved my item. The first time it was lost and I told them I still wanted it. Finally recieved it two days ago and there is nothing but a dry brush in the natural fiber tube. I am very upset! I was looking forward to it. I contacted to let it be known ive recieved an defected iter and still have not been written back.</li>
            <li> Very Cool Love Love Love</li>
            <li> I liked the product, it was easy to apply and looked very good, it was comparable to the more expensive fiber eye lash mascara.  I did experience the fibers falling out as the day went on the first day i used it.  But the next day i just applied a coat of my regular mascara on and it stayed all day.  I will infinity be purchasing this product again and have already recommended the product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I think I might have have the Fiber combination I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> Love the product my only problem is that it didn&#x27;t come with the case like it is shown. So I&#x27;m a little disappointed about that</li>
            <li> Horrible Barely has any fiber but somewhat works</li>
            <li> This mascara is seriously amazing I use it almost everyday I&#x27;m in the military and can&#x27;t put on to much make up so I only use this mascara when I&#x27;m in uniform you can put it on lightly for a natural look or heavy for a dramatic look it do both with no problem if you put the fibers on incorrectly they will get in your eye and on your face the way I do it to avoid that is instead of putting the brush sideways like mascara I use the tip of the brush with only minimal fibers on the tip use the gel and mascara so it sticks and won&#x27;t fall on your face or eyes I&#x27;ve never had a problem with breaking out because of it or anything like that if used properly great great product this will be the only fiber mascara I will buy it&#x27;s cheap and does what it says mine also came with the cheetah case I love it</li>
            <li> This is a cute product, the only down fall is it cakes up so you have to spread it around, and look down so the lakes don&#x27;t get in your eyes. But I like using it.</li>
            <li> Some trouble with the seller but over all the communication between us set it right.  Im curious how this stuff really lasts once you open it.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this stuff, this beautiful package from eBay ending up paying for it more than here cause it was located in the States...didn&#x27;t want to wait. Got it right away. Well I applied it as shown in the video on YouTube but I think I did something wrong because I had an allergic reaction to it,  my eyes were tearing all day long from the fibers falling into them. I was disappointed.  But I realized that the product must work if you practice, so I did just that...practice,  practice. Now I am in love with the product!  Once I got it right,  that is do one eye at a time...first the gel from bottom to top of lashes then thoroughly swoosh the fibers brush in its own container and apply on the tips of my lashes, then apply the gel on the tips quickly before anything dries, then repeat. Really comes out like 3d! I mean I look like a princess with fabulous fluttering lashes!  You really have to get the fiber part down or your eyes will suffer. Swooshing it thoroughly in its container was the trick for me...then apply only about the tips of the lashes quickly followed by the transplanting gel and repeat. That&#x27;s it...and with practice it starts to become more simple.  Worth it, so worth it...not a huge hassle like you might think.  And the packaging is so attractive!  So leopard classy. Simply a great invention!  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Reading the description I was to believe that it would increase length, volume better then a regular mascara.  Tried it several times but the length was not any better then a regular mascara.  I&#x27;ve used the brand name 3D mascara, very impressive it is and no joke on the length and volume it produces.  So for anyone wants to get the 3D definitely go with brand name and splurge on price</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a good purchase. The main negative thing is the awful smell of the gel and how long it took to ship. Other than that, it works as well as the $30 kind from Younique.</li>
            <li> This mascara does give your lashes length! so it does what it says. It could get a little messy with the fibers but honestly nothing you can&#x27;t just clean up within seconds plus you get the hang of applying it better and its cheap so eh doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> Shipping took forever, over a month, but it was worth the wait. It works great!! I love the transplanting gel, it&#x27;s amazing! Covers of both products were crooked &amp; bent, lol, but doesn&#x27;t affect use. I will definitely be ordering more, probably 5 at a time, lol.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your time !! Mine never came on and it&#x27;s literally been 3 months ! ✋✋✋ save your money ! I&#x27;m really disappointed !!! 😡😡😡</li>
            <li> I wanted to LOVE this product because I used to be able to buy a pre-mixed fiber mascara that was phenomenal unfortunately they stopped making that mascara and this product fell very short.  First, the instructions weren&#x27;t in English.  Not good.  I thought I had read the correct steps were to apply your own mascara, then the gel, then the fiber, then another coat of gel.  All of which I did.  Within minutes though I had the fiber pieces all under my eyes so I decided to apply my own mascara on top and it still didn&#x27;t eliminate the fiber fall out.  Glad I didn&#x27;t pay more for this but it was still very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The best mascara ever!</li>
            <li> I love the gel eye lash for mascara but I don&#x27;t really like the fiber tube but the case is cute and I also got one for my mom. She likes it but doesn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Love it, Just wish it last longer!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too found of the process or outcome. Personally, i think it&#x27;s too much.. like spider legs. I used my regular mascara followed by gel, then fibers, then gel, and mascara again. Too much for an everyday thing for me. Also, i made sure to read the reviews before i purchased. I saw where most people didn&#x27;t get the case. I made sure to contact the seller and ask for it.</li>
            <li> Love the mascara but it did not come with the case as advertised I attempted to contact them but so far nothing</li>
            <li> This product works great! The fibers stick really well to your lashes and makes them look amazing and much longer, love the case that it came in, got it way sooner than expected. I&#x27;m a mascara freak, and I am so happy with the outcome.</li>
            <li> I live this product it really works it makes your eyelashes stand out</li>
            <li> I think most of this product was dried out or something when I go it:(....Not much to it at all.</li>
            <li> oh these fiber lashes are so amazing...i got them in the mail and they were nicely packaged i  love the case they come in. i opened them up and i used it and the results are amazing i was skeptical at first but not anymore one i started putting them on i instantly noticed a difference as Im applying it so you start out with the primer then go straight to the fiber lashes how i applied the fiber lashes was i did them in an up and down motion as on putting the brush to my eyelashes. you will imminently notice them going on to your lashes.WOW its so amazing. so i did both eyes and everyone that i seen instantly noticed the difference it made my eyelashes darker fuller and longer..These are absolutely amazing. I am so happy with the fiber lasher they are amazing.. the shipping was fast.. great price...perfect packaging and most of all the most amazing results:</li>
            <li> Love this product and the price! Definitely makes my lashes long and noticeable! Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my lashes look</li>
            <li> Love love love this product I use my regular mascara with the fibers they seem to stay in place better that way.</li>
            <li> It was okay not so crazy about it.</li>
            <li> My eyes kept watering.  I will stick with nsme brand mascara.</li>
            <li> This worked really well for me. I think it&#x27;s just as good as the younique brand. Application technique is everything though so if you want any fiber mascara to work for you, you must apply it correctly (mascara, fiber, mascara etc) until you achieve the perfect amount for you. There are several videos to teach you how and practice makes perfect. After you get your technique down it looks as good as false lashes with none of the trouble of applying them. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> My lashes are short and thin naturally, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try. I am glad I did! It works amazing. Will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> got it in well do time and it kinda does what it is meant for and  I love the mascara by it self the only thing I don&#x27;t like it the little fibers that fall  in my eyes it about kills me every time even if im super careful</li>
            <li> This works exactly the same as the expensive brand! I have both &amp; cannot tell the difference! Plus, you get the super cute containers &amp; case with this brand! Love!!</li>
            <li> All I can say is OMG! I absolute love ❤ this mascara. This is my first time trying this brand and I&#x27;m very impressed. I normally use Younique 3d fiber mascara and hands down I like this one a lot better. I will definitely purchase this again and I got it for such a great price. I suggest all ladies try this mascara you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Not liking it, it flakes off in my eyes all day :(</li>
            <li> Love the product but it didn&#x27;t come with the case as shown in the picture....</li>
            <li> When a vender shows me a case that will accompany the product it better come with the product. Mine came with no adorable case to put the mascara in. No matter what I want what is in the picture. The vender sent me the case. It&#x27;s very cute and it came pretty quickly. Thank you</li>
            <li> This mascara is very similar to the famous 3D Fiber Lash one, it works the exact same way. Except after a while you have fiber on your cheeks and it can only be removed by a tissue or makeup remover tissues which is not good.. other than that they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> Love the mascara but didn&#x27;t receive my case that was supposed to come with it</li>
            <li> Came in earlier than eta but just the two tubes with no case. Emailed the sender they apologized and they sent me the case free of charge. Worked great for about 3 days until the fibers ran out.. If that is at all possible. Lol it was nice for those 3 days but not sure I would buy more.</li>
            <li> This product works really well, my lashes are noticeable longer. The only issue is the fibers fall I to my eyes throughout the day and I ended up washing it off because it was irritating. I&#x27;m hoping that the more in practice applying it, the less this will be a problem. It did take over a month to get here but by the time it arrived, I had forgot I ordered it. It was like a surprise gift to myself!</li>
            <li> The worst mascara I ever purchased when it was delivered it was dried up and useless, DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> Shipping took about a month just as stated by seller. So worth the wait, I LOVE this mascara! So great for the price too! A little hard to apply at first but once you get used to it it&#x27;s the best you can get for $5</li>
            <li> Great so far but mine never came with a case i was sure it was supposed to</li>
            <li> For the price I am satisfied I just wish it would have worked better, the fibers don&#x27;t really go on and there are hardly any fibers at all I feel like there was more transplanting gel vs fibers as far as tubes go, and sticking it back in the tube for more doesn&#x27;t help, the instructions were in Chinese but I looked up on YouTube how to apply other 3D fiberlash mascaras so I didn&#x27;t care. It didn&#x27;t come with a case for them like I thought they would but overall I am satisfied they did make somewhat of a difference in my lashes. I just added extra maybe too much regular mascara. Also I received product earlier than expected with free shipping!(:</li>
            <li> I love this product, I read the reviews before I bought it, and was prepared for the fibers, but had NO idea the amount that winds up in your eye! I removed my contact immediately, doused my eye with saline and was going to throw the tubes in the trash.. But I bought a 3 pack, and I HATE wasting anything, so I washed my eye, and started again.. Being the directions were in Chinese, I said, &amp;#34;what the heck, I&#x27;ll try this.. I stuck the fiber brush, into the gel tube, applied the gel, then the gel coated fiber, Bam! Awesome lashes.. So I alternate back and forth until my lashes are as long and thick as I like.. The trick to lengthen your lashes is to make long sweeps up, past the tips, like you&#x27;re coating lashes that aren&#x27;t there, and  it works.. Love this, don&#x27;t get the fibers in your eye, hurts like hell.. Lol</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail yesterday, I love it!!!! But the negatives it took about a 4 weeks for me to receive it &amp; it had no case!</li>
            <li> This is just like the 3D fibers mascara but a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> Great product but the seller posts a photo of a case as well. Beware that there is NO case with it. Shame on whoever allows this to go on.</li>
            <li> This came to me fast in the mail, and I love this product so much, I can&#x27;t live without it.  I had been spending over a hundred dollars a month on eye last refills.  The extensions did not look as good as this product!!!  I could have bought myself a whole years supply with the money I spend on extensions.  LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> Awful product! Beware</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used. I love it! People have been saying that the fibers fall on their face and in their eyes, the reason for this is they are not applying it correctly. It may be weird or difficult to apply at first but you need to practice. It didn&#x27;t take long for me to learn how to apply this mascara. I fell in love with it. Made my eyelashes super long and fibers stayed in place. Love my love alpha mascara. &#x3D;)</li>
