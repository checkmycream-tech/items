            <li>This brush moves through them quickly and painlessly!  </li>
            <li>The small one is perfect for travel and its so easy to clean them!</li>
            <li>The small one is perfect for travel and its so easy to clean them!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful brush set that works great on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li>The little one is perfect for my glovebox.</li>
            <li>Even better, the first time I used one, when I was finished brushing, my hair felt softer!</li>
            <li>The little things at the end of the bristles massage your scalp and it feels awesome.</li>
            <li>I feel like it is more effective at removing tangles than my old brush.</li>
            <li>so this isn&#x27;t a huge issue for us,  </li>
            <li>and I notice a huge difference</li>
            <li>The brush glided smoothly through tangles and made them disappear.</li>
            <li>Smooth sleek brush, and no tangling or pain.</li>
            <li>Great to have the smaller brush to stick in the gym bag as well.</li>
            <li>It os fantastic. . . .</li>
            <li>She is happy to get her hair brushed now!</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fantastic brushes.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the customer service was great prior to receiving the brush</li>
            <li>These brushes are FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>A lot of brushes tend to smooth out the curls, resulting in me having to rewet my hair.  </li>
            <li>The smaller one works great to keep in my purse for touchups.</li>
            <li>Great set, and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall the brushes are made nicely, they just weren&#x27;t quite the multifunctional brush that I was hoping they would be, although they work very well when used as directed.</li>
            <li>It has thousand of reviews and noticed that it wasn&#x27;t cheap at all.  </li>
            <li>I like the brush, as well as the free mini brush that comes along with it.</li>
            <li>Gentle and effective at detangling.</li>
            <li>Green brush is great for drying and on the go!</li>
            <li>The brush set is great and especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried many different brushes on her &amp;#34;Rapunzel&amp;#34; like hair and this by far has done the best.  </li>
            <li>I would say be very gentile like warm soapy water but do not soak just wipe &amp; go .</li>
            <li>Beauty Junkees has offered a set of truly nice Detangling Brushes that really work as promised!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Besides the brushes detangling, hair is easy to clean off the brush it doesn&#x27;t collect like some others, I can pull them off easily to keep the brush clean.</li>
            <li>She has beautiful long hair</li>
            <li>To be fair most of the good reviews were given by people with thick curly hair</li>
            <li>: Thought this was a good brush, but I have only had for 2 1/2 months and more than 40 tips from the bristles</li>
            <li>I did receive the replacements and so far so good.</li>
            <li>but so far so good......</li>
            <li>Wow I love the brushes and nice colors too.  </li>
            <li>It definitely does a good job of even de tangling her hair at the end of a play filled day!</li>
            <li>Very good at detangling hair, and my daughter doesn&#x27;t complain about them hurting (like she has with every other brush we&#x27;ve tried).</li>
            <li>It worked really well!!!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li>but this brush goes deep into the hair and provide an outcome of very nice detangled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>Handles are so user friendly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tonight I borrowed it from my daughter to untangle an enormous knot in my own hair - the knot was the size of an egg!  </li>
            <li>Had I posted this review when we originally purchased this brush 6 months ago, I would have given it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>mini one makes a great on-the-go brush for my purse and the bigger pink one works great.  </li>
            <li>The small brush is perfect  for my purse!</li>
            <li>The small one is perfect for the car or your purse.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>She loves these brushes and was so excited to receive them.</li>
            <li>After trying the Kabuki brushes from Beauty Junkees, I was excited to try these brushes.</li>
            <li>so totally worth it!</li>
            <li>The small brush is perfect for keeping in a purse.</li>
            <li>The bristles take a day or two to return to their original position if you do.</li>
            <li>Its great for preventing hair loss and hair from going grey.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>When I first got the package it was extremely overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Was really excited to get this brush set.</li>
            <li>I gave the small one to my daughter and it&#x27;s the perfect size for traveling.</li>
            <li>works great love that it came with a little brush for my purse......#longhairproblems</li>
            <li>So great for kids with long hair!</li>
            <li>This NO TANGLE hair brush is great on my very long CURLY hair.</li>
            <li>great brushes,, my daughter has very long hair</li>
            <li>These 2 brushes are absolutely fantastic that there are not enough good words in the world to say about</li>
            <li>This brush makes getting the tangles out MUCH easier and makes the mornings go more smoothly.</li>
            <li>The smaller brush is perfect for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li>Great brushes (work well with both wet and dry hair!), good price, and fast and friendly service (a call to see if we are happy with the products - unexpected) - what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>They work great on my toddlers long hair too!!  </li>
            <li>They glide right through your hair so easily.</li>
            <li>This brush duo works well right out of the shower for tangles!</li>
            <li>I have tried many de-tangling hairbrushes, and while these aren&#x27;t the best or the most gentle (the bristles are a little stiff and unyielding), they are definitely a good option for the price.</li>
            <li>To my pleasant surprise, it really does live up to its claims.</li>
            <li>The brush is also great to use on wet hair after a shower, or swim.</li>
            <li>Great brush for wet hair and getting tangles out.</li>
            <li>This &#x27;No tangle&#x27; hair brush effectively removes tangles out of even the most unruly long hair.  </li>
            <li>These brushes were great, but within three months almost all of the pink bristle tips had fallen off.</li>
            <li>With these, I can brush my hair even if it&#x27;s full of hairspray and knotted beyond belief.</li>
            <li>Nice, soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I liked how soft it felt on my head.</li>
            <li>They seem ok, but the smell is just too much.</li>
            <li>Now doing her hair is much easier and its better on her hair.  </li>
            <li>The brushes have soft flexible bristles which is really nice.</li>
            <li>My hairbrushes are usually full of strands that have been pulled out.</li>
            <li>I still lose a good amount of hair in my brushes since I&#x27;m constantly shedding (don&#x27;t get my husband started on finding my hair all over).</li>
            <li>The only not so good thing with the brushes is the chemical smell that comes off of them.</li>
            <li>but all opinions are complete my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li>a soft silicone feel that was nice to touch.  </li>
            <li>and I really wanted to love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I have long hair that gets knotted in the shower and this truly proved to be remarkable.  </li>
            <li>Got these brushes because I was looking for a brush that would not tug so much at my daughters hair, and make her hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s handy they come in a set of two; we keep one in her bedroom for use before bedtime and one near the front door.</li>
            <li>and you will love the brushes as much as she does.</li>
            <li>magic hairbrush&amp;#34; because it really is.  </li>
            <li>This brush did the trick and I am able to brush his hair quickly without too much fuss.</li>
            <li>and I mean BEST brush I ever owned!</li>
            <li>These brushes are great quality unlike other detangling brushes I have bought before.  </li>
            <li>We love our new brushes!  </li>
            <li>I love this new brush set!</li>
            <li>Best brush ever, seriously.</li>
            <li>I love the vibrant colors too.</li>
            <li>I keep the mini one in the car for quick touch-ups on the go and to brush my daughters hair after a day out</li>
            <li>I have seen them before and thought they were mainly for curly hair but am so glad I tried them.</li>
            <li>I also liked that Beauty Junkies was very communicative through the whole order process and even followed up after.</li>
            <li>far as a brush goes, I&#x27;m not really all that impressed with them.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many brands and most only lasted a couple of weeks, before the tangles would start up again.</li>
            <li>It is perfect size for her and still the same comfort as the big ones.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and came undamaged.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>I is okay and does a decent job brushing hair but is not any easier than the brushes we get at target.</li>
            <li>This brush is good for my 14 mo old while she doesn&#x27;t have much hair.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair that tangles very easily along with a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expections because many times detangling items don&#x27;t work so well.</li>
            <li>but since we have had these she has not complained once :)</li>
            <li>I love how it made getting my hair untangled faster than normal.</li>
            <li>These brushes are both very pretty colors.</li>
            <li>My daughter was so excited to have her own smaller brush.</li>
            <li>The colors are cool and the spare little brush is great for my purse or the car when we are the go.</li>
            <li>I would imagine it would be great for younger kids as well, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is going to be my new favorite detangling brush.  </li>
            <li>Will be sure to buy again when we need a new brush.</li>
            <li>She also loves these brushes and is her new favorite brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love my new set of brushes.  </li>
            <li>Bought this brush for my 4 year old&#x27;s fine hair that easily tangles after sleeping and after washing.  </li>
            <li>I got a full email tutorial that detailed the best process for wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li>It cuts through tangles like a hot knife through butter!  </li>
            <li>Love the soft texture of the handles!  </li>
            <li>When you have long hair that snarls easily a good brush is critical and t&amp;see brushes dr tangle nicely.  </li>
            <li>This brush is amazing, it easily works out knots in my hair, and doesn&#x27;t damage wet hair when brushing.</li>
            <li>These brushes are light weight with a soft easy grip handle.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is fine and straight and LOVES to tangle (we call them rat&#x27;s nest)</li>
            <li>So happy to have the little travel size one now.</li>
            <li>Only reason I gave them 4 starts instead of 5 was because of smell, otherwise this brush is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The handles, on both are comfortable, and they really do untangle my hair, with causing pain.</li>
            <li>The brushes are light weight, which I really like.</li>
            <li>In fact, they WERE great for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I have used the smaller brush many times, and it works just as good as the larger one.</li>
            <li>Both myself and my five year old daughter absolutely love these brushes.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter (8) years old loves it she can detangle her hair herself.</li>
            <li>Worth its weight in gold.  </li>
            <li>The brushes, I tried both, left my curls intact, which I really liked.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s definitely worth the cost in my book</li>
            <li>The smaller one works as a nice size travel brush for the car or for my daughter&#x27;s backpack.</li>
            <li>We purchased brush set in a promotion&lt;br /&gt;for personal use, honest evaluation and review.  </li>
            <li>its worth it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brush to replace my old brush that the bristles were coming off from, but I had that brush for more than 5 years.  </li>
            <li>I also liked that the smaller brush has a thicker handle, so it was easier to hold when brushing.  </li>
            <li>I came back and bought another set so both kids could have their own</li>
            <li>The colors are fun too.</li>
            <li>I ordered the brush for my 8 year old granddaughter who has many tangles in her hair and refuses to brush her hair.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>My wife loved them so much she took the smaller of the two.</li>
            <li>I hope someone invents something worth my money.</li>
            <li>This is the only kind of brush I will use now.</li>
            <li>feels nice at the same time!  </li>
            <li>My 3-year-old hates having her hair brushed but these brushes do a good job of detangling without pulling too much.</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled to have a smaller one for my purse or swim bag!</li>
            <li>larger Detangling Brush&#x27;s handle fits nicely in the palm of my hand and enables me to have complete control when removing the tangles from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Starting at the ends and working my way up to the top of my head, this brush gets the tangles out without pulling my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, Quality Detangling Brushes well worth the under $15 asking price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter has the most sensitive head?</li>
            <li>I got these brushes on a deal for super cheap and didn&#x27;t have high expectations.  </li>
            <li>Perfect detangling brush- not too soft, not too stiff.  </li>
            <li>We have tried other brushes on my daughter&#x27;s hair and have finally found what works best.  </li>
            <li>Super fast delivery!</li>

            <li>I have really curly hair, with many many dry tangles.</li>

            <li>They are perfect for wet or dry hair for detangling.  </li>
            <li>They work great on out super thick hair and the handles are great for even her small hands, she&#x27;s 3.</li>
            <li>She gave the small one to my daughter in law for our infant granddaughter and it is great.</li>
            <li>And the small brush is great when we go away on the weekend.</li>
            <li>The small brush works great for when I am out or at work and need to freshen up.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read the instructions since I usually don&#x27;t with items like this, lol.  </li>
            <li>The small brush is great for travel or just throwing in your purse when you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
            <li>Plus the small brush fits great in my purse.</li>
            <li>These brushes (the full size and the travel size) work really well on her hair type.  </li>
            <li>small one will be great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine anyone else would have an experience unlike my own, seeing as how (I&#x27;ll say again), my hair is LONG.</li>
            <li>The kind that takes effort to brush out and tends to get really knotted in the back.</li>
            <li>These brushes work very well on my daughter&#x27;s hair, which gets super tangly.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve been used regularly and the green brush is still in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>and I bought these for my daughter with long straight fine hair, should have known better.  </li>
            <li>I got them for my 3 year old grand niece that has very curly hair.</li>
            <li>They work super on straight hair.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve found these brushes do a great job (especially the bigger one) for detangling her hair after washing.</li>
            <li>GREAT brushes - my daughter has coarse, wavy hair that is always tangled, and these brushes are the only ones that work.</li>
            <li>She has very fine, easily tangled hair, and brushing it is often a heartbreaking mess.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants the perfect size brushes, if it can work for my thick hair it can work for others.</li>
            <li>At first these brushes worked good for knots, but after a month the plastic on the ends of the bristles came off making it very sharp to brush with.</li>
            <li>These brushes are very gentle and enable you to get rid of tangles without clumps of hair along with it.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on the tugging and get the job done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly on the go so saving time in anything I do is very important.</li>
            <li>Once I could finely the stand the smell I decided to use it on my seven year old</li>
            <li>My daughter has long hair which tangles very easy.</li>
            <li>love it, gentle, easy, helpful for 6 yr old, she can brush her own thick hair.</li>
            <li>Very nice set, the thinner flexible bristles are super gentle on my always tangles thick color treated hair.</li>
            <li>and like it a little better - somehow it seems to be a bit more gentle -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually surprised it brushes through my wet hair and gets the tangles out amazingly!  </li>
            <li>tried this brush for the first time assuming that it wasn&#x27;t going to work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did smell plasticy when I first took it out of the bag</li>
            <li>These brushes work really well!</li>
            <li>They really detangle hair with no pain!</li>
            <li>and I use the mini brush on my young boys which have surfer style hair and they enjoy it as well.</li>
            <li>Worked really well for my hair!</li>
            <li>Not a lot of difference between this brush and a regular hairbrush, although the bristles are thinner and more flexible.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a big gap on the top of my brush because the bristles are positioned off to the side.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was wrong, they are awesome.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks, Beauty Junkies!</li>
            <li>but these brushes really do work!</li>
            <li>they really are worth it..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try it out on my 3 year old niece who always complains that it hurts when i brush her hair, this should be smooth brushing from now on.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>but my daughter is pretty tender headed.....</li>
            <li>just use  a light hand and move carefully on sensitive heads</li>
            <li>This is the second product I have purchased through this company and again completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>This brush set is the first we have EVER used where that wasn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li>Great brushes to work through thick tangle hair without pulling or hurting.</li>
            <li>This brush helps detangle my hair and really works!</li>
            <li>I have coarse and wavy hair, my hair has not looked better.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush!</li>
            <li>Her comment was this really works!</li>
            <li>I love this brush for several reasons...</li>
            <li>first it works wonders on kids hair (and attitudes).</li>
            <li>I have makeup brushes from the same company that I absolutely love.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat it, no matter how much you spend on a brush!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always skeptical when something claims to be the BEST.</li>
            <li>The larger brush is almost identical to the Drybar Lemon drop brush, but I love the travel size that comes with this set.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many brushes have gotten stuck in my hair over the years and it&#x27;s definitely not an experience I want to keep going through.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Today we have about 6 of these brushes and the first brush we bought is still being used.  </li>
            <li>This brush is slightly better than a regular brush.</li>
            <li>I said I wanted to try them first</li>
            <li>My hair does not break off when I use it and it leaves my hair tangle free and so soft.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I just curl my hair with a small curling iron and brush it from the top to the bottom and it gives off those Hollywood waves with no frizz or static.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I had a heart attack a year ago and decided for the first time in my life to grow my hair out</li>
            <li>Love the travel size especially.</li>
            <li>The beads started coming off after the first week.</li>
            <li>worked on my hair very well!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a granddaughter who loves to play beauty salon but DOESN&#x27;T love to have her hair brushed!</li>
            <li>I guess I will have to buy a brush in person at a store and smell it first.</li>
            <li>I saw this detangling brush and my first thought was, &amp;#34;Gimmick!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re reasonably priced too!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!  </li>
            <li>I first noticed that it didn&#x27;t hurt to use it at all</li>
            <li>Lightning fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Love that these are sold in a pair and in different colors.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and they never fail.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brushes!</li>
            <li>The product is perfect for people or children with normal to thin hair.</li>
            <li>little one my grand daughter can easily carry in her backpack to school.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Major issue for me, the strong rubber smell.</li>
            <li>I bought them for my daughter who will soon be getting long hair, but I tested them out on my very fine hair</li>
            <li>Only a couple of other reviews mentioned the SMELL of these brushes, so clearly many people are being paid to say nice things.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is about the brush design, but it is so much easier to brush her hair, which is super fine and stick straight, so it gets some major tangles.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that these brushes don&#x27;t pull on my hair like other brushes do.  </li>
            <li>This No Tangle Hair Brush Set is not only great on my fiances very long and straight hair</li>
            <li>It even did great when I put it to the ultimate test (wet hair with no leave in conditioner or</li>
            <li>but it is more gentle than a regular brush or comb because the bristles have a lot of give.</li>
            <li>We have tried many no tangle brushes and these are probably my least favorite.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter whined and complained about having her hair brushed, until I bought your ( Best Detangling Hair Brush Set).</li>
            <li>We have a multitude of detangling brushes, including The Wet Brush, but this one is superior by far.  </li>
            <li>My hair is pretty straight</li>
            <li>I love having long hair</li>
            <li>but my 3 year old daughter hates having her hair brush full blown fits every time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the handle and back of the brush are very soft and the grip is very comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It detangles the hair, quickly, and almost completely painlessly.</li>
            <li>That fact you get two brushes in two different sizes is so convenient, using the pink large one comes in handy in my everyday hair routine and the smaller one is the perfect size for your makeup bag or purse.</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t want my hair to smell like these brushes.</li>
            <li>Leaving the large one for me to help them.</li>
            <li>Good bye plain old store brand hairbrushes that break!!</li>
            <li>It worked great for a while but less than a year later and the tops of the bustles have fallen off. .</li>
            <li>They work great, both with wet hair and dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely keep this brand in mind for the future when I need more!</li>
            <li>Having tons of fine hair, I&#x27;ve always dreaded brushing and have constantly struggled with tangles..</li>
            <li>The big one worked well for brushing through wet hair, detangling easily without getting stuck and pulling like most brushes.</li>
            <li>and they were fine when I went back a couple hours</li>
            <li>the knot got to a manageable size that was less noticeable and I just pulled my hair back into the best pony tail I could &#x27;til I got home and could use the bigger brush.  </li>
            <li>you for such a fine product.</li>
            <li>Overall they liked it, as for removing tangles easily, took some time, but it didnt pull their hair, just had to brush over it a few times to get the tangles out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had them for about a week now and the smell has gone away a little bit, but they&#x27;re still kind of stinky even after having washed them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work really well.</li>
            <li>She is prone to tangles and really hates it when she has to practically tear her hair out to get rid of one.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so much easier to manage and brush bc</li>
            <li>They really help with tangeled hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Arrived fast as well.</li>
            <li>Since using the brushes she no longer complains (as much) about brushing her haire.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and the bristles don&#x27;t hurt my scalp.</li>
            <li>that don&#x27;t cost and arm and a leg, that I can safely brush my hair wet with.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not really a product defect but more of quality control.</li>
            <li>These brushes really do detangle without pulling or damaging the hair.</li>
            <li>my family absolutely LOVES these brushes.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the advice that came in the email</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>A couple of passes and my hair is gently untangled.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes, and recommend them to anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>She used to tear her hair out while brushing after a shower, but this brush made it a much smoother process.</li>
            <li>Seems like they have a great customer service and they stand behind their product.</li>
            <li>The hair brushes are gentle on hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also very tender headed</li>
            <li>Very practical set of brushes.  </li>
            <li>But I have to admit that these brushes really do work.</li>
            <li>These are also great for thin hair and shorter hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it really did get the rat&#x27;s nest out.</li>
            <li>They shipped it fast, too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It works better on wet</li>
            <li>Wish I had gotten these much sooner.</li>
            <li>and this brush combs out my knots really fast.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think that it would work.  </li>
            <li>They do get rid of tangles and are gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li>colors are very pretty&lt;</li>
            <li>Highly recommended all around!</li>
            <li>Her hair is very tangled and she is &amp;#34;tender headed&amp;#34; and would cry every time I would brush her hair.</li>
            <li>and I find it very uncofortable on my scalp when I brush with them.</li>
            <li>I use the big one at home and love how soft it is on the scalp and gentle with the tangles.  </li>
            <li>Then if my hair is really knappy</li>
            <li>Straight from the shower with no hair product at all</li>
            <li>My hair is not in the best condition and I&#x27;m always afraid of it breaking off when I brush it after showering.</li>
            <li>much easier.</li>
            <li>These really do work well for tangles.</li>
            <li>Brushes and detangles your hair gently without pulling.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this seller!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>No pain, gentle brushes thru the snarls and tangles.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>was sent fast and well boxed</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>However it gently smoothed and divides hair.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, also.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it on a real snarl</li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>There mother tells me they are working very well,</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I really like how my hair does not frizz after I&#x27;ve used the brushes.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for inventing these hair brushes.  </li>
            <li>my daughter really likes it.</li>
            <li>Granddaughter really likes the brushes.</li>
            <li>I have waist length straight hair</li>
            <li>how much conditioner</li>
            <li>My daughter has curly hair and it gets very tangled over night.</li>
            <li>These brushes really take out the tangles, painlessly.</li>
            <li>I have very fine/tangled hair.</li>
            <li>This did make brushing their hair easier, but for some reason it seemed to work much better when their hair was wet / damp.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference and neither does my daughter.</li>
            <li>They work well to get the tangles out without pulling too much.</li>
            <li>but this is a very close runner up.</li>
            <li>It is not a miracle worker but does make brushing out my daughter&#x27;s hair much easier.</li>
            <li>My daughter is very picky about her hairbrush.</li>
            <li>They seem to make it much easier to get through any tangles in the hair</li>
            <li>Not anymore, the brush is gentle on her hair and combs thru it with ease.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very fine/tangled/curly hair.</li>
            <li>Only several days of use, but already loving it.</li>
            <li>These brushes work great for my thick, curly hair and also on my tender headed 3 yr old.</li>
            <li>The smaller brush was nice for my younger daughter,  </li>
            <li>They are good quality and at least they shouldn&#x27;t break or lose their bristles.</li>
            <li>Only thing I would improve is color choices, I like muted natural colors better.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get out all the knots/tangles without a lot of brushing, but it does make the hair look really nice and without crying.  </li>
            <li>My wife uses the brushes and she absolutely loves them.&lt;br /&gt;There was a minute issue with the original large brush but after telephone contact with the vendor the brush was instantly replaced without any hassle.</li>
            <li>My 10 yr old daughter&#x27;s hair is long and very fine.  </li>
            <li>:) Works great on normal hair to thick hair, but doesn&#x27;t seem to cut it on my youngest daughters SUPER THICK hair.</li>
            <li>It really glides through my long hair easily.</li>
            <li>Then I was introduced to this brush and the first time my husband used it on the girls he came running to tell me how he was able to brush through one of the girl&#x27;s hair in less than 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>I do not understand the magical powers of this brush and how it works, but somehow it really does easily comb through hair without pulling the hair- whether the hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li>So easy for her to get through her long curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair that easily gets tangled, with these brushes it was no issue.</li>
            <li>My daughter (a super super sensitive red head) loves these brushes!!</li>
            <li>The brush completely smooths out my tangled wet hair easily and quickly</li>
            <li>&quot; when we have our twice-daily brush battles, but they work better than some other brushes out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other options and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li>It is better than any other brushes I have purchased from drugstores.</li>
            <li>This has been a great brush for little girls with long hair.  </li>
            <li>The small green brush is the perfect size for traveling.</li>
            <li>My 3- year old loved the &amp;#34;Frozen&amp;#34; color of the small brush.</li>
            <li>These work very well and highly reduce tangles.</li>
            <li>but it actually brushes them right out!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t run so smoothly through my young daughter&#x27;s hair (very long) when it&#x27;s dry but works great when it is wet.</li>
            <li>Works really good in both dry and wet hair.  </li>
            <li>I love how there&#x27;s a handle with the brush allowing me to easily comb out my long hair (goes to the middle of my back).  </li>
            <li>i have very long, fine hair</li>
            <li>smaller brush easily fits in my small cosmetic bag very comfortably and even my jeans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With this amazing brush there are no more tears.</li>
            <li>and I definitely couldn&#x27;t justify paying full price for them.</li>
            <li>The pink one is a great brush, the smaller green one isn&#x27;t as good, which is odd.</li>
            <li>It is a good product but nothing special, just like any other regular hair brush, OK to use for thin hair too.</li>
            <li>For normal slightly tangled hair just having wet/damp hair is good enough.  </li>
            <li>: There is a slight rubbery smell to the brushes that will surely dissipate with time, so if you are sensitive to that, just be aware.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a large brush for at home and a small one I can use for travel :) They are easy to hold and have a long enough handle to where your hand isn&#x27;t hitting your hair like the smaller ones</li>
            <li>Both my daughter and I have very long hair and these brushes do their job and smooth our tangly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m noticing less hair in the brush after I use it and because of less healthy strands being pulled out my hair is getting more length.</li>
            <li>I love the makeup brush, but had a slight smell when opened but was gone once washed.  </li>
            <li>so much more less stressful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also used the brushes on my daughter&#x27;s fine but curly hair and it worked better but again only when used on small sections.</li>
            <li>She has enjoyed brushing her hair with less tangles.</li>
            <li>I have thick coarse hair and this brush does a great job in getting the tangles out without pulling my hair.</li>
            <li>I was worried the small one would be too small, but it was perfect size for my gym bag after swimming!  </li>
            <li>Yes but have realistic expectations.  </li>
            <li>I just followed the directions exactly, brush in small sections from bottom to top.</li>
            <li>and these are the same brush pretty much!</li>
            <li>Luckily spraying with a detangler made it damp enough to work well</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re too weak to do a good job detangling</li>
            <li>I have super long hair and coming straight from the shower to the blow-drying and using this brush</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend these.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEDED</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for tangle prone hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and didn&#x27;t like it, because it made my hair static-y and harder to brush.</li>
            <li>Compared to my other detangling brush, this set is by far a lot better.</li>
            <li>Love the little brush to put in my purse.</li>
            <li>My hair is the longest its ever been in my life at about 4 inches past my shoulders, and I feel that this brush is crucial to taking extra good care of it!  </li>
            <li>Even better, no tears from my little girl.  </li>
            <li>I have thin hair that gets tangled easily and the brushes untangled my hair easily.</li>
            <li>My daughter has long, fine, natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick wavy hair and this brush does a good job getting through it all.</li>
            <li>I love how it comes with a large one and also a small one for my purse.</li>
            <li>I will be keeping one in my purse, and other within easy reach.</li>
            <li>VERY fast shipping which I am very thankful for that especially around the holidays.</li>
            <li>It is also a fantastic wet brush.</li>
            <li>Soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>My seven year old has board straight hair.</li>
            <li>They are soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>but at least now she brushes her own hair and it looks</li>
            <li>It glides through my hair with no problem and if it does hit a snag, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as a normal bristled brush does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping the smaller brush will prove useful for my toddler someday.</li>
            <li>This is not my go to normal every day brush.</li>
            <li>I have normal hair with lose waves.</li>
            <li>There is some hair in the brush when I am finished, but I believe that to be normally shed hair that would have come out anyway.</li>
            <li>Using them on dry hair was only slightly better than a normal hair brush.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact this came with a big and little brush, instead of fighting over something my toddler immediately grabbed the small one and her sister grabbed the big one and they were both happy ( how often does that happen?)  </li>
            <li>Right away one of my girlfriends chimed in that they buy the same brushes for their daughter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them right after I get out of the shower, after styling my hair, and at the end of the day (when I haven&#x27;t brushed my hair for hours.)</li>
            <li>Love these, and they work very well on long wet hair.....</li>
            <li>Live these brushes</li>
            <li>Need new brushes.</li>
            <li>I was received an email letting me know that they went with a new company to produce their brushes, and would send me ANOTHER replacement when they are in stock.</li>
            <li>I live that it comes with the mini brush for my purse.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying a new brush.</li>
            <li>I handed her the new brush and asked her to give it a try.</li>
            <li>(I live in a humid climate).</li>
            <li>Even though my hair was wet and likely full of conditioner still, the brush bristles just floated right over the knot.  </li>
            <li>My daughter REALLY prefers this one and she doesn&#x27;t complain nearly as much about having her hair brushed.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the brushes have a strong plastic/chemical smell which hasn&#x27;t dissipated much even after being in the open for a few weeks (the odor is much more noticeable on the larger brush).  </li>
            <li>I love the colors and they work very well on my hair, wet, damp or dry.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and brushes through my hair nicely (I have thick hair)</li>
            <li>These brushes are very easy to use on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it came with a large and smaller brush (I keep the smaller brush in the car for days when I ride with my windows down and my hair gets tangled).</li>
            <li>I was in a locker-room full of other women who probably found great humor in my feeble attempts to untangle my hair.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and flexible.</li>
            <li>I had been searching for a good de tangling brush for my older daughter,  who had very long, thick hair.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think this would work on my massive bird nest</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much because how many times have you made a purchase in hopes it would be amazing to only be utterly disappointed.</li>
            <li>In addition to getting the knots out and not hurting, they also leave my hair soft, silky and shiny!  </li>
            <li>love the combo as the small brush fits into my purse - to use when out and about</li>
            <li>I want to say first off that my hair is one of those that you see in a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; commercial for humidity prone frizziness/waves/etc.</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE THAT THERE IS A SMALL BRUSH FOR MY PURSE</li>
            <li>my 10 and 11 year old daughters each claimed one!  </li>
            <li>May daughters love these Brushes no more pulling out hair from tangles.</li>
            <li>and of course a sensitive scalp!</li>
            <li>That would never happen with my old brush!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also great on my long thick curly hair!</li>
            <li>They both are made of strong durable plastic, and will definitely last me a very long time.</li>
            <li>I have long, coarse hair and it worked fine with my hair.</li>
            <li>The small brush lives in my purse for quick smooth outs and the big brush is our go-to for after baths and showers.</li>
            <li>but they have not worked very well on my daughters hair as she has wavy hair and a lot of the other brushes I have tried only provide a smooth surface</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised I had the strength to put in a new pony tail.  </li>
            <li>My hair is especially long, and tangles quickly.  </li>
            <li>My little one still doesn&#x27;t like to have her hair brushed and by no means does this &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; through hair like I had hoped, but these brushes are much better than normal combs.</li>
            <li>I have a 4 year old boy with long straight hair but with all the jumping and running around, it gets very tangled.</li>
            <li>They work ok if my hair is wet, but when it&#x27;s dry, it seems like the bristles just bend instead of brushing through my hair.</li>
            <li>I am able to brush through my hair with ease wet or dry with this brush without ripping it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love a marbeling of black, white and purple!</li>
            <li>We keep the larger one at home, and carry the smaller one in the car for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li>Easily and gently untangle thick hair while reducing hair loss and breakage.</li>
            <li>I use the small brush on my 2yr old son, he has long curls and the small brush is perfect size and he hasnt had a fussy day yet.</li>
            <li>We have used them both right out of the shower and on dry hair</li>
            <li>The first time I used this brush I noticed that my hair did not fall out as much as it does with other brushes I use</li>
            <li>This brush was so easy to use it glide right through my thick coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t LOVE about the brushes is that the bristles are a little bit scratchy (this is why it got 4 stars instead of 5) it doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft and flexible, works well even on wet hair!</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is like a dreadlock everyday I have to deal with huge knots ..</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product and I&#x27;d recommend to any mom who is tired of her child screaming when trying to brush their hair!</li>
            <li>Works very well on wet, or very damp hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how much my old brush was pulling my hair until I started using these.</li>
            <li>Went to use old brush and it hurt.</li>
            <li>There hair feels so soft  NO</li>
            <li>TANGLES RUN AND BUY these No crying kids</li>
            <li>Combs out her bed head and is soft on her scalp.  </li>
            <li>Has helped eliminated some of the screams and tears from my 5 year old at hair brushing time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My 4 year old also loves this brush.</li>
            <li>Overall, I do really like the brush, and will keep it and use another brush while blowdrying.</li>
            <li>They do occasionally complain, but it is not as much.  </li>
            <li>My old detangling brush doesn&#x27;t have a handle</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 7 year old who hates tangles and brushing her hair.  </li>
            <li>Got rid of my old ones the day these arrived.</li>
            <li>So I was pleasantly surprised when these brushes worked on his hair as well.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my children but after trying on myself, there is NO WAY I can use them on my kids sensitive scalps.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter used to complain about tangles all the time.</li>
            <li>was surprised by the quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive scalp, and I felt like the brushes bristles were massaging my head.  </li>
            <li>Seller also takes extra time to provide very helpful tips for use and care.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my 6 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li>Her hair is now soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>My 8 year old daughter, who has curly hair, loves these.</li>
            <li>Purchased as a birthday gift for our 8 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>My 3 years old girl doesn&#x27;t mind brushing her hair anymore.</li>
            <li>We have tears and screams every day while brushing our 7 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>My two year old doesn&#x27;t cry anymore when I need to brush her natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something soft and that would not snag on her tangles.  </li>
            <li>but none were completely satisfactory.</li>
            <li>I ordered this hair brush set for my 9 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>NO trouble brushing after the wash.</li>
            <li>I am returning them because I would not think of  getting them near my 3 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>My 8 yo daughter is the type that screams every time we brush her hair, being as gentle as we possibly can.  </li>
            <li>at all the bristles are soft and bend instead of pulling.  </li>
            <li>My 5 year old loves this brush.</li>
            <li>I like the size of this brush and the soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>My 5 year old daughter has naturally curly hair that gets a LOT of tangles in it.  </li>
            <li>My 7 year old has been begging for a hairbrush that doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>I was willing to try anything for my 3 year old daughter who has long hair and hates me brushing it.</li>
            <li>I got a deep discount on this product to write a review, but this hairbrush is definitely worth paying a bit extra for.  </li>
            <li>Nice brush for someone with thin hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter really does willingly comb her hair now, wet or dry, and really loves this brush.</li>
            <li>My wife bought this brush for our daughter and herself, this is what she said: &amp;#34;The small brush is great for my toddler, and we tried with both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li>The little green brush is the best for little ones!</li>
            <li>and I love that I can carry the small one in my purse!</li>
            <li>i dont think it works any better than other brushes that are similar or the same that you can get at almost any store</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t completely make brushing long hair painless, but so much better than a paddle or round brush.</li>
            <li>My other 4 year old daughter didn&#x27;t complain when I brushed her hair today, that&#x27;s success in my book!  </li>
            <li>As other people have pointed out, there is a distinct burnt rubber smell to the product</li>
            <li>Takes a bit of patience to comb out extreme snarls, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>My teen daughter, though, has long thick hair and loved the brush.</li>
            <li>Also, I find that the larger brush works better on wet hair than dry.</li>
            <li>I bought this essentially because I wanted a small brush for my purse, and I thought for this price, might as well get the pack - a girl can&#x27;t have too many hair brushes laying around,</li>
            <li>My hair is very straight, thick, long, fine and tangly.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old wakes up each day with a huge mess of tangles at the back of her head.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter who was having major tangles and a sensitive head.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you&#x27;re finding tangles a regular part of your life.</li>
            <li>She usually runs and fights with me to brush her hair but with this brush it really runs right through her hair with no pulling or tugging.</li>
            <li>They get the tangles out and the hair smooth with very little effort.</li>
            <li>If used correctly they detangle the hair pain free whether hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li>It brushes through it smoothly either wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>It works fabulously on both wet and dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate where they are coming from, especially in today&#x27;s online world where reviews really matter, but the reason I&#x27;m shopping on Amazon is because I have very little time (okay, and I&#x27;m also lazy ;))</li>
            <li>She usually brings her brush and sits on my lap or on the floor in front of me and lets me brush it smooth.</li>
            <li>My daughter wants long hair, but would not brush.  </li>
            <li>(I have really long stick straight hair).</li>
            <li>I thought the colors were very playful, and my 4 year old claimed the smaller brush instantly.  </li>
            <li>She normally hates having her hair brushed because it can hurt, but she says this one doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>This is not a replacement for a normal brush, it really only works well as a detangler.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush worked pretty well when her hair was wet.</li>
            <li>So far no tangle has proven too tough but we also make sure we do not let her hair ever get to that point.  </li>
            <li>It detangles wet hair easily and doesn&#x27;t pull or damage like every other brush I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes, but they fell flat.</li>
            <li>But detangling has honestly never been as painless and easy as it is now with this brush.</li>
            <li>My daughter said that this brush does not hurt as much, but I have noticed that it only brushes the surface of her hair and does not get the kinks out of the middle of her head.</li>
            <li>They make it easy to comb through my thick hair.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these brushes to anyone, but especially to those with a sensitive head of tangled hair!</li>
            <li>you can barely tell it&#x27;s working until you realize all of the tangles are now gone!  </li>
            <li>my major concerns were the brushes would just break and not too stand up to its quality.</li>
            <li>Add J&amp;J no more tangles leave in conditioner and you are golden!</li>
            <li>So glad I got these brushes because I have a hard time removing tangles from my long hair.</li>
            <li>They were also extremely persistent re: positive feedback.</li>
            <li>It was a fight to get his untangled, to get her to not cry and me not to rip my hair out in general.  </li>
            <li>My 3 yr old twin girls stopped complaining about getting their hair brushed and their hair is silkier and shinier.</li>
            <li>My young daughter prefers the bigger brush.  </li>
            <li>I use the smaller one for my 1 year old daughter and she does not cry anymore when I brush her hair.</li>
            <li>four year old claimed the smaller brush.</li>
            <li>This brush works very well on wet hair, which is what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I have replaced my old brush with this one and use it daily now!</li>
            <li>I purchased the set for my 2 year old daughter - who hates to have the knots brushed out of her hair - and myself.  </li>
            <li>Was definitely and unexpected</li>
            <li>I find it very similar to a natural bristle brush in the way that it approaches tangles.</li>
            <li>I am ordering another set because my 6 Year old won&#x27;t let me use her big brush.</li>
            <li>I like this a lot, it really does detangle wet hair.  </li>
            <li>The key is that in addition to being meant for detangling, they also have a soft tip on each bristle, and that makes all the difference.</li>
            <li>They pulled just as much as my regular brushes, and my kids complained more about them than they actually do over a brush I bought at Walmart for $2.</li>
            <li>With a 1 yr old I just didn&#x27;t think that was possible.</li>
            <li>The bristles seemed cheap and thin, and it looked like a normal brush-</li>
            <li>Works for my thick long hair where most brushes get stuck.</li>
            <li>I bought an expensive detangling brush from a popular beauty product store that I was using before.</li>
            <li>Her hair type is more on the thin side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>price not bad for two and no more tangle means that.</li>
            <li>It has seemed to calm down a bit since taking them out of the package, but if I put my nose to the brush you can definitely still smell it.</li>
            <li>Since we started using this hairbrush, not a single tear!  </li>
            <li>use them on dry hair as well and its still much easier than a regular pin brush to get it through hair without pulling.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have about it is its strong smell.</li>
            <li>But, out of habit, I still tend reach for a wide toothed comb after my showers.&lt;br /&gt;These detangle hair quickly and with absolutely minimal pain, and for me, they made my hair softer.</li>
            <li>the other hand, my own hair is extremely thick and these do not work well for my hair, they do not hurt, but they do not get through the massive amount of hair I have.  </li>
            <li>In addition, my hair is shedding less and it has really pumped up the volume on my hair too!</li>
            <li>Glides right through my hair wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Other brushes would rip through my hair and cause breakage no matter how gentle I tried to be with them.</li>
            <li>With other brushes, my daughter would not want to brush her hair since it would hurt so much.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried other brushes that claimed to be gentle at detangling, but they didn&#x27;t work as well as they claimed.  </li>
            <li>The smaller brush works better on her hair but not great.  </li>
            <li>They did have a little smell at first</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, very thick, and very long.  </li>
            <li>I have long, straight hair that is dry and damaged and loves to frizz.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve  broken my fair share of brushes while trying to tame my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for great beauty products on a budget, give Beauty Junkees a try and you wont be disappointed.  </li>
            <li>My 2 daughters of 4 and 5 years old have long hair.</li>
            <li>My teen daughter with thick straight hair said she really like the brush.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had them for less than 9 months and the large brush is falling apart.</li>
            <li>I had such a hard time trying to brush my two granddaughters long hair, but this brush makes it so easy and no complaints or</li>
            <li>She has very thick, wavy hair that tangles easily......</li>
            <li>I love the little small one too..</li>
            <li>No more tears for my little girl :)</li>
            <li>Arrived as expected and daughter loves the new brushes.  </li>
            <li>I have a 7 month old son with very long, wavy hair that gets knotted and matted.</li>
            <li>Less stress on and breakage of hair when brushing, seems to get tangles out without pulling as much.  </li>
            <li>Both doll and girl have long hair that tends to tangle and the bristles on these brushes are far enough apart</li>
            <li>At first you may you may think it is a cheap and boring cheap brush.  </li>
            <li>this brush really does the trick for my mess of hair.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this, and then I tried to cancel it, because I really didn&#x27;t need a new brush, however it was too late.</li>
            <li>Works very well on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>These brushes really do make brushing our little ones tangles out with ease.  </li>
            <li>but it slides through much easier with little pulling effort.</li>
            <li>This brush works well on my long hair, particularly when wet.</li>
            <li>The large area means that I can get through my hair faster and the soft bristles ensures the least stress and tear on the hair to get the job</li>
            <li>I bought them for my 8 year old daughter who has very thick and full and LONG hair.</li>

            <li> They are cute and I like the feel of the material.</li>

            <li> The sellers were very proactive in making sure I received the product and that it met my expectations, which was great.</li>
            <li> On top of that it hurts.</li>

            <li> Helps her comb her hair more because it does not hurt anymore.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I called them her magic brushes and got her a Christmas haircut and now brushing her hair is a pleasure.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many types of brushes for her</li>
            <li> and she especially wants to brush her own hair now.</li>
            <li> The brushes also work great on my really curly hair.</li>

            <li> and I love the feel of the handles.</li>
            <li> If I could EVER give anything more than five stars, it would be this.  </li>
            <li> These brushes have some magical fairy dust in them or something.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered two more sets for family now.  </li>

            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> Glad we discovered them.</li>
            <li> The two-pack is even better because there is no fighting over who gets which</li>

            <li> The best part is when I&#x27;m brushing my hair when it&#x27;s dry it doesn&#x27;t give off static</li>
            <li> Great quality, didn&#x27;t rip hair like normal brushes with this type of stems do.</li>

            <li> , wonderful surprise.&lt;br /&gt;While the thought of using a hair brush on wet hair makes my instincts scream against me</li>
            <li> Your hair looks healthy and smooth after using these, and there is no pain involved.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, they do the job.</li>
            <li> First the bristles are soft so that wonderful feeling you get on your scalp as you brush your hair is not there.</li>
            <li> price was great, works like a charm.. leaving her hair soft and smoothe.</li>
            <li> Because if the smell I haven&#x27;t thoroughly tried to brush my hair to awesome extents or even tried it with wet hair.</li>

            <li> I am amazed at how easily these brushes work on my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> It was easy to detangle the knots.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughters as their hair gets tangled easily and are tender headed.</li>
            <li> It has a strong chemical smell that has not yet gone away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong smell of rubber</li>
            <li> They are durable, strong and well made.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the brush smelled strongly of chemical or rubber when we took it out of the package.....</li>
            <li> My daughters both have fine hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> , her hair is really fine and tangles easily, she used to cry every time I did her hair…</li>
            <li> love that this brush set comes with a full size and a mini size so that you can keep one at home and have the mini in your purse,car, or</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hair brush especially because it works great on wet hair.</li>
            <li> These brushes are affordable and I love that it comes in a set of 2, one being a &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; and one full size.</li>
            <li> and I gotta say they work great, specially on my four year old daughter</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, beauty junkees proactively reach me, and once they found out we never received it, they followed up and shipped new one to us.</li>
            <li> I have longer thinner hair than my daughter but its fine and wavy</li>
            <li> The handles are easy to grip and the material on the handles is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> My package arrived quickly and I had no problems whatsoever with my transaction!  </li>
            <li> This brush moves through them quickly and painlessly!  </li>
            <li> The small one is perfect for travel and its so easy to clean them!</li>
            <li> The small one is perfect for travel and its so easy to clean them!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful brush set that works great on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> The little one is perfect for my glovebox.</li>
            <li> Even better, the first time I used one, when I was finished brushing, my hair felt softer!</li>
            <li> The little things at the end of the bristles massage your scalp and it feels awesome.</li>
            <li> I feel like it is more effective at removing tangles than my old brush.</li>
            <li> so this isn&#x27;t a huge issue for us,  </li>
            <li> and I notice a huge difference</li>
            <li> The brush glided smoothly through tangles and made them disappear.</li>
            <li> Smooth sleek brush, and no tangling or pain.</li>
            <li> Great to have the smaller brush to stick in the gym bag as well.</li>
            <li> It os fantastic. . . .</li>
            <li> She is happy to get her hair brushed now!</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brushes.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the customer service was great prior to receiving the brush</li>
            <li> These brushes are FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> A lot of brushes tend to smooth out the curls, resulting in me having to rewet my hair.  </li>
            <li> The smaller one works great to keep in my purse for touchups.</li>
            <li> Great set, and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall the brushes are made nicely, they just weren&#x27;t quite the multifunctional brush that I was hoping they would be, although they work very well when used as directed.</li>
            <li> It has thousand of reviews and noticed that it wasn&#x27;t cheap at all.  </li>
            <li> I like the brush, as well as the free mini brush that comes along with it.</li>
            <li> Gentle and effective at detangling.</li>
            <li> Green brush is great for drying and on the go!</li>
            <li> The brush set is great and especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried many different brushes on her &amp;#34;Rapunzel&amp;#34; like hair and this by far has done the best.  </li>
            <li> I would say be very gentile like warm soapy water but do not soak just wipe &amp; go .</li>
            <li> Beauty Junkees has offered a set of truly nice Detangling Brushes that really work as promised!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Besides the brushes detangling, hair is easy to clean off the brush it doesn&#x27;t collect like some others, I can pull them off easily to keep the brush clean.</li>
            <li> She has beautiful long hair</li>
            <li> To be fair most of the good reviews were given by people with thick curly hair</li>
            <li> : Thought this was a good brush, but I have only had for 2 1/2 months and more than 40 tips from the bristles</li>
            <li> I did receive the replacements and so far so good.</li>
            <li> but so far so good......</li>
            <li> Wow I love the brushes and nice colors too.  </li>
            <li> It definitely does a good job of even de tangling her hair at the end of a play filled day!</li>
            <li> Very good at detangling hair, and my daughter doesn&#x27;t complain about them hurting (like she has with every other brush we&#x27;ve tried).</li>
            <li> It worked really well!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> but this brush goes deep into the hair and provide an outcome of very nice detangled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both brushes smooth my hair easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li> Great brushes for long fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have had long hair my whole life and struggle to find the perfect brush.  </li>
            <li> This brush makes it super easy to untangle and makes my mornings</li>
            <li> The best part was the little to non of my hair that fell out!</li>

            <li> Well worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Handles are so user friendly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tonight I borrowed it from my daughter to untangle an enormous knot in my own hair - the knot was the size of an egg!  </li>
            <li> Had I posted this review when we originally purchased this brush 6 months ago, I would have given it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> mini one makes a great on-the-go brush for my purse and the bigger pink one works great.  </li>
            <li> The small brush is perfect  for my purse!</li>
            <li> The small one is perfect for the car or your purse.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> She loves these brushes and was so excited to receive them.</li>
            <li> After trying the Kabuki brushes from Beauty Junkees, I was excited to try these brushes.</li>
            <li> so totally worth it!</li>
            <li> The small brush is perfect for keeping in a purse.</li>
            <li> The bristles take a day or two to return to their original position if you do.</li>
            <li> Its great for preventing hair loss and hair from going grey.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> When I first got the package it was extremely overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Was really excited to get this brush set.</li>
            <li> I gave the small one to my daughter and it&#x27;s the perfect size for traveling.</li>
            <li> works great love that it came with a little brush for my purse......#longhairproblems</li>
            <li> So great for kids with long hair!</li>
            <li> This NO TANGLE hair brush is great on my very long CURLY hair.</li>
            <li> great brushes,, my daughter has very long hair</li>
            <li> These 2 brushes are absolutely fantastic that there are not enough good words in the world to say about</li>
            <li> This brush makes getting the tangles out MUCH easier and makes the mornings go more smoothly.</li>
            <li> The smaller brush is perfect for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li> Great brushes (work well with both wet and dry hair!), good price, and fast and friendly service (a call to see if we are happy with the products - unexpected) - what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> They work great on my toddlers long hair too!!  </li>
            <li> They glide right through your hair so easily.</li>
            <li> This brush duo works well right out of the shower for tangles!</li>
            <li> I have tried many de-tangling hairbrushes, and while these aren&#x27;t the best or the most gentle (the bristles are a little stiff and unyielding), they are definitely a good option for the price.</li>
            <li> To my pleasant surprise, it really does live up to its claims.</li>
            <li> The brush is also great to use on wet hair after a shower, or swim.</li>
            <li> Great brush for wet hair and getting tangles out.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;No tangle&#x27; hair brush effectively removes tangles out of even the most unruly long hair.  </li>
            <li> These brushes were great, but within three months almost all of the pink bristle tips had fallen off.</li>
            <li> With these, I can brush my hair even if it&#x27;s full of hairspray and knotted beyond belief.</li>
            <li> Nice, soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I liked how soft it felt on my head.</li>
            <li> They seem ok, but the smell is just too much.</li>
            <li> Now doing her hair is much easier and its better on her hair.  </li>
            <li> The brushes have soft flexible bristles which is really nice.</li>
            <li> My hairbrushes are usually full of strands that have been pulled out.</li>
            <li> I still lose a good amount of hair in my brushes since I&#x27;m constantly shedding (don&#x27;t get my husband started on finding my hair all over).</li>
            <li> The only not so good thing with the brushes is the chemical smell that comes off of them.</li>
            <li> but all opinions are complete my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> a soft silicone feel that was nice to touch.  </li>
            <li> and I really wanted to love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that gets knotted in the shower and this truly proved to be remarkable.  </li>
            <li> Got these brushes because I was looking for a brush that would not tug so much at my daughters hair, and make her hair more manageable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s handy they come in a set of two; we keep one in her bedroom for use before bedtime and one near the front door.</li>
            <li> and you will love the brushes as much as she does.</li>
            <li> magic hairbrush&amp;#34; because it really is.  </li>
            <li> This brush did the trick and I am able to brush his hair quickly without too much fuss.</li>
            <li> and I mean BEST brush I ever owned!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great quality unlike other detangling brushes I have bought before.  </li>
            <li> We love our new brushes!  </li>
            <li> I love this new brush set!</li>
            <li> Best brush ever, seriously.</li>
            <li> I love the vibrant colors too.</li>
            <li> I keep the mini one in the car for quick touch-ups on the go and to brush my daughters hair after a day out</li>
            <li> I have seen them before and thought they were mainly for curly hair but am so glad I tried them.</li>
            <li> I also liked that Beauty Junkies was very communicative through the whole order process and even followed up after.</li>
            <li> far as a brush goes, I&#x27;m not really all that impressed with them.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many brands and most only lasted a couple of weeks, before the tangles would start up again.</li>
            <li> It is perfect size for her and still the same comfort as the big ones.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and came undamaged.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> I is okay and does a decent job brushing hair but is not any easier than the brushes we get at target.</li>
            <li> This brush is good for my 14 mo old while she doesn&#x27;t have much hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair that tangles very easily along with a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expections because many times detangling items don&#x27;t work so well.</li>
            <li> but since we have had these she has not complained once :)</li>
            <li> I love how it made getting my hair untangled faster than normal.</li>
            <li> These brushes are both very pretty colors.</li>
            <li> My daughter was so excited to have her own smaller brush.</li>
            <li> The colors are cool and the spare little brush is great for my purse or the car when we are the go.</li>
            <li> I would imagine it would be great for younger kids as well, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is going to be my new favorite detangling brush.  </li>
            <li> Will be sure to buy again when we need a new brush.</li>
            <li> She also loves these brushes and is her new favorite brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love my new set of brushes.  </li>
            <li> Bought this brush for my 4 year old&#x27;s fine hair that easily tangles after sleeping and after washing.  </li>
            <li> I got a full email tutorial that detailed the best process for wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> It cuts through tangles like a hot knife through butter!  </li>
            <li> Love the soft texture of the handles!  </li>
            <li> When you have long hair that snarls easily a good brush is critical and t&amp;see brushes dr tangle nicely.  </li>
            <li> This brush is amazing, it easily works out knots in my hair, and doesn&#x27;t damage wet hair when brushing.</li>
            <li> These brushes are light weight with a soft easy grip handle.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is fine and straight and LOVES to tangle (we call them rat&#x27;s nest)</li>
            <li> So happy to have the little travel size one now.</li>
            <li> Only reason I gave them 4 starts instead of 5 was because of smell, otherwise this brush is amazing.  </li>
            <li> The handles, on both are comfortable, and they really do untangle my hair, with causing pain.</li>
            <li> The brushes are light weight, which I really like.</li>
            <li> In fact, they WERE great for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used the smaller brush many times, and it works just as good as the larger one.</li>
            <li> Both myself and my five year old daughter absolutely love these brushes.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter (8) years old loves it she can detangle her hair herself.</li>
            <li> Worth its weight in gold.  </li>
            <li> The brushes, I tried both, left my curls intact, which I really liked.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s definitely worth the cost in my book</li>
            <li> The smaller one works as a nice size travel brush for the car or for my daughter&#x27;s backpack.</li>
            <li> We purchased brush set in a promotion&lt;br /&gt;for personal use, honest evaluation and review.  </li>
            <li> its worth it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush to replace my old brush that the bristles were coming off from, but I had that brush for more than 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I also liked that the smaller brush has a thicker handle, so it was easier to hold when brushing.  </li>
            <li> I came back and bought another set so both kids could have their own</li>
            <li> The colors are fun too.</li>
            <li> I ordered the brush for my 8 year old granddaughter who has many tangles in her hair and refuses to brush her hair.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> My wife loved them so much she took the smaller of the two.</li>
            <li> I hope someone invents something worth my money.</li>
            <li> This is the only kind of brush I will use now.</li>
            <li> feels nice at the same time!  </li>
            <li> My 3-year-old hates having her hair brushed but these brushes do a good job of detangling without pulling too much.</li>
            <li> and I am thrilled to have a smaller one for my purse or swim bag!</li>
            <li> larger Detangling Brush&#x27;s handle fits nicely in the palm of my hand and enables me to have complete control when removing the tangles from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Starting at the ends and working my way up to the top of my head, this brush gets the tangles out without pulling my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , Quality Detangling Brushes well worth the under $15 asking price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter has the most sensitive head?</li>
            <li> I got these brushes on a deal for super cheap and didn&#x27;t have high expectations.  </li>
            <li> Perfect detangling brush- not too soft, not too stiff.  </li>
            <li> We have tried other brushes on my daughter&#x27;s hair and have finally found what works best.  </li>
            <li> Super fast delivery!</li>
            <li> My daughter has a sensitive scalp and her tangles easily, with these brushes we have no pain and brushes quickly.  </li>

            <li> The brissels are long and flexible making a great detangler leaving my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair, with many many dry tangles.</li>
            <li> Works great on my 3 year old with long hair!</li>
            <li> They are perfect for wet or dry hair for detangling.  </li>
            <li> They work great on out super thick hair and the handles are great for even her small hands, she&#x27;s 3.</li>
            <li> She gave the small one to my daughter in law for our infant granddaughter and it is great.</li>
            <li> And the small brush is great when we go away on the weekend.</li>
            <li> The small brush works great for when I am out or at work and need to freshen up.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the instructions since I usually don&#x27;t with items like this, lol.  </li>
            <li> The small brush is great for travel or just throwing in your purse when you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
            <li> Plus the small brush fits great in my purse.</li>
            <li> These brushes (the full size and the travel size) work really well on her hair type.  </li>
            <li> small one will be great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine anyone else would have an experience unlike my own, seeing as how (I&#x27;ll say again), my hair is LONG.</li>
            <li> The kind that takes effort to brush out and tends to get really knotted in the back.</li>
            <li> These brushes work very well on my daughter&#x27;s hair, which gets super tangly.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve been used regularly and the green brush is still in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> and I bought these for my daughter with long straight fine hair, should have known better.  </li>
            <li> I got them for my 3 year old grand niece that has very curly hair.</li>
            <li> They work super on straight hair.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve found these brushes do a great job (especially the bigger one) for detangling her hair after washing.</li>
            <li> GREAT brushes - my daughter has coarse, wavy hair that is always tangled, and these brushes are the only ones that work.</li>
            <li> She has very fine, easily tangled hair, and brushing it is often a heartbreaking mess.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants the perfect size brushes, if it can work for my thick hair it can work for others.</li>
            <li> At first these brushes worked good for knots, but after a month the plastic on the ends of the bristles came off making it very sharp to brush with.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very gentle and enable you to get rid of tangles without clumps of hair along with it.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the tugging and get the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly on the go so saving time in anything I do is very important.</li>
            <li> Once I could finely the stand the smell I decided to use it on my seven year old</li>
            <li> My daughter has long hair which tangles very easy.</li>
            <li> love it, gentle, easy, helpful for 6 yr old, she can brush her own thick hair.</li>
            <li> Very nice set, the thinner flexible bristles are super gentle on my always tangles thick color treated hair.</li>
            <li> and like it a little better - somehow it seems to be a bit more gentle -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually surprised it brushes through my wet hair and gets the tangles out amazingly!  </li>
            <li> tried this brush for the first time assuming that it wasn&#x27;t going to work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did smell plasticy when I first took it out of the bag</li>
            <li> These brushes work really well!</li>
            <li> They really detangle hair with no pain!</li>
            <li> and I use the mini brush on my young boys which have surfer style hair and they enjoy it as well.</li>
            <li> Worked really well for my hair!</li>
            <li> Not a lot of difference between this brush and a regular hairbrush, although the bristles are thinner and more flexible.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a big gap on the top of my brush because the bristles are positioned off to the side.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was wrong, they are awesome.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks, Beauty Junkies!</li>
            <li> but these brushes really do work!</li>
            <li> they really are worth it..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try it out on my 3 year old niece who always complains that it hurts when i brush her hair, this should be smooth brushing from now on.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> but my daughter is pretty tender headed.....</li>
            <li> just use  a light hand and move carefully on sensitive heads</li>
            <li> This is the second product I have purchased through this company and again completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> This brush set is the first we have EVER used where that wasn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> Great brushes to work through thick tangle hair without pulling or hurting.</li>
            <li> This brush helps detangle my hair and really works!</li>
            <li> I have coarse and wavy hair, my hair has not looked better.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush!</li>
            <li> Her comment was this really works!</li>
            <li> I love this brush for several reasons...</li>
            <li> first it works wonders on kids hair (and attitudes).</li>
            <li> I have makeup brushes from the same company that I absolutely love.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat it, no matter how much you spend on a brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical when something claims to be the BEST.</li>
            <li> The larger brush is almost identical to the Drybar Lemon drop brush, but I love the travel size that comes with this set.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many brushes have gotten stuck in my hair over the years and it&#x27;s definitely not an experience I want to keep going through.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today we have about 6 of these brushes and the first brush we bought is still being used.  </li>
            <li> This brush is slightly better than a regular brush.</li>
            <li> I said I wanted to try them first</li>
            <li> My hair does not break off when I use it and it leaves my hair tangle free and so soft.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I just curl my hair with a small curling iron and brush it from the top to the bottom and it gives off those Hollywood waves with no frizz or static.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I had a heart attack a year ago and decided for the first time in my life to grow my hair out</li>
            <li> Love the travel size especially.</li>
            <li> The beads started coming off after the first week.</li>
            <li> worked on my hair very well!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a granddaughter who loves to play beauty salon but DOESN&#x27;T love to have her hair brushed!</li>
            <li> I guess I will have to buy a brush in person at a store and smell it first.</li>
            <li> I saw this detangling brush and my first thought was, &amp;#34;Gimmick!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re reasonably priced too!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!  </li>
            <li> I first noticed that it didn&#x27;t hurt to use it at all</li>
            <li> Lightning fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Love that these are sold in a pair and in different colors.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and they never fail.  </li>
            <li> I really like this brushes!</li>
            <li> The product is perfect for people or children with normal to thin hair.</li>
            <li> little one my grand daughter can easily carry in her backpack to school.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Major issue for me, the strong rubber smell.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my daughter who will soon be getting long hair, but I tested them out on my very fine hair</li>
            <li> Only a couple of other reviews mentioned the SMELL of these brushes, so clearly many people are being paid to say nice things.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about the brush design, but it is so much easier to brush her hair, which is super fine and stick straight, so it gets some major tangles.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that these brushes don&#x27;t pull on my hair like other brushes do.  </li>
            <li> This No Tangle Hair Brush Set is not only great on my fiances very long and straight hair</li>
            <li> It even did great when I put it to the ultimate test (wet hair with no leave in conditioner or</li>
            <li> but it is more gentle than a regular brush or comb because the bristles have a lot of give.</li>
            <li> We have tried many no tangle brushes and these are probably my least favorite.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter whined and complained about having her hair brushed, until I bought your ( Best Detangling Hair Brush Set).</li>
            <li> We have a multitude of detangling brushes, including The Wet Brush, but this one is superior by far.  </li>
            <li> My hair is pretty straight</li>
            <li> I love having long hair</li>
            <li> but my 3 year old daughter hates having her hair brush full blown fits every time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the handle and back of the brush are very soft and the grip is very comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It detangles the hair, quickly, and almost completely painlessly.</li>
            <li> That fact you get two brushes in two different sizes is so convenient, using the pink large one comes in handy in my everyday hair routine and the smaller one is the perfect size for your makeup bag or purse.</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t want my hair to smell like these brushes.</li>
            <li> Leaving the large one for me to help them.</li>
            <li> Good bye plain old store brand hairbrushes that break!!</li>
            <li> It worked great for a while but less than a year later and the tops of the bustles have fallen off. .</li>
            <li> They work great, both with wet hair and dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely keep this brand in mind for the future when I need more!</li>
            <li> Having tons of fine hair, I&#x27;ve always dreaded brushing and have constantly struggled with tangles..</li>
            <li> The big one worked well for brushing through wet hair, detangling easily without getting stuck and pulling like most brushes.</li>
            <li> and they were fine when I went back a couple hours</li>
            <li> the knot got to a manageable size that was less noticeable and I just pulled my hair back into the best pony tail I could &#x27;til I got home and could use the bigger brush.  </li>
            <li> you for such a fine product.</li>
            <li> Overall they liked it, as for removing tangles easily, took some time, but it didnt pull their hair, just had to brush over it a few times to get the tangles out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for about a week now and the smell has gone away a little bit, but they&#x27;re still kind of stinky even after having washed them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work really well.</li>
            <li> She is prone to tangles and really hates it when she has to practically tear her hair out to get rid of one.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so much easier to manage and brush bc</li>
            <li> They really help with tangeled hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Arrived fast as well.</li>
            <li> Since using the brushes she no longer complains (as much) about brushing her haire.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and the bristles don&#x27;t hurt my scalp.</li>
            <li> that don&#x27;t cost and arm and a leg, that I can safely brush my hair wet with.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not really a product defect but more of quality control.</li>
            <li> These brushes really do detangle without pulling or damaging the hair.</li>
            <li> my family absolutely LOVES these brushes.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the advice that came in the email</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> A couple of passes and my hair is gently untangled.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes, and recommend them to anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> She used to tear her hair out while brushing after a shower, but this brush made it a much smoother process.</li>
            <li> Seems like they have a great customer service and they stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> The hair brushes are gentle on hair.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also very tender headed</li>
            <li> Very practical set of brushes.  </li>
            <li> But I have to admit that these brushes really do work.</li>
            <li> These are also great for thin hair and shorter hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it really did get the rat&#x27;s nest out.</li>
            <li> They shipped it fast, too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It works better on wet</li>
            <li> Wish I had gotten these much sooner.</li>
            <li> and this brush combs out my knots really fast.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think that it would work.  </li>
            <li> They do get rid of tangles and are gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li> colors are very pretty&lt;</li>
            <li> Highly recommended all around!</li>
            <li> Her hair is very tangled and she is &amp;#34;tender headed&amp;#34; and would cry every time I would brush her hair.</li>
            <li> and I find it very uncofortable on my scalp when I brush with them.</li>
            <li> I use the big one at home and love how soft it is on the scalp and gentle with the tangles.  </li>
            <li> Then if my hair is really knappy</li>
            <li> Straight from the shower with no hair product at all</li>
            <li> My hair is not in the best condition and I&#x27;m always afraid of it breaking off when I brush it after showering.</li>
            <li> much easier.</li>
            <li> These really do work well for tangles.</li>
            <li> Brushes and detangles your hair gently without pulling.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this seller!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> No pain, gentle brushes thru the snarls and tangles.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> was sent fast and well boxed</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> However it gently smoothed and divides hair.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, also.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on a real snarl</li>
            <li> Shipped fast</li>
            <li> There mother tells me they are working very well,</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I really like how my hair does not frizz after I&#x27;ve used the brushes.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for inventing these hair brushes.  </li>
            <li> my daughter really likes it.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter really likes the brushes.</li>
            <li> I have waist length straight hair</li>
            <li> how much conditioner</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair and it gets very tangled over night.</li>
            <li> These brushes really take out the tangles, painlessly.</li>
            <li> I have very fine/tangled hair.</li>
            <li> This did make brushing their hair easier, but for some reason it seemed to work much better when their hair was wet / damp.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference and neither does my daughter.</li>
            <li> They work well to get the tangles out without pulling too much.</li>
            <li> but this is a very close runner up.</li>
            <li> It is not a miracle worker but does make brushing out my daughter&#x27;s hair much easier.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very picky about her hairbrush.</li>
            <li> They seem to make it much easier to get through any tangles in the hair</li>
            <li> Not anymore, the brush is gentle on her hair and combs thru it with ease.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very fine/tangled/curly hair.</li>
            <li> Only several days of use, but already loving it.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great for my thick, curly hair and also on my tender headed 3 yr old.</li>
            <li> The smaller brush was nice for my younger daughter,  </li>
            <li> They are good quality and at least they shouldn&#x27;t break or lose their bristles.</li>
            <li> Only thing I would improve is color choices, I like muted natural colors better.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get out all the knots/tangles without a lot of brushing, but it does make the hair look really nice and without crying.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses the brushes and she absolutely loves them.&lt;br /&gt;There was a minute issue with the original large brush but after telephone contact with the vendor the brush was instantly replaced without any hassle.</li>
            <li> My 10 yr old daughter&#x27;s hair is long and very fine.  </li>
            <li> :) Works great on normal hair to thick hair, but doesn&#x27;t seem to cut it on my youngest daughters SUPER THICK hair.</li>
            <li> It really glides through my long hair easily.</li>
            <li> Then I was introduced to this brush and the first time my husband used it on the girls he came running to tell me how he was able to brush through one of the girl&#x27;s hair in less than 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I do not understand the magical powers of this brush and how it works, but somehow it really does easily comb through hair without pulling the hair- whether the hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li> So easy for her to get through her long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair that easily gets tangled, with these brushes it was no issue.</li>
            <li> My daughter (a super super sensitive red head) loves these brushes!!</li>
            <li> The brush completely smooths out my tangled wet hair easily and quickly</li>
            <li> &quot; when we have our twice-daily brush battles, but they work better than some other brushes out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other options and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> It is better than any other brushes I have purchased from drugstores.</li>
            <li> This has been a great brush for little girls with long hair.  </li>
            <li> The small green brush is the perfect size for traveling.</li>
            <li> My 3- year old loved the &amp;#34;Frozen&amp;#34; color of the small brush.</li>
            <li> These work very well and highly reduce tangles.</li>
            <li> but it actually brushes them right out!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t run so smoothly through my young daughter&#x27;s hair (very long) when it&#x27;s dry but works great when it is wet.</li>
            <li> Works really good in both dry and wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I love how there&#x27;s a handle with the brush allowing me to easily comb out my long hair (goes to the middle of my back).  </li>
            <li> i have very long, fine hair</li>
            <li> smaller brush easily fits in my small cosmetic bag very comfortably and even my jeans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this amazing brush there are no more tears.</li>
            <li> and I definitely couldn&#x27;t justify paying full price for them.</li>
            <li> The pink one is a great brush, the smaller green one isn&#x27;t as good, which is odd.</li>
            <li> It is a good product but nothing special, just like any other regular hair brush, OK to use for thin hair too.</li>
            <li> For normal slightly tangled hair just having wet/damp hair is good enough.  </li>
            <li> : There is a slight rubbery smell to the brushes that will surely dissipate with time, so if you are sensitive to that, just be aware.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a large brush for at home and a small one I can use for travel :) They are easy to hold and have a long enough handle to where your hand isn&#x27;t hitting your hair like the smaller ones</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I have very long hair and these brushes do their job and smooth our tangly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m noticing less hair in the brush after I use it and because of less healthy strands being pulled out my hair is getting more length.</li>
            <li> I love the makeup brush, but had a slight smell when opened but was gone once washed.  </li>
            <li> so much more less stressful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also used the brushes on my daughter&#x27;s fine but curly hair and it worked better but again only when used on small sections.</li>
            <li> She has enjoyed brushing her hair with less tangles.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair and this brush does a great job in getting the tangles out without pulling my hair.</li>
            <li> I was worried the small one would be too small, but it was perfect size for my gym bag after swimming!  </li>
            <li> Yes but have realistic expectations.  </li>
            <li> I just followed the directions exactly, brush in small sections from bottom to top.</li>
            <li> and these are the same brush pretty much!</li>
            <li> Luckily spraying with a detangler made it damp enough to work well</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too weak to do a good job detangling</li>
            <li> I have super long hair and coming straight from the shower to the blow-drying and using this brush</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend these.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEDED</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for tangle prone hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and didn&#x27;t like it, because it made my hair static-y and harder to brush.</li>
            <li> Compared to my other detangling brush, this set is by far a lot better.</li>
            <li> Love the little brush to put in my purse.</li>
            <li> My hair is the longest its ever been in my life at about 4 inches past my shoulders, and I feel that this brush is crucial to taking extra good care of it!  </li>
            <li> Even better, no tears from my little girl.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair that gets tangled easily and the brushes untangled my hair easily.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, fine, natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair and this brush does a good job getting through it all.</li>
            <li> I love how it comes with a large one and also a small one for my purse.</li>
            <li> I will be keeping one in my purse, and other within easy reach.</li>
            <li> VERY fast shipping which I am very thankful for that especially around the holidays.</li>
            <li> It is also a fantastic wet brush.</li>
            <li> Soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> My seven year old has board straight hair.</li>
            <li> They are soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> but at least now she brushes her own hair and it looks</li>
            <li> It glides through my hair with no problem and if it does hit a snag, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as a normal bristled brush does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping the smaller brush will prove useful for my toddler someday.</li>
            <li> This is not my go to normal every day brush.</li>
            <li> I have normal hair with lose waves.</li>
            <li> There is some hair in the brush when I am finished, but I believe that to be normally shed hair that would have come out anyway.</li>
            <li> Using them on dry hair was only slightly better than a normal hair brush.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact this came with a big and little brush, instead of fighting over something my toddler immediately grabbed the small one and her sister grabbed the big one and they were both happy ( how often does that happen?)  </li>
            <li> Right away one of my girlfriends chimed in that they buy the same brushes for their daughter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them right after I get out of the shower, after styling my hair, and at the end of the day (when I haven&#x27;t brushed my hair for hours.)</li>
            <li> Love these, and they work very well on long wet hair.....</li>
            <li> Live these brushes</li>
            <li> Need new brushes.</li>
            <li> I was received an email letting me know that they went with a new company to produce their brushes, and would send me ANOTHER replacement when they are in stock.</li>
            <li> I live that it comes with the mini brush for my purse.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying a new brush.</li>
            <li> I handed her the new brush and asked her to give it a try.</li>
            <li> (I live in a humid climate).</li>
            <li> Even though my hair was wet and likely full of conditioner still, the brush bristles just floated right over the knot.  </li>
            <li> My daughter REALLY prefers this one and she doesn&#x27;t complain nearly as much about having her hair brushed.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the brushes have a strong plastic/chemical smell which hasn&#x27;t dissipated much even after being in the open for a few weeks (the odor is much more noticeable on the larger brush).  </li>
            <li> I love the colors and they work very well on my hair, wet, damp or dry.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and brushes through my hair nicely (I have thick hair)</li>
            <li> These brushes are very easy to use on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it came with a large and smaller brush (I keep the smaller brush in the car for days when I ride with my windows down and my hair gets tangled).</li>
            <li> I was in a locker-room full of other women who probably found great humor in my feeble attempts to untangle my hair.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a good de tangling brush for my older daughter,  who had very long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think this would work on my massive bird nest</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much because how many times have you made a purchase in hopes it would be amazing to only be utterly disappointed.</li>
            <li> In addition to getting the knots out and not hurting, they also leave my hair soft, silky and shiny!  </li>
            <li> love the combo as the small brush fits into my purse - to use when out and about</li>
            <li> I want to say first off that my hair is one of those that you see in a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; commercial for humidity prone frizziness/waves/etc.</li>
            <li> AND I LOVE THAT THERE IS A SMALL BRUSH FOR MY PURSE</li>
            <li> my 10 and 11 year old daughters each claimed one!  </li>
            <li> May daughters love these Brushes no more pulling out hair from tangles.</li>
            <li> and of course a sensitive scalp!</li>
            <li> That would never happen with my old brush!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also great on my long thick curly hair!</li>
            <li> They both are made of strong durable plastic, and will definitely last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have long, coarse hair and it worked fine with my hair.</li>
            <li> The small brush lives in my purse for quick smooth outs and the big brush is our go-to for after baths and showers.</li>
            <li> but they have not worked very well on my daughters hair as she has wavy hair and a lot of the other brushes I have tried only provide a smooth surface</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised I had the strength to put in a new pony tail.  </li>
            <li> My hair is especially long, and tangles quickly.  </li>
            <li> My little one still doesn&#x27;t like to have her hair brushed and by no means does this &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; through hair like I had hoped, but these brushes are much better than normal combs.</li>
            <li> I have a 4 year old boy with long straight hair but with all the jumping and running around, it gets very tangled.</li>
            <li> They work ok if my hair is wet, but when it&#x27;s dry, it seems like the bristles just bend instead of brushing through my hair.</li>
            <li> I am able to brush through my hair with ease wet or dry with this brush without ripping it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love a marbeling of black, white and purple!</li>
            <li> We keep the larger one at home, and carry the smaller one in the car for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> Easily and gently untangle thick hair while reducing hair loss and breakage.</li>
            <li> I use the small brush on my 2yr old son, he has long curls and the small brush is perfect size and he hasnt had a fussy day yet.</li>
            <li> We have used them both right out of the shower and on dry hair</li>
            <li> The first time I used this brush I noticed that my hair did not fall out as much as it does with other brushes I use</li>
            <li> This brush was so easy to use it glide right through my thick coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t LOVE about the brushes is that the bristles are a little bit scratchy (this is why it got 4 stars instead of 5) it doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li> The bristles are super soft and flexible, works well even on wet hair!</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is like a dreadlock everyday I have to deal with huge knots ..</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product and I&#x27;d recommend to any mom who is tired of her child screaming when trying to brush their hair!</li>
            <li> Works very well on wet, or very damp hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how much my old brush was pulling my hair until I started using these.</li>
            <li> Went to use old brush and it hurt.</li>
            <li> There hair feels so soft  NO</li>
            <li> TANGLES RUN AND BUY these No crying kids</li>
            <li> Combs out her bed head and is soft on her scalp.  </li>
            <li> Has helped eliminated some of the screams and tears from my 5 year old at hair brushing time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My 4 year old also loves this brush.</li>
            <li> Overall, I do really like the brush, and will keep it and use another brush while blowdrying.</li>
            <li> They do occasionally complain, but it is not as much.  </li>
            <li> My old detangling brush doesn&#x27;t have a handle</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 7 year old who hates tangles and brushing her hair.  </li>
            <li> Got rid of my old ones the day these arrived.</li>
            <li> So I was pleasantly surprised when these brushes worked on his hair as well.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my children but after trying on myself, there is NO WAY I can use them on my kids sensitive scalps.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter used to complain about tangles all the time.</li>
            <li> was surprised by the quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive scalp, and I felt like the brushes bristles were massaging my head.  </li>
            <li> Seller also takes extra time to provide very helpful tips for use and care.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my 6 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Her hair is now soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> My 8 year old daughter, who has curly hair, loves these.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a birthday gift for our 8 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> My 3 years old girl doesn&#x27;t mind brushing her hair anymore.</li>
            <li> We have tears and screams every day while brushing our 7 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> My two year old doesn&#x27;t cry anymore when I need to brush her natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something soft and that would not snag on her tangles.  </li>
            <li> but none were completely satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair brush set for my 9 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> NO trouble brushing after the wash.</li>
            <li> I am returning them because I would not think of  getting them near my 3 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> My 8 yo daughter is the type that screams every time we brush her hair, being as gentle as we possibly can.  </li>
            <li> at all the bristles are soft and bend instead of pulling.  </li>
            <li> My 5 year old loves this brush.</li>
            <li> I like the size of this brush and the soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter has naturally curly hair that gets a LOT of tangles in it.  </li>
            <li> My 7 year old has been begging for a hairbrush that doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> I was willing to try anything for my 3 year old daughter who has long hair and hates me brushing it.</li>
            <li> I got a deep discount on this product to write a review, but this hairbrush is definitely worth paying a bit extra for.  </li>
            <li> Nice brush for someone with thin hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter really does willingly comb her hair now, wet or dry, and really loves this brush.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this brush for our daughter and herself, this is what she said: &amp;#34;The small brush is great for my toddler, and we tried with both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> The little green brush is the best for little ones!</li>
            <li> and I love that I can carry the small one in my purse!</li>
            <li> i dont think it works any better than other brushes that are similar or the same that you can get at almost any store</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t completely make brushing long hair painless, but so much better than a paddle or round brush.</li>
            <li> My other 4 year old daughter didn&#x27;t complain when I brushed her hair today, that&#x27;s success in my book!  </li>
            <li> As other people have pointed out, there is a distinct burnt rubber smell to the product</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of patience to comb out extreme snarls, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> My teen daughter, though, has long thick hair and loved the brush.</li>
            <li> Also, I find that the larger brush works better on wet hair than dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this essentially because I wanted a small brush for my purse, and I thought for this price, might as well get the pack - a girl can&#x27;t have too many hair brushes laying around,</li>
            <li> My hair is very straight, thick, long, fine and tangly.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old wakes up each day with a huge mess of tangles at the back of her head.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who was having major tangles and a sensitive head.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you&#x27;re finding tangles a regular part of your life.</li>
            <li> She usually runs and fights with me to brush her hair but with this brush it really runs right through her hair with no pulling or tugging.</li>
            <li> They get the tangles out and the hair smooth with very little effort.</li>
            <li> If used correctly they detangle the hair pain free whether hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It brushes through it smoothly either wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> It works fabulously on both wet and dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate where they are coming from, especially in today&#x27;s online world where reviews really matter, but the reason I&#x27;m shopping on Amazon is because I have very little time (okay, and I&#x27;m also lazy ;))</li>
            <li> She usually brings her brush and sits on my lap or on the floor in front of me and lets me brush it smooth.</li>
            <li> My daughter wants long hair, but would not brush.  </li>
            <li> (I have really long stick straight hair).</li>
            <li> I thought the colors were very playful, and my 4 year old claimed the smaller brush instantly.  </li>
            <li> She normally hates having her hair brushed because it can hurt, but she says this one doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> This is not a replacement for a normal brush, it really only works well as a detangler.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush worked pretty well when her hair was wet.</li>
            <li> So far no tangle has proven too tough but we also make sure we do not let her hair ever get to that point.  </li>
            <li> It detangles wet hair easily and doesn&#x27;t pull or damage like every other brush I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but they fell flat.</li>
            <li> But detangling has honestly never been as painless and easy as it is now with this brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter said that this brush does not hurt as much, but I have noticed that it only brushes the surface of her hair and does not get the kinks out of the middle of her head.</li>
            <li> They make it easy to comb through my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these brushes to anyone, but especially to those with a sensitive head of tangled hair!</li>
            <li> you can barely tell it&#x27;s working until you realize all of the tangles are now gone!  </li>
            <li> my major concerns were the brushes would just break and not too stand up to its quality.</li>
            <li> Add J&amp;J no more tangles leave in conditioner and you are golden!</li>
            <li> So glad I got these brushes because I have a hard time removing tangles from my long hair.</li>
            <li> They were also extremely persistent re: positive feedback.</li>
            <li> It was a fight to get his untangled, to get her to not cry and me not to rip my hair out in general.  </li>
            <li> My 3 yr old twin girls stopped complaining about getting their hair brushed and their hair is silkier and shinier.</li>
            <li> My young daughter prefers the bigger brush.  </li>
            <li> I use the smaller one for my 1 year old daughter and she does not cry anymore when I brush her hair.</li>
            <li> four year old claimed the smaller brush.</li>
            <li> This brush works very well on wet hair, which is what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I have replaced my old brush with this one and use it daily now!</li>
            <li> I purchased the set for my 2 year old daughter - who hates to have the knots brushed out of her hair - and myself.  </li>
            <li> Was definitely and unexpected</li>
            <li> I find it very similar to a natural bristle brush in the way that it approaches tangles.</li>
            <li> I am ordering another set because my 6 Year old won&#x27;t let me use her big brush.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot, it really does detangle wet hair.  </li>
            <li> The key is that in addition to being meant for detangling, they also have a soft tip on each bristle, and that makes all the difference.</li>
            <li> They pulled just as much as my regular brushes, and my kids complained more about them than they actually do over a brush I bought at Walmart for $2.</li>
            <li> With a 1 yr old I just didn&#x27;t think that was possible.</li>
            <li> The bristles seemed cheap and thin, and it looked like a normal brush-</li>
            <li> Works for my thick long hair where most brushes get stuck.</li>
            <li> I bought an expensive detangling brush from a popular beauty product store that I was using before.</li>
            <li> Her hair type is more on the thin side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> price not bad for two and no more tangle means that.</li>
            <li> It has seemed to calm down a bit since taking them out of the package, but if I put my nose to the brush you can definitely still smell it.</li>
            <li> Since we started using this hairbrush, not a single tear!  </li>
            <li> use them on dry hair as well and its still much easier than a regular pin brush to get it through hair without pulling.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about it is its strong smell.</li>
            <li> But, out of habit, I still tend reach for a wide toothed comb after my showers.&lt;br /&gt;These detangle hair quickly and with absolutely minimal pain, and for me, they made my hair softer.</li>
            <li> the other hand, my own hair is extremely thick and these do not work well for my hair, they do not hurt, but they do not get through the massive amount of hair I have.  </li>
            <li> In addition, my hair is shedding less and it has really pumped up the volume on my hair too!</li>
            <li> Glides right through my hair wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Other brushes would rip through my hair and cause breakage no matter how gentle I tried to be with them.</li>
            <li> With other brushes, my daughter would not want to brush her hair since it would hurt so much.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried other brushes that claimed to be gentle at detangling, but they didn&#x27;t work as well as they claimed.  </li>
            <li> The smaller brush works better on her hair but not great.  </li>
            <li> They did have a little smell at first</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, very thick, and very long.  </li>
            <li> I have long, straight hair that is dry and damaged and loves to frizz.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve  broken my fair share of brushes while trying to tame my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for great beauty products on a budget, give Beauty Junkees a try and you wont be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My 2 daughters of 4 and 5 years old have long hair.</li>
            <li> My teen daughter with thick straight hair said she really like the brush.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had them for less than 9 months and the large brush is falling apart.</li>
            <li> I had such a hard time trying to brush my two granddaughters long hair, but this brush makes it so easy and no complaints or</li>
            <li> She has very thick, wavy hair that tangles easily......</li>
            <li> I love the little small one too..</li>
            <li> No more tears for my little girl :)</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected and daughter loves the new brushes.  </li>
            <li> I have a 7 month old son with very long, wavy hair that gets knotted and matted.</li>
            <li> Less stress on and breakage of hair when brushing, seems to get tangles out without pulling as much.  </li>
            <li> Both doll and girl have long hair that tends to tangle and the bristles on these brushes are far enough apart</li>
            <li> At first you may you may think it is a cheap and boring cheap brush.  </li>
            <li> this brush really does the trick for my mess of hair.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this, and then I tried to cancel it, because I really didn&#x27;t need a new brush, however it was too late.</li>
            <li> Works very well on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> These brushes really do make brushing our little ones tangles out with ease.  </li>
            <li> but it slides through much easier with little pulling effort.</li>
            <li> This brush works well on my long hair, particularly when wet.</li>
            <li> The large area means that I can get through my hair faster and the soft bristles ensures the least stress and tear on the hair to get the job</li>
            <li> I bought them for my 8 year old daughter who has very thick and full and LONG hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thin hair that tangles easily and doesn&#x27;t like to untangle,  except with this brush.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has really thick hair and it glides right thru it.</li>
            <li> Okay i guess i just have the very thin, frail and flat asian hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick long blond adult hair which the brushes do not work very well in.  </li>
            <li> She is very tender headed and at times hard to bare when brushing her hair.</li>
            <li> The large one, I keep in my bathroom, while the small one goes everywhere with me in my purse.</li>
            <li> I have an 8 year old daughter who would melt down at the slightest mention of needing to get her hair brushed.  </li>
            <li> I normally only use a wide tooth comb because i&#x27;m afraid of doing more damage to my hair, but these brushes have made it into my hair care routine!</li>
            <li> Also on dry hair, after being windblown and horribly tangled, it worked awesome, too!  </li>
            <li> My oldest has a sensitive head and she complains less when I use these brushes instead of our regular ones.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful at first, but this is a very good hairbrush for long, thick hair -- wet or dry!</li>
            <li> The small brush is small enough to fit in my purse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really been trying to baby my hair over the past year, to help heal years of damage, dyes, and split ends.  </li>
            <li> a household of people with long mane&#x27;s, I recommend this product totally!</li>
            <li> I actually ended up spending way too long trying to brush out my hair.</li>
            <li> It seems the ease may be due to the lengthy bristles, but it brushes out my tangles and knots like no other hair brush I have used before.</li>
            <li> really love that it comes with a travel companion, seeing as I am too afraid of losing the larger sized brush if I brought it with me on a trip.</li>
            <li> seeing far less breakage as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What was even more disappointing than buying brushed</li>
            <li> The next morning we used it on her hair when it was dry</li>
            <li> I use the smaller brush because of the color and my girlfriend uses the larger pink one.  </li>
            <li> I have two girls with long, thick hair that gets pretty tangled throughout the day and even after washing.</li>
            <li> They are not hard, or too stiff.  </li>
            <li> I usually tease my hair and had a hard time getting the knots out and this brush has made it so easy just make</li>
            <li> However, since my kids have insanely quick to tangle hair, taking a long time to brush can be frustrating-</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its just the size of the small one that makes it less intimidating to her, but she reacts to the small much MUCH better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever used on her.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a little sensitive to the &amp;#34;new smell&amp;#34; of the brush</li>
            <li> I have very long, very thick hair that tangles easily when I wear it down.</li>
            <li> I end up having a hard time and there&#x27;s always so much hair that falls on the brush.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s curved to fit the palm of your hand) which makes brushing long hair rather difficult.  </li>
            <li> My everyday shampoo/conditioner I use Clear Damage and Color Repair.</li>
            <li> I use the big one on my hair and the small on my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I have really long hair...</li>
            <li> I am always reluctant to to brush out my hair when I&#x27;ve had it in a bun all day, or even at the end of a long work day.</li>
            <li> I ordered these 2 brushes for my 3 year old daughter who has been crying when I brush her hair.</li>
            <li> The pink brush is starting to show wear and the tips have begun to wear off.</li>
            <li> and now I am wondering why and how I suffered so long without one...</li>
            <li> These brushes were missing many of the small beads and the ones that were there were so small that the medal bristles still hurt.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and I had just gotten used to pain when brushing through tangles.</li>
            <li> Handle is rubbery so as not to be slippery, especially when wet.</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is long and wavy.</li>
            <li> If your hair is still in knots after you condition it then depending on the length of your hair, you are in for a long brushing process.  </li>
            <li> and I have long hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about the color as long as it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter can brush her hair, which is three feet long and wavy, with these brushes.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has long wavy hair that is always tangled.</li>
            <li> I have 3 girls with long curly hair.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be similar to the Wet Brush</li>
            <li> I have two curly girls with long hair.  </li>
            <li> These brushes were not nearly as sturdy a I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> These brushes worked very well on my thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> My girls are very tender headed and have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about it at first because I have super thick hair</li>
            <li> This is the only brush we have found that doesn&#x27;t make her cry when brushing her hair - wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Not only did this leave pink specks all in my hair, but it also left sharp bristles that hurt my scalp.</li>
            <li> I got this brush to see if I could really brush my hair when it&#x27;s wet and have less fall out and less pain.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t take me as long to brush it!</li>
            <li> The bigger brush had the bristles closer together and the nubs on each one were a little sharper than my regular paddle brush.</li>
            <li> We have long hair!</li>
            <li> I only use it if I have extremely tangled hair.</li>
            <li> We also have a &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34; and it seems to be just as nice, and less expensive!  </li>
            <li> Second due to the bristles being soft it simply doesn&#x27;t go through my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I cannot just let it dry without brushing it.</li>
            <li> The bristles on these brushes are soft on your scalp yet are strong enough to get those annoying tangles out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a brush to help tame my daughters hair without it either hurting her as its brushed or ripping hair out as its brushed.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and am constantly stuggling w keeping my hair detangled or even looking decent bc in all honesty</li>
            <li> The wide spread of the bristles makes for less tangles and the bristles being as soft as they are won&#x27;t hurt your head when pressing down on scalp.</li>
            <li> I needed a new hair brush that would work well for thick curly hair and this worked well for both myself and my daughter.</li>
            <li> Does work nicely on dry hair though!</li>
            <li> This brush goes through my hair (shoulder length) with ease both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on wet and dry hair...</li>
            <li> Does it have less pull then a regular brush, yes.</li>
            <li> Still have alot of hair on my brush every after brushing with wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Makes it easier to work through tangles,  wet or dry.</li>
            <li> No problems with using it with wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> It gets all my hair detangled in about five minutes when used with dry hair, and in about two minutes, when my hair is wet (with conditioner in it).</li>
            <li> By this time my arms were so weak from this intense wrestling match</li>
            <li> They look very simple and had less bristles than I expected</li>
            <li> wet or dry!</li>
            <li> love these hair brushes and would recommend them to anyone who has little girls with tough tangled hard to manage hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My boyfriend, who has hair down to his bottom, LOVES these brushes (hates that the bigger one is pink though!).</li>
            <li> but I only had a little bit with this brush.</li>
            <li> Kept the larger brush for myself and my preschooler kept the little one.</li>
            <li> Little one for my purse, big for at home.</li>
            <li> I only wish they had this brush when I was little.</li>
            <li> I have 2 little girls that constantly have tangles in their hair</li>
            <li> Only thing I would change up a little are the color offerings.  </li>
            <li> I kept the big one and use the little one on my toddler.</li>
            <li> Really does detangle tough knots if given a bit of time and a detangler solution.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, and a whole lot of it</li>
            <li> I tried both brushes on dry and wet hair and it works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I have a 3 year old whose hair is so hard to brush sometimes.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this to anyone who has had trouble with tangles in the past.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how these brushes work, but they manage to detangle my crazy, thick, matted, long curly hair very easily.</li>
            <li> At 2 yrs I would have to have wrestling matches, trying to brush my granddaughters hair,No matter how careful I would be it would still pull and hurt.</li>
            <li> it was a wet brush.  </li>
            <li> have tried a few different detangling brushes; the knot genie, the Goody version of the knot genie and now this.</li>
            <li> The flexible bristles work into the tangles and help pull them out without any pain and minimal hair breakage.</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t cringe when I combed through her hair while it was wet</li>
            <li> This brush is almost identical to the wet brush.</li>
            <li> Not as expected.</li>
            <li> These do work on wet hair.</li>
            <li> I gave my granddaughter the pink one</li>
            <li> I kept the green one and use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;m literally running out the door with a wet head -</li>
            <li> Five years ago it was the \\&quot;The Wet</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried a few different brushes, and none have helped make brushing any easier.</li>
            <li> so leaving online reviews is not a high priority of mine!</li>
            <li> This gets the job done with minimal screaming.</li>
            <li> I use the pink brush in the shower after I apply my conditioner.</li>
            <li> I had resigned myself to crying every time I brushed my hair for the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li> and I always use mine after I get out of the shower and my hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> I purchased these because I have the wet brush</li>
            <li> I tried this brush with my hair wet</li>
            <li> I have tried a few detangler brushes in my daughter&#x27;s hair, with mixed results.</li>
            <li> but it is something to consider since some people do not like to brush wet hair since it can cause</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the wet brush also</li>
            <li> This was not as I had expected.</li>
            <li> I use the pink brush daily and the green brush is for when I travel.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my 10 year old daughter who has thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a regular brush, but the bristles are thin and soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the deal with my 3 year old&#x27;s hair is, but these brushes cause much less pain and make life easier.</li>
            <li> The blue one is a little small, but works well for my younger daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, and it&#x27;s minor-</li>
            <li> Over the course of running 10 miles with my pony tail twisting into a tornado tight knot, I attempted to use the smaller brush to un-wind my unholy mess of a nest at the nape of my neck.  </li>
            <li> Usually I have a big chunk of hair to pull out of my brush</li>
            <li> The brush works like any other brush.</li>
            <li> Decided to get this set as it has 2 brushes - 1 big and 1 small.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the heads of the bristles falling off like other reviews</li>
            <li> I have paid big bucks for no tangle hair brushes in the past.  </li>
            <li> I am using the big one and she is using the small one.  </li>
            <li> He is African-American and I have only used boar-hair brushes in the past.</li>
            <li> These are the only brushes she uses and loves that she can carry the small one in her backpack.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical it would detangle my daughters</li>
            <li> These brushes do not rip your hair out like a lot of other brushes.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I noticed there are other vendors who sell almost identical brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one from Beauty Junkees is the same brush plus a small one that my 8-yr-old daughter took with her in her bag she uses at school.  </li>
            <li> This brush works like other brush.</li>
            <li> I have to say I took a chance on the other reviews</li>
            <li> This came as a two pack, so I use the larger one for myself and the small one for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to toss into my purse or let my daughter use.</li>
            <li> Grandbaby loves the brushes they do not pull her hair like other brushes</li>
            <li> This brush eliminates the need for a cream rinse or other product that helps tangles.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the small one for my purse and travel.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and have had 38 years of many painful tangles and snarls (with long and short hair).</li>
            <li> My 5yo daughter gets the worse tangles possible in the back of her curly hair.</li>
            <li> Really makes brushing curly hair easier and less painful on my 6 year old when her hair is wet.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how strongly the brushes smell like petrol or gasoline.</li>
            <li> If you have trouble with dangles in your hair, you will want to buy this product to help alleviate the discomfort of removing dangles from your hair whether after washing your hair or brushing dry hair.</li>
            <li> the brushes aren&#x27;t horrible, they work well when the hair is wet and freshly conditioned but not so much when the hair is dry, even with a spray detangler.</li>
            <li> There was no pulling and hurting and getting stressed at how long it would take to untangle this mess!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly, long hair that I can only brush if its soaking wet and loaded with conditioner.</li>
            <li> Having long thick hair I&#x27;ve always had to wait until it was dry in order to brush it and</li>
            <li> My daughter is 4 with smooth, thin straight blonde hair that always ends up with horrible knots - especially from her hair pulling little brother.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be making my hair smell, but I would be a little worried about how it would make my clothes smell after being in a closed suitcase for a while.</li>
            <li> She complains a lot less with these than other brushes we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much hair I was needlessly losing until I got this brush.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for my niece who is mixed and has thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Good Brush, but smells terrible.  </li>
            <li> I use the pink one and my daughter the green.  </li>
            <li> About halfway down my</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product when I ordered it because I have super thick hair that is unruly.</li>
            <li> DOWN</li>
            <li> I keep one upstairs &amp; one down</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been let down.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other brush !</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve thrown out every other brush I have!  </li>
            <li> One of my daughters has thin wavy hair and the other has thick straight hair.</li>
            <li> I caught her brushing her hair by herself the other day!</li>
            <li> My daughter puts up much less of a fuss when I use this brush.  </li>
            <li> Makes getting the tangles out of my toddler&#x27;s wavy hair in the mornings less traumatic for both of us.</li>
            <li> My daughter complains less about her hair being pulled with this brush.</li>
            <li> I noticed that there is less hair coming out in my brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer a brush that was in an earthy color, i.e. graphite, black, brown or some marbling of colors in the plastic itself</li>
            <li> The smell is still there, but it is less and less.</li>
            <li> They work great on my thick hair and my daughters crazy unruly curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> I have really long thick hair and everytime I brush</li>
            <li> My husband, myself and my step daughter all have long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and before I found this brush</li>
            <li> This brush works well on my long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and always struggle with tangles and knots.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has long thick hair, and this doesn&#x27;t even go thru her hair.  </li>
            <li> kids have long, thick hair and brushing out the tangles has always been a fight, until we found these brushes.  </li>
            <li> found out the hard way after taking the small, blue brush with me on a long relay run that it does not work well to get out thick tangles.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and I use this after I dry my hair after a shower.  </li>
            <li> it has the little mini that I can take along in my purse.</li>
            <li> They cause little to no hair loss as well as zero frizz.</li>
            <li> My little one LOVES these..</li>
            <li> I have two little girls and somehow can never find a brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little worried when I opened up the packaging.</li>
            <li> blown hair without a little pull here and there..</li>
            <li> I have little to no problem at all brushing her hair now.  </li>
            <li> Check the bristles out and the little &amp;#34;nubby&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have tried other detangling hair brushes in the past that promise no pulling</li>
            <li> I appreciate little details like that.  </li>
            <li> Goes through my daughters hair with little to no problems.</li>
            <li> It combs through her tangles with little or no snagging.  </li>
            <li> It does still pull a little while brushing my daughters hair</li>
            <li> It glides through with little tugging and pain.  </li>
            <li> I soaked mine for a few hrs &amp; they was a mess .  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have curly hair and unless I wash my hair everyday it&#x27;s a mess, until I used this brush.</li>
            <li> It does still pull a little on the tangles</li>
            <li> Then, the little round parts on the ends of the bristles came off.</li>
            <li> so getting through it following a washing has always been a tough process.  </li>
            <li> but it cut down on screaming and tears by 100%!</li>
            <li> As a last resort before cutting her hair short, I bought these two brushes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush out of desperation, our last hope before cutting her hair short.</li>
            <li> but after a few days the smell went away.</li>
            <li> In my experience, brushing  out tangles is easier if my hair is wet or at least damp.</li>
            <li> a really harsh chemical paint type smell...hard to use because of the smell.  </li>
            <li> The texture of the brushes gives a firm grip so they won&#x27;t slip out of your hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I need something heavy duty</li>
            <li> Ever household should have at least one wet brush.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are long and thin and they have little plastic beads at the tip.</li>
            <li> My other daughter has thick curly hair and she too loves them.</li>
            <li> In my family we have three females, myself included, with long, thick, curly hair!  </li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes for my 7 year old granddaughter who has always hated to have her long hair brushed.  </li>
            <li> but because of the very strong horrible chemical smell she will not use it again.</li>
            <li> My daughters&#x27;s hair and very thick and long</li>
            <li> My hair is long &amp; very thick</li>
            <li> when I got these brushes I was honestly skeptical on how they worked and didn&#x27;t really think they could detangle my thick mop on my head!</li>
            <li> These look like an everyday ordinary brush.</li>
            <li> I have thin long hair.  </li>
            <li> She took the small green one and kept it.</li>
            <li> no more daughter crying her lil eyes out</li>
            <li> Even when I used the brushes as recommend (small sections working it until all tangles were gone) it was VERY time consuming and felt very difficult to do.</li>
            <li> and it was much more difficult and painful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about these little brushes, but my hair loves them!</li>
            <li> These type brushes have small little beads of hard plastic at the end of each bristle to prevent them from scratching your scalp.</li>
            <li> With these brushes I no longer have to worry about that because the brushes glide through my hair with very little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still use a spray but it helps really get through the bad spots alot easier.</li>
            <li> One thing that I didn&#x27;t read, although it is clearly stated, is that you can not use this brush with a hair dryer, that was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I packed the small on in my bag when I went on vacation over Easter.</li>
            <li> No more tears for my daughter</li>
            <li> The toddler enjoys holding the small brush.</li>
            <li> the small one is already in my purse for hair emergencies</li>
            <li> so I carry the small one around with me in my car.</li>
            <li> They never snag, the small one is purse-sized and no static whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Not many Amazon merchants do that anymore.</li>
            <li> not sure why that is</li>
            <li> She usually screams and cries and sometimes runs away from me when I brush through her hair after her shower/bath.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usually a battle and takes forever to get all the tangles out.  </li>
            <li> She has used them everyday without a complaint.  </li>
            <li> There is no more crying, and brushing hair is no longer a burden!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the small one yet, but if it works as well as the full-size</li>
            <li> i keep the small one in my purse  </li>
            <li> The brush is just what I had asked for for Christmas and the addition of the small brush is an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have used it everyday since !</li>
            <li> No more screaming while my kids brush their hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is that makes this brush work</li>
            <li> No more tears or tangles.</li>
            <li> No more hair fights in the am and</li>
            <li> no more birds nest head.</li>
            <li> Well, at least it&#x27;s not a huge struggle like</li>
            <li> no more tears in the morning at hair brushing time.</li>
            <li> My daughters use the small one when they brush their hair.</li>
            <li> No more pulling and yanking a brush through my hair.</li>
            <li> No more whining.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to get my daughter&#x27;s hair brushed through without tears.</li>
            <li> No more crying!</li>
            <li> I have use these brushes for the past week</li>
            <li> I have thick, course hair which doesn&#x27;t tangle too awful much, but it will occasionally get twisted in knots (especially when I work out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually dont brush my hair when its dry because I have wavy hair and Ill</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a miracle product, my daughter yelled &amp;#34;ow!&amp;#34; At least twice in the past week we&#x27;ve had it....</li>
            <li> No more crying!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s near to impossible to find a brush that runs through my locks without tugging, pulling and breaking...</li>
            <li> My daughter has a hard time letting me brush her hair</li>
            <li> we all know how hard it is to brush wind</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it even if the small brush gave me some grief.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, now almost all of the round pieces on the end of the bristles are missing.  </li>
            <li> Always complained of the knots.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had these brushes for a while now, at least a year.</li>
            <li> Eventually (eventually meaning after at least 2 hours of wrestling with brushing my hair)</li>
            <li> My tween daughter has thick wavy hair and a sensitive scalp, so she is always reluctant to brush it all the way through because it&#x27;s painful.  </li>
            <li> my daughter has extremely thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, wavey, and prone to tangling.</li>
            <li> my daughter has thick hair wish I had this brush years ago.</li>
            <li> who&#x27;s hair is not quite as thick</li>
            <li> I am not Tender headed, but it would pull and hurt as I pulled a comb or brush through my hair (which is thick).</li>
            <li> Because I am growing out my hair...because my hair is really thick and curly...</li>
            <li> Hair brushing used to bring tears to my daughter&#x27;s eyes since her hair was so thick.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and these brushes don&#x27;t seem to go all the way though and get the tangles out.</li>
            <li> Since I have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s probably the secret to less tangles!</li>
            <li> The bristle are quite sharp underneath, so the brush was made basically useless at that point.</li>
            <li> No More!  </li>
            <li> I mean...</li>
            <li> No more screaming while I brush her hair!</li>
            <li> While it worked well, if there were serious tangles it would still pull and cause my daughter to yell saying it hurts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m being serious</li>
            <li> Seriously, I have no idea</li>
            <li> Bought this to have the little one for my toddler, but am now addicted for myself!  </li>
            <li> I have 2 girls with medium to long hair and we always used to have problems doing their hair because hair combing or brushing was painful,  With these detangling brushes our problem has gone away...</li>
            <li> The brushes do get tangles out of my hair and make it smoother, but the bristles on the brush are very hard</li>
            <li> We purchased these brushes for our daughter who has very thick hair that would knot up all the time.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> No more tears!!</li>
            <li> No more pulling my hair out over tangles!!</li>
            <li> They say it&#x27;s bad to brush your hair when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I still have my thick poodle hair</li>
            <li> The bristles are thin so they seem to get through tangles easier.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not feel that the brushes worked well with my extremely thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> Could not get over the chemical smell when I opened the package, thus don&#x27;t really know how it works, but the stench was terrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The secret to detangling is your conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I bought the brushes for my daughter, but it never arrived and Amazon system seems to be confused with tracking.</li>
            <li> I figured, no great loss if it&#x27;s a fluke.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are very thin and can&#x27;t penetrate my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> and she used to get so frustrated using other brushes.</li>
            <li> You still need to place a hand at the base of the hair to cut down on pulling, and brush slowly.....</li>
            <li> but it makes brushing less painful.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair, and every brush I tried previously,(including combs) would cause my hair to snap, they would get stuck,  and they were PAINFUL!</li>
            <li> I have really bad tangles in my hair and these brushes get them out with little to no pulling.</li>
            <li> I have a daughter with naturally curly hair that tangles horribly.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, very difficult hair</li>
            <li> No more cry!!!</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was skeptical when I saw this brush.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about getting this brush.  </li>
            <li> The brush also has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> Every morning when I comb for them, it is difficult to detangle their hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> These brushes exude such a horrible chemical smell that I had to put them away, and I am not one who has &amp;#34;chemical sensitivities&amp;#34; or anything like that.</li>
            <li> I was WRONG.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair that always gets knotted up real bad.</li>
            <li> These brushes make quick work of the terrible awful knots that come out of nowhere under my hair.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have crazy curly hair</li>
            <li> I am afraid to use them on my hair...</li>
            <li> I tried the brush for myself and it was like cutting through butter.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this brush a try after the Tangle Teaser failed (it didn&#x27;t hurt, but didn&#x27;t get any tangles out!)</li>
            <li> Doesnt pull badly at knots or anything.</li>
            <li> Like the set a lot, but doesn&#x27;t get out bad tangles, the bristles just bend.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and a bad habit of using rubber bands in my hair.</li>
            <li> Every brush we have used on her has been painful to get the knots out of her hair.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> BUT HATE THAT MY HAIR GET SO TANGLED UP</li>
            <li> and I honestly hate brushing my hair</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s saying a lot because she previously hated brushing her hair.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It has been months and they still smell awful..</li>
            <li> Upon opening the box, I was met with a TERRIBLE chemical/plastic smell.</li>
            <li> These smell awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am loving these brushes. I packed the small on in my bag when I went on vacation over Easter. I was impressed with how well it worked. No pulling hair to get tangles out. The brush glided smoothly through tangles and made them disappear. I have even used the brush to comb by kids hair. Definitely a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair... The kind that takes effort to brush out and tends to get really knotted in the back. I am always reluctant to to brush out my hair when I&#x27;ve had it in a bun all day, or even at the end of a long work day. There will be tangles... oh yes, there will be tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this brush for the first time assuming that it wasn&#x27;t going to work as well as I had hoped. To my pleasant surprise, it really does live up to its claims. It seems the ease may be due to the lengthy bristles, but it brushes out my tangles and knots like no other hair brush I have used before. It also doesn&#x27;t cause me pain, which is something my scalp cringes at the thought of. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone else would have an experience unlike my own, seeing as how (I&#x27;ll say again), my hair is LONG. About halfway down my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love that it comes with a travel companion, seeing as I am too afraid of losing the larger sized brush if I brought it with me on a trip. I have used the smaller brush many times, and it works just as good as the larger one. Would highly recommend this to anyone who has had trouble with tangles in the past.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! They get the tangles out and the hair smooth with very little effort. My daughter loves brushing her hair now. The smaller brush in the set is the perfect size for her to brush by herself.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair and this brush does a great job in getting the tangles out without pulling my hair.Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did smell plasticy when I first took it out of the bag but after a few days the smell went away.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. My 3 yr old twin girls stopped complaining about getting their hair brushed and their hair is silkier and shinier.</li>
            <li> I have had these for a month now. Love them.  My daughter has a sensitive scalp and her tangles easily, with these brushes we have no pain and brushes quickly.  My other daughter has thick curly hair and she too loves them. Will be buying them for her as well.</li>
            <li> This brush duo works well right out of the shower for tangles!</li>
            <li> Both myself and my five year old daughter absolutely love these brushes.</li>
            <li> Im in love. No more tears for my daughter</li>
            <li> My nieces love the brushes. They work really well. The toddler enjoys holding the small brush.</li>
            <li> I love these, My granddaughter and I have have curly hair, which easily gets tangles. At 2 yrs I would have to have wrestling matches, trying to brush my granddaughters hair,No matter how careful I would be it would still pull and hurt. These Brushes Are Wonderful,, No more tears!! She now Loves to have her hair brushed and taken care of.</li>
            <li> Love love these brushes I didn&#x27;t know how much my old brush was pulling my hair until I started using these. Went to use old brush and it hurt. But these are amazing the green brush is perfect for travel</li>
            <li> So happy with this brush. Would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these brushes.  She is prone to tangles and really hates it when she has to practically tear her hair out to get rid of one.  These brushes are very gentle and enable you to get rid of tangles without clumps of hair along with it.</li>
            <li> These brushes work very well on my daughter&#x27;s hair, which gets super tangly. The blue one is a little small, but works well for my younger daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> These are the absolute BEST hairbrushes I&#x27;ve ever had. I have very thick, curly, long hair that I can only brush if its soaking wet and loaded with conditioner. With these, I can brush my hair even if it&#x27;s full of hairspray and knotted beyond belief. I have a 7 month old son with very long, wavy hair that gets knotted and matted. The small brush is perfect to use on his hair. It doesn&#x27;t pull at all and he no longer fights me to brush his hair. I HIGHLY recommend these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the deal with my 3 year old&#x27;s hair is, but these brushes cause much less pain and make life easier.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and am constantly stuggling w keeping my hair detangled or even looking decent bc in all honesty my hair looks like a jacked up poodle! 😊 when I got these brushes I was honestly skeptical on how they worked and didn&#x27;t really think they could detangle my thick mop on my head! When I tried it I was amazed at how well and easily it detangled my hair! It worked really well!!! There was no pulling and hurting and getting stressed at how long it would take to untangle this mess! Needless to say I still have my thick poodle hair but it&#x27;s so much easier to manage and brush bc it doesn&#x27;t take me as long to brush it! Well worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Only several days of use, but already loving it. Smooth sleek brush, and no tangling or pain. Excellent for kids!</li>
            <li> Works nicely.  We also have a &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34; and it seems to be just as nice, and less expensive!  Great to have the smaller brush to stick in the gym bag as well.</li>
            <li> These brushes work really well! I have really bad tangles in my hair and these brushes get them out with little to no pulling. The smaller one to me doesn&#x27;t work as well but still works! I love that it comes with a large brush for at home and a small one I can use for travel :) They are easy to hold and have a long enough handle to where your hand isn&#x27;t hitting your hair like the smaller ones</li>
            <li> These brushes deserve a 5star rating!!!! I bought them for my daughter who will soon be getting long hair, but I tested them out on my very fine hair and I lalalalalove them! They are A-MAZING! A++++ Definitely worth the price! Don&#x27;t hurt or pull my hair.  Will definitely keep this brand in mind for the future when I need more!</li>
            <li> I kept the larger brush and my daughter kept the smaller brush. These work very well and highly reduce tangles.</li>
            <li> I just love these brushes. They work great and feel great. Just want to keep brushing lol</li>
            <li> We love our new brushes!  They are durable and kid friendly!  They really detangle hair with no pain! Great for young kids!</li>
            <li> Awesome hair brush. Handles are so user friendly.It can be used on any kind of hair</li>
            <li> my girls love these brushes. There hair feels so soft  NO TANGLES RUN AND BUY these No crying kids lol</li>
            <li> As described, Came on time...would order again.</li>
            <li> Hallelujah! Having tons of fine hair, I&#x27;ve always dreaded brushing and have constantly struggled with tangles.. The brushes are the best invention! Can I give these six stars instead?</li>
            <li> does the great job..i love it</li>
            <li> Great brush love them!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hair brush, it even works well on wet hair. perfect size and comfort.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it has the little mini that I can take along in my purse. I would totally recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Love the brushes.  They really help with tangeled hair.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think this would work on my massive bird nest I call hair but somehow these brushes work in detangling without ripping out good hair. I&#x27;m noticing less hair in the brush after I use it and because of less healthy strands being pulled out my hair is getting more length.</li>
            <li> I  bought this thinking it was a wet brush.  It worked great for a while but less than a year later and the tops of the bustles have fallen off. .</li>
            <li> These brushes are very easy to use on both wet and dry hair. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great quality, didn&#x27;t rip hair like normal brushes with this type of stems do. Usually I have a big chunk of hair to pull out of my brush but I only had a little bit with this brush. would definitely recommend to any female with any type hair!</li>
            <li> Perfect 4 my princess hair</li>
            <li> These brushes are great quality unlike other detangling brushes I have bought before.  I like that I got two so I can throw one in my purse.  Excellent value!</li>
            <li> My daughter is so tender headed. But I can honestly say that she doesn&#x27;t pull away or whine when I use these brushes. They cause little to no hair loss as well as zero frizz. I&#x27;m very very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> Good hairbrushes - the small one is already in my purse for hair emergencies</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the product!! It os fantastic. . . . Love how light weight it is and how easily it works through your hair.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great for my thick, curly hair and also on my tender headed 3 yr old. Nice, soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Love this! Great brush and great feel. The little one is perfect for my glovebox.</li>
            <li> Great product.  We had such issues with brushing her hair.  She is now brushing constantly!  She loves the mini one.</li>
            <li> Works great! She is happy to get her hair brushed now! I use the smaller brush on my youngest she loves it too!</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush, great for my childrens hair. Doesnt pull badly at knots or anything. Good deal!</li>
            <li> This NO TANGLE hair brush is great on my very long CURLY hair. I love is and I use the mini brush on my young boys which have surfer style hair and they enjoy it as well. I was very surprised and pleased that this brush does just what it says it does! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My brushes arrived today and I absolutely love them! More importantly, my daughters (age 3 and 5) love them : ) Getting them to brush their hair is always a struggle because they say it hurts. Well, not anymore! The Beauty Junkees brush glides right through the knots- wet or dry! I also loved the fact that this set came with 2 brushes. Each girl gets to have their very own brush. No more fighting over who gets it first. The mini brush is the perfect size for my 3 yr old. I plan to keep it in my purse to have it handy on the go since her hair manages to get snarled just from resting her head against the car seat.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and daughter love these brushes.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush set.  My young daughter prefers the bigger brush.  Really does detangle tough knots if given a bit of time and a detangler solution.  For normal slightly tangled hair just having wet/damp hair is good enough.  I did not find it as effective when hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter still won&#x27;t let us brush her hair but at least now she brushes her own hair and it looks good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight I borrowed it from my daughter to untangle an enormous knot in my own hair - the knot was the size of an egg!  It took 20 minutes but the brush did the trick.  Highly recommend if you&#x27;re finding tangles a regular part of your life.</li>
            <li> works great on taking knot out</li>
            <li> Had I posted this review when we originally purchased this brush 6 months ago, I would have given it 5 stars.  Unfortunately, now almost all of the round pieces on the end of the bristles are missing.  It did a great job detangling, it is just not a durable product.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Quick service and wonderful brushes!  Gets rid of the tangles without tears.  My 3- year old loved the &amp;#34;Frozen&amp;#34; color of the small brush.</li>
            <li> The brush works like any other brush. It has a strong chemical smell that has not yet gone away.</li>
            <li> I abosultely love these! Def recommend. My daughter and I have crazy curly hair and she always screams when I brush her hair but I&#x27;ve used this and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife as a stocking stuffer. She loves it. Combs out her bed head and is soft on her scalp.  She gave the small one to my daughter in law for our infant granddaughter and it is great. Pat myself on the back for searching &amp;#34;best stocking stuffers for wife&amp;#34; on Amazon.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super awesome. My daughters hair gets tangled with these brushes i can untangle her hair easily.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush set, great quality and customer service.</li>
            <li> Best brushes EVER!!! I have very thick long hair, and every brush I tried previously,(including combs) would cause my hair to snap, they would get stuck,  and they were PAINFUL! This brush is amazing, it easily works out knots in my hair, and doesn&#x27;t damage wet hair when brushing. And its PAIN-FREE!!</li>
            <li> My girls love these. It works as it said it would.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised</li>
            <li> These look like an everyday ordinary brush. But they work so much better! They glide right through your hair so easily. I use the smaller one for my 1 year old daughter and she does not cry anymore when I brush her hair.</li>
            <li> Item was exactky as described! Shipped on time ! Excellent!! Would definitely recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes! Worked really well for my hair!</li>
            <li> These are a great brushes.  Doesn&#x27;t completely make brushing long hair painless, but so much better than a paddle or round brush.</li>
            <li> Great brush!  Has helped eliminated some of the screams and tears from my 5 year old at hair brushing time.</li>
            <li> This is going to be my new favorite detangling brush.  I&#x27;ve got one for my bedroom and a mini one for traveling.  Wonderful!</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes for anyone!</li>
            <li> Work fabulously!!! Arrived fast as well.</li>
            <li> I have always had to fight with my daughter to brush her hair. Always complained of the knots. I have not had her once come to me that they hurt and couldn&#x27;t brush her hair. Fantastic. And the small brush is great when we go away on the weekend. Fantastic brushes. Glad I tried them.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery! I ordered these 2 brushes for my 3 year old daughter who has been crying when I brush her hair. Decided to get this set as it has 2 brushes - 1 big and 1 small. Since using the brushes she no longer complains (as much) about brushing her haire. Will order again!</li>
            <li> My little one LOVES these.. So easy for her to get through her long curly hair.  She keeps one by her bed.. And one downstairs.  Great purchase!!</li>
            <li> I thought the brushes worked good.  I still use a spray but it helps really get through the bad spots alot easier. i have very long, fine hair so my hair gets in knots very easily so I carry the small one around with me in my car.</li>
            <li> I love this new brush set! I keep the bigger one at home in my drawer and the smaller one in my purse for travel. It really glides through my long hair easily. I feel like it is more effective at removing tangles than my old brush. And having the smaller one is great for when I need to brush on the go! I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> So glad I got these brushes because I have a hard time removing tangles from my long hair. These brushes work great! I use the pink brush daily and the green brush is for when I travel.</li>
            <li> My wife uses the brushes and she absolutely loves them.&lt;br /&gt;There was a minute issue with the original large brush but after telephone contact with the vendor the brush was instantly replaced without any hassle. This indeed is excellent customer service and I won&#x27;t hesitate one second to recommend this vendor - and the product is great too!</li>
            <li> I received these brushes quickly and for a great price through Beauty Junkees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mini one makes a great on-the-go brush for my purse and the bigger pink one works great.  I have super long hair and coming straight from the shower to the blow-drying and using this brush made everything run smoother. The small brush works great for when I am out or at work and need to freshen up. Who likes hauling around a big brush in their purse,?? I don&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use with a hair dryer!! I didn&#x27;t read the instructions since I usually don&#x27;t with items like this, lol.  It&#x27;s not made to be use with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This brush is really good. I was so happy to see it came with a mini one.  Its great thanks</li>
            <li> This is a great brush set. The small brush is small enough to fit in my purse. It&#x27;s gentle and the bristles don&#x27;t hurt my scalp.</li>
            <li> I would give this brush set 5 stars. The only complaint I have about it is its strong smell. That said, I am not bothered by it unless I put it right in front of my nose anymore. The smell seems to have dissipated somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few different detangling brushes; the knot genie, the Goody version of the knot genie and now this. My daughter REALLY prefers this one and she doesn&#x27;t complain nearly as much about having her hair brushed. We both use the brushes. I have longer thinner hair than my daughter but its fine and wavy so it tangles easily. This brush glides right through after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use them on dry hair as well and its still much easier than a regular pin brush to get it through hair without pulling.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of difference between this brush and a regular hairbrush, although the bristles are thinner and more flexible. I have fine hair and didn&#x27;t like it, because it made my hair static-y and harder to brush. My teen daughter, though, has long thick hair and loved the brush. She had an easier time brushing her hair and said it made her hair softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My four year old claimed the smaller brush. She had mixed reviews. But she&#x27;s 4 - she has mixed reveiws about everything.</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect, they are the best brushes I have ever tried. I have very long, very thick hair that tangles easily when I wear it down. Other brushes would rip through my hair and cause breakage no matter how gentle I tried to be with them. This brush is a dream to use. The flexible bristles work into the tangles and help pull them out without any pain and minimal hair breakage. The brush is also great to use on wet hair after a shower, or swim. It detangles wet hair easily and doesn&#x27;t pull or damage like every other brush I&#x27;ve tried. The small brush is great for travel or just throwing in your purse when you&#x27;re on the go. I love the vibrant colors too. All around great product that I have already recommended to my friends!</li>
            <li> These brushes worked very well on my thick, wavy hair. The best brushes I have ever used on my hair that tangles so easily.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had these brushes for a while now, at least a year. They&#x27;ve been used regularly and the green brush is still in perfect condition. The pink brush is starting to show wear and the tips have begun to wear off. The fact that it took over a year of being shoved in bags, toted every where, and being the only brush for an entire family of four for it to wear is admirable to me. It is also a fantastic wet brush. I have fine, thin hair and this is one of the only brushes I&#x27;ve found, that don&#x27;t cost and arm and a leg, that I can safely brush my hair wet with. I would buy this brush again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love these brushes!  They are perfect for wet or dry hair for detangling.  My boyfriend, who has hair down to his bottom, LOVES these brushes (hates that the bigger one is pink though!).</li>
            <li> No more pulling my hair out over tangles!! These are great brushes for very fine hair. In my experience, brushing  out tangles is easier if my hair is wet or at least damp. The small brush is perfect  for my purse! Very friendly and personable seller is an added bonus!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has a hard time letting me brush her hair but since we have had these she has not complained once :) Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have two little girls and somehow can never find a brush.  I bought two sets and put their names on them.  The two different sizes work great for them to use easily and the feel is really nice.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome hair brush!!!!! I would totally get another one if I could.Get this brush you will like it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product when I ordered it because I have super thick hair that is unruly. These brushes work great. It glides through my hair with no problem and if it does hit a snag, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as a normal bristled brush does. I keep the mini one in the car for quick touch-ups on the go and to brush my daughters hair after a day out n about! Everyone in the family uses these brushes, well, except my husband, he shaves his head. So glad I decided to order these!</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much because how many times have you made a purchase in hopes it would be amazing to only be utterly disappointed. Let me tell you this brush WORKS!! Additionally, the customer service was great prior to receiving the brush I got a full email tutorial that detailed the best process for wet and dry hair. Super impressed and will definitely purchase from this vendor again:D</li>
            <li> These brushes are FANTASTIC. The small one is perfect for the car or your purse. The bristles are super soft and flexible, works well even on wet hair! &amp;#60;3 So glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this brush for our daughter and herself, this is what she said: &amp;#34;The small brush is great for my toddler, and we tried with both wet and dry hair. She didn&#x27;t cringe when I combed through her hair while it was wet so that was a plus! The bigger brush had the bristles closer together and the nubs on each one were a little sharper than my regular paddle brush. I have long, coarse hair and it worked fine with my hair. My only complaint, and it&#x27;s minor- that the bigger brush&#x27;s bristles were not centered on the brush-- it&#x27;s not really a product defect but more of quality control. There&#x27;s a big gap on the top of my brush because the bristles are positioned off to the side.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My teen daughter with thick straight hair said she really like the brush.  My other 4 year old daughter didn&#x27;t complain when I brushed her hair today, that&#x27;s success in my book!  I liked how soft it felt on my head.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing on my 3 year olds hair. She has beautiful long hair but it tangles very easily. After bath time, we no longer have a screaming child who hates brushing her hair. She usually brings her brush and sits on my lap or on the floor in front of me and lets me brush it smooth. It has greatly improved our bath and bed routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 4 year old also loves this brush. She has shorter hair, but she can brush out the tangles herself.</li>
            <li> Great brush for wet hair and getting tangles out.</li>
            <li> To be fair most of the good reviews were given by people with thick curly hair and I bought these for my daughter with long straight fine hair, should have known better.  It has been months and they still smell awful.. a really harsh chemical paint type smell...hard to use because of the smell.  The smaller brush works better on her hair but not great.  I bought these to replace similar ones we had that had worn out but they are not working so we will have to get something else.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter (8) years old loves it she can detangle her hair herself. My decision to buy was based on the rating.</li>
            <li> I love how it made getting my hair untangled faster than normal. It makes it feel softer than before and I love it.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased one of their makeup brushes which lead me to this brand.  I love the makeup brush, but had a slight smell when opened but was gone once washed.  Same smell with this brush, but customer service has said they are working diligently  to correct the smell.  Only reason I gave them 4 starts instead of 5 was because of smell, otherwise this brush is amazing.  I have really long thick hair and everytime I brush it hurts, hair falls out.  This brush was so easy to use it glide right through my thick coarse hair.  It untangled in minutes.  The best part was the little to non of my hair that fell out!</li>
            <li> This brush is almost identical to the wet brush. Works great to detangle hair without snagging. Great for people with sensitive heads and tangly hair!</li>
            <li> This brush works very well on wet hair, which is what I needed.  I&#x27;m actually surprised it brushes through my wet hair and gets the tangles out amazingly!  Also on dry hair, after being windblown and horribly tangled, it worked awesome, too!  I have replaced my old brush with this one and use it daily now!</li>
            <li> Very nice set!!! I got them for my 3 year old grand niece that has very curly hair. Works great, and she has the smaller brush to herself :-)</li>
            <li> By far the best and I mean BEST brush I ever owned!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these brushes!!!  I have never had a brush that got tangles out so well without pulling my hair.  I have had long hair my whole life and struggle to find the perfect brush.  I got these brushes on a deal for super cheap and didn&#x27;t have high expectations.  I was wrong, they are awesome.  In addition to getting the knots out and not hurting, they also leave my hair soft, silky and shiny!  They work great on my toddlers long hair too!!  Definitely will purchase these in the future when I need to replace mine.</li>
            <li> These Brushes Are Awesome! They make detangling my daughters hair effortless! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have two girls with long, thick hair that gets pretty tangled throughout the day and even after washing. These brushes really do detangle without pulling or damaging the hair. I have seen them before and thought they were mainly for curly hair but am so glad I tried them. They work super on straight hair. Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Great brush for de-tangling hair.  Worth its weight in gold.  Will be sure to buy again when we need a new brush.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my 10 year old daughter who has thick, curly hair.  She loves them!  Brushing with no pain is awesome!</li>
            <li> my family absolutely LOVES these brushes. they work so well for removing tangles. this is the only brush my daughter will let me use for her hair anymore.</li>
            <li> I love this brush set I was skeptical about it at first because I have super thick hair but it works better than any &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; bristled brush I have used and it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about these little brushes, but my hair loves them! They never snag, the small one is purse-sized and no static whatsoever. Good deal.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome! Mine keeps disappearing because my daughter keeps taking it. :) Works great on normal hair to thick hair, but doesn&#x27;t seem to cut it on my youngest daughters SUPER THICK hair.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Doesn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my granddaughter - one for her and one for her doll. It was a big hit! Both doll and girl have long hair that tends to tangle and the bristles on these brushes are far enough apart that they do the job well.</li>
            <li> The brushes are for my granddaughter who is 11 and just learning to comb her hair. She loves these brushes and was so excited to receive them. I was unaware that she had wanted them .  Thanks for the advice that came in the email I did print the email for her to keep.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am really impressed with this hair brush. I was willing to try anything for my 3 year old daughter who has long hair and hates me brushing it. It was always a battle to get the tangles out but this doesn&#x27;t bother her a bit!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never heard of these brushes until a couple minutes before I ordered them. A friend had shared an Amazon special on FB and it was so good, I could resist. I ordered, then shared the details of the specials. Right away one of my girlfriends chimed in that they buy the same brushes for their daughter. Having someone I know recommend them made me feel better about my impulse buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered on Friday and USPS delivered on SUNDAY! Yes, prime has stepped up it&#x27;s game!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened immediately and brushed my toddlers bed head (how DOES that happen?!) with the smaller brush (which she has since claimed for herself). Later I tried the larger brush for myself. Both work well. They look very simple and had less bristles than I expected but that&#x27;s probably the secret to less tangles! Regardless, they&#x27;re great and I&#x27;m a fan. I also liked that Beauty Junkies was very communicative through the whole order process and even followed up after. Not many Amazon merchants do that anymore. Thanks, Beauty Junkies!</li>
            <li> I have naturally super curly hair that tangles very easily. I have never had a hair brush that could detangle my hair without causing breakage. I am going to get more brushes to send them out to my friends. What an amazing product!!!!</li>
            <li> Brush works as described, really nice that is comes with a travel size as well. My daughter can use it without tangling her hair.</li>
            <li> After trying the Kabuki brushes from Beauty Junkees, I was excited to try these brushes. I have thick, course hair which doesn&#x27;t tangle too awful much, but it will occasionally get twisted in knots (especially when I work out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried when I opened up the packaging. The brushes came in a box and both the packaging and the product looked kind of cheap. Upon opening the box, I was met with a TERRIBLE chemical/plastic smell. I&#x27;ve had them for about a week now and the smell has gone away a little bit, but they&#x27;re still kind of stinky even after having washed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as a brush goes, I&#x27;m not really all that impressed with them. They work ok if my hair is wet, but when it&#x27;s dry, it seems like the bristles just bend instead of brushing through my hair. I especially notice it if I&#x27;m trying to brush in an upward motion (i.e. to pull hair up into a ponytail) or if I need to brush through a knot (which is what they&#x27;re supposed to be designed for). I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the heads of the bristles falling off like other reviews have mentioned, but again, I&#x27;ve only had if for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just got a lemon, but I don&#x27;t think that these will replace my current brush. I can&#x27;t say that I would recommend them to a friend and I definitely couldn&#x27;t justify paying full price for them.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be great for my grandchild, but discarded it instead.  It&#x27;s strong smell of rubber made me concerned about using it on anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Works great my daughter has extremely thick hair this worked out great to work out all her tangles.</li>
            <li> My nieces loved these brushes. Perfect that they came in different sizes, so each one could have their own brush.  The youngest one immediately took the smaller one and started brushing her hair. Overall they liked it, as for removing tangles easily, took some time, but it didnt pull their hair, just had to brush over it a few times to get the tangles out. I think if we used a detangler spray the tangles would have come out easier and faster.</li>
            <li> These smell awful. I am afraid to use them on my hair... I certainly don&#x27;t want my hair to smell like these brushes. They seem ok, but the smell is just too much. I guess they will be going in the trash.</li>
            <li> i seen this on facebook and they were offering it for a dollar the price on it was 14.97 but i got the coupon code and got it for a dollar! wasn&#x27;t really sure if it works like they said but heck it was a dollar..lol!!.. well i do give them credit I dont know how but these brushes really do work! we all know how hard it is to brush wind blown hair without a little pull here and there..well I used it yesterday and no joke..it did not pull my hair at all! I would pay the regular price for these if i had too! they really are worth it..these are the kinds of brushes every girl should have..so totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hair brush,perfect size and comfort.So easy to brush my hair after I&#x27;ve washed it.I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughter for when she gets out of the bath/shower. She usually runs and fights with me to brush her hair but with this brush it really runs right through her hair with no pulling or tugging. Brushing wet hair is now so easy!! Plus the colors are fun!!</li>
            <li> I have a 4 year old boy with long straight hair but with all the jumping and running around, it gets very tangled. This brush did the trick and I am able to brush his hair quickly without too much fuss. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful brush set that works great on both wet and dry hair. I have long hair that easily gets tangled, with these brushes it was no issue. I can&#x27;t wait to try it out on my 3 year old niece who always complains that it hurts when i brush her hair, this should be smooth brushing from now on. Plus the small brush fits great in my purse.</li>
            <li> The absolute perfect brush for the road or at home.  These 2 brushes are absolutely fantastic that there are not enough good words in the world to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a must own for any style hair you have, I am a man and absolutely love it.  I use the smaller brush because of the color and my girlfriend uses the larger pink one.  She also loves these brushes and is her new favorite brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It easily removes any knots you have in your hair and does a great job styling if you use a brush to style your hair.  You are a fool if you dont buy these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to thank beauty junkees for allowing me to test these awesome brushes at a reduced price!</li>
            <li> I have never used a detangling brush before and now I am wondering why and how I suffered so long without one...works great..and I love the mini one to take with me in the car... One thing I didn&#x27;t undersand it says on the package not to use with the hair dryer..not sure why that is..is it b/c it would get damaged from the heat???  Maybe someone can comment for me..thanks</li>
            <li> DISCLAIMER: I received a product discount for this review.  This is a great offer! Two brushes for the price of one. I will be keeping one in my purse, and other within easy reach. The handles, on both are comfortable, and they really do untangle my hair, with causing pain. I have mid-length curly hair, that tends to get tangled in the back. A couple of passes and my hair is gently untangled. The brushes, I tried both, left my curls intact, which I really liked. A lot of brushes tend to smooth out the curls, resulting in me having to rewet my hair.  I really like these brushes, and recommend them to anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> Kept the larger brush for myself and my preschooler kept the little one. She is able to brush her own hair with ease!</li>
            <li> My daughters both have fine hair that tangles easily. these brushes work wondefully for them! They love the bright colors, too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to go shopping so having it come to my door on time is so helpful. I tried this brush and it is the best brush ever. I was amazed at the care the people took to put in directions and helpful hints. I appreciate this company and will definately order from them again and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> This brush does an excellent job of de tangling  my fine hair.  I would highly recommend this brush.  The small green brush is the perfect size for traveling.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush at a good price. The brush does do what it says, it detangles your hair with ease, even! My hair is colored and it has highlights also, and even after a good conditioner it has knots in it. I used the brush this morning, and it glided right through the knots. My hair is medium length and I have a lot of it, I did not have to section it into pieces, I just brushed it. One thing that I didn&#x27;t read, although it is clearly stated, is that you can not use this brush with a hair dryer, that was a disappointment. Overall, I do really like the brush, and will keep it and use another brush while blowdrying. The added mini brush was a bonus, great for your purse!</li>
            <li> Very happy with our purchase of this brush set. VERY fast shipping which I am very thankful for that especially around the holidays. My daughters hair gets tangled so easy and she used to get so frustrated using other brushes. It works GREAT! I am a hair dresser and find this brush so helpful brushing out my clients hair. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This brush goes through my hair (shoulder length) with ease both wet and dry. It doesn&#x27;t run so smoothly through my young daughter&#x27;s hair (very long) when it&#x27;s dry but works great when it is wet.</li>
            <li> I have waist length color treated hair, and this goes through like a breeze. Little one for my purse, big for at home. Happy with these.</li>
            <li> I really love that these brushes come with 2 sizes because i can stick one in my purse!! They&#x27;ve been a big help for the windy days!!&lt;br /&gt;And they don&#x27;t seem to damage my hair. I normally only use a wide tooth comb because i&#x27;m afraid of doing more damage to my hair, but these brushes have made it into my hair care routine!</li>
            <li> These brushes were great. The big one worked well for brushing through wet hair, detangling easily without getting stuck and pulling like most brushes. I also loved that it came with a mini brush, which was a perfect size for my 3 year old. She normally hates having her hair brushed because it can hurt, but she says this one doesn&#x27;t hurt. Even without a kid, you could use the mini brush in your purse!</li>
            <li> I use these brushes for my daughter&#x27;s hair. It tends to get tangled very easily, especially the hair in the back, underneath. She usually screams and cries and sometimes runs away from me when I brush through her hair after her shower/bath. However, I&#x27;ve found these brushes do a great job (especially the bigger one) for detangling her hair after washing. The smaller one works great to keep in my purse for touchups. Overall, a great product and I&#x27;d recommend to any mom who is tired of her child screaming when trying to brush their hair!</li>
            <li> This Hair Brush truly works....Thanks my Grands love it . Will be purchasing more for my friends&lt;br /&gt;and I will be sharing the news about this brush</li>
            <li> I have 2 girls with medium to long hair and we always used to have problems doing their hair because hair combing or brushing was painful,  With these detangling brushes our problem has gone away... They do occasionally complain, but it is not as much.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Like the set a lot, but doesn&#x27;t get out bad tangles, the bristles just bend.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves to have her hair brushed with these brushes. If used correctly they detangle the hair pain free whether hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great detanglers.  I have a daughter with naturally curly hair that tangles horribly.  She HATES having her hair brushed....it&#x27;s usually a battle and takes forever to get all the tangles out.  This brush is AMAZING.  We tried it out this morning...It literally glides right through her hair....no pulling or fighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when I took them out of the package they had a bit of a smell (I&#x27;m assuming from the rubbery feeling coating on the handles...) but I let them air out on the counter top and they were fine when I went back a couple hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only thing I don&#x27;t LOVE about the brushes is that the bristles are a little bit scratchy (this is why it got 4 stars instead of 5) it doesn&#x27;t bother me but my daughter is pretty tender headed.....just use  a light hand and move carefully on sensitive heads and it&#x27;s not big deal.  Even my daughter (who HATES having her hair brushed) was impressed with the brush....so it&#x27;s definitely worth the cost in my book</li>
            <li> These are good brushes for the price. I have tried many de-tangling hairbrushes, and while these aren&#x27;t the best or the most gentle (the bristles are a little stiff and unyielding), they are definitely a good option for the price. The small brush is perfect for keeping in a purse. Also, I find that the larger brush works better on wet hair than dry.</li>
            <li> love it, gentle, easy, helpful for 6 yr old, she can brush her own thick hair. 2 sizes are great.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. And it doesn&#x27;t pull on knots!</li>
            <li> Love having extra brushes and these work perfect. The smaller brush is perfect to put in my purse. Live these brushes</li>
            <li> Great product! Works for my thick long hair where most brushes get stuck. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have two young girls with long hair and have long hair myself. All of us have between wavy and curly hair and these brushes work great! The bristles are thin so they seem to get through tangles easier. My oldest has a sensitive head and she complains less when I use these brushes instead of our regular ones. The handles are easy to grip and the material on the handles is comfortable to hold. The smaller one works as a nice size travel brush for the car or for my daughter&#x27;s backpack.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for my niece who is mixed and has thick curly hair.  This brush works like it says; detangles without ripping the hair out. Now doing her hair is much easier and its better on her hair.  I would recommend this on all hair types.  This is the second product I have purchased through this company and again completely satisfied.  Their products are just as described.</li>
            <li> Put this in my wife&#x27;s stocking for Christmas, she loves it! She used to tear her hair out while brushing after a shower, but this brush made it a much smoother process. The company sent me an email after it arrived explaining the best way to use it. Seems like they have a great customer service and they stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;No tangle&#x27; hair brush effectively removes tangles out of even the most unruly long hair.  We purchased brush set in a promotion&lt;br /&gt;for personal use, honest evaluation and review.  Both brushes smooth my hair easily and quickly.  Happy to have gotten a small&lt;br /&gt;version for travel, as well.  My hair is especially long, and tangles quickly.  This brush set does a great job and are well worth the&lt;br /&gt;current advertised sale price.</li>
            <li> Compared to my other detangling brush, this set is by far a lot better. I love how there&#x27;s a handle with the brush allowing me to easily comb out my long hair (goes to the middle of my back).  My old detangling brush doesn&#x27;t have a handle (it&#x27;s curved to fit the palm of your hand) which makes brushing long hair rather difficult.  I love how I&#x27;m able to brush through my hair without tugging at my tangles.</li>
            <li> This brush glided effortlessly through my hair. However, it seemed like there was a ton of hair left in the bristles after each brushing.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with these brushes! My 5yo daughter gets the worse tangles possible in the back of her curly hair. I bought an expensive detangling brush from a popular beauty product store that I was using before. While it worked well, if there were serious tangles it would still pull and cause my daughter to yell saying it hurts. This brush set is the first we have EVER used where that wasn&#x27;t a problem. They brush through so nicely and do a really great job at getting the tangles out without pulling/getting stuck. The quality of the brushes are also good. I would recommend these brushes to anyone, but especially to those with a sensitive head of tangled hair!</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I have very long hair and these brushes do their job and smooth our tangly hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 7 year old who hates tangles and brushing her hair.  She has used them everyday without a complaint.  Love them!!</li>
            <li> Great brushes to work through thick tangle hair without pulling or hurting. love the combo as the small brush fits into my purse - to use when out and about</li>
            <li> This brush helps detangle my hair and really works! I use it daily. I have coarse and wavy hair, my hair has not looked better.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was skeptical when I saw this brush. The bristles seemed cheap and thin, and it looked like a normal brush- I didn&#x27;t think it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I have three daughters who all scream and cry every time I brush their hair, so I needed to try something. I am so glad I did! I do not understand the magical powers of this brush and how it works, but somehow it really does easily comb through hair without pulling the hair- whether the hair is wet or dry. There is no more crying, and brushing hair is no longer a burden! These brushes are worth every penny, I will be buying more for sure!!!</li>
            <li> My husband, myself and my step daughter all have long thick hair.  It was a fight to get his untangled, to get her to not cry and me not to rip my hair out in general.  This brush makes it super easy to untangle and makes my mornings so much more less stressful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a household of people with long mane&#x27;s, I recommend this product totally!</li>
            <li> I really like this brush! I have thick, curly, very difficult hair and this did a great job of removing all my tangles without pulling out or breaking lots of my hair. I haven&#x27;t used the small one yet, but if it works as well as the full-size I know I&#x27;ll love it. I will warn against storing it in a way in which it&#x27;ll be pressed against things. The bristles take a day or two to return to their original position if you do.</li>
            <li> My daughter wants long hair, but would not brush.  She got these brushes and now brushes without any complaints.  Her comment was this really works!</li>
            <li> I love this brush for several reasons...first it works wonders on kids hair (and attitudes). The small brush is the perfect size for kids to hold and a perfect size to travel with. Secondly, it&#x27;s so easy to use and having 2 is the best, I can just leave it in the shower and not have to go searching for it when I need to use it on the kids or myself. Awesome brush!</li>
            <li> Beauty Junkees never disappoint me!  I have makeup brushes from the same company that I absolutely love.  I have paid big bucks for no tangle hair brushes in the past.  They work so its worth it.  However, I received a chance to try the no tangle brushes from Beauty Junkees at a reduced price.  Guess What?  They work just as great as the high dollar brushes!  I love to have tons of these so I can keep one in the car, at the office, and in just about every room in the house (that way I can always find one...LOL)!  If you&#x27;re looking for great beauty products on a budget, give Beauty Junkees a try and you wont be disappointed.  I recommend this brush to anyone!  You can&#x27;t beat it, no matter how much you spend on a brush!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:ecd911eac4f83a0ed32c825a32759e4]] Absolutely love this No Tangle Hair Brushes Set. I feel that these brushes are a great quality. They are durable, strong and well made.&lt;br /&gt;I like to know that an item is durable. I did my video on that. How durable and how they look up close. The brushes have soft flexible bristles which is really nice. 2 sizes great for at home and travel.  The wide spread of the bristles makes for less tangles and the bristles being as soft as they are won&#x27;t hurt your head when pressing down on scalp. The texture of the brushes gives a firm grip so they won&#x27;t slip out of your hand.&lt;br /&gt;The little one my grand daughter can easily carry in her backpack to school.&lt;br /&gt;This brush set  makes a great gift for bride on wedding day, teenager for birthday present.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> The hair brushes are gentle on hair.  I purchased the set for my 2 year old daughter - who hates to have the knots brushed out of her hair - and myself.  I am using the big one and she is using the small one.  My daughter puts up much less of a fuss when I use this brush.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the brushes have a strong plastic/chemical smell which hasn&#x27;t dissipated much even after being in the open for a few weeks (the odor is much more noticeable on the larger brush).  Colors of brushes were received as shown.</li>
            <li> Love love love these brushes. Got rid of my old ones the day these arrived. Keep one in my bag to take everywhere. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Amazing! This brush is lightweight but still sturdy. My hair is thick, wavey, and prone to tangling. I&#x27;m also very tender headed and I&#x27;ve  broken my fair share of brushes while trying to tame my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This brush glides through my hair with great ease. I&#x27;ve used it on wet and dry hair... It even did great when I put it to the ultimate test (wet hair with no leave in conditioner or detangler).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m seeing far less breakage as well. My hairbrushes are usually full of strands that have been pulled out. After 4 days of use I still haven&#x27;t needed to de-hair it.</li>
            <li> Very practical set of brushes.  I love the colors and they work very well on my hair, wet, damp or dry.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair and this brush does a good job getting through it all. The brushes are light weight, which I really like. Will definitely keep one of the brushes in my pool bag this summer. Major issue for me, the strong rubber smell. It&#x27;s been days, and the smell has only subsided a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical when something claims to be the BEST. But I have to admit that these brushes really do work. I have thin hair that gets tangled easily and the brushes untangled my hair easily. I&#x27;ve used them right after I get out of the shower, after styling my hair, and at the end of the day (when I haven&#x27;t brushed my hair for hours.) I&#x27;ve even used them on my son&#x27;s hair. He is African-American and I have only used boar-hair brushes in the past. So I was pleasantly surprised when these brushes worked on his hair as well. (He has short curly, not kinky hair.)</li>
            <li> My daughter (a super super sensitive red head) loves these brushes!! These are the only brushes she uses and loves that she can carry the small one in her backpack.</li>
            <li> price not bad for two and no more tangle means that.</li>
            <li> These are also great for thin hair and shorter hair. Mine is shoulder length and these work great! Also, since you get 2, you have a smaller one for travel.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they are well made  i keep the small one in my purse  saves on space  and the larger one I uses all the time now  i go through brushes alot and this one is holding up</li>
            <li> Fantastic product from a fantastic company!! Great quality &amp; results. Could not be more pleased with this purchase and I&#x27;m looking forward to buying more. HIGHLY RECOMMEDED</li>
            <li> I do believe this is the brush for you to try. It&#x27;s a regular brush, but the bristles are thin and soft and flexible. I started low and worked up, and tho it pulled, it didn&#x27;t hurt, and it worked.&lt;br /&gt;it really did get the rat&#x27;s nest out. They shipped it fast, too. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful at first, but this is a very good hairbrush for long, thick hair -- wet or dry!</li>
            <li> I needed a new hair brush that would work well for thick curly hair and this worked well for both myself and my daughter.</li>
            <li> The pink one is a great brush, the smaller green one isn&#x27;t as good, which is odd.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works well on my daughter&#x27;s hair. She&#x27;s a little sensitive to the &amp;#34;new smell&amp;#34; of the brush but I have zero problems with it. :) It detangles much better than the brush we were using and she doesn&#x27;t complain a bit. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The brushes work amazingly even on the most stubborn of tangly hair!  My daughter loved the ease of how it glided through her tangled hair!  It cuts through tangles like a hot knife through butter!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Cute brushes. Not as expected. Looks and works just like my wig brush. They are however for my Granddaughter and she likes them. She&#x27;s 10. She said she can use the smaller brush for her dolls. Also she can put it in her Mom&#x27;s purse when they go out.</li>
            <li> The brush is just what I had asked for for Christmas and the addition of the small brush is an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated March 19, 2014: Thought this was a good brush, but I have only had for 2 1/2 months and more than 40 tips from the bristles have fallen off.  I bought this brush to replace my old brush that the bristles were coming off from, but I had that brush for more than 5 years.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works well to get out the tangles. Love the little brush to put in my purse. The handle is easy to grip. the colors are really attractive.  :)</li>
            <li> Good Brush, but smells terrible.  Almost knocked me over when opened package. It is better now, but can&#x27;t be good for you to inhale those plastic fumes.</li>
            <li> These type brushes have small little beads of hard plastic at the end of each bristle to prevent them from scratching your scalp. These brushes were missing many of the small beads and the ones that were there were so small that the medal bristles still hurt. I bought these for my children but after trying on myself, there is NO WAY I can use them on my kids sensitive scalps. I didn&#x27;t even want to use to use them. I trashed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was even more disappointing than buying brushed we can&#x27;t use was the relentlessness unsolicited contact from this company after the purchase. I have received emails weekly from them as well as several phone calls to my personal cell phone. I will never buy from a company who feels the need to contact me repeatedly afterwards. It&#x27;s board-line harassment at this point as I&#x27;ve asked NOT to be contacted again.</li>
            <li> Purchase to use on my child. Works likes a dream! I won&#x27;t use any other brush ! The mini is also wonderful to keep in your purse or child&#x27;s diaper bag for on the go use. We have used it everyday since !</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter used to complain about tangles all the time. It was almost a nightmare at 07:00am preparing her before the school bus. The brush seems to solve our problems. I do not hear screams any more, while her mother is combing her hair.</li>
            <li> Works very well on both wet and dry hair. No more screaming while my kids brush their hair. Gret product</li>
            <li> EXCELENT!1 For me,  and Isabella, the my grand/daughter.  We have long hair!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much hair I was needlessly losing until I got this brush. My hair is very straight, thick, long, fine and tangly. I am able to brush through my hair with ease wet or dry with this brush without ripping it out. It works better on wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out the hard way after taking the small, blue brush with me on a long relay run that it does not work well to get out thick tangles.  Over the course of running 10 miles with my pony tail twisting into a tornado tight knot, I attempted to use the smaller brush to un-wind my unholy mess of a nest at the nape of my neck.  I was in a locker-room full of other women who probably found great humor in my feeble attempts to untangle my hair. Even though my hair was wet and likely full of conditioner still, the brush bristles just floated right over the knot.  I had to switch flipping my hair over, to the side, finger-combing, etc.  Eventually (eventually meaning after at least 2 hours of wrestling with brushing my hair) the knot got to a manageable size that was less noticeable and I just pulled my hair back into the best pony tail I could &#x27;til I got home and could use the bigger brush.  By this time my arms were so weak from this intense wrestling match I&#x27;m surprised I had the strength to put in a new pony tail.  The moral of the story is... pack your bigger brush, especially if your hair is likely to turn into a rat&#x27;s home. I&#x27;m hoping the smaller brush will prove useful for my toddler someday. I still lose a good amount of hair in my brushes since I&#x27;m constantly shedding (don&#x27;t get my husband started on finding my hair all over). But detangling has honestly never been as painless and easy as it is now with this brush. I highly recommend it even if the small brush gave me some grief.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these hair brushes. The large one, I keep in my bathroom, while the small one goes everywhere with me in my purse. They both are made of strong durable plastic, and will definitely last me a very long time. Thumbs Up on this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this essentially because I wanted a small brush for my purse, and I thought for this price, might as well get the pack - a girl can&#x27;t have too many hair brushes laying around, eh?&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by the quality of these brushes. I have long hair, and I had just gotten used to pain when brushing through tangles. These do not hurt at all. Even better, the first time I used one, when I was finished brushing, my hair felt softer! Was definitely and unexpected, wonderful surprise.&lt;br /&gt;While the thought of using a hair brush on wet hair makes my instincts scream against me, I had to try with this. These do work on wet hair. Detangles fairly easily. But, out of habit, I still tend reach for a wide toothed comb after my showers.&lt;br /&gt;These detangle hair quickly and with absolutely minimal pain, and for me, they made my hair softer. What else to ask from a hairbrush?</li>
            <li> The brush completely smooths out my tangled wet hair easily and quickly (I have really long stick straight hair). I like that this package comes with a smaller version for travel. The only not so good thing with the brushes is the chemical smell that comes off of them. It has seemed to calm down a bit since taking them out of the package, but if I put my nose to the brush you can definitely still smell it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be making my hair smell, but I would be a little worried about how it would make my clothes smell after being in a closed suitcase for a while.</li>
            <li> Best Brush ever for tangles my daughter has thick hair wish I had this brush years ago. Love it</li>
            <li> These brushes work great! I gave my granddaughter the pink one and she set about brushing hair that hadn&#x27;t received such treatment in probably a month. And she kept it up, showing off her beautiful hair. I kept the green one and use it regularly. The advice to begin with the bottom 2&amp;#34; of hair is invaluable.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is that makes this brush work but my 3 year old daughter hates having her hair brush full blown fits every time. After buying this brush I only geet he occasional outch. It has been a life saver.</li>
            <li> Works very well on wet, or very damp hair. Makes getting the tangles out of my toddler&#x27;s wavy hair in the mornings less traumatic for both of us. I don&#x27;t like how easily the bristles bend, but I&#x27;ll deal.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and so do my kiddo. Very gentle on the tugging and get the job done. The colors are cool and the spare little brush is great for my purse or the car when we are the go. Plus the price is exceptional for what you get. Wish I had gotten these much sooner. Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> great brushes,, my daughter has very long hair and she just loves these brushes, great for taking out tangles</li>
            <li> Definetly the best brush to detangle hair. I have curly hair that gets knotted really easy and this brush combs out my knots really fast. I only wish they had this brush when I was little. Could&#x27;ve saved my mom and I so many headaches. Lol</li>
            <li> This set works just like it says. It&#x27;s a great detangler. I have curly hair and a bad habit of using rubber bands in my hair. The brushes helps get those tangles out. The larger brush is almost identical to the Drybar Lemon drop brush, but I love the travel size that comes with this set.</li>
            <li> Perfect detangling brush- not too soft, not too stiff.  Handle is rubbery so as not to be slippery, especially when wet.</li>
            <li> Ordered these brushes and they arrived the very next day! Very nice set, the thinner flexible bristles are super gentle on my always tangles thick color treated hair. I would imagine it would be great for younger kids as well, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got a super great deal on these, so honestly I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot.  But they are some of the best brushes I have ever had!</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about getting this brush.  I really didn&#x27;t think that it would work.  I have a 3 year old whose hair is so hard to brush sometimes.  This brush set does the job it says it does.  I have little to no problem at all brushing her hair now.  Great set, and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I want to say first off that my hair is one of those that you see in a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; commercial for humidity prone frizziness/waves/etc. I was excited when I saw these brushes and thought they would make an excellent addition to my beauty regimen and hopefully make taking care of my tangles easier. Unfortunately I did not feel that the brushes worked well with my extremely thick, wavy hair. Even when I used the brushes as recommend (small sections working it until all tangles were gone) it was VERY time consuming and felt very difficult to do. I also used the brushes on my daughter&#x27;s fine but curly hair and it worked better but again only when used on small sections. This is not a replacement for a normal brush, it really only works well as a detangler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the brushes are made nicely, they just weren&#x27;t quite the multifunctional brush that I was hoping they would be, although they work very well when used as directed.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical it would detangle my daughters hair cause nothing works on her hair. However I was impressed it got the tangles out but, I did need to hold on to her hair so it wouldn&#x27;t hurt her. It did its job and very happy!</li>
            <li> I loved these brushes. In the beginning. They do get rid of tangles and are gentle on the hair. And then I noticed that it actually hurt to use them.  Check the bristles out and the little &amp;#34;nubby&amp;#34; things at the end of the bristles are gone! Have to pitch them now. Just bought them in February. Not happy. Need new brushes. Will not buy these again.  Update! This seller is GREAT.  I received a replacement set only to have the same thing happen again. I was received an email letting me know that they went with a new company to produce their brushes, and would send me ANOTHER replacement when they are in stock. I did receive the replacements and so far so good. My only issue is the smell of the brushes. I soaked them in the sink in some shampoo and it seemed to help. Makes me wonder though what they are made of?</li>
            <li> THIS BRUSH SET IS REALLY GREAT! THEY ARE VERY GOOD AT GETTING THROUGH TANGLED UP HAIR WITHOUT DAMAGING OR RIPPING OUT MORE HAIR. THEY GLIDE THROUGH MY HAIR SO EASY AND I LOVE THAT THERE IS A SMALL BRUSH FOR MY PURSE AS WELL. I LOVE RIDING WITH MY WINDOWS DOWN BUT HATE THAT MY HAIR GET SO TANGLED UP AND NOW I DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MY HAIR WHILE I AM ON MY WAY TO PLACES. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> This No Tangle Hair Brush Set is not only great on my fiances very long and straight hair but it&#x27;s also great on my long thick curly hair! These brushes are both very pretty colors. The bristles on these brushes are soft on your scalp yet are strong enough to get those annoying tangles out of your hair. I can&#x27;t tell you how many brushes have gotten stuck in my hair over the years and it&#x27;s definitely not an experience I want to keep going through. With these brushes I no longer have to worry about that because the brushes glide through my hair with very little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this brush set comes with a full size and a mini size so that you can keep one at home and have the mini in your purse,car, or wherever you would like to keep it. These brushes do not rip your hair out like a lot of other brushes. The handles on these brushes are nice and strong so you can hold on to them easily. I would definitely recommend this No Tangle Hair Brush Set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> I love that these brushes come as a set and they both work perfectly at detangling my daughters hair without any pain at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are very pretty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller brush easily fits in my small cosmetic bag very comfortably and even my jeans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the handle and back of the brush are very soft and the grip is very comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both hair brushes do not pull hair at all. I have tried other detangling hair brushes in the past that promise no pulling but they have not worked very well on my daughters hair as she has wavy hair and a lot of the other brushes I have tried only provide a smooth surface but this brush goes deep into the hair and provide an outcome of very nice detangled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these hair brushes and would recommend them to anyone who has little girls with tough tangled hard to manage hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have receive this product at a discounted price in exchange o my honest and unbiased review but all opinions are complete my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are amazing!</li>
            <li> Love these, and they work very well on long wet hair.....</li>
            <li> I like that this pack of no tangle hair brushes comes with a smaller version of itself but has the same Bristle Length.  I thought the colors were very playful, and my 4 year old claimed the smaller brush instantly.  I have a sensitive scalp, and I felt like the brushes bristles were massaging my head.  They are not hard, or too stiff.  I felt like they had give to them, that way getting a knot out felt easy to do instead of getting stuck in my hair.  I also noticed the brushes are covered in like a soft silicone feel that was nice to touch.  I also liked that the smaller brush has a thicker handle, so it was easier to hold when brushing.  I appreciate little details like that.  I received product at discount for my opinion.</li>
            <li> Bought this to have the little one for my toddler, but am now addicted for myself!  Takes the knots out of my hair with such ease.  Seller also takes extra time to provide very helpful tips for use and care.  Highly recommended all around!</li>
            <li> Definitely a lot  easier then the brushes I was using!!! Might get another set just to have!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! I can finally brush my hair without squinching and flinching and ouching. I recommend this product! One for the house, one for the car. As other people have pointed out, there is a distinct burnt rubber smell to the product but since I don&#x27;t have to sleep with it under my nose or sniff it unless I want to, I am going to wait out the outgassing. No problem!</li>
            <li> I got this for my 6 year old granddaughter. Her hair is very tangled and she is &amp;#34;tender headed&amp;#34; and would cry every time I would brush her hair. This brush works great. I use the larger one and gave her the smaller one to use. No more crying!!</li>
            <li> GREAT brushes - my daughter has coarse, wavy hair that is always tangled, and these brushes are the only ones that work.</li>
            <li> Great brushes!  I LOVE that this set came with 2!  1 for my bathroom and 1 for the car.  Sometimes I&#x27;m literally running out the door with a wet head - and now I even have a tool in the car that can deal with it!  Awesome!</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a good de tangling brush for my older daughter,  who had very long, thick hair. I have purchased many brands and most only lasted a couple of weeks, before the tangles would start up again. This brush has been fabulous! No more tears or tangles. The smaller brush was nice for my younger daughter,  who&#x27;s hair is not quite as thick and she loves it. I will be ordering another set. Just wish they had more colors.</li>
            <li> Great brush and great price!</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome.  I came back and bought another set so both kids could have their own and I could have my own set for home and travel.  Your hair looks healthy and smooth after using these, and there is no pain involved.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> We have tried other brushes on my daughter&#x27;s hair and have finally found what works best.  So glad we purchased these as the mini brush is perfect for her and the full size is great for me.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome!!  It has never been easier to brush through my hair!  I&#x27;ve really been trying to baby my hair over the past year, to help heal years of damage, dyes, and split ends.  My hair is the longest its ever been in my life at about 4 inches past my shoulders, and I feel that this brush is crucial to taking extra good care of it!  I wish I had discovered it sooner!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because I have very fine hair that knots very, very easily. For me these brushes were just ok. I liked the fact that it came with a large and smaller brush (I keep the smaller brush in the car for days when I ride with my windows down and my hair gets tangled). The brushes do get tangles out of my hair and make it smoother, but the bristles on the brush are very hard and I find it very uncofortable on my scalp when I brush with them. This is not my go to normal every day brush. I only use it if I have extremely tangled hair.</li>
            <li> Both brushes are great, quality products.  I was worried the small one would be too small, but it was perfect size for my gym bag after swimming!  I use the big one at home and love how soft it is on the scalp and gentle with the tangles.  The colors are fun too.</li>
            <li> the set arrived on time in perfect condition. I can&#x27;t believe how well it works.  My daughters hair is long and wavy. A regular brush makes it frizzy. Her hair was so tangledI thought we would have to cut it off.  This brush went thru her hair easily. Her hair is now soft and silky.  No more hair fights in the am and no more birds nest head. Highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> My girls favorite brush. Seller contacted me in regards to a possible defective brush. I was given a replacement brush and the seller was very kind to do so with out hesitation and a pleasure to work with. The world needs this kind of service and value for it&#x27;s customers. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Great product, In the future I will be ordering from Beauty Junkies, their customer service is top notch!</li>
            <li> Could not get over the chemical smell when I opened the package, thus don&#x27;t really know how it works, but the stench was terrible.</li>
            <li> These work great on my daughters&#x27; hair.  I live that it comes with the mini brush for my purse.  Customer service was great.  They seem to care about their product and making sure the customer is satisfied</li>
            <li> My 8 year old daughter, who has curly hair, loves these. That&#x27;s saying a lot because she previously hated brushing her hair. These brushes have saved us from many arguments to brush her hair!</li>
            <li> At first you may you may think it is a cheap and boring cheap brush.  But this is the best brush I have used and never went back.  Five years ago it was the \\&quot;The Wet Brush\\&quot;.  Everybody in the household loved it and so I had to buy more.  It has thousand of reviews and noticed that it wasn&#x27;t cheap at all.  That&#x27;s when I noticed there are other vendors who sell almost identical brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today we have about 6 of these brushes and the first brush we bought is still being used.  This one from Beauty Junkees is the same brush plus a small one that my 8-yr-old daughter took with her in her bag she uses at school.  It is perfect size for her and still the same comfort as the big ones.  She used to whimper whenever her mom brushes her hair every time she takes a bath.  This brush she announced is the most painless experience.  It is also waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict - still the best brush after all these years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample item was provided for review purposes.</li>
            <li> Not the best detangler, very flimsy.</li>
            <li> Great set, great for my child with longer hair!!!</li>
            <li> Really great brush set! I have long thick hair and before I found this brush it took me twenty minutes to detangle my hair. Now it take five or ten minutes ! The customer service is excellent too!</li>
            <li> Glad these were on sale. I bought them for my 8 year old daughter who has very thick and full and LONG hair. We&#x27;ve tried a few different brushes, and none have helped make brushing any easier. Same goes for these. I had high hopes, but they fell flat. They are good quality and at least they shouldn&#x27;t break or lose their bristles. Even following the instructions...which are basic instructions for how you should always brush your hair no matter which brush you use...there is no difference in ease of detangling.</li>
            <li> This brush is slightly better than a regular brush. Does it miraculously take out a rats nest in your hair, no. Does it have less pull then a regular brush, yes. You will still have hair in your brush if you don&#x27;t brush it correctly. Basically if you slam the brush through your hair you will do damage to your hair regardless of what hair brush you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret to detangling is your conditioner.  If your hair is still in knots after you condition it then depending on the length of your hair, you are in for a long brushing process.  This is what i use on my hair. Once a week I use Biotique Botanicals Bhringraj Hair Growth Therapeutic Oil. Its great for preventing hair loss and hair from going grey.  My everyday shampoo/conditioner I use Clear Damage and Color Repair. Then if my hair is really knappy and I need something heavy duty, I use  Herbal Essences Hydralicious Reconditioning Conditioner and that takes any knots out.  I Brush my hair with the beauty junkies brush in the shower and it glides right through after I condition it.  I usually dont brush my hair when its dry because I have wavy hair and Ill end up with and afro but if I do then I spray some Argan oil in the brush and start from the bottom. You dont want to get oil on the scalp because you will look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend this brush?  Yes but have realistic expectations.  It wont take out dred locks.  The brush also has a weird smell. I think its the rubbery part but it doesn&#x27;t go into my hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered the brush for my 8 year old granddaughter who has many tangles in her hair and refuses to brush her hair.&lt;br /&gt;She tried the brush and loves it and now is brushing her hair and it is tangle free!</li>
            <li> It is a good product but nothing special, just like any other regular hair brush, OK to use for thin hair too.</li>
            <li> My 2 daughters of 4 and 5 years old have long hair. Every morning when I comb for them, it is difficult to detangle their hair. After I read reviews of this pair of comb. I bought it. And it does the work. Love it.</li>
            <li> In my family we have three females, myself included, with long, thick, curly hair!  We often struggle with knots and tangles!  This brush set came very nicely packaged and as soon as I opened it my 10 and 11 year old daughters each claimed one!  I said I wanted to try them first and I was impressed!  Straight from the shower with no hair product at all I was able to easily brush my hair out!  The girls are going to love these and I probably will have to buy another set so they can each have one of each size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I was asked to review these brushes after receiving them for a discounted price from the seller! My package arrived quickly and I had no problems whatsoever with my transaction!  Thank you, Beauty Junkees!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: There is a slight rubbery smell to the brushes that will surely dissipate with time, so if you are sensitive to that, just be aware.</li>
            <li> My hair is not in the best condition and I&#x27;m always afraid of it breaking off when I brush it after showering. I&#x27;ve been looking for a no tangle brush to avoid an distess to my hair. I came across this brush and I am so glad that I did. My hair does not break off when I use it and it leaves my hair tangle free and so soft. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Really good specialy for curly her like mine!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a birthday gift for our 8 year old granddaughter.  She has enjoyed brushing her hair with less tangles.</li>
            <li> The brushes would have been great. In fact, they WERE great for a few weeks. Then, the little round parts on the ends of the bristles came off. The bristle are quite sharp underneath, so the brush was made basically useless at that point. I did not use the brushes with a hair dryer or misuse them in any way - they just didn&#x27;t hold up to regular brushing. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This brush works well on my long, thick hair.  Less stress on and breakage of hair when brushing, seems to get tangles out without pulling as much.  My grandaughters like this brush the best for getting out the tangles.  Only thing I would improve is color choices, I like muted natural colors better.</li>
            <li> It really works! My 3 years old girl doesn&#x27;t mind brushing her hair anymore. She actually likes to brush her hair now. No more cry!!!</li>
            <li> At first these brushes worked good for knots, but after a month the plastic on the ends of the bristles came off making it very sharp to brush with.</li>
            <li> I wonder how I lived without this brush!  I have long, thin hair that tangles easily and doesn&#x27;t like to untangle,  except with this brush.  I ended up buying one for my daughter too.</li>
            <li> We purchased these brushes for our daughter who has very thick hair that would knot up all the time.  They work great, both with wet hair and dry hair.  With other brushes, my daughter would not want to brush her hair since it would hurt so much.  But, she gladly uses these detangling brushes and they do not hurt her when working on knots and tangles.</li>
            <li> Love having one for home and one for the purse or car.</li>
            <li> I bought the brushes for my daughter, but it never arrived and Amazon system seems to be confused with tracking. Surprisingly, beauty junkees proactively reach me, and once they found out we never received it, they followed up and shipped new one to us. I am really impressed! My daughter also likes the brushes too.</li>
            <li> I ordered it twice since it was so good that my mom in law asked me to order it for her as well. My daughters&#x27;s hair and very thick and long and I always struggled brushing her hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush for my 4 year old&#x27;s fine hair that easily tangles after sleeping and after washing.  The brush will still pull if the hair has tangles in it but it is more gentle than a regular brush or comb because the bristles have a lot of give.</li>
            <li> I like the brush, as well as the free mini brush that comes along with it. They are cute and I like the feel of the material. Most importantly, they do the job. I wouldn&#x27;t say they are magical or anything. My daughter still whines and says \\&quot;Ow\\&quot; and \\&quot;Stop it Mommy!\\&quot; when we have our twice-daily brush battles, but they work better than some other brushes out there. The sellers were very proactive in making sure I received the product and that it met my expectations, which was great. They were also extremely persistent re: positive feedback. I appreciate where they are coming from, especially in today&#x27;s online world where reviews really matter, but the reason I&#x27;m shopping on Amazon is because I have very little time (okay, and I&#x27;m also lazy ;)) so leaving online reviews is not a high priority of mine!</li>
            <li> Makes brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair (and getting her to brush her own!) much easier. The mini size is great for camp!</li>
            <li> These brushes were great, but within three months almost all of the pink bristle tips had fallen off. Not only did this leave pink specks all in my hair, but it also left sharp bristles that hurt my scalp. I don&#x27;t have coarse hair either- I have normal hair with lose waves. I ended up buying a new brush. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, very thick, and very long.  These brushes make quick work of the terrible awful knots that come out of nowhere under my hair.  They don&#x27;t pull, not do they rip out clumps of hair.  I&#x27;m thrilled and just wish I&#x27;d come across them sooner.</li>
            <li> These detangle without snagging the hair.  Very nice brushes</li>
            <li> Great brush and awesome customer service from Beauty Junkees!</li>
            <li> do not make hair frizzy and dont hurt</li>
            <li> These really do work well for tangles. I have four daughters and I have long hair so we use them a lot!</li>
            <li> My daughter complains less about her hair being pulled with this brush. I find it very similar to a natural bristle brush in the way that it approaches tangles. It does its job well.</li>
            <li> They say it&#x27;s bad to brush your hair when it&#x27;s wet. I cannot just let it dry without brushing it. I end up having a hard time and there&#x27;s always so much hair that falls on the brush. On top of that it hurts. I got this brush to see if I could really brush my hair when it&#x27;s wet and have less fall out and less pain. Guess what it did just that! This brush is amazing I can brush my hair and it won&#x27;t hurt also my hair isn&#x27;t falling out. The best part is when I&#x27;m brushing my hair when it&#x27;s dry it doesn&#x27;t give off static and now I can achieve those beautiful waves after curling my hair. I just curl my hair with a small curling iron and brush it from the top to the bottom and it gives off those Hollywood waves with no frizz or static. I usually tease my hair and had a hard time getting the knots out and this brush has made it so easy just make sure you start from the bottom and work your way up. I&#x27;m being serious you guys should try this brush it will make things easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly on the go so saving time in anything I do is very important. Having long thick hair I&#x27;ve always had to wait until it was dry in order to brush it and when I saw this brush I decided to give it a try. First the bristles are soft so that wonderful feeling you get on your scalp as you brush your hair is not there. Second due to the bristles being soft it simply doesn&#x27;t go through my thick hair. I actually ended up spending way too long trying to brush out my hair. My hair is pretty straight and I can&#x27;t even imagine using this brush on wavy hair.</li>
            <li> This product is really AMAZING. It works wonderfully. Brushes and detangles your hair gently without pulling. The product arrived on time and in perfect condition. The seller has great follow up with the customer. Checks up to make sure you know how to use the brush properly etc. I was very impressed&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this seller!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised. Bought this for my daughter who was having major tangles and a sensitive head. She would literately scream every time we tried to brush her hair. As a last resort before cutting her hair short, I bought these two brushes. She loved them so much she combs her own hair a couple of times a day, with out us prompting her. My wife loved them so much she took the smaller of the two. I had a heart attack a year ago and decided for the first time in my life to grow my hair out (while I still had some). I sweat alot and it would get tangled. I am not Tender headed, but it would pull and hurt as I pulled a comb or brush through my hair (which is thick). I tried the brush for myself and it was like cutting through butter. I am ordering another set because my 6 Year old won&#x27;t let me use her big brush. I don&#x27;t care about the color as long as it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair. Try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old wakes up each day with a huge mess of tangles at the back of her head.  This brush moves through them quickly and painlessly!  I&#x27;ve tried so many other options and nothing worked.  The little green brush is the best for little ones!</li>
            <li> Love it! Love this type of brush for my curly hair and I love that I can carry the small one in my purse!</li>
            <li> Ever household should have at least one wet brush.  Love the travel size especially.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes!  We have tears and screams every day while brushing our 7 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  No More!  We keep the larger one at home, and carry the smaller one in the car for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  I use the pink one and my daughter the green.  My two year old doesn&#x27;t cry anymore when I need to brush her natural curly hair.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and always struggle with tangles and knots. I&#x27;ve tried many different hair products and creams, and nothing has worked as great ad these brushes. No pain, gentle brushes thru the snarls and tangles. Not looking hair is a plus. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic! My girls are very tender headed and have thick hair. This gets the job done with minimal screaming.</li>
            <li> Love love love these brushes! I have 2 little girls that constantly have tangles in their hair and I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect product to make it painless for me to get those tangles out! That is this product!  It worked so well I even tried it on my own hair and let me daughter brush it! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The bristles are very thin and can&#x27;t penetrate my thick hair.  They&#x27;re too weak to do a good job detangling</li>
            <li> Nice brushes! Love the color. Shipped quickly and came undamaged. Very great buying experience!!</li>
            <li> Best brush by far!! I use the small brush on my 2yr old son, he has long curls and the small brush is perfect size and he hasnt had a fussy day yet. I use the pink brush in myself and its the best brush i ever used on my long curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Set was sent fast and well boxed up.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much. We love our brush set!</li>
            <li> Great gift and awesome bright color!</li>
            <li> love love them.  My family has curly hair and this works amazing to detangle everyone hair!!!!  Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> What an amazing brush  I&#x27;d recommend this to everyone  great product</li>
            <li> Great brushes for long fine hair.  My 10 yr old daughter&#x27;s hair is long and very fine.  Every brush we have used on her has been painful to get the knots out of her hair.  These brushes (the full size and the travel size) work really well on her hair type.  She does not complain about having her hair brushed as she used to.  I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Really makes brushing curly hair easier and less painful on my 6 year old when her hair is wet.</li>
            <li> Soft and gentle. Worked as promised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for almost a month now and I really wanted to love these brushes. I have 2 girls, one whose 7 and one whose 2. I thought these would be perfect for them, and couldn&#x27;t wait to try them out. When these brushes arrived the smell was very strong, like a chemical smell. I had to let these brushes sit out for almost a week just to get rid of the smell. Once I could finely the stand the smell I decided to use it on my seven year old after she got out of the shower. My seven year old has board straight hair. The brush worked pretty well when her hair was wet. The next morning we used it on her hair when it was dry and it was much more difficult and painful. I also attempted to use this brush on my two year olds hair which is curly and she wasn&#x27;t having it. She never fights me brushing her hair but she did not like this brush at all. The bristles are long and thin and they have little plastic beads at the tip. The beads started coming off after the first week. We have tried many no tangle brushes and these are probably my least favorite. Don&#x27;t get me wrong the brushes aren&#x27;t horrible, they work well when the hair is wet and freshly conditioned but not so much when the hair is dry, even with a spray detangler. I received these brushes at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This brush works like other brush. It come with very strong smell. After using it, the smell will stay on my hand.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Great, speedy service by seller.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> love it , gets knots out easy !!</li>
            <li> i use the smaller one in my purse.I love these brushes. Gets tangles out of my hair easily.</li>
            <li> May daughters love these Brushes no more pulling out hair from tangles.</li>
            <li> my daughter only used this product once and it does detangles but because of the very strong horrible chemical smell she will not use it again.</li>
            <li> I almost never write a review. I have to say I took a chance on the other reviews and I am so glad I did. It works!!!! I am so happy because I no longer have my daughter running from me. She actually asks me to brush her hair and multiple times a day! My daughter is 4 with smooth, thin straight blonde hair that always ends up with horrible knots - especially from her hair pulling little brother. I just followed the directions exactly, brush in small sections from bottom to top.</li>
            <li> Does NOT work like it claims.  Our daughter has long thick hair, and this doesn&#x27;t even go thru her hair.  Nice brush for someone with thin hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is a breeze! Goes through my daughters hair with little to no problems. She is very tender headed and at times hard to bare when brushing her hair. However it gently smoothed and divides hair. Love it</li>
            <li> Great brush. It detangles easily.  I don&#x27;t think any brush is totally tangle free, but compared to others this is the best we&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> These hairbrushes are excellent.  I had such a hard time trying to brush my two granddaughters long hair, but this brush makes it so easy and no complaints or squirming from the girls!!  I am definitely going to purchase another set.</li>
            <li> Perfect brushes for my daughter&#x27;s hair. Fast shipping, also.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot, it really does detangle wet hair.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on a real snarl yet but I think it will do the job.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush for tangles!</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is like a dreadlock everyday I have to deal with huge knots .. after screaming and screaming I needed to find a brush that would detangle and not rip her hair out.This product was perfect.. price was great, works like a charm.. leaving her hair soft and smoothe. I love the little small one too.. I leave it at grandma&#x27;s house in case I forget and it&#x27;s perfect. Shipped fast and I am happy customer!</li>
            <li> Very good at detangling hair, and my daughter doesn&#x27;t complain about them hurting (like she has with every other brush we&#x27;ve tried). The key is that in addition to being meant for detangling, they also have a soft tip on each bristle, and that makes all the difference.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!!! They go right through my hair. Good bye plain old store brand hairbrushes that break!! These are my go to brush from now on.</li>
            <li> worked on my hair very well!</li>
            <li> Felt a massage gets through knots 5 stars</li>
            <li> Durable handle, but the beads on the end of each bristle tends to pop out.  My hair is thick and I use this after I dry my hair after a shower.  It does detangle well, but requires a lot of brushing to do so.</li>
            <li> These detangle my hair and my 2 year olds&#x27; hair much better than a comb or brush.  It works better than tangle spray. My little one still doesn&#x27;t like to have her hair brushed and by no means does this &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; through hair like I had hoped, but these brushes are much better than normal combs.</li>
            <li> NO tears! This is the only brush we have found that doesn&#x27;t make her cry when brushing her hair - wet or dry.</li>
            <li> The brushes are OK but the smell of the brush is almost unbearable!  It reminds me of what your hair smells like after you&#x27;ve been sitting around a fire pit.  Just got them yesterday so hopefully the smell will go away.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected and daughter loves the new brushes.  Helps her comb her hair more because it does not hurt anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my daughter&#x27;s infant hair brush just wasn&#x27;t working anymore.  I wanted something soft and that would not snag on her tangles.  I love it.  It combs through her tangles with little or no snagging.  This came as a two pack, so I use the larger one for myself and the small one for my daughter.  I noticed that there is less hair coming out in my brush.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how strongly the brushes smell like petrol or gasoline. I immediately returned these and recommend you DO NOT buy these!</li>
            <li> Okay i guess i just have the very thin, frail and flat asian hair. Still have alot of hair on my brush every after brushing with wet or dry hair. I hope someone invents something worth my money.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes for my 7 year old granddaughter who has always hated to have her long hair brushed.  I called them her magic brushes and got her a Christmas haircut and now brushing her hair is a pleasure.  Well, at least it&#x27;s not a huge struggle like it was before.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever, seriously.</li>
            <li> High quality, works great for me and my daughter! Gentle and effective at detangling.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how easily these brushes work on my daughters hair. She is mixed and HATES having her hair brushed. Does amazing work with out ripping outer hair.</li>
            <li> These are great.  It was a nice touch to an email about cleaning out the brushes.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> My tween daughter has thick wavy hair and a sensitive scalp, so she is always reluctant to brush it all the way through because it&#x27;s painful.  I&#x27;ve tried many types of brushes for her but none were completely satisfactory. I found this set on Amazon and read the reviews, and have to say that they are right on point.  GREAT BRUSH!  My daughter really does willingly comb her hair now, wet or dry, and really loves this brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!! No more tears for my little girl :)</li>
            <li> There mother tells me they are working very well, no more tears in the morning at hair brushing time. thanks</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair brush set for my 9 yr old daughter. She loves the brushes; she said the brushes go very smoothly through her hair.</li>
            <li> Brush works great and got it within 2 days. My daughter finally let&#x27;s me brush her hair! I keep one upstairs &amp; one down so I&#x27;m never tempted to use a regular comb or brush again!</li>
            <li> I have long hair that gets knotted in the shower and this truly proved to be remarkable.  It was easy to detangle the knots.&lt;br /&gt;The small one will be great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such a fine product.</li>
            <li> I give these brushes 5 stars because this is absolutely the best brush I have ever used. I have very thick hair and have had 38 years of many painful tangles and snarls (with long and short hair). I use the pink brush in the shower after I apply my conditioner. When I rinse my hair, it has never felt so silky after a rinse (it does not feel like my hair); NO trouble brushing after the wash. In addition, my hair is shedding less and it has really pumped up the volume on my hair too! Green brush is great for drying and on the go! Thank you! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a granddaughter who loves to play beauty salon but DOESN&#x27;T love to have her hair brushed! I got this brush and she actually said &amp;#34;It doesn&#x27;t hurt!!&amp;#34; Will be buying for my daughter as well!</li>
            <li> I recieved my detangler brush and have been absolutely loving it.  It is better than any other brushes I have purchased from drugstores. Love it! Yay beauty junkee!!</li>
            <li> My experience with these brushes made me doubt the entire AMAZON review process. Only a couple of other reviews mentioned the SMELL of these brushes, so clearly many people are being paid to say nice things. These brushes exude such a horrible chemical smell that I had to put them away, and I am not one who has &amp;#34;chemical sensitivities&amp;#34; or anything like that. I am returning them because I would not think of  getting them near my 3 year old daughter. I guess I will have to buy a brush in person at a store and smell it first.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes, they work great don&#x27;t pull or rip your hair.  They are the best detangling brushes!  I carry the mini brush in my gym/travel bag.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a brush to help tame my daughters hair without it either hurting her as its brushed or ripping hair out as its brushed. I handed her the new brush and asked her to give it a try. She went into her room and brushed her hair when i heard her hollar &amp;#34; it hurts&amp;#34; i run in there and said &amp;#34;it hurts?&amp;#34; She was like no IT WORKS she was all excited which makes me a happy Mom. Thank you for this amazeballs brush!</li>
            <li> My 8 yo daughter is the type that screams every time we brush her hair, being as gentle as we possibly can.  I got these brushes for her.  She immediately loved them.  They simply do not hurt at all the bristles are soft and bend instead of pulling.  They work very well for her, perfect!!  Her hair type is more on the thin side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, my own hair is extremely thick and these do not work well for my hair, they do not hurt, but they do not get through the massive amount of hair I have.  I gave these five stars because it is truly about what type of hair you are buying for rather than the product itself.  The product is perfect for people or children with normal to thin hair.</li>
            <li> The brush set is great and especially for the price.  It does still pull a little while brushing my daughters hair but that is any brush I think!</li>
            <li> I have hair almost to my waist and having a brush that detangles easily is very important. I don&#x27;t have to worry about damage caused to my hair from fighting tangles. Shipping was super fast and every interaction with this company has been amazing. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> If you have trouble with dangles in your hair, you will want to buy this product to help alleviate the discomfort of removing dangles from your hair whether after washing your hair or brushing dry hair.</li>
            <li> I love my brush because it&#x27;s so easy to brush my hair after I&#x27;ve washed it.  It glides through with little tugging and pain.  I really like how my hair does not frizz after I&#x27;ve used the brushes.  It comes with two brushes so I have one in my purse.</li>
            <li> Because I am growing out my hair...because my hair is really thick and curly...it&#x27;s near to impossible to find a brush that runs through my locks without tugging, pulling and breaking...until now!  This brush works wonders...very few strands are left in the brush the brush flows smoothly through my hair...very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> My daughter hates having her hair brushed in the morning. This brush makes getting the tangles out MUCH easier and makes the mornings go more smoothly.</li>
            <li> Got these brushes because I was looking for a brush that would not tug so much at my daughters hair, and make her hair more manageable. My daughter said that this brush does not hurt as much, but I have noticed that it only brushes the surface of her hair and does not get the kinks out of the middle of her head.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter whined and complained about having her hair brushed, until I bought your ( Best Detangling Hair Brush Set). Now she loves to have her hair brushed and she especially wants to brush her own hair now. The brushes also work great on my really curly hair. The brush glides right through my hair even without putting a lot of conditioner in it. Thanks for inventing these hair brushes.  Sincerely, L.C.</li>
            <li> i dont think it works any better than other brushes that are similar or the same that you can get at almost any store</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush...my daughter really likes it.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for managing tangles without tears. My daughters use the small one when they brush their hair. Leaving the large one for me to help them.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this brush a try after the Tangle Teaser failed (it didn&#x27;t hurt, but didn&#x27;t get any tangles out!) My 5 year old loves this brush. She has very thick, wavy hair that tangles easily......and of course a sensitive scalp! I tried both brushes on dry and wet hair and it works like a charm! It isn&#x27;t a miracle product, my daughter yelled &amp;#34;ow!&amp;#34; At least twice in the past week we&#x27;ve had it....but it cut down on screaming and tears by 100%! You still need to place a hand at the base of the hair to cut down on pulling, and brush slowly.....but it is still an excellent brush! Bonus is she uses the travel brush to brush her doll&#x27;s hair, or her own hair! Only downside I&#x27;ve found is the brush smelled strongly of chemical or rubber when we took it out of the package.....but nothing noticeable since!</li>
            <li> My 4 year-old daughter would cry and cry when I brushed her hair every morning. I ordered this brush out of desperation, our last hope before cutting her hair short. They work great! I don&#x27;t know what it is about the brush design, but it is so much easier to brush her hair, which is super fine and stick straight, so it gets some major tangles. I cannot say enough good things about this brush, I am so grateful that we found it!</li>
            <li> My daughter (who is eight) and I have tried many different brushes on her &amp;#34;Rapunzel&amp;#34; like hair and this by far has done the best.  Works really good in both dry and wet hair.  So far no tangle has proven too tough but we also make sure we do not let her hair ever get to that point.  Would recommend this brush.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is fine and straight and LOVES to tangle (we call them rat&#x27;s nest) but so far so good...... Also she loves the smaller one - she uses that one to do the &amp;#34;pre-brush&amp;#34; before I tackle it with the larger one.</li>
            <li> I really loved these brushes. Everything I have purchased from beauty junkees has been great. I would highly recommend these products. The little brush is so cute and perfect size for your purse!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hair brush especially because it works great on wet hair. Perfect size for my 5 year old daughter and I.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, having the mini one is awesome for tossing in my purse, and my toddler likes to use it to imitate me while I&#x27;m getting ready.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, fine, natural curly hair.  Some mornings are a nightmare when it comes to brushing her hair.  I used this brush and was quite pleased with the results.  The brush didn&#x27;t tear or pull her hair.  Even better, no tears from my little girl.  I&#x27;m happy to have it in my collection.</li>
            <li> These brushes glide through my hair with ease, combing out tangles without problems. Even my brush-hating girls will let me brush their hair now!</li>
            <li> I love the way this brush combs my hair and daughters hair. She no longer whines when i comb her hair, thank you you just made my life way easier. The best brush and the value was great also!</li>
            <li> Perfect for detangling hair. Love them.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter really likes the brushes. Painless.</li>
            <li> This has been a great brush for little girls with long hair.  It brushes through it smoothly either wet or dry.  Best of all causing no damage.  I love it.....and so do my girls!</li>
            <li> I like the size of this brush and the soft bristles.  The large area means that I can get through my hair faster and the soft bristles ensures the least stress and tear on the hair to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the utility of the brush.  Only thing I would change up a little are the color offerings.  I&#x27;d prefer a brush that was in an earthy color, i.e. graphite, black, brown or some marbling of colors in the plastic itself I&#x27;d love a marbeling of black, white and purple!</li>
            <li> UPDATE I still love the brushes but the reason im giving them 3 stars is because  whatever you do DO NOT WASH THEM mine fell apart &amp; I just ordered my 2nd set . I would say be very gentile like warm soapy water but do not soak just wipe &amp; go . I soaked mine for a few hrs &amp; they was a mess .  These are still by far my favorite brushes ever!!!</li>
            <li> I have given this detangling brush set five stars because I am seriously impressed! These brushes are affordable and I love that it comes in a set of 2, one being a &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; and one full size. The colors of the brushes are cute and they brush through hair effortlessly. I have very thick hair, and a whole lot of it and I honestly hate brushing my hair but these brushes work SO great! I&#x27;m happy I decided on this purchase and I will definitely be purchasing from the Beauty Junkees brand again in the future! I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought these to use on my girls&#x27; (age 5 &amp; 7) hair because they are always fighting me at brushing time. They arrived way faster than anticipated and I love the feel of the handles. The small brush lives in my purse for quick smooth outs and the big brush is our go-to for after baths and showers. They do work well when you take your time and follow the instructions. However, since my kids have insanely quick to tangle hair, taking a long time to brush can be frustrating- hence the 4 stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> This is the only kind of brush I will use now. Glides right through my hair wet or dry. So happy to have the little travel size one now.</li>
            <li> This brush works well on my long hair, particularly when wet. Makes it easier to work through tangles,  wet or dry. I feel like my hair benefits! Especially appreciate the travel sized brush.</li>
            <li> If I could EVER give anything more than five stars, it would be this.  I have thin long hair.  It tangles when I walk from one room to another, I mean...IT TANGLES!  I love having long hair but it HURTS and I&#x27;m a pansy.  I had resigned myself to crying every time I brushed my hair for the rest of my life.  I saw this detangling brush and my first thought was, &amp;#34;Gimmick!&amp;#34;  But, I had a coupon code and with Amazon Prime, i got this set for $1 shipped.  I figured, no great loss if it&#x27;s a fluke.  I was WRONG.  These brushes have some magical fairy dust in them or something.  I&#x27;ve had mine for a couple months now and I&#x27;ve thrown out every other brush I have!  Seriously, I have no idea how this works but it makes brushing less painful.  I&#x27;ve ordered two more sets for family now.  Every home with a child or a pansy (like me) needs to have this set.  They&#x27;re reasonably priced too!</li>
            <li> This brush is nice to hold. The bristles are soft and brushes through my hair nicely (I have thick hair) Compared to retail stores brushes I would have to say this feels a lot nicer to to the touch and actual brushing. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m gonna accidentally rip it out of my head... the reason for the 4 stars is the smell. When I first got the package it was extremely overwhelming. I&#x27;ve had it sitting out to air for 3 days. The smell is still there, but it is less and less. Because if the smell I haven&#x27;t thoroughly tried to brush my hair to awesome extents or even tried it with wet hair. Should things change I&#x27;ll adjust my review, but as for now... once the smell dies away I think this will be a nice brush. Also, the big bonus is the additional mini brush. It&#x27;s small enough to toss into my purse or let my daughter use.</li>
            <li> this brush really does the trick for my mess of hair.  i love how easily it gets through the tangles yet feels nice at the same time!  you can barely tell it&#x27;s working until you realize all of the tangles are now gone!  love that it comes with two sizes!</li>
            <li> These brushes really do make brushing our little ones tangles out with ease.  Thank you so much!  We&#x27;ve tried other brushes that claimed to be gentle at detangling, but they didn&#x27;t work as well as they claimed.  There have been no tears using these two brushes.  One happy Mom and one happy little girl.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> These detangling brushes are awesome for long hair. I have waist length straight hair and I always use mine after I get out of the shower and my hair is still wet. You can also use it in the shower. They do not damage your hair and get rid of the knots and tangles. The mini one is an awesome bonus for traveling or for the gym.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome, I love this brush for the simple fact that my child lets me brush her hair!</li>
            <li> Hair brushing used to bring tears to my daughter&#x27;s eyes since her hair was so thick. With this amazing brush there are no more tears. My girls love brushing their hair in the morning now!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes! I have very thick hair but nothing these brushes can&#x27;t handle. I would recommend these brushes to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> I purchased these because I have the wet brush and these are the same brush pretty much! The only brushes I now use in my house!! love these</li>
            <li> We love this brush!  My 5 year old daughter has naturally curly hair that gets a LOT of tangles in it.  She approves of this brush and says that it doesn&#x27;t hurt her head.  She also loves the mini brush. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it on myself, but love that it doesn&#x27;t make my kids cry when we use it!  I would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> No problems with using it with wet or dry hair. Concerned bristles may break off but will wait and see</li>
            <li> My daughter can brush her hair, which is three feet long and wavy, with these brushes.  They help her with tangles a bunch.  Highly recommended for tangle prone hair.</li>
            <li> Grandbaby loves the brushes they do not pull her hair like other brushes</li>
            <li> I use the big one on my hair and the small on my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  I don&#x27;t know if its just the size of the small one that makes it less intimidating to her, but she reacts to the small much MUCH better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever used on her. We have a multitude of detangling brushes, including The Wet Brush, but this one is superior by far.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> My girls love these brushes. My daughter has long wavy hair that is always tangled. This is the only brush we have found that doesn&#x27;t pull her hair when we brush it.</li>
            <li> I had to return my brushes. Gave it 2 stars because the design is pretty, the sizes of the brushes are good, and the grip was good. But I bought them to untangle my kids&#x27; hair and for that, they did not work. They pulled just as much as my regular brushes, and my kids complained more about them than they actually do over a brush I bought at Walmart for $2. So for functionality purposes, I would not recommend these. One of my daughters has thin wavy hair and the other has thick straight hair. Didn&#x27;t untangle either one&#x27;s hair without tears and discomfort on their part (and mine, for that matter...).</li>
            <li> Great brushes (work well with both wet and dry hair!), good price, and fast and friendly service (a call to see if we are happy with the products - unexpected) - what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> These brushes have surpassed my expectations.  I am thrilled with the quality, design, and ease of use.  I have no pain when brushing tangles anymore and my 3 year-old daughter agrees!  Great value too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE these brushes. They make it easy to comb through my thick hair. Definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> I love this set.  My hair is long &amp; very thick so getting through it following a washing has always been a tough process.  This brush eliminates the need for a cream rinse or other product that helps tangles.  The smaller brush is perfect for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li> Great bargain and was pleased with how affordable they were.</li>
            <li> My 3-year-old hates having her hair brushed but these brushes do a good job of detangling without pulling too much. She complains a lot less with these than other brushes we&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s handy they come in a set of two; we keep one in her bedroom for use before bedtime and one near the front door.</li>
            <li> I purchase these for all my girls now. They are the only brushes I have used that all 5 of them don&#x27;t cry when we use them. They are great. Takes a bit of patience to comb out extreme snarls, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Works great on my 3 year old with long hair! No tears!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how these brushes work, but they manage to detangle my crazy, thick, matted, long curly hair very easily. It gets all my hair detangled in about five minutes when used with dry hair, and in about two minutes, when my hair is wet (with conditioner in it). Somehow it detangles without ripping the hair out; there is no discomfort at all. There is some hair in the brush when I am finished, but I believe that to be normally shed hair that would have come out anyway. Very happy with these brushes.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair that tangles very easily along with a sensitive scalp. These brushes finally make me not dread brushing out my hair after a shower. No more pulling and yanking a brush through my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and these brushes don&#x27;t seem to go all the way though and get the tangles out. They work great on my friend&#x27;s kids tho.</li>
            <li> I use the fullsize for myself and my daughter loves the travel size, so she has adopted it!. These brushes work surprisingly well! My daughter has curly hair.. like imagine Shirley Temple hair.. on crack.. it works great! She doesn&#x27;t cry while brushing or having me brush her hair. I also love whatever coating is on the brushes handles, it feels awesome, comfortable handle and goes thru hair smoothly!</li>
            <li> I wanted to give the brush 5 stars but I&#x27;ve had them for less than 9 months and the large brush is falling apart. The bristle tips are falling off. The brush worked great for the first 6 months but gradually more and more tips are breaking off.</li>
            <li> These work great...Shipped fast and priced perfect</li>
            <li> THESE REALLY WORK!!!!!!! My hair loves to get tangled-the wind, the shower, and especially when swimming. This brush does exactly what it says without pulling my hair out!!! I love it and I am thrilled to have a smaller one for my purse or swim bag!</li>
            <li> Great brushes!  My daughter was so excited to have her own smaller brush. Would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> I figured for the price I would give these brushes a try. I didn&#x27;t have high expections because many times detangling items don&#x27;t work so well. I had a much different experience with these. They actually did detangle and didn&#x27;t pull my hair. My daughter hates brushing her hair and she said these didn&#x27;t pull for her either. She took the small green one and kept it. That says everything. They are soft and gentle. They did have a little smell at first but that went away. I can&#x27;t explain why but these do indeed work.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed on the quality of these brushes. Since I have thick curly hair my major concerns were the brushes would just break and not too stand up to its quality. That fact you get two brushes in two different sizes is so convenient, using the pink large one comes in handy in my everyday hair routine and the smaller one is the perfect size for your makeup bag or purse. I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants the perfect size brushes, if it can work for my thick hair it can work for others.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great on tangled hair. My daughter has long hair which tangles very easy. Just follow the suggestions on the usage and you will love the brushes as much as she does.</li>
            <li> Easily and gently untangle thick hair while reducing hair loss and breakage.</li>
            <li> Beauty Junkees has offered a set of truly nice Detangling Brushes that really work as promised!&lt;br /&gt;I have a grown out perm that I am dealing with and brushing my hair after washing it is always a challenge no matter how much conditioner I use.&lt;br /&gt;The larger Detangling Brush&#x27;s handle fits nicely in the palm of my hand and enables me to have complete control when removing the tangles from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Starting at the ends and working my way up to the top of my head, this brush gets the tangles out without pulling my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;I love that Beauty Junkees included a smaller version of this wonderful De-tangling Brush that fits in my beach bag for use after a dip in the pool or the ocean.&lt;br /&gt;Attractive, Quality Detangling Brushes well worth the under $15 asking price.&lt;br /&gt;A+++ Recommendation.</li>
            <li> these brushes are a life saver! worked great</li>
            <li> I ordered this, and then I tried to cancel it, because I really didn&#x27;t need a new brush, however it was too late. I received it in a short time with instructions on how to use it. I am so happy that it didn&#x27;t cancel. My daughter and I both have curly hair and unless I wash my hair everyday it&#x27;s a mess, until I used this brush. I first noticed that it didn&#x27;t hurt to use it at all and it didn&#x27;t scratch my scalp. My daughter also now likes her hair brushed. With a 1 yr old I just didn&#x27;t think that was possible. I&#x27;m. So glad that the cancellation didn&#x27;t go through!</li>
            <li> These do a much better job than most brushes getting tangles out. I would say they are flawless, but they definitely worth trying. My daughter has curly hair and it gets very tangled over night. These have helped a lot in the pain of getting the tangles out. :)</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> One for mommy one for daughter. Works great! My hair dreadlocks over night ,this brush is awesome and no more daughter crying her lil eyes out :-( because of tangles!</li>
            <li> Wow I love the brushes and nice colors too.  Just got it today.  I used it on my hair and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that always gets knotted up real bad. I tried this brush with my hair wet and it glided right through with no problem. That would never happen with my old brush! I am  in love with this and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> These brushes are light weight with a soft easy grip handle. The brissels are long and flexible making a great detangler leaving my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Lightning fast shipping! Love the brushes</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  My 7 year old has been begging for a hairbrush that doesn&#x27;t hurt.  This works great.  It does still pull a little on the tangles but it actually brushes them right out!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few detangler brushes in my daughter&#x27;s hair, with mixed results. She has very fine, easily tangled hair, and brushing it is often a heartbreaking mess. I spend obscene amounts of money on products attempting to reduce the tangles so we can brush it. This brush just works! It detangles the hair, quickly, and almost completely painlessly. Best hair purchase yet!</li>
            <li> Mine and my daughters new favorite brushes!</li>
            <li> Love the soft texture of the handles!  Great brushes, my daughter also loves them!  No more screaming while I brush her hair!</li>
            <li> Kids love these. They love that they can brush their own hair with out hurting them.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair, with many many dry tangles. These brushes really take out the tangles, painlessly. The bristles are very soft and flexible. I found my favorite brush!</li>
            <li> I love my new set of brushes.  I can honestly say that these brushes don&#x27;t pull on my hair like other brushes do.  The first time I used this brush I noticed that my hair did not fall out as much as it does with other brushes I use and now I only use this set because it&#x27;s gentler on my scalp and hair.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Great for my stubborn kid and my long-haired dog too (separate brush of course)</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pull at all!!!! I have very fine/tangled hair. The small one is perfect for travel and its so easy to clean them!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughters as their hair gets tangled easily and are tender headed. My daughters love these brushes! No more whining. I definitely recommend these to anyone with daughters.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!! And works great!! I have 3 girls with long curly hair. These brushes makes hair a lot easier!!</li>
            <li> Great brushes. I especially like the small one for my purse and travel. Mush better then most travel brushes</li>
            <li> I love the fact this came with a big and little brush, instead of fighting over something my toddler immediately grabbed the small one and her sister grabbed the big one and they were both happy ( how often does that happen?)  This did make brushing their hair easier, but for some reason it seemed to work much better when their hair was wet / damp.  Using them on dry hair was only slightly better than a normal hair brush.  Luckily spraying with a detangler made it damp enough to work well so this isn&#x27;t a huge issue for us,  but it is something to consider since some people do not like to brush wet hair since it can cause breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Purchased as promotional price for review/testing purposes. All opinions expressed are wholly my own.</li>
            <li> My grand children never complain when I brush their hair now.  Brush works  great!</li>
            <li> These brushes are nice but I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference and neither does my daughter. The only thing I did not like about these brushes was the smell! the smelled like tires! the smell of rubber even lingered on my hair after I used the brushes!!!!</li>
            <li> Was really excited to get this brush set. I was expecting it to be similar to the Wet Brush but I&#x27;ve been let down. I have the hardest time getting any tangles out of my kids hair after a shower. Does work nicely on dry hair though!</li>
            <li> These are nice. They work well to get the tangles out without pulling too much. I&#x27;ve tried the wet brush also and like it a little better - somehow it seems to be a bit more gentle - but this is a very close runner up. The colors are nice and bright and my children love them</li>
            <li> I was offered this No Tangle Hair Brush Set from Beauty Junkees for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about them. We, my daughter and I, absolutely love these 2 detangler hair brushes. They work great on out super thick hair and the handles are great for even her small hands, she&#x27;s 3. Even the baby has tried to brush his hair. It is difficult to get my daughter&#x27;s hair brushed through without tears. These brushes have worked great for us and I definitely recommend trying these Detangler Hair Brushes from Beauty Junkees for your tangles.</li>
            <li> Love that these are sold in a pair and in different colors. I gave the small one to my daughter and it&#x27;s the perfect size for traveling. Besides the brushes detangling, hair is easy to clean off the brush it doesn&#x27;t collect like some others, I can pull them off easily to keep the brush clean. I also like the logo better than others and the detailing and design of the brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It is not a miracle worker but does make brushing out my daughter&#x27;s hair much easier. Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> Most amazing brush ever!  LIFE CHANGING!  I have two curly girls with long hair.  The only time I brush their hair is after bath time.  It use to by quite the struggle.  Then I was introduced to this brush and the first time my husband used it on the girls he came running to tell me how he was able to brush through one of the girl&#x27;s hair in less than 30 seconds.  I keep one in every bedroom!</li>
            <li> When you have long hair that snarls easily a good brush is critical and t&amp;see brushes dr tangle nicely.  Glad we discovered them.</li>
            <li> These are the best hairbrushes on the market.  Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids have long, thick hair and brushing out the tangles has always been a fight, until we found these brushes.  It works fabulously on both wet and dry hair.  The two-pack is even better because there is no fighting over who gets which brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, the customer service I received from Beauty Junkees has been top notch.  They sent an email ahead of the shipment letting me know best practices for the brushes, and then reached out after to make sure the products were received.  I&#x27;ve never worked with a company like this before, and will definitely go back. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This was not as I had expected. I is okay and does a decent job brushing hair but is not any easier than the brushes we get at target.</li>
            <li> These brushes were not nearly as sturdy a I had hoped.  I have thick long blond adult hair which the brushes do not work very well in.  For children these brushes are probably very good.</li>
            <li> My daughter has the most sensitive head? I try everything to get her not to fuss when brushing her hair. These brushes are awesome. Santa brought them in her stocking, he knows his brushes! I caught her brushing her hair by herself the other day! I used this on my own hair and I notice a huge difference, it might catch on a tangle here or there but it slides through much easier with little pulling effort.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a brush that actually brushes my hair without making it frizzy! These brushes are amazing. I have long, straight hair that is dry and damaged and loves to frizz. (I live in a humid climate). These brushes make my hair silky and shiny. I love how it comes with a large one and also a small one for my purse. Also, when you brush your scalp, it feels so good! The little things at the end of the bristles massage your scalp and it feels awesome. I highly recommend these brushes. Wish I had found them sooner!</li>
            <li> So great for kids with long hair! Only way we get through every shower or bath time! Add J&amp;J no more tangles leave in conditioner and you are golden!</li>
            <li> Excellent way to brush child&#x27;s tangled hair.  No more crying!</li>
            <li> My daughter is very picky about her hairbrush. She loves this one! Thanks!</li>
            <li> works great love that it came with a little brush for my purse......#longhairproblems</li>
            <li> These brushes work great!  We have used them both right out of the shower and on dry hair and they never fail.  They seem to make it much easier to get through any tangles in the hair so we are both very pleased!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes I keep one in my purse so I can brush my hair out while I&#x27;m at work</li>
            <li> Love these. They work great on my thick hair and my daughters crazy unruly curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> I kept the big one and use the little one on my toddler. It definitely does a good job of even de tangling her hair at the end of a play filled day!</li>
            <li> I really like this brushes! My daughter has really thick hair and it glides right thru it.</li>
            <li> I have use these brushes for the past week and I gotta say they work great, specially on my four year old daughter, her hair is really fine and tangles easily, she used to cry every time I did her hair…Not anymore, the brush is gentle on her hair and combs thru it with ease.</li>
            <li> One for me and one for my girls. We both love it.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pull at all!!!! My daughter has very fine/tangled/curly hair. The small one is perfect for travel and its so easy to clean them! They work great in my two year olds unruly curly hair. Great product!!</li>
            <li> It works great, it does not pull my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> This hairbrush set is amazing!  I got a deep discount on this product to write a review, but this hairbrush is definitely worth paying a bit extra for.  I have an 8 year old daughter who would melt down at the slightest mention of needing to get her hair brushed.  Since we started using this hairbrush, not a single tear!  We call it &amp;#34;the magic hairbrush&amp;#34; because it really is.  It doesn&#x27;t get out all the knots/tangles without a lot of brushing, but it does make the hair look really nice and without crying.  I could probably sit and brush her hair until all the tangles were out because she is not screaming and pulling away.  If you have been looking for the solution to your &amp;#34;my daughter won&#x27;t let me brush her hair woes&amp;#34;, look no further.</li>
            <li> This brush is good for my 14 mo old while she doesn&#x27;t have much hair. The brissels don&#x27;t hold up to brushing a lot of hair.</li>
