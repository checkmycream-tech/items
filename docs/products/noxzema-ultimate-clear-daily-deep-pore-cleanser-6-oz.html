            <li>I read all the wonderful reviews on this product and took a chance.</li>

            <li>It is okay, but it doesn&#x27;t cleanse as well.</li>
            <li>I love this brand and product line.</li>
            <li>I tried many cleansers and medicated creams and none helped.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it isn&#x27;t oily and it does not smell medicated.</li>

            <li>If you don&#x27;t care about any of that you will LOVE this.</li>
            <li>i love this face cleanser</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it on here because they stopped stocking it at my wal-mart.</li>
            <li>I also love how  my skin feels in the morning after I wake up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good, gives your face a very clean, refreshed feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working great so far!</li>
            <li>Squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>It has a fresh light fragrance to it that is very appealing.</li>
            <li>I had used it for 2 months, it works great so far.</li>
            <li>It lathers up easily and doesnâ€™t feel oily.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s for sure going to help clean your skin if it doesn&#x27;t help your acne.</li>
            <li>Love this product and the tingly clean feeling I get after each use.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is light, easy to apply and easy to remove as well.</li>
            <li>I just put the stuff into another bottle and it works fine.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with my recent Noxzema purchase.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone looking for a genuine face cleanser</li>
            <li>works great, covers so well you only need a speck and LASTS FOREVER</li>
            <li>I thought it was just the price to keep fit.  </li>
            <li>I shower with this at the gym and my skin stays smooth.  </li>
            <li>Lathers up great, need only a pea sized amount</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you, Noxzema, for such a great face wash.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so darn cheap</li>
            <li>Also wouldn&#x27;t be good for those sensitive to lots of fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and clean, fresh feeling</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s significantly softer, and feels significantly cleaner.</li>
            <li>However, this product is nothing like the original.  </li>
            <li>but if you use it right before bed, have a new pillow case, and get a good nights rest</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling remarkably clean and pimples drying up just after 1st use.  </li>
            <li>This is the repackaged and rebranded Triple Clean Anti-Bacterial Lathering Cleanser</li>
            <li>Leaves my face squeaky clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Great face soap and so much easier to dispense than the old fashion tub.</li>
            <li>After the first wash, my face felt soooo clean!</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY face wash I&#x27;ve found that does any good at all for my acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Hay guys try it your woman will love you because your skin will be much cleaner.</li>
            <li>that said, this is still a good option, especially if you don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li>You would still need a full anti-acne regimen along with this.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using Noxzema, it felt like my face was actually clean.</li>
            <li>It has a light, pleasantly soapy scent and DOESN&#x27;T have any micro-beads (which sometimes leave my skin feeling raw).</li>
            <li>my skin had been clear most of my life</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin, and most products irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective AND it&#x27;s really cheap compared to Cetaphil and other acne cleansers.</li>
            <li>so I can apply it right after I rinse out my conditioner.</li>
            <li>it really does clean.</li>
            <li>My husband loves it too, although he doesn&#x27;t get much acne, he likes that it keeps his face clean.</li>
            <li>This one is particularly nice because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but keeps break-outs away.  </li>
            <li>Super fast delivery</li>
            <li>But after a month of using the anti-bacterial (which is more of a cream), I still have lots of dirt left on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a great job cleaning the face; the cream is a bit thick, which I like.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t seem to over-dry either!</li>
            <li>Noxzema however, cleared up the rash within the first use.</li>
            <li>I started seeing acne when i first used it for couple of days.</li>
            <li>If anyone is interested, I found this article on Ayurveda and hormonal</li>
            <li>My face was soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I only discovered this about 2 months ago, and after using it in that time I&#x27;ve fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li>It smells kinda funny...</li>
            <li>Got the product in a timely fashion, was wonderfull and does exactly as it says.</li>
            <li>First the \\&quot;Clearasil STAY</li>
            <li>I really like it!  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t clean your face any better than loads of other products    </li>
            <li>Finally, aloe leaf is a nice addition that makes sure it doesn&#x27;t dry out the face too much.</li>
            <li>If you do care, you&#x27;ll struggle with guilt every time you use it, and then the guilt will be replaced by pleasure at seeing clean clear skin.</li>
            <li>the guilt will be replaced by pleasure at seeing clean clear skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my clean so soft</li>
            <li>I ordered these online because I thought I would get the old triple Clean cleanser</li>
            <li>Noxzema&#x27;s Triple Clean Face Wash is almost identical to Clearasil&#x27;s old version and might be even better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been having positive results with it.</li>
            <li>I had been using gentle hand soap because of its antibacterial properties, but it was drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li>wanted a face wash that was gentle, removes dirt and oil, and kills germs.  </li>
            <li>cuz I didn&#x27;t care much.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this product.</li>
            <li>And in this case, this product hasn&#x27;t really helped my jawline.</li>
            <li>I like Cetaphil because it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li>fast and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I have VERY oily, breakout-prone skin</li>
            <li>In fact, it can be VERY drying even for my skin.</li>
            <li>gentle and gets the job done</li>
            <li>This product works effectively at a very resonable price.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day morning and night, it cleans very well with just a tip of cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for an acne product that was much lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My go to for clear skin!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser that left my skin feeling clean, refreshed, and ready to face the day.</li>
            <li>Does it work any better than LOADS of other products?</li>
            <li>The derm doc said it was hormonal adult acne - thanks peri-menopause!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I wasn&#x27;t suffering from hormonal acne, this product would work well for average acne issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Triclosan is a great anti-bacterial that gets rid of stubborn acne that doesn&#x27;t respond to other typical cleansers.</li>
            <li>This does all of that, and even has a decent scent.  </li>
            <li>Noxzema is classic.</li>
            <li>This does not dry my face out, has a clean smell and is not harsh on my face at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most important part of this cleanser is that it&#x27;s non-comedogenic, so you never have to worry about it clogging your pores or making acne worse.</li>
            <li>I love the old-fashioned Noxzema cleanser in the big blue jar.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this product when i received it.  </li>
            <li>I get next to nothing for raised bumps, and it works even better when i use a mild exfolient (gets into the pores easier when you lift off the dead skin).</li>
            <li>Noxzema Ultimate Clear Anti-Bacterial Lathering Cleanser leaves my skin feeling extremely clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive to lots of cleanser, original Noxzema cleanser had worked wonder for me for a long time.</li>
            <li>I also love that my face doesn&#x27;t feel dried out after washing.</li>
            <li>This product works well and seems to reduce new breakouts.</li>
            <li>I will not switch products just because there is some new fancy thing out on the market.</li>
            <li>This triple clenan anti-bacterial lathering cleanse is a new try for me.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll wake up and your face with be almost completely healed!</li>
            <li>Not only does it keep my face consistently about 90% clear</li>
            <li>First of all, they sent me the Noxzema Ultimate Clear instead of this one.</li>
            <li>Also, my moderate-to-severe acne is pretty much already under control; I am on several prescription acne medications, both oral and topical.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past but this one is more effective and cost  much less than the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>When you first use it you&#x27;ll notice it burns twice as much as any other brand</li>
            <li>In other hands it makes the skin super soft.</li>
            <li>I work out a lot and my sensitive skin breaks out from the sweating.  </li>
            <li>I have had acne since I was about 9 years old, and I have  tried everything out there, including going to a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>so i think this will go far for the money.</li>
            <li>This plus evening primrose oil caps have almost completely gotten rid of my acne.  </li>
            <li>Very silky and smooth, cleans extremely well, lots of lather, and just a tiny bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only found triclosan in 2 other face cleansers (both from super high-end companies) and they were too drying, had too much fragrance, and ultimately caused me to break out.</li>
            <li>Other than that it keeps my skin pretty clear.</li>
            <li>I use plenty of expensive dermatology recommended products, but this is by far one of my favorite ...and cheapest!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how well this would work on its own for someone still suffering from active, moderate-to-severe breakouts.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s rebranded with the same formula or a new formula, but the triple clean was recommended to me and so far it seems to be working as a cleanser.</li>
            <li>For those with occasional, milder breakouts and very oily skin, this is a terrific option.</li>
            <li>One of the major causes of acne is bacteria.  </li>
            <li>If only they had this in town near me!</li>
            <li>Since using this and Bare Minerals makeup I have not had a zit in 2 years!</li>
            <li>It is just anti-bacterial, but that is apparently what I needed!</li>
            <li>I can really tell that it washes away dirt and bacteria, leaving behind refreshed clean skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s identical to Clearasil&#x27;s old Daily Face</li>
            <li>I have battled acne since I was a teen and into my adult years as well.</li>
            <li>Only used a couple of times so far, hope it will help my acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always use the original noxzema but decided to try this since I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of acne lately</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 years and it is the only facial cleanser that hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts and keeps my face mostly clear, besides around the time of the month and food allergies.</li>
            <li>I recently changed to this face wash because my old standby, Clearasil&#x27;s Daily Oil-Free Face Wash, changed their formula and made me break out.</li>
            <li>It would definitely help with oily skin, but it wouldn&#x27;t do much by itself for severely active skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry, oily and acne prone skin, and this face wash helps deal with all of these issues.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing I can find that does not dry out or irritate my skin, and it actually keeps my acne under control.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Thank you, Noxzema, for such a great face wash.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so darn cheap</li>
            <li> Also wouldn&#x27;t be good for those sensitive to lots of fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and clean, fresh feeling</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s significantly softer, and feels significantly cleaner.</li>
            <li> However, this product is nothing like the original.  </li>
            <li> but if you use it right before bed, have a new pillow case, and get a good nights rest</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling remarkably clean and pimples drying up just after 1st use.  </li>
            <li> This is the repackaged and rebranded Triple Clean Anti-Bacterial Lathering Cleanser</li>
            <li> Leaves my face squeaky clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Great face soap and so much easier to dispense than the old fashion tub.</li>
            <li> After the first wash, my face felt soooo clean!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY face wash I&#x27;ve found that does any good at all for my acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> Hay guys try it your woman will love you because your skin will be much cleaner.</li>
            <li> that said, this is still a good option, especially if you don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li> You would still need a full anti-acne regimen along with this.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Noxzema, it felt like my face was actually clean.</li>
            <li> It has a light, pleasantly soapy scent and DOESN&#x27;T have any micro-beads (which sometimes leave my skin feeling raw).</li>
            <li> my skin had been clear most of my life</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, and most products irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective AND it&#x27;s really cheap compared to Cetaphil and other acne cleansers.</li>
            <li> so I can apply it right after I rinse out my conditioner.</li>
            <li> it really does clean.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it too, although he doesn&#x27;t get much acne, he likes that it keeps his face clean.</li>
            <li> This one is particularly nice because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but keeps break-outs away.  </li>
            <li> Super fast delivery</li>
            <li> But after a month of using the anti-bacterial (which is more of a cream), I still have lots of dirt left on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does a great job cleaning the face; the cream is a bit thick, which I like.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t seem to over-dry either!</li>
            <li> Noxzema however, cleared up the rash within the first use.</li>
            <li> I started seeing acne when i first used it for couple of days.</li>
            <li> If anyone is interested, I found this article on Ayurveda and hormonal</li>
            <li> My face was soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I only discovered this about 2 months ago, and after using it in that time I&#x27;ve fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li> It smells kinda funny...</li>
            <li> Got the product in a timely fashion, was wonderfull and does exactly as it says.</li>
            <li> First the \\&quot;Clearasil STAY</li>
            <li> I really like it!  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t clean your face any better than loads of other products    </li>
            <li> Finally, aloe leaf is a nice addition that makes sure it doesn&#x27;t dry out the face too much.</li>
            <li> If you do care, you&#x27;ll struggle with guilt every time you use it, and then the guilt will be replaced by pleasure at seeing clean clear skin.</li>
            <li> the guilt will be replaced by pleasure at seeing clean clear skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my clean so soft</li>
            <li> I ordered these online because I thought I would get the old triple Clean cleanser</li>
            <li> Noxzema&#x27;s Triple Clean Face Wash is almost identical to Clearasil&#x27;s old version and might be even better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been having positive results with it.</li>
            <li> I had been using gentle hand soap because of its antibacterial properties, but it was drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li> wanted a face wash that was gentle, removes dirt and oil, and kills germs.  </li>
            <li> cuz I didn&#x27;t care much.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product.</li>
            <li> And in this case, this product hasn&#x27;t really helped my jawline.</li>
            <li> I like Cetaphil because it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li> fast and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have VERY oily, breakout-prone skin</li>
            <li> In fact, it can be VERY drying even for my skin.</li>
            <li> gentle and gets the job done</li>
            <li> This product works effectively at a very resonable price.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day morning and night, it cleans very well with just a tip of cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an acne product that was much lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My go to for clear skin!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser that left my skin feeling clean, refreshed, and ready to face the day.</li>
            <li> Does it work any better than LOADS of other products?</li>
            <li> The derm doc said it was hormonal adult acne - thanks peri-menopause!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I wasn&#x27;t suffering from hormonal acne, this product would work well for average acne issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Triclosan is a great anti-bacterial that gets rid of stubborn acne that doesn&#x27;t respond to other typical cleansers.</li>
            <li> This does all of that, and even has a decent scent.  </li>
            <li> Noxzema is classic.</li>
            <li> This does not dry my face out, has a clean smell and is not harsh on my face at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The most important part of this cleanser is that it&#x27;s non-comedogenic, so you never have to worry about it clogging your pores or making acne worse.</li>
            <li> I love the old-fashioned Noxzema cleanser in the big blue jar.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product when i received it.  </li>
            <li> I get next to nothing for raised bumps, and it works even better when i use a mild exfolient (gets into the pores easier when you lift off the dead skin).</li>
            <li> Noxzema Ultimate Clear Anti-Bacterial Lathering Cleanser leaves my skin feeling extremely clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive to lots of cleanser, original Noxzema cleanser had worked wonder for me for a long time.</li>
            <li> I also love that my face doesn&#x27;t feel dried out after washing.</li>
            <li> This product works well and seems to reduce new breakouts.</li>
            <li> I will not switch products just because there is some new fancy thing out on the market.</li>
            <li> This triple clenan anti-bacterial lathering cleanse is a new try for me.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll wake up and your face with be almost completely healed!</li>
            <li> Not only does it keep my face consistently about 90% clear</li>
            <li> First of all, they sent me the Noxzema Ultimate Clear instead of this one.</li>
            <li> Also, my moderate-to-severe acne is pretty much already under control; I am on several prescription acne medications, both oral and topical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past but this one is more effective and cost  much less than the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> When you first use it you&#x27;ll notice it burns twice as much as any other brand</li>
            <li> In other hands it makes the skin super soft.</li>
            <li> I work out a lot and my sensitive skin breaks out from the sweating.  </li>
            <li> I have had acne since I was about 9 years old, and I have  tried everything out there, including going to a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> so i think this will go far for the money.</li>
            <li> This plus evening primrose oil caps have almost completely gotten rid of my acne.  </li>
            <li> Very silky and smooth, cleans extremely well, lots of lather, and just a tiny bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only found triclosan in 2 other face cleansers (both from super high-end companies) and they were too drying, had too much fragrance, and ultimately caused me to break out.</li>
            <li> Other than that it keeps my skin pretty clear.</li>
            <li> I use plenty of expensive dermatology recommended products, but this is by far one of my favorite ...and cheapest!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well this would work on its own for someone still suffering from active, moderate-to-severe breakouts.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s rebranded with the same formula or a new formula, but the triple clean was recommended to me and so far it seems to be working as a cleanser.</li>
            <li> For those with occasional, milder breakouts and very oily skin, this is a terrific option.</li>
            <li> One of the major causes of acne is bacteria.  </li>
            <li> If only they had this in town near me!</li>
            <li> Since using this and Bare Minerals makeup I have not had a zit in 2 years!</li>
            <li> It is just anti-bacterial, but that is apparently what I needed!</li>
            <li> I can really tell that it washes away dirt and bacteria, leaving behind refreshed clean skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s identical to Clearasil&#x27;s old Daily Face</li>
            <li> I have battled acne since I was a teen and into my adult years as well.</li>
            <li> Only used a couple of times so far, hope it will help my acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always use the original noxzema but decided to try this since I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of acne lately</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 years and it is the only facial cleanser that hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts and keeps my face mostly clear, besides around the time of the month and food allergies.</li>
            <li> I recently changed to this face wash because my old standby, Clearasil&#x27;s Daily Oil-Free Face Wash, changed their formula and made me break out.</li>
            <li> It would definitely help with oily skin, but it wouldn&#x27;t do much by itself for severely active skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry, oily and acne prone skin, and this face wash helps deal with all of these issues.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I can find that does not dry out or irritate my skin, and it actually keeps my acne under control.</li>
            <li> It is very lightly scented and has a thick, creamy texture when it comes out of the tube, but it DOES lather and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Triclosan or whatever the ingredient used is a simple common handsoap ingredient, but something with this product is much better than the common handsoap on my skin and helps my acne (unlike the handsoap that has the same ingredient).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sadly, I learned that jawline acne is hormonal, so a gentle topical treatment won&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft, not stripped dry like other cleansers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but it has helped reduce my acne enormously.  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to seeing the long term benefits.</li>
            <li> you will need a moisturizer for this, at first I broke out a little  bit but pores eventually got smaller, Its kinda hard to find</li>
            <li> I found it after so long in Amazon and bought 6 bottles!</li>
            <li> It cleans my face without leaving it dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out either.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t over dry my face.  </li>
            <li> I was using St. Ives for a while because it claims to be all natural, but one day after washing my face, my cousin told me to use one of her Noxzema Facial Pads to see if dirt was still left behind...</li>
            <li> &quot; line was the only one with this formula; once the patent for it expired, Noxzema (P &amp; G) got a hold of it, and though the formula remained the same the Noxzema tube has thicker plastic and slightly less product, so it costs a little less than the \\&quot;original\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Not like other facial cleansers that make your face feel crackly and stiff.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I had never even thought to try Noxema, until one day Walmart was out of my other face wash.</li>
            <li> it does dry out your skin but nothing a little moisturizer can&#x27;t fix.  </li>
            <li> I like this product except for the tiny granular residue that gets left behind.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it dries out my face a bit.</li>
            <li> Now as far as dryness, as of yet I have not experienced any problems in this area.</li>
            <li> Got this to use once a day to hopefully prevent those random little suckers and keep my face clean.</li>
            <li> also I see less pimples since using this cleanser.</li>
            <li> My wife even agreed that my face felt less oily and smoother.</li>
            <li> But i&#x27;ve noticed my breakouts during the day are significantly less when I use this to wash my face, too.</li>
            <li> I had an awful sandpaper like rash on my face for a few months that would flare up with the slightest touch of soap or facial cleanser touching it.</li>
            <li> It foams well, and it keeps the little staph bumps away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used proactive, however I tried this product since proactive was just too harsh on my skin and didn&#x27;t help my acne</li>
            <li> Washes off my tough eyeliner and mascara, cleans my skin and doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> It cleared up my pimples without irritating my skin and didnâ€™t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> but I find it sometimes in small department stores.</li>
            <li> but i just started getting a lot of acne during this past year.  </li>
            <li> I have a very bad skin, and I use this product every night after I clean my make up</li>
            <li> Ordered this product for my wife because it seems she has a hard time finding</li>
            <li> I got some in bulk to stock up for a while, but without this, i don&#x27;t know what my poor little skin cells would do.</li>
            <li> the tube it comes in is a bit clumsy, so</li>
            <li> and at least you know it&#x27;s cleaning your pores.</li>
            <li> The lather is also thick and creamy, but don&#x27;t be fooled by that: this is not a moisturizing cleanser.</li>
            <li> The scent is different, the container itself is very difficult to squeeze the product through.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Dries your skin out terribly, I have very dry skin in general</li>
            <li> For some reason starting August, I got a bad case of chin acne that nothing was working.  </li>
            <li> This product has saved me multiple times when I&#x27;ve had bad breakouts.</li>
            <li> and considering the benefits of no longer having horrible acne, i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> The secret ingredient?</li>
            <li> problem.&lt;br /&gt;Proactive is known for irritating the skin, so</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ll always have those annoying pimples that pop up, but it used to be MUCH worse), but it also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have terrible skin, but I do get the occasional zit.</li>
            <li> Needless to say</li>
            <li> It started as blind pimples at the corners of my mouth that spread to my chin.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to find an anti-bacterial that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot of money.  </li>
            <li> Stick with the classics and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Because the company that owns Noxzema (Proctor &amp; Gamble) does testing on animals and pollutes like crazy.</li>
            <li> The BAD:  </li>
            <li> so now I have to buy another one :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was the worst I had ever seen it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this cleanser. I can really tell that it washes away dirt and bacteria, leaving behind refreshed clean skin. I also love that my face doesn&#x27;t feel dried out after washing. This is now my favorite cleanser!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. This is the ONLY face wash I&#x27;ve found that does any good at all for my acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried a TON of acne face washes over the years. I had never even thought to try Noxema, until one day Walmart was out of my other face wash. I saw it and figured, what the heck, I&#x27;ll give it a shot. I have not gone back since! This stuff is amazing! Not only does it keep my face consistently about 90% clear (I&#x27;ll always have those annoying pimples that pop up, but it used to be MUCH worse), but it also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin! I love love it!</li>
            <li> The GOOD:  -It cleans your face    The BAD:  -It doesn&#x27;t clean your face any better than loads of other products    I don&#x27;t have terrible skin, but I do get the occasional zit. Got this to use once a day to hopefully prevent those random little suckers and keep my face clean. Does it work? Yeah, sorta. Does it work any better than LOADS of other products? Nah.     Recommended: Nope</li>
            <li> I was looking for this product at CVS and could not find it. My mother got me started with Noxzema in 1950.. never used soap on my face, For a man that is something to talk about.. Hay guys try it your woman will love you because your skin will be much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I got this because I could not find the  Noxema anti-blemish cleanser. It is okay, but it doesn&#x27;t cleanse as well. The anti blemish cleanser has microbeads that exfoliate my skin. When I follow up with a witch hazel or Noxema&#x27;s anti-blemish cleansing pads, I see no residue. But after a month of using the anti-bacterial (which is more of a cream), I still have lots of dirt left on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, this is still a good option, especially if you don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup. I noticed my blemishes were still getting lighter, and my breakouts were still kept to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars only because I cleaned my skin prior to applying it, and I still had residue when using my toner.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and product line. Been using it since I was a teenager, and it has controlled my breakouts for years. My go to for clear skin!!!</li>
            <li> One of the major causes of acne is bacteria.  I had been using gentle hand soap because of its antibacterial properties, but it was drying out my skin.  This face wash is the best of both worlds.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but it has helped reduce my acne enormously.  I have sensitive, dry, oily and acne prone skin, and this face wash helps deal with all of these issues.</li>
            <li> Does a great job cleaning the face; the cream is a bit thick, which I like.  I have been having positive results with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, gives your face a very clean, refreshed feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Dries your skin out terribly, I have very dry skin in general you will need a moisturizer for this, at first I broke out a little  bit but pores eventually got smaller, Its kinda hard to find but I find it sometimes in small department stores.</li>
            <li> I started using this product once Clearsil changed the formula of their daily face wash.  Clearasil used to contain Triclosan (antibacterial) which I found was really effective against my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a face wash that was gentle, removes dirt and oil, and kills germs.  This does all of that, and even has a decent scent.  It really doesn&#x27;t seem to over-dry either!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling remarkably clean and pimples drying up just after 1st use.  Looking forward to seeing the long term benefits.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for anti-bacterial fighting and to keep completion clear.</li>
            <li> I was using St. Ives for a while because it claims to be all natural, but one day after washing my face, my cousin told me to use one of her Noxzema Facial Pads to see if dirt was still left behind... Needless to say but it was a wrap for St. Ives. So out of curiosity I purchased this product, and I can honestly say if it doesn&#x27;t do nothing else it really does clean. I had a blackhead on my lip for over two years and after using this product it all just burst out I was amazed how deeply and thoroughly the product cleaned my face.  Now as far as dryness, as of yet I have not experienced any problems in this area.</li>
            <li> I had an awful sandpaper like rash on my face for a few months that would flare up with the slightest touch of soap or facial cleanser touching it. I tried many cleansers and medicated creams and none helped. Noxzema however, cleared up the rash within the first use. I would say thats amazing.</li>
            <li> have used this product for several years now and continue to be amazed at how it cleans and protects your skin.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely best face wash ever. It cleans my face perfectly without striping it. It also removes all of my makeup. It makes my clean so soft also I see less pimples since using this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I use this to clean my beard, and it works great.  It foams well, and it keeps the little staph bumps away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with my recent Noxzema purchase. I love the fact that it isn&#x27;t oily and it does not smell medicated. It has a fresh light fragrance to it that is very appealing. The cleanser is light, easy to apply and easy to remove as well. It&#x27;s definitely a great value and amount for the price.</li>
            <li> First of all, they sent me the Noxzema Ultimate Clear instead of this one. I jux stuck to it cuz I didn&#x27;t care much. I started seeing acne when i first used it for couple of days. But now it seems tat my skin has gotten used the product n has gotten better. In other hands it makes the skin super soft.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at the drug store on impulse.  This is not my mother&#x27;s Noxzema that never worked on my teenage breakouts.  For some reason starting August, I got a bad case of chin acne that nothing was working.  It started as blind pimples at the corners of my mouth that spread to my chin.  I decided to try this and immediately I noticed the next morning that the redness went away.  Within a week, it cleared up without over drying.  The acne never came back.  The visit to the dermatologist once it was cleared up (went to him for another issue), he said my skin looks great.  The derm doc said it was hormonal adult acne - thanks peri-menopause!</li>
            <li> HOLY MACARONIS! I absolutely adore this product. I have bought literally EVERYTHING off the shelf and a lot of organic products for my acne prone/oily skin and this one tops them all, and for a low price! I bought this at a local walmart. It was a simple antibacterial face wash and so I thought to myself, if everything else hasn&#x27;t worked than maybe I just need something to kill the bacteria on my face. After the first wash, my face felt soooo clean! Squeaky clean! I didn&#x27;t need a toner but just a good moisturizer. I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 years and it is the only facial cleanser that hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts and keeps my face mostly clear, besides around the time of the month and food allergies. My husband loves it too, although he doesn&#x27;t get much acne, he likes that it keeps his face clean.</li>
            <li> I recently broke out on my jaw line. This was the worst I had ever seen it. I read all the wonderful reviews on this product and took a chance. Sadly, I learned that jawline acne is hormonal, so a gentle topical treatment won&#x27;t work very well. And in this case, this product hasn&#x27;t really helped my jawline. However, I must say that the rest of my face looks and feels wonderful. I used to use Cetaphil. I like Cetaphil because it&#x27;s gentle. But I prefer the way my skin feels after I use Noxzema Triple Cream. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;m sure if I wasn&#x27;t suffering from hormonal acne, this product would work well for average acne issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still researching hormonal acne and what I can do about it. If anyone is interested, I found this article on Ayurveda and hormonal acne:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.holisticvanity.ca/chin-and-jawline-break-outs-what-is-your-acne-saying-about-your-health/</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Noxzema, it felt like my face was actually clean. Not like other facial cleansers that make your face feel crackly and stiff. My face was soft and smooth. My wife even agreed that my face felt less oily and smoother. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a genuine face cleanser</li>
            <li> It cleans my face without leaving it dry. Would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> This product works well and seems to reduce new breakouts. It doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out either. However, it has to be used after a make up remover type cleanser because it won&#x27;t get your make up off. Also, it has that string Noxema smell which I like but not be everyone&#x27;s cup of tea. Also wouldn&#x27;t be good for those sensitive to lots of fragrance.</li>
            <li> I ordered these online because I thought I would get the old triple Clean cleanser but what arrived was the Ultimate Cleanser that I could have bought at the store anyway. Not sure if it&#x27;s rebranded with the same formula or a new formula, but the triple clean was recommended to me and so far it seems to be working as a cleanser.</li>
            <li> I currently use a mixture of prescribed medications - Adapolene, and Clindamyacin are part of my daily routine. But i&#x27;ve noticed my breakouts during the day are significantly less when I use this to wash my face, too. And it&#x27;s significantly softer, and feels significantly cleaner. I get next to nothing for raised bumps, and it works even better when i use a mild exfolient (gets into the pores easier when you lift off the dead skin). If only they had this in town near me! I got some in bulk to stock up for a while, but without this, i don&#x27;t know what my poor little skin cells would do. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the repackaged and rebranded Triple Clean Anti-Bacterial Lathering Cleanser so it works just as well for me. What i didn&#x27;t like was all the confusion the change of name brought about. Noxzema and the seller didn&#x27;t even announce that the name had already been changed so when I got the item, I almost returned it.</li>
            <li> works great, covers so well you only need a speck and LASTS FOREVER</li>
            <li> Just started using this product last December 2014.  I work out a lot and my sensitive skin breaks out from the sweating.  I&#x27;ve tried everything....  I&#x27;ve dealt with break outs for decades.  I thought it was just the price to keep fit.  Nope.  I shower with this at the gym and my skin stays smooth.  I do not use it on my face.) I ran into this on accident and I&#x27;m so happy I did.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find an anti-bacterial that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot of money.  This one is particularly nice because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but keeps break-outs away.  I will continue buying. it.  (Tip:  the tube it comes in is a bit clumsy, so I just put the stuff into another bottle and it works fine.)</li>
            <li> Ordered this product for my wife because it seems she has a hard time finding&lt;br /&gt;it in local stores. She loves the product and has used it for quite awhile. Shipping&lt;br /&gt;was fast and will buy again.</li>
            <li> it does dry out your skin but nothing a little moisturizer can&#x27;t fix.  and at least you know it&#x27;s cleaning your pores. and considering the benefits of no longer having horrible acne, i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it.  my skin had been clear most of my life but i just started getting a lot of acne during this past year.  tried so many well reviewed products but this was the only one that delivered any noticeable results.  my skin cleared up in about a week.</li>
            <li> I only discovered this about 2 months ago, and after using it in that time I&#x27;ve fallen in love with it. It&#x27;s identical to Clearasil&#x27;s old Daily Face Wash. I have VERY oily, breakout-prone skin and this has been a terrific option in all but the coldest, driest weather. It is very lightly scented and has a thick, creamy texture when it comes out of the tube, but it DOES lather and a little goes a long way. The lather is also thick and creamy, but don&#x27;t be fooled by that: this is not a moisturizing cleanser. In fact, it can be VERY drying even for my skin. I can&#x27;t recommend this for normal-to-dry skin, even if it&#x27;s breakout-prone. Also, my moderate-to-severe acne is pretty much already under control; I am on several prescription acne medications, both oral and topical. I&#x27;m not sure how well this would work on its own for someone still suffering from active, moderate-to-severe breakouts. It would definitely help with oily skin, but it wouldn&#x27;t do much by itself for severely active skin. You would still need a full anti-acne regimen along with this. For those with occasional, milder breakouts and very oily skin, this is a terrific option.</li>
            <li> I was really happy with this. It has a light, pleasantly soapy scent and DOESN&#x27;T have any micro-beads (which sometimes leave my skin feeling raw). It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser that left my skin feeling clean, refreshed, and ready to face the day.</li>
            <li> This product has saved me multiple times when I&#x27;ve had bad breakouts. I always have a tube of it in the shower so I can apply it right after I rinse out my conditioner. When you first use it you&#x27;ll notice it burns twice as much as any other brand but if you use it right before bed, have a new pillow case, and get a good nights rest you&#x27;ll wake up and your face with be almost completely healed!</li>
            <li> Cleans nicely and feels refreshing. It smells kinda funny... not at all like the regular eucalyptus noxzema.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I have had acne since I was about 9 years old, and I have  tried everything out there, including going to a dermatologist.  I have really sensitive skin, and most products irritate my skin. This is the only thing I can find that does not dry out or irritate my skin, and it actually keeps my acne under control. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t give many 5 star reviews, but this product deserves it. I just wish they sold it in my local stores. I have battled acne since I was a teen and into my adult years as well. When you realize acne is bacteria, you think to buy a wash that has antibacterial qualities. Noxzema is classic. Stick with the classics and you can&#x27;t go wrong. This does not dry my face out, has a clean smell and is not harsh on my face at all. I cannot use anything with salycilic acid(sp) or I get a red rash. I will not switch products just because there is some new fancy thing out on the market. I stick with this because it works. I recommend it highly. Since using this and Bare Minerals makeup I have not had a zit in 2 years!</li>
            <li> Got the product in a timely fashion, was wonderfull and does exactly as it says. I will be sure to order again.</li>
            <li> First the \\&quot;Clearasil STAY CLEAR\\&quot; line was the only one with this formula; once the patent for it expired, Noxzema (P &amp; G) got a hold of it, and though the formula remained the same the Noxzema tube has thicker plastic and slightly less product, so it costs a little less than the \\&quot;original\\&quot;. I had acne at fifteen which cleared up in about 2 weeks once I started using this (at the time it was still Clearasil&#x27;s \\&quot;Stay Clear\\&quot;). Twenty years later I STILL USE IT and I don&#x27;t have acne issues unless I use another product. The secret ingredient? TRICLOSAN. I&#x27;ve only found triclosan in 2 other face cleansers (both from super high-end companies) and they were too drying, had too much fragrance, and ultimately caused me to break out. So since this product has worked so well for me, why only 3 stars? Because the company that owns Noxzema (Proctor &amp; Gamble) does testing on animals and pollutes like crazy. If you don&#x27;t care about any of that you will LOVE this. If you do care, you&#x27;ll struggle with guilt every time you use it, and then the guilt will be replaced by pleasure at seeing clean clear skin. Just...don&#x27;t...think...about...the...bunnies.hen the guilt will be replaced by pleasure at seeing clean clear skin. Just...don&#x27;t...think...about...the...bunnies.</li>
            <li> I love it!! I found it after so long in Amazon and bought 6 bottles! I love this product! I have a very bad skin, and I use this product every night after I clean my make up off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a must have for me!</li>
            <li> I like this product except for the tiny granular residue that gets left behind. Other than that it keeps my skin pretty clear.</li>
            <li> Lathers up great, need only a pea sized amount so i think this will go far for the money. Leaves my face squeaky clean feeling. Only used a couple of times so far, hope it will help my acne.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it dries out my face a bit.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face wash! I recently changed to this face wash because my old standby, Clearasil&#x27;s Daily Oil-Free Face Wash, changed their formula and made me break out. Noxzema&#x27;s Triple Clean Face Wash is almost identical to Clearasil&#x27;s old version and might be even better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important part of this cleanser is that it&#x27;s non-comedogenic, so you never have to worry about it clogging your pores or making acne worse. Triclosan is a great anti-bacterial that gets rid of stubborn acne that doesn&#x27;t respond to other typical cleansers. Finally, aloe leaf is a nice addition that makes sure it doesn&#x27;t dry out the face too much. I still use Cetaphil&#x27;s facial moisturizer, though, because almost any cleanser dries my face out too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Noxzema, for such a great face wash. It&#x27;s effective AND it&#x27;s really cheap compared to Cetaphil and other acne cleansers. I hope they never stop making this stuff!</li>
            <li> Noxzema Ultimate Clear Anti-Bacterial Lathering Cleanser leaves my skin feeling extremely clean and refreshed. It has a very light, uplifting scent. It cleared up my pimples without irritating my skin and didnâ€™t dry out my skin. It lathers up easily and doesnâ€™t feel oily. I could feel and see a difference in my skin condition almost immediately after using this cleanser. I am impressed at how much better my skin looks since I started using it. I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past but this one is more effective and cost  much less than the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> gentle and gets the job done</li>
            <li> seems to do the trick!</li>
            <li> This product works effectively at a very resonable price. I would recommend this to anyone that has oily skin and problems with acne.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day morning and night, it cleans very well with just a tip of cream. My skin is very sensitive to lots of cleanser, original Noxzema cleanser had worked wonder for me for a long time. This triple clenan anti-bacterial lathering cleanse is a new try for me. I had used it for 2 months, it works great so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used proactive, however I tried this product since proactive was just too harsh on my skin and didn&#x27;t help my acne problem.&lt;br /&gt;Proactive is known for irritating the skin, so I&#x27;ve been searching for an acne product that was much lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it for a week and noticed my acne disappearing, unfortunately I left my bottle at work so now I have to buy another one :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Triclosan or whatever the ingredient used is a simple common handsoap ingredient, but something with this product is much better than the common handsoap on my skin and helps my acne (unlike the handsoap that has the same ingredient).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it it&#x27;s so darn cheap it&#x27;s for sure going to help clean your skin if it doesn&#x27;t help your acne.</li>
            <li> I love the old-fashioned Noxzema cleanser in the big blue jar.  This is even better!  Very silky and smooth, cleans extremely well, lots of lather, and just a tiny bit goes a long way.  This product would be great for men to use as a shaving cream with the added advantage of killing bacteria.  Leaves skin soft, not stripped dry like other cleansers.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product when i received it.  I love the smell and clean, fresh feeling i get when i use regular Noxzema.  However, this product is nothing like the original.  The scent is different, the container itself is very difficult to squeeze the product through.  I actually broke out when i began using this on a regular basis!  I would recommend anyone using the regular Noxzema wash to stick to it, you won&#x27;t be receiving the same benefits by switching to this version.</li>
            <li> This plus evening primrose oil caps have almost completely gotten rid of my acne.  I really like it!  And it doesn&#x27;t over dry my face.  I was using stuff with acne fighting junk in it like salycilic acid and the like.  Nope!  It is just anti-bacterial, but that is apparently what I needed!</li>
            <li> i love this face cleanser its doesin&#x27;t break me out and the price is amazing i would recommend this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;m so glad I found it on here because they stopped stocking it at my wal-mart.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery and it&#x27;s working great so far! I&#x27;ve always use the original noxzema but decided to try this since I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of acne lately and my face is loving it.</li>
            <li> read labels, i buy this one too but i thought this was the scrub ;(</li>
            <li> Bit expensive but seems to work ok</li>
            <li> Great face soap and so much easier to dispense than the old fashion tub. Love this product and the tingly clean feeling I get after each use.</li>
            <li> Washes off my tough eyeliner and mascara, cleans my skin and doesn&#x27;t dry out. I also love how  my skin feels in the morning after I wake up. I use plenty of expensive dermatology recommended products, but this is by far one of my favorite ...and cheapest!</li>
