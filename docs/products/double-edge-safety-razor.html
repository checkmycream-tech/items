            <li>Just about perfect...</li>
            <li>You ARE going to have to take a month or so to find the best blades for your face, learn your technique, and teach yourself that you just don&#x27;t use pressure with these things (there will be blood otherwise).</li>
            <li>The chrome finish is perfect in all aspects.</li>
            <li>Great for gift giving!</li>

            <li>Man what a great razor!</li>
            <li>This is an awesome razor.</li>
            <li>That being said, my buddy is very very happy with it.</li>
            <li>But no, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>One of the best things is...</li>
            <li>it locks the blade in; perfectly and evenly, every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found this razor to be the perfect weight and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s awesome for buying me this awesome gift.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s excellent.</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;ll have to say that it&#x27;s performing flawlessly.</li>
            <li>I also got Edwin Jagger&#x27;s best badger brush because of the price</li>
            <li>Excellent razor.</li>
            <li>Six months on, and moving to DE razors is still one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li>Again, this style is wonderful, but beware of the plastic coverings.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a month  with absolutely wonderful results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had the best shave of my life using this razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And if you want the best shave, throw the blade out after one use, it&#x27;s 13 cents, not going to break</li>
            <li>Might be perfect for some but not me.</li>
            <li>This is the best razor that I even had!!!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s included blades gave me an awesome shave in no time at all.</li>
            <li>However, whether that would have been the case or not - the blade on this DE86 is perfectly aligned and held rock-solid in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This Razor is awesome!!!</li>
            <li>Has a wonderful head on it, maybe one of the best in the business!!</li>
            <li>Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>If the blade had fitted perfectly I would have given it 5 stars.  </li>

            <li>I also have a Feather razor (the $ 20 by Jatai) and that handle is a good deal longer.</li>
            <li>good close shave.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know that I was getting into an obsession, but I have loved every part about it.</li>

            <li>Excellent, mild razor.</li>

            <li>Very pleased with this razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get infinitely more mileage out of it and it&#x27;s a great value over the store bought disposable razors.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love mine!</li>
            <li>He was so excited that and happy about the gift for him from me and agreed that I made a good choice.</li>
            <li>An excellent choice if you&#x27;re thinking of getting this as your first shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I must say that for my first safety razor, I thought I made the perfect choice!</li>

            <li>I love the Edwin Jagger!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I decided to return!  </li>
            <li>It is beautiful out of the box and delivers a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>pretty awesome razor until you drop it.</li>
            <li>I have always used cartridges, but even my first time with this was probably the best shave of my life.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and looks great.</li>
            <li>Great balance; easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>Easily one of the best looking and comfortable razors in this price range.</li>
            <li>This is a fine razor with a great weight to it.</li>
            <li>Very nice looking and easy to assemble for use.</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>Great weight and balance, doesn&#x27;t slip, even with the smooth handle.</li>
            <li>The weight feels great in the hand and ensures a smooth shaving experience every time.</li>
            <li>This razor is amazing.</li>
            <li>amazing-</li>
            <li>and  it blows my mind how amazing this razor is.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor to anyone looking for a nice safety razor to start out with.</li>
            <li>This thing gives me the absolute best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy, with great heft in the head to provide sufficient pressure against the face, it&#x27;s a cinch to unscrew to replace the blade, and it looks great too.  </li>
            <li>The weight is perfect and makes the whole &amp;#34;let the razor&#x27;s weight do the work&amp;#34; thing a breeze.</li>
            <li>My three star is partly my own fault.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely thrilled with my decision to try this.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a kind of mini FAQ I put together based on my own concerns:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the result is good though it cost me more time every morning.</li>
            <li>I own a Merkur 180, a Parker 96R, and this razor, and</li>
            <li>I found the razor to be nicely balanced.  </li>
            <li>Nice, shiny and elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I own 4 DE razors...</li>
            <li>but gives a nice even shave.</li>
            <li>Was between the Merkur and Edwin Jagger, liked the handle on this one.</li>
            <li>It is stylish, it has a good weight</li>
            <li>Do yourself a good service and start shaving with a safety razor, you&#x27;ll get a better shave</li>
            <li>nice by the sink&lt;br /&gt;well</li>
            <li>Medium aggressiveness with a nice chrome finish on the head.</li>
            <li>, it has a nice finish.</li>
            <li>good safety razor love the look</li>
            <li>I own the ebony, ivory and chrome models.  </li>
            <li>After about two good uses, I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>but it fits in perfectly and really looks nice too.</li>
            <li>Looks nice also.</li>
            <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell any difference and</li>
            <li>honestly have no clue why men switched from these to the plastic disposables.</li>
            <li>and she wants one just like it, because it was the best razor she ever used.</li>
            <li>Nice weight and feel.  </li>
            <li>I liked the set</li>
            <li>I did a ton of research and loved this razor more for the looks than anything else.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a nice weight to it</li>
            <li>Looking through the packaging that I kept, I see that there&#x27;s no mention of any kind of warranty.</li>
            <li>It comes with a 5-pack of derby blades which is nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d still recommend Edwin Jagger Razors (it shaved really nice before it broke)</li>
            <li>and I had to own one for myself.  </li>
            <li>Nice razor.</li>
            <li>It is well balanced so you won&#x27;t have to apply any real pressure or worry about nicking yourself if your grip isn&#x27;t perfect.</li>
            <li>Nice beginner razor.</li>
            <li>nice finish.</li>
            <li>Seemed to work well, nice shave.</li>
            <li>Nice construction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To use this kind of construction on a razor of this price and &#x27;pedigree&#x27; is shameful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the durability of this razor is still nice.</li>
            <li>Great razor, great price, very durable.</li>
            <li>They match up really nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice razor, but it slipped out of my hand in the shower and broke.</li>
            <li>It is beautiful and has a good weight to it, so it can easily slide across your skin, leaving you baby butt smooth.</li>
            <li>A very nice, comfortable razor.</li>
            <li>and the top is rounded perfectly to give you a consistent razor angle against your skin.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t much more expense than the competition, so if you positively love nice things, buy EJ!</li>
            <li>I also have a Ballie that was a pretty inexpensive but very good razor.  </li>
            <li>Free blades are a nice bonus!</li>
            <li>Attractive, good weight, not too aggressive, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon and the razor was replaced with a new one which is perfect.</li>
            <li>quite a beautiful razor, very elegant and really well crafted.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this razor,just superb.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve done a good job selling us on the idea that more blades on a razor is better, no matter WHAT the cost.</li>
            <li>The Jagger shaving heads are excellent and this razor looks very classy but the slickness of the handle is a deal killer for me.  </li>
            <li>and it cleans very easily.</li>
            <li>The Derby blades that it came with worked great as a first timer!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely beautiful and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>but like I said they are old but work flawlessly with a variety of blades.</li>
            <li>So smooth, a good heft to it.</li>
            <li>First off this razor is beautiful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s diminutive size takes nothing away from the crisp lines and beautiful chrome</li>
            <li>So Disapointed, a beautiful razor to look at , but did not last, enjoyed it while it held together though, now will look for another brand and type of safety razor, if you are looking for a beautiful work of art for your Razor stand</li>
            <li>Not only is it beautiful but performs great as well.  </li>
            <li>This was my first foray into DE shaving, and I think it&#x27;s one of the best options available for beginners and long-time shavers alike.</li>
            <li>It turns out that super aggressive razor used with duller blades works amazing!</li>
            <li>Easy to use but follow the directions if you have never used this type of razor!  </li>
            <li>The DE by far give the best shaving experiences, shave closer than anything I have used before, and my skin feels a hundred times better.</li>
            <li>He had to order a different kind and is very happy now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very sturdy, nicely built and gives great shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li>great product and very very cost efficient..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also of great quality and very very durable from what i can tell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this is a very good exception.</li>
            <li>I rinsed it again, and a very large (finger-nail sized) piece of the chrome plating fell off the top edge of the razor!!</li>
            <li>As a side note, it arrived three days early, a very pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>I have used MANY and own many razors and this is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>I have not nicked myself and can generally have a wonderfully close shave with 1 pass using the Wilkinsons.</li>
            <li>I had been eye balling this Edwin Jagger for some time now, but had put it off because I was pretty happy with my razor, but decided to splurge on myself and on something I use every day.  </li>
            <li>This is the first safety razor I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Also, be sure to assemble it correctly or your not going to get a good clean cut from it.</li>
            <li>I did a fine job of not gashing my face!</li>
            <li>Blades are held very securely, without a worry about them being misaligned.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and sleek look.</li>
            <li>This razor is very comfortable in the hand and while shaving.</li>
            <li>He said it gave him a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very smooth to shave with.</li>
            <li>It was a work of art and very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>a 4 pack of cartridges can run you a good $20 if you are lucky.</li>
            <li>This razor is super sleek and feels really good in your hand.</li>
            <li>First time using this kind of shaver and from the very start was completely impressed by the ease and closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quality is better than veery good and paired with the Shark Super Chrome (after going through a sampler pack)</li>
            <li>The head of the razor, in particular, is beautifully machined.</li>
            <li>The packaging on this razor is great, very high end feeling.</li>
            <li>If you look like the Brawny man, maybe you could get something more aggressive than this.</li>
            <li>Last thing, as everyone else says, DE razors are the best.</li>
            <li>how many blades were on that disposable razor, but this has changed all that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it, and this is a good razor to start with.</li>
            <li>This razor does an EXCELLENT job and feels solid in your hand.</li>
            <li>so I cannot say for sure that this would be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>t came with some Derby blades which were top notch.  </li>
            <li>However, this razor seems to be well received by most.</li>
            <li>I am a no-fuss type of guy when it comes to shaving, so I&#x27;m not doing more than one-pass.</li>
            <li>Jagger + Feather is a winning combination for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen a razor as well made and elegant as this one.  </li>
            <li>can pay more for a DE razor but why?</li>
            <li>Razor is very well made and performs great.</li>
            <li>but it turns out to be an advantage as it gives you better control.   </li>
            <li>Love Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li>This is a very fancy razor, which does a great job at shaving.</li>
            <li>, it makes so much more sense</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much more cost</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a gadget man, and i love how things work-</li>
            <li>Outstanding razor for the price.</li>
            <li>I was out of razor blades and decided I didn&#x27;t want to spend twenty dollars for four more.  </li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Like most experienced people say, let the weight of the razor do the work -- not so much pressure is needed as with the disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>may have gotten over confident with your handling of the razor and forgotten to let the weight of the razor do the work</li>
            <li>The Pearl is much more aggressive, but doesn&#x27;t necessaily give me a better shave.</li>
            <li>Like many of the reviewers here, I got into DE shaving to save on cost of razor blades.  </li>
            <li>This Edwin Jagger is top notch, and under priced.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>I have had for so many years.  </li>
            <li>I still have to perfect my technique but this is definitely the razor for beginners.</li>
            <li>From personal experience, I believe this is a excellent razor.  </li>
            <li>this razor is definitely the best.  </li>
            <li>Hoping it will serve for many years.</li>
            <li>love how the razor feels,</li>
            <li>I also have a Merkur 41 comb DE, this seems to shave more closely without being too aggressive.</li>
            <li>matter the angle or how many passes my beard always</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a more milder shave.  </li>
            <li>I researched for many days before purchasing this Jagger DE Safety Razor.</li>
            <li>The fit and finish looked absolutely perfect and the razor looked quite handsome with the Badger Brush and Clear Acrylic Stand that I purchased separately.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>2 Edwin Jagger razors of which this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the &amp;#34;faux ebony&amp;#34; handle</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;m just more old-school.</li>
            <li>The box looks fancy and the razor itself is sexy.</li>
            <li>I look forward to many shaves.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a good weight to it and is easy to clean and change the blades.</li>
            <li>Once I used it, I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Love the Ebony handle.</li>
            <li>The jury is out as to which will ultimately be my favorite, but for now I&#x27;m using the Jagger and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the heft and build quality.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did my research.  </li>
            <li>well I can get a shave as closeas if not a bit better than my mach 3 ($$$)</li>
            <li>I use soap and a brush, waay better than foam in a can</li>
            <li>Good product worth the money</li>
            <li>I love this DE razor.</li>
            <li>This razor is top of the line.</li>
            <li>Let the blade do most of the work.</li>
            <li>love the feel of the razor.</li>
            <li>I love DE safety razors.</li>
            <li>I dialed into the EJ DE89 based mostly on the quality, and desire for a milder DE shaver to start with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this razor for over four months and really love it.</li>
            <li>For me personally, I love this one.</li>
            <li>You will feel better.</li>
            <li>your wallet will fell better.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>It shaves better, is better constructed, and is cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Love this razor, good clean shave and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>So, I fired up my trusty Amazon to see if I could get a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I did not feel like anything was touching my skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll do more test to see if the burn improves.</li>
            <li>This razor is excellent, gives a close shave, and without the nicks and stubble left by the Futur.  </li>
            <li>I have some Wilkinson sword blades that I like better as they seem to give me a better shave though.</li>
            <li>My face is nice and smooth</li>
            <li>The handle and blades are amazing, but the quality of the head is cheap.  </li>
            <li>I would suspect that many of the buyers have already found this out.  </li>
            <li>I then tried it as well, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase, just bought a years supply of these same razors, [</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read some reviews and spring for better razors, maybe.  </li>
            <li>The chrome is top notch work</li>
            <li>No matter what the purists say, it is okay to use canned shave cream while getting used to this (or forever).</li>
            <li>If you get it, just make sure you let you kids know it isn&#x27;t something to touch.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would look based on the picture.  </li>
            <li>I just take my time and  make sure im not rushed or anything</li>
            <li>Enjoyed the craftsmanship of the razor.</li>
            <li>The overall finish on this razor is flawless.  </li>
            <li>I have another Edwin Jagger with the same head and the blade fits perfectly.  </li>
            <li>so i gave one more razor a try.</li>
            <li>Timeless, durable, and stylish.</li>
            <li>It sure beats the Parker 90R</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be pleased you did.</li>
            <li>Awesome double edge razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s deceptive in that it works better without any pressure on</li>
            <li>I also bought a 32 blade mix pack (2 each of 16 brands) to try with it, so some blades may turn out better, but these work well for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic razor!  </li>
            <li>Best shave I have ever had, with Personna blue label blades.  </li>
            <li>And in my case, it seems to do it better than all the over-priced, multi-blade monstrosities I&#x27;ve stopped using.</li>
            <li>I still cannot believe how many shaves you can get out of one blade, either.</li>
            <li>and I cannot imagine a better razor.</li>
            <li>While putting a razor blade in requires a bit of assembly, the weighty feel and bonus five-pack of Derby blades more than makes up for it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>The handle is compact, which is the appropriate size for the grip you need.</li>
            <li>razor itself is quite striking.</li>
            <li>It does, as others have proclaimed, look lovely.</li>
            <li>Skin is 110% better after shaving this way vs disposable razors.  </li>
            <li>After looking at it most of construction is plastic.</li>
            <li>I didn´t cut my self at all even put more pressure.</li>
            <li>You essentially get the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Operationally though, it works great and produces a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Operationally though, it works great and produces a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>This cuts smooth and effortlessly as it has a nice heft to it</li>
            <li>I love love love this razor.</li>
            <li>: Great for starters and those experienced in wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I invested in this.</li>
            <li>I find the shorter handle works better when shaving anyway.</li>
            <li>Love the feel of this razor.</li>
            <li>make sure you rinse off the wax on the razors before inserting into the razor holder.</li>
            <li>great purchase, and a very classy-looking razor.</li>
            <li>There is a bit of a learning curve, but be patient and you will start having better quality shaves with no irritation.</li>
            <li>so i bought this in the hopes that it would be better for my razor bumps and im</li>
            <li>so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>im more than alright</li>
            <li>Frankly, my face feels better than ever.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t even nicked myself yet (of course now that I said something, I&#x27;m sure I will).</li>
            <li>4 more words required.</li>
            <li>, it was a better more efficient shave than I had with the Parker 96r.</li>
            <li>more efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Out of all, feathers and gillette silver blues gave me the closest and most effortless shaves.  </li>
            <li>It is a fairly forgiving razor, not too aggressive but it strikes the right balance for me.</li>
            <li>What a mistake,,,,,,, do not buy this razor if you are looking for something to last many years, because this one will not !!!</li>
            <li>the Edwin Jagger razor is an excellent addition to the morning ritual most men wake up to.&lt;br /&gt;The Edwin Jagger compares favorably to the Merkur long handle safety razor, though slightly more &#x27;agressive&#x27; in nature.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The black handle is a nice touch and the balance is perfect.</li>
            <li>Has some heft to it yet very comfortable in hand, and easy to steer.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I bought one for myself!</li>
            <li>paired with a good blade and on my first try I didn&#x27;t even nick myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor sample that it comes with are pretty good as well but also try Feather razors.</li>
            <li>I got a pretty good deal on it as well.</li>
            <li>The chrome is great and the black handle makes it look very nice.  </li>
            <li>I think it provides a very nice shave and would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Product came new in box wrapped in tissue paper, and it has been great.</li>
            <li>At around 13 cents a blade delivered I am able to shave my beard and head twice easily before switching out blades, so you are looking at around 3 cents a shave if you just do your beard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Merkur works best with a safety razor that is very slightly larger than some cheap brands.</li>
            <li>Try to find a razor blade that works with your skin pair it with this razor for an experience you will only look forward too every morning (and yes I actually enjoy shaving every morning now) Happy Shaving!</li>
            <li>It is a solid product, has a nice weight to it, and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li>Very classy look and great quality.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to clean when disassembled.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap and leave a very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>It feels more luxurious in a way with all the preparing and the smooth, comfortable shave that leaves a nice smooth face afterwards.</li>
            <li>Nice clean smooth shave every time..</li>
            <li>The quality and comfort of the shave is very good overall.</li>
            <li>, the fit and finish is great and overall it has a nice timeless look.  </li>
            <li>The chrome plating, fit, and finish on this razor are outstanding.</li>
            <li>When I felt comfortable with my technique, I wanted to move up to a better quality razor.  </li>
            <li>I use it to shave my legs and am extremely pleased with the quality of the shave and how smooth my legs feel.</li>
            <li>This one has a nicer feeling and more comfortable handle than the Merkur.  </li>
            <li>Also seems to fit better with the razors I found.  </li>
            <li>While it is true that a DE razor will require more time and a learned hand, the results are just as satisfying as that of any of the newest disposable cartridge razors out there.  </li>
            <li>The closed head razor is superb.</li>
            <li>After about a week, however, I was shaving effortlessly and naturally and achieving great results.</li>
            <li>I was able to comfortably grip it and glide it along my face.</li>
            <li>The feeling of having such control and precision with a razor is incredible.</li>
            <li>Fit and finish are top notch.  </li>
            <li>I had a cheap DE razor before it and am glad I got this.</li>
            <li>WOW -- great shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this one for roughly two years, and the handle still looks in perfect</li>
            <li>It is surprisingly satisfying the sound it makes and the feel of it working.</li>
            <li>I intend to return this one and hopefully get a better blade fit.  </li>
            <li>I find each blade lasts almost a week, which is pretty good considering how cheap they are.  </li>
            <li>You will always be able to get blades to fit it period.</li>
            <li>Has good weight, and very well made.</li>
            <li>any others to really give a fair comparison.</li>
            <li>It shaves very well and feels good to me.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much</li>
            <li>It also is not in the highest price tier for razors, meaning that it&#x27;s a great combination of cheap and easy to use but high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best way to shave with it will be in short, quick strokes.</li>
            <li>Got this for the boyfriend, he loved it and it looks very nice and classy on our bathroom sink with the SimplyBeautiful deluxe razor and brush stand and the Omega boar brush with the white handle.</li>
            <li>Easy to (dis)assemble.</li>
            <li>I bought an EJ prior to shaving using straights and for the most part I was completely happy shaving using it.</li>
            <li>to change blades; easily tightening and loosening handle.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and I never cut my face.</li>
            <li>If, you are not afraid to use double edge, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;  - Easy to handle and hold</li>
            <li>Easy to assemble/disassemble.</li>
            <li>Changing the blade is fairly easy.</li>
            <li>Also, the razor blades, unlike the cartridges, can be easily recycled.</li>
            <li>The pack of blades it came with are very mild</li>
            <li>I found the dome on this prevented me from having an easy time under my nose, so with that, I deduct one star.</li>
            <li>The head and comb are 2 pieces, which unscrew from the handle, which allows for easy loading/unloading of your razor, as well as easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>I easily switch between the two.</li>
            <li>The blades that it comes with are decent, good for 3-5 shaves depending on your beard growth rate and thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good classic design.  </li>
            <li>from the beautiful plating, they fit the hand well, have a good weight, and are a forgiving razor.&lt;br /&gt;Teens just starting out, women, and experienced wet shavers can all enjoy a smooth, close, shave with this EJ product.</li>
            <li>I liked to weight very much, which is just a tad on the heavier side..</li>
            <li>Also, most gel shaving creams will work fine with the razor - there&#x27;s no reason to buy a brush and shave soap to go with it unless you just really want to be fancy for your own enjoyment.</li>
            <li>The only reason I am not giving it 5 starts is the handle is a little shorter than ideal but otherwise perfect.</li>
            <li>It is a solidly built, beautifully finished product.  </li>
            <li>and it went through my whiskers nicely on the first shave.  </li>
            <li>and it went through my whiskers nicely on the first shave.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this razor at first</li>
            <li>Good heft and the threads and fit of the machined parts seems high quality.  </li>
            <li>Very good, well built single blade razor.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and easy to use - true winner!  </li>
            <li>This company knows how to make fine razors.</li>
            <li>This razor is a fine piece.  </li>
            <li>it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a guy with a lighter beard this is probably fine.  </li>
            <li>I would call it a damn fine shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, i watched a lot of videos and saw people using these razors with a lot of ease and was amazed at how quickly it removed hair with not too many strokes..</li>
            <li>a super smooth and close shave!  </li>
            <li>or is this what true, good stainless steel is supposed to be like?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still working on finding the right amount of lather (Proraso shaving cream), but for a first attempt I still got a good shave.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean, liking it a lot.</li>
            <li>Ready to use, easy to use and has a nice chrome finish.</li>
            <li>this is my second safety razor, and to be honest I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fortunately, I can tell you it works fine with cheap canned shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>These little razors are excellent.</li>
            <li>Incredibly impressed with this little razor.</li>
            <li>kind of tricky to assemble and all that, but its a great little razor.</li>
            <li>I read very good things about those blades, but my old Gillette Sensor II Excel gives me a much closer shave on one pass than the Derby blades.</li>
            <li>I paired it with feather blades and it does its job very smoothly, just glides right over.</li>
            <li>As most wet shavers will tell you, what performance you get out of razors, creams, soaps, brushes, blades, etc., will greatly vary by user.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a huge issue for me because I wanted a &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; razor.</li>
            <li>it felt cheap</li>
            <li>The Jagger razor is very well finished and has a nice heft.</li>
            <li>I have never had a shave this smooth.  </li>
            <li>so opening the razor to replace blades is more fun and fascination than a chore.</li>
            <li>but maybe that&#x27;s just me being used to cheap</li>
            <li>the it primarily made of zinc and plastic.</li>
            <li>This razor trumps any commercially available cartridge razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>I was nick free.  </li>
            <li>This razor is heavy and the finish is flawless.</li>
            <li>I have a light to medium beard.</li>
            <li>you haven&#x27;t ever used a double edge razor, this is a great one to start on.</li>
            <li>perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that the &amp;#34;faux ebony&amp;#34; handle might look cheap</li>
            <li>but it is attractive and is not especially slippery.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes steal it to shave my legs, closer shave than a cartridge 5-blade razor and replacement blades for this are dirt cheap.</li>
            <li>One of my problem areas when shaving are my cheeks, I could never seem to get them as smooth as I&#x27;d like, but after a couple passes with this, my cheeks are silky</li>
            <li>was worried the plastic handle would be too light</li>
            <li>, it may not be as grippy as a knurled handle, but I have had zero grip issues with the smooth handle.</li>
            <li>It works with Feather or Shark blades and is easy to take apart and clean when changing blades - unlike the Futur.  </li>
            <li>The blades are dirt cheap &amp;</li>
            <li>It shaves or but does not slide as smooth as my Merkur</li>
            <li>Overall, a great razor with mild/moderate aggressiveness, great looks and feels solid in the hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy shaving.</li>
            <li>It just requires deliberate, thoughtful strokes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I like that it&#x27;s not some cheaply made piece of metal.  </li>
            <li>In spite of the smooth handle I did not have a problem holding onto it.</li>
            <li>As either one is great,then just try diff blades to fit your beard and face..</li>
            <li>Save your money and enjoy this razor.  </li>
            <li>Looks great hanging on the stand I got for it next to my badger brush.  </li>
            <li>Edwin Jagger makes some fantastic stuff, and this razor is no exception.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was recommended to me by several people as a novice razor and it was a great choice.</li>
            <li>It seems a bit light.</li>
            <li>I use Proraso for my products, however feel free to use what you like.</li>
            <li>Dont buy the cheap blades though.  </li>
            <li>I truly enjoy this razor.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to keep clean without having water spots on it all the time.</li>
            <li>Quality is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>There is no added pressure needed when letting this glide across your skin which leads to an amazingly smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This razor isn&#x27;t too aggressive, which is great for starting out.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the weight and design of this over all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heck, I enjoy shaving with this razor and look forward to it.</li>
            <li>Purchased two of these for family members and they&#x27;re fantastic shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Aside</li>
            <li>I really enjoy my razor.  </li>
            <li>Well, I cannot compare the EJ to the Merkur, but I can confidently say that after using the EJ twice I have never gotten better results from any cartridge or straight razor.  </li>
            <li>I use this razor with good old Barbasol from a can.  </li>
            <li>The chrome handle looks nice, and if you can afford it you should probably get it, but it makes absolutely no difference in the shave quality, so I suggest putting that $10 towards some good shave creme or blades</li>
            <li>So I called them directly, and they could not have been more courteous.</li>
            <li>Build quality is good, I like the fact that it comes apart completely rather than using the butterfly opening of the parker.</li>
            <li>I would have had a problem with it being too short but to my amazement the finger-tip grip with handle gently rested into my palm was actually a perfect form-factor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too aggressive, but it&#x27;s also not so soft that I can&#x27;t get a good shave with it.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely beautiful and wonderfully middle of the road for cutting..not aggressive...not mild.</li>
            <li>It is an elegantly designed razor and has just the right heft to it.</li>
            <li>for the razor itself, it is well build and solid feeling and does a very nice job.  </li>
            <li>It has a well weighted handle that gave me a smooth and clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I immediately liked the shorter handle on the EJ as I could almost tuck it in my hand, grip my fingers high up underneath the head and use it as an extension of my hand.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure the week was just me learning, others may make it to a great shave in much less</li>
            <li>So I had no idea that using a double-edged razor is amazingly easy, and gives such good results.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the overall high reviews, the beautiful style/finish, and I think it&#x27;s a slightly better deal than the merkur.</li>
            <li>Makes me smile every time I pick it up!</li>
            <li>Great razor, just started with the safety razor style, and didn&#x27;t take long to get used to.</li>
            <li>I watched many videos before I chose my first DE razor</li>
            <li>It was my first safety razor and my favorite.</li>
            <li>This is the first safety razor I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I love it.</li>
            <li>originally purchased this razor specifically because it is recommended as a beginners safety razor.  </li>
            <li>I went with a Van Der Hagen Safety Razor first, and well wasnt completly satisfied</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor and went with this one after so many recommended it.</li>
            <li>My first shave with this was absolutely stunning.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was excited to use it when it got here</li>
            <li>Great construction, tight fitting head (it doesnt wobble or anything).  </li>
            <li>The razor is well weighted and the blades that come with it are functional if a little un aggressive (not so great on more than a couple of days growth).</li>
            <li>It is my first double edge razor after 20 years of shaving with Gillette, it is beautiful</li>
            <li>As always with Amazon quick and free shipping.</li>
            <li>This makes it easier to clean and almost foolproof to put the blades in without bending them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly using the store brand ones from my local drug store, and I feel like they&#x27;re giving me a better shave than what came with the razor.</li>
            <li>the chrome is super smooth, and it will shave as close as you need.</li>
            <li>I have gone back to my dad&#x27;s era and as the old saying goes Father knows Best.</li>
            <li>, my first shave was smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>It is easy to feel when you have the right angle.</li>
            <li>Feel great on the hand, not too light, not too heavy, easy to cleanup and to change the blades.</li>
            <li>As sturdy and smart looking as DE razors two or more times the price.  </li>
            <li>escape me right now!</li>
            <li>The Edwin Jagger is the more gentle of the 2 I keep in rotation, but it still gives me a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Handle is a bit shorter than expected, but the razor has a nice weight to it that makes control very easy.</li>
            <li>The blades that come with it too are super sharp and I was able to get a close shave and good finish everytime.</li>
            <li>The razor looks very nice with its \\&quot;faux ebony\\&quot; handle, but I believe it is unsafe due to the ergonomic deficiencies caused by the smooth surface of the handle.</li>
            <li>The overall aesthetics of it are stellar and it appears to have great craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>The craftsmanship of this razor is beautiful and it fits very well in my hand and is well weighted (no pushing necessary).  </li>
            <li>I really wanted a Merkur, but shipping would have been more as I use Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to absolutely anyone looking for a better shave.  </li>
            <li>i decided to take the wasteful, disposable plastic elements out of my life, and was more than ready to eliminate disposable razors.</li>
            <li>Nothing, besides maybe a straight razor, will give you a better shave.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who wants a close shave with ease and in the end save lots of money from not spending more for the plastic shavers</li>
            <li>The razor-changing action is not as nice as the Merkur #34C.</li>
            <li>Compared to the SS it is much heavier at the head and there is a bit more gap between the blade and the safety bar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice safety razor after my father&#x27;s 30 old butterfly Gillette was lost.</li>
            <li>I purchase the Edwin Jagger DE86BL razor in late February and was very happy with the quality and feel of their product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s full rating is because of two things.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These (DE) things really do cut better, than multi-bladed marketing BS. ...</li>
            <li>but, I was able to drill a hole and add a stainless</li>
            <li>It costs about as much as a pack of Gillette Fusion blades, lasts longer, and is more eco-friendly considering its parts are recyclable.</li>
            <li>Razors go into a mini Altoids tin and when that&#x27;s full, to the recycling bin.</li>
            <li>with the same head, so it&#x27;s probably just as good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wake up late and get in a rush with this beautiful razor!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I love the weight of it and it seems really well made.</li>
            <li>I have never had such a good shave in my life.</li>
            <li>No big deal, though, when 100 good blades cost</li>
            <li>Gives soft, nice shaves,</li>
            <li>After doing some research, I came across the Edwin Jagger De86bl safety razor after reading some reviews and all the stories were true.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good starter option, and this one definitely fits the bill.</li>
            <li>Comparing it to my dad&#x27;s DE razor from decades ago (no idea what brand), his had a cool butterfly mechanism.  </li>
            <li>So cool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it over and over and just can&#x27;t get the same good shave I get with my Merkur.  </li>
            <li>I loved this razor enough that when I dropped it on the tile floor and it broke, that I immediately ordered another one.</li>
            <li>Quality is top notch, very well made.</li>
            <li>You should shoot for comfortable/irritation-free shave, and when your skill set is ready, you should move on to more aggressive razors like open-comb razors or slants, which are known to cut hairs</li>
            <li>am still a DE noob, and have only been wetshaving for 2 months, but I can tell you that this razor will give you good shave</li>
            <li>Wow, when I first pulled this razor out of its box, I was blown away by how good looking it was.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
            <li>This is my first safety blade razor, and after two weeks, so far so good.</li>
            <li>A very gentle shaver, it made it easy for me to learn the art of wetshaving.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to continue to use cheap canned shaving cream which, while possibly not conducive to the best possible shave, is inexpensive and quick to apply.  </li>
            <li>So , finally decided to take the plunge with this Edwin Jagger and let me tell you it is so easy , i was nervous at first but after my first two strokes i realized that its not going to bite me unless i jam it in my face, i do make sure that i have a nice lather</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it looks beautiful, offers a close, smooth and painless shave and definitely value for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>Gives a great shave because I always have a sharp blade.  </li>
            <li>Settled on this razor because it seemed the best overall value (along with the Merkur of similar price), and it looked cool.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but each time I put in a new blade it always seats it at a symmetric proper angle on both sides, so I find it to be very reliable and top-notch quality.</li>
            <li>I recently switched to double edged razors and am very happy I did.</li>
            <li>The chrome finish is flawless and the whole razor just oozes quality and understated elegance.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a like a tiny, tiny annoyance in an otherwise perfect razor.  </li>
            <li>The Jagger has a smaller head than the Merkur, however, so I am able to get more of the hairs underneath my nose without slicing my face up.</li>
            <li>I upgraded to this razor from my consignment store acquired 1955 Gillette Super Speed.</li>
            <li>Super quality, close shaves, they also sent 5 Derby blades.  </li>
            <li>I like the way it comes apart for a quick cleaning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one issue I&#x27;ve had is that I noticed that rather quickly the chrome began to chip off of the head (</li>
            <li>It feels very substantial, like it will last a lifetime and is a great example of</li>
            <li>After some research, I bought 100 Astra Stainless Steel razors and they are far superior in my opinion.</li>
            <li>More important the blades are far cheaper.</li>
            <li>For now, though, I&#x27;m thrilled with this razor and the fact it sets me up for cheap blades into the future.</li>
            <li>so I quickly changed to Wilkinson Sword Classics and have Feathers ordered.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced next to a straight razor shave.  </li>
            <li>This arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to assemble/disassemble and clean and holds the razor blade very well</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it adds about five minutes to the morning routine (maybe more if you&#x27;re used to an electric razor, but a much better shave than an electric).</li>
            <li>Lastly, it comes packaged in a very elegant style.</li>
            <li>It will probably take most people longer, yes, but I find the process kind of relaxing and the extra time isn&#x27;t that much.  </li>
            <li>So far, with the Derby blades, I have been getting the best shaves of my life without the irritation other disposable razors leave.</li>
            <li>To do this safely at first I just put the head in a towel and held it securely in one hand and unscrewed it with the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>I have used Merkur, Gillette (fat boy and other classics) Parker, Ikon, and by far this is the best safety razor I have tried.</li>
            <li>That being said, yes, you do have to use a bit more finesse than with modern disposable blades and you can&#x27;t just \\&quot;slam\\&quot; this kind of razor against your face the same way either.  </li>
            <li>with this plus it feels nice taking a little longer and using a good shave soap and some decent aftershave.</li>
            <li>Boyfriend loves his new razor, much better than using disposable ones.</li>
            <li>I coupled this with a mug of soap and brush from Wal-Mart and get great shaves for lots less.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super aggressive so maybe that might bug some people, but for beginners it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Blade replacement is not as easy on some models, but I don&#x27;t consider it that much of a pain.  </li>
            <li>I will say that the short handle was surprising when I first opened the package</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find a single issue with this gorgeous razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it came back like riding a bike, I guess once you shaved like this previously it just comes back, great shave, three passes, a nice thick proraso sandalwood shave cream followed by a nice shave balm, have forgotten what a nice feeling it is to have a shave like this, so glad I made this choice, and it will only get better as I collect more shave creams, lotions, and balms !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not adjustable, which I think makes it great for a beginner like me since there are fewer options to mess with.  </li>
            <li>Do NOT attempt to shave against-the-grain with this on your first time using a double-edge razor!  </li>
            <li>Six months later this is still the case and my beard never felt better!</li>
            <li>I do recommend that you have a post shave balm of any kind you like ready on hand if you are new to this stuff like me.</li>
            <li>The razor was a distinct improvement over my previous razor and the quality is great.</li>
            <li>Sharp looking (ha-ha, sorry), comfortable to hold with a nice balance of weight, and nice casing for the razor which provides me a weekly beautiful shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for a little over 8 months and its by far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of pot metal, but at this price you&#x27;re hard pressed to find a good razor in a more durable material.</li>
            <li>While it was comfortable to use, it didn&#x27;t give me very close shaves.  </li>
            <li>This razor is amazing, and it&#x27;s going to last me a lifetime.</li>
            <li>and I honestly don&#x27;t like the feel of it overall, or how it felt gliding on my face buzzing.</li>
            <li>This razor sees the most action of any of them.</li>
            <li>I love old DE razors and have a few that are over 50 years old that still look and perform perfect</li>
            <li>I have like 5 years worth of replacement blades.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice and solid</li>
            <li>Nice finish, solid razor.</li>
            <li>- Shaving actually fells nice</li>
            <li>My brother owns an Edwin Jagger DE89 Chrome and I wanted to buy something similar as I really liked the weight and performance.</li>
            <li>While shaving, I accidentally dropped the razor onto my counter top from about chin height, 2-3 feet and the head snapped completely off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since bought some nice shave soap that I like but am still working on a proper lather.</li>
            <li>I started out with a Weishi which did a poor at best job.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The head is heavy steel with nice chrome on it, and the handle, though plastic, still has a nice heft to it thanks to the metal on the end.</li>
            <li>Even on my coarse stubble, it was more comfortable than any disposable I have ever used, including the Gillette Proglide.</li>
            <li>After using it for over a year, I went and got a nice Ikon razor, and I still find myself going back to this razor from time to time.</li>
            <li>Paired with some good quality blades (I&#x27;ve become partial to Feather), you can expect a nice shave with this razor, and it appears built to last.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still learning how to use this but it is a solid, nice razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a bit heavier than I expected, which is good.</li>
            <li>So far my favorite blades are Astra, bluebird and bolzano.  </li>
            <li>Great starter razor for those of you wanting to get back to the old ways and save some money over today&#x27;s overpriced blades.  </li>
            <li>Feels nice and solid.  </li>
            <li>, it comes with 5 derby extra blades and they work together nice</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>the rewards and pleasure of shaving will be worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra money to have nice things.  </li>
            <li>The razor has a nice solid feel to it and is just the right wieght.  </li>
            <li>For once, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34; to shave, the DE glides over easily removing pretty much everything, flip it over and glide it over again</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving with this safety razor started out fine the first several weeks, but now I&#x27;m getting more cuts and nicks!&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li>Just like many other people who have switched, I am in love.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you actually clean the thing after each shave, open it up and get the gunk out.</li>
            <li>just right agressive-ness</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t get the Edwin Jagger to shave right up to my nostrils.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair comes right off now.  </li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>Oh how I was right.</li>
            <li>I have the razor now about 6 months and no nicks, and balanced just right for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sharp, very sharp looking razor and a good addition of your first set of blades (get a sampler pack of blades as you want to compare them all!)</li>
            <li>Some like the butterfly opening razors, but this mechanism is much easier to clean, and there are no moving parts to break or bend or malfunction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s quick to take apart, easy to dry, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>First off, this is my first DE Safety Razor!</li>
            <li>the shorter, more stubby handle is relatively easy to grip and as others have noted is not slippery in wet hands as you might expect.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be sorry, it&#x27;s a stunning razor that performs exceptionally!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a modern classic known for mild, smooth shaves.</li>
            <li>This razor was my first safety razor, and after I got over the initial fear of letting a bare razor touch my face, it worked great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;  - great to travel with as it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li>The stem on the Chinese one seems to be made out of much sturdier construction but the blade clogs fast and doesn&#x27;t provide as good a shave than the Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li>This was my first de safety razor, and all I can say is it was well worth the money..</li>
            <li>: Make sure to wet your face properly and apply a good lather of shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Also, I have sensitive skin and cut myself easily, so this level of aggressiveness is just right.</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;ll state clearly that this is purely my First-Day-Review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>replaced the first head with a cheap Chinese knock off which has lasted me over two years and still going strong.  </li>
            <li>The reviews of DE razors almost make it seem like you MUST use a fancy brush and the best possible cream, so I was a little nervous about ordering the Edwin Jagger</li>
            <li>You only need to go over most areas ONCE with a fresh razor in this</li>
            <li>I can already tell; this is way closer, and yet far more gentle on my troublesome neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This gives a fast quick shave.</li>
            <li>When you get used to wet shaving, this delivers a closer and more comfortable shave than any disposable I&#x27;ve yet used.</li>
            <li>It shaves very well, mild but thorough.  </li>
            <li>The design is simple and clean up is easy.</li>
            <li>just wish it had a more secure grip when wet with eather a longer handle and or</li>
            <li>The head assembly screws on perfectly to the handle, holding your razor blade in place solidly and making each pass predictable.</li>
            <li>but so far I have found it to be easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The black handle is gorgeous but does not have any type of grip or grooves</li>
            <li>I just find that it doesn’t expose enough of the blade to really get the kind of quality</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything I expected and more!</li>
            <li>Nicely chromed, a good heft and gives a sense of being much more expensive than it actually is.</li>
            <li>I love the three piece design, and the black and chrome really look elegant.</li>
            <li>The thing looks so good, little fingers may be tempted.</li>
            <li>razor itself feels high quality and has a nice solid weight to it.</li>
            <li>The black handle is $10 cheaper than the chrome handle, but the black lacquer feels nice and smooth, and the handle still has a nice heft to it.  </li>
            <li>Very reasonable price, high quality product and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>several others and this Edwin Jagger has risen to the top of the list.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a bit more aggressive than my first razor, and that&#x27;s what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>This Razor is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The handle is suppose to be short for this type of razor, but I&#x27;ve found that I get the most control the closer to the blades I hold it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This provides a VERY close shave!  </li>
            <li>I bought this razor off of a recommendation for a first timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have found that the Derby Extra blades are acceptable for my beard, there may be better ones out there, but for the price (currently $0.14 ea), I can just change the blades more often.  </li>
            <li>I eventually went with a WSP El Grande, which appears to me to be exactly the same config, but has a diamond knurled handle which inspires more confidence when you shave.  </li>
            <li>Granted, it&#x27;s my first safety razor.</li>
            <li>The first time using this</li>
            <li>The first thing we try to look for is value, and understandably so because let&#x27;s face it..</li>
            <li>I am a beginner and had no trouble getting an extremely smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Has the quality that feels like it would last for many years.</li>
            <li>(Most likely ABS.)</li>
            <li>The more I try to get the stubble off, the more cuts I get, usually under my nose, on my chin, or on my Adam&#x27;s apple</li>
            <li>When I first received the item, the first thing I noticed was the box.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not difficult but some users may find it meddlesome after a while.</li>
            <li>This is my first one.  </li>
            <li>Just shower, rub oil on and use hot water.  </li>
            <li>It has been exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>not a big issue, just make sure the soap is off your hand.</li>
            <li>This was my first try with a modern/old fashioned safety razor.</li>
            <li>My first one broke</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get the hang of it the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first DE razor and</li>
            <li>My first DE razor.</li>
            <li>I am knew to wet shaving, but have been using the Popular Feather razor and like it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for nothing better especially for the price!</li>
            <li>The craftsmanship has to be seen first hand to appreciate.</li>
            <li>This was the first safety razor I bought  </li>
            <li>This has been my first safety razor</li>
            <li>For those of you interested in trying DE shaving</li>
            <li>About a million times better than a plastic Gillette which costs the same.</li>
            <li>Mostly my fault for not realizing how fragile it was.  </li>
            <li>I bought this razor as my first safety razor.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first, but then the day I got it my girlfriend called me and told me she shaved her legs with it</li>
            <li>I was interested in getting a safety razor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now been using it consistently since May, so after 7 months, here&#x27;s my feedback:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It glides like a hot knife through butter on your whiskers and has not once nicked me on the face.</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I must say that as I was working through my first minute of shaving with this I asked my wife \\&quot;Where</li>
            <li>had there been a bit &#x27;more&#x27; for extra value for the price...</li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say what it was exactly</li>
            <li>so be aware of that.  </li>
            <li>, they promptly replied, saying that my first email had never been received.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first de razor</li>
            <li>This was the first DE razor I tried...</li>
            <li>(be sure to get a sampler pack when you order this, everyone&#x27;s face likes different</li>
            <li>Based on reviews, this was my first razor I purchased to move to safety razors.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>(I try to re-use until I can&#x27;t anymore--strop the blade between uses, etc.), but still pretty easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor.  </li>
            <li>The Derby blades also worked pretty well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my first re-visit to a safety razor in three decades</li>
            <li>And I get the feeling that shaves with this razor will only get better.</li>
            <li>This is my first double edged safety razor, but I love it.  </li>
            <li>This was my first safety razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first double-edge razor I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Very close shave!  </li>
            <li>The first time my wife saw me standing there with the shaver in 3 pieces</li>
            <li>The first time my wife saw me standing there with the shaver in 3 pieces</li>
            <li>Amazon to this point has represented themselves well, and produced exactly what they said they would.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying the Future soon, but I&#x27;m glad I started with this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cheap children&#x27;s toys have a higher quality of construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first razor I ever bought.</li>
            <li>The Edwin Jagger also works well with the Derby blades that are more forgiving when you start off, or go back to DE shaving.</li>
            <li>I can tell you this much!</li>
            <li>Just be sure you get a proper case to keep the pieces from jostling together during travel.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor because it seemed like a lot of people recommend this razor as first razor for person beginning to learn safety razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>first shave and</li>
            <li>I wondered; if I might need to order a few, to get a good one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comparing it with disposable razors is a bit on the heavy side, but is a weight that feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li>still geting used to my neck after a few weeks but still just as good as my mach 3.</li>
            <li>Super high quality.</li>
            <li>some Shark Super Stainless wich also worked very will.  </li>
            <li>Have been trying out some different blades, and so far the Astra&#x27;s are giving me the best results, but I have to yet try out a really sharp Feather -</li>
            <li>/&gt;My first shave with Derby blades (one pass only - gently does it) was very smooth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually post reviews, but I have been shopping on Amazon for many years and have only good things to say about their customer service.</li>
            <li>5 stars, its a keeper, you&#x27;ll never want to use anything else if you enjoy a nice, long lasting close shave and holds up.</li>
            <li>This is my first SE razor and it&#x27;s good enough to be my last!</li>
            <li>The handle on this model is smooth, &amp;#34;faux ebony&amp;#34; that looks very sharp but is perhaps not as secure as the chrome, lined handle featured on the EJ DE89 for some, but I have found it to be secure in the hand under normal conditions.</li>
            <li>I have two other safety razors (one at work, and one at home), neither of which is as nice as this one.</li>
            <li>Extra mild razor which is a great gift for new wet shavers.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell, if I step up from here to a straight edge, but for now I am more then content.</li>
            <li>Not only is this product a fair value, buying 100 razor packs is only ~$10 shipped!</li>
            <li>Also, I get as many shaves out of a Feather blade as I do with a Sensor 2 Excel carterThe Feather blades are three times as much money as the Derbys, but are still only one-third the cost of Sensor II cartridges.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;This certainly seems to fill the bill, first shave with it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a standard three-piece design like your grandfather&#x27;s Gillette, so blade changes are pretty easy.</li>
            <li>A $6 full metal razor that I had previously bought holds up better than this.</li>
            <li>the positive side, I like the shape/tolerances of the head.</li>
            <li>I was positive</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a positive thing for letting the weight and mass of the razor do the work for you rather than flipping the shaver around like you do with plastic cartridge</li>
            <li>but if this razor was made with any kind of quality metal whatsoever, this nearly 1/4\\&quot; bolt should have been able to take being thrown at a brick wall as hard as you can throw it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hopefully it holds up for a long time, because I am completely in love with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>for the De86bl, it is my first safety razor, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to its competition.</li>
            <li>I like this more than my Merkur long razor.  </li>
            <li>Edwin Jagger DE razor look really nice, but won&#x27;t the smooth handle be slippery?&lt;br /&gt;-Maybe only a bit slippery if you let your fingers and the handle get wet.  </li>
            <li>For a long time, I had been using the 3,4,5,6 blade gillete fusions and shicks, thinking that I would get a better shave.</li>
            <li>, pretty much all the work is done by the razor weight gliding on your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reason for 4 stars is that the razor doesn&#x27;t give you the closest shave, but you really shouldn&#x27;t shoot for the closest shave when you first start wetshaving.  </li>
            <li>The chrome finish is really slick and good looking.</li>
            <li>Replacing a razor blade is quick and easy, even with wet fingers.</li>
            <li>I recently decided to switch to a double-edge safety razor, and this was one of the most highly recommended razors in the &amp;#34;budget&amp;#34; price range.</li>
            <li>The razor is very mild, milder than the Gillette Fusion system that I used earlier (I use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>However, after experiencing almost no nicks after shaving my face on the first day, I felt comfortable attempting the head shave on the second.</li>
            <li>I would have liked a slightly longer handle, but I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li>a simple stand or larger sampler of blades or something but 4 stars and my being very pleased is where it&#x27;s at!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty light but still has enough weight that you can just position the razor on your face and let the weight of the razor do the cutting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>handle feels short, but it allows for maximum flexibility with strong control.</li>
            <li>I have large man-hands, and the handle still fits and feels</li>
            <li>But that is a purely subjective decision.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the fact that the piece it self is pure craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>I chose the DE86 purely for aesthetics.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t add much to all the positive reviews out there as I basically agree with them.</li>
            <li>all the great reviews that you see for the DE89 can be applied here, only with a black handle.</li>
            <li>The craftsmanship is very visible here as an example of why you should spend the extra 10-20 bucks for a quality product instead of a product that will easily show its flaws</li>
            <li>Going old school was a great choice as I have a very thick and quick growing beard.</li>
            <li>So far I am very happy with my choice, the black handle to offset all the chrome bits is very pleasing to the eye, and most importantly does not feel overly slick when wet</li>
            <li>/&gt;Its not a very aggressive razor, and is very smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s weighty, solid, and finely crafted.</li>
            <li>but this thing has a large and very well-weighted head.</li>
            <li>The handle in this area has a nice little flange to grip between two fingers and a thumb, so someone was thinking when they designed this.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t look very grippy, but trust me, it is.</li>
            <li>you more of the blade&amp;#34; than others, so be careful what you buy.</li>
            <li>I like it better than my old butterfly style razor; there are less moving parts to clean or foul up.  </li>
            <li>It is also not an aggressive razor though it gives a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>and it is a real deal I got my for around $25!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the Edwin Jagger is priced much lower.</li>
            <li>Muhle razors are the ones you can find in the Art of Shaving stores and they are much expansive.</li>
            <li>Did not want to invest in a straight blade yet.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very ergonomic and in the shower it&#x27;s slippery</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants to save money.  </li>
            <li>and/or shaving too fast.  </li>
            <li>this razor will offer a very close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>I am really quite blown away.  </li>
            <li>I used to dread shaving and skipped it as much as possible, but with this one, I actually enjoy shaving with it.</li>
            <li>Blades fit well, and it&#x27;s easier to get them centered properly than in my Mercur razor.</li>
            <li>Closest shave I have ever had with the exception of a straight razor shave at the barbers.</li>
            <li>The chrome finish was great and the construction of the whole razor feels solid and not cheap.</li>
            <li>I held it around there, and is was absolutely luxurious.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 3 piece that works very well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this razor along with a Parker to shave my head witth to move from using a straight razor.</li>
            <li>the shorter handle does really make it very maneuverable.</li>
            <li>But this really goes with any part of shaving using double-edge razor.</li>
            <li>I found I prefer a much sharper blade (Feathers, Gillette SharpEdge, etc).</li>
            <li>These razors are not meant to be tightened too much - just tighten it until it is snug.</li>
            <li>Much closer shave than multi blade razors.</li>
            <li>but as it turns out both the razor and handle are very well polished</li>
            <li>I use a towel to grip the ends of the head and twist it off, but once I slipped and cut my thumb very deeply.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>It fits well in the hand and is very responsive.  </li>
            <li>I pair this with Astra blades and it works really well for me.</li>
            <li>that my Merkur but not by much.</li>
            <li>I know it comes with a stainless handle also, but l like to look of the ebony.</li>
            <li>- Blades are very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>- Lots of different brands of blades will fit this.</li>
            <li>They shave very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I am not asking you to man up to a straight razor....</li>
            <li>My shaves are extra smooth and no one nick or cut.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>But I have tried straight edge safety razors with the intent to practice and learning.</li>
            <li>and I like real well.</li>
            <li>I think the closeness is comparable to a modern 5 blade cartridge razor.</li>
            <li>On the second shave I learned it wasn&#x27;t the razor but the cheap shave soap I bought at Wal Mart and my lack of lathering abilities.</li>
            <li>like i was thinking oh this looks too intense</li>
            <li>Weight of the razor helps you keep it on track without putting too much pressure on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He and my boyfriend both say (and so does the touch test) that it is a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Very well made, and it&#x27;s quite the looker sitting on the counter.</li>
            <li>Very well balanced razor.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really make sense to me why it broke.</li>
            <li>very natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was smooth, only took one pass, and didn&#x27;t hurt (except where I messed up my adams apple--user error).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>it was just a great look (like my Harley), has the same head as the more expensive EJs.</li>
            <li>He has never shaved with a safety razor until today and he absolutely loves this razor.</li>
            <li>The shave is so much smoother than a cartridge razor or an electric.</li>
            <li>Recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t have the center piece on backwards.</li>
            <li>Def a great way to get into the DE game.</li>
            <li>This is a very well made unit however if I had to do it again, I would opt for a razor with a bit longer handle and one with texture to the handle.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased a cheap double edged razor and it tore my skin up.</li>
            <li>The razor has absolutely zero space between the blade and the razor...</li>
            <li>(thanks to this goberment).</li>
            <li>I bought one cheap from china (used to cut all over my face) because this is the only one we can find here.</li>
            <li>many times it has to be used carefully.</li>
            <li>Better than expected quality for the price.</li>
            <li>#34;You broke it already?!&amp;#34;  I explained to her that that&#x27;s the way you&#x27;re supposed to change the blade, but I have to admit it really does feel like you&#x27;re breaking it.  </li>
            <li>#34;You broke it already?!&amp;#34;  I explained to her that that&#x27;s the way you&#x27;re supposed to change the blade, but I have to admit it really does feel like you&#x27;re breaking it.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t guess how much experience any of you have had with metal and bolts -</li>
            <li>It works very well and gives an aggressive shave with an Astra blade.</li>
            <li>I recommend the titanium coated Stainless Steel Blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it also clogs up too fast.  </li>
            <li>You have to be more careful with those I believe.  </li>
            <li>I really like the weight of the razor</li>
            <li>Leaves such a smooth surface</li>
            <li>I purchased this Razor as a gift for a very &amp;#34;High</li>
            <li>I have not had any gripping issues while my hands have been wet or with some shaving soap on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t shave for about 2 or 3 days to really test it and</li>
            <li>It is cheap and will last forever, and you will not regret the quality craftsmanship nor the quality shave!</li>
            <li>If that’s you, I’d absolutely recommend getting this</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I’ve been wet shaving for many years</li>
            <li>It has a nice weight to it without being too heavy.</li>
            <li>and I was wondering if there is any kind of warranty on it, this is a metal heavy razor</li>
            <li>After many years of trying sensitive skin foams and gels as well as different brands of razor&#x27;s, I decided I had to try something</li>
            <li>and I own quite a few.</li>
            <li>On first glance the smooth ebony handle might make you think that it could possibly slip easily when wet, however this is not so.</li>
            <li>Which means that it will break easily with a even minor drop on your sink.  </li>
            <li>This was my first attempt to step outside the Electronic / Gillette disposables world and entire the amazing world of old school safety razors.</li>
            <li>After shaving I take it apart and put the blade out of the way after drying it, then I rince and dry the three parts of the razor and leave out for a good air dry.</li>
            <li>i did some research, and realized i wasn&#x27;t yet ready for a true straight razor and the almost strict religious upkeep factors of them...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to men looking to make the smart move to a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>I am slender and have a more contoured face and my beard grows straight out not curly, my mustache lays down and no matter how much I shave, stretch or change shaving direction I still have stubble.</li>
            <li>I just took the head from it, as my imitation horn is much more pleasing to the eye.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy another Edwin Jagger when this one&#x27;s gone, but if you keep it clean and polish it every so often, it should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a ridiculous value and too good to ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only got nicked because I was not as careful the second shave, because the first was so successful.  </li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t used any other safety razors, the ease of transition to this one after using disposables for so many years leads me to recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>With all the blades takes up less space than my more modern razors.  </li>
            <li>The chrome and black gives it a nice classy look.</li>
            <li>: It appears to be really solidly constructed, and also looks really good in the bathroom coupled with the black SimplyBeautiful badger brush and stand that I ordered from Amazon as well.)</li>
            <li>EJ shaves very close, very quickly with minimal effort and cleanup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I am new to the safety razor shaving community and by no means can speak purely from dog years of experience*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Later on I&#x27;ll put the blade back in and the razor back together and hang it on the stand, it looks to good on the counter to put away.</li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to from regular carts but after about 1 week I got a considerably better shave than any other I&#x27;ve had before, and it&#x27;s only got better since then</li>
            <li>The head holds the blade at a really nice angle for my beard, and the comb is deep enough to make it nearly foolproof.</li>
            <li>This is my first DE, so I can&#x27;t speak too much as far as comparing it to others.</li>
            <li>/&gt;EDIT (three years down the line): This thing is still doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, after I don&#x27;t know how many shaves.</li>
            <li>I prefer something with a little bit more heft to it but for the price, I won&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>The safest way to put a blade in the razor I&#x27;ve found is to turn the two parts upside-down on the counter and set the blade down onto it, steady the top, and screw in the handle.  </li>
            <li>I am from Venezuela and this kind of razor is used by very few people here.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I got this particular model in general but also in particular over a butterfly style because I had concerns of the blade being a little out of alignment.</li>
            <li>It is also a 3 piece razor, meaning that you have to unscrew the whole head to put a new razor in.</li>
            <li>In the end I chose the De86bl because I like the look of the black and chrome better.</li>
            <li>I also bought a black, and chrome handled, Silvertip badger brush; as a bit of a splurge (for me), and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>and I was able to use this razor the day it arrived with less razor burn than I was getting with my Gillette Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It sails thru my whiskers better than anything I have used before, and I have had much less irritation.</li>
            <li>also be realistic $25</li>
            <li>It is solid, heavy and looks good.  </li>
            <li>No matter what brand of blade I put in it, I can always get a decent shave.</li>
            <li>I get a decent shave, I haven&#x27;t cut myself yet, and it costs me about six cents a week for blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try till I use up all of my remaining free blades and decide on my next course of action.</li>
            <li>This is a good beginners razor as I had just a few nicks on my second shave.  </li>
            <li>Worth the investment &amp; I will save big money over time as the razors are so much cheaper then the 3,4 &amp; 5 blade razor heads</li>
            <li>I initially worried that the smooth handle would prove slippery, but so far I&#x27;ve had no problem with the grip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, the Derby razors I got are decent.</li>
            <li>From a personal perspective, I have been shaving for more than 10 years using different electric shavers and disposable blades</li>
            <li>the quality of this razor will most likely last you the rest of your life.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a decent safety razor with out breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>The black looks a bit more contemporary, though.</li>
            <li>I am just sorry that I fell into the trap of more blades are better.  </li>
            <li>Everybody says so, and it is SUCH an industrially artistic piece...</li>
            <li>The razor breaks down very easily for cleaning and looks the same as it did the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Super high quality razor that will last a lifetime,without breaking the bank!</li>
            <li>and so far I have quite a positive impression about it.</li>
            <li>With only small modifications in how you hold your razor and the amount of pressure that you apply, you will be receiving the closest, most comfortable shaves of your life.  </li>
            <li>so far I like it better than the normal cartridges, though you have to be a little more careful.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The chrome is particularly high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I purchased a blade sampler pack that I have been using in conjunction with this and highly recommend that</li>
            <li>It included Derby razors which I recommend highly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recomend this razor to anyone as a matter a fact</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Yes the price of this razor seems high</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>High quality feel and construction.  </li>
            <li>High quality materials and construction.  </li>
            <li>Also use high quality blades.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended buying Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>With high hopes on the Edwin Jagger, I figured why not give it a shot.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li>I love this razor, but buying another one would be rewarding the manufacturer for making an inferior product, or at least rewarding them for poor customer service.</li>
            <li>Shaving with this razor also feels much more comfortable than my old Gillette Fusion, and much cleaner (very little stubble left).    </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say about this other than it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say the same for other razors that I own.</li>
            <li>in all other ways, this razor seems built to last- the kind of thing that if we&#x27;d gone to atomic war decades ago, this would have been pulled out of the rubble and used by a scruffy-faced survivor.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned about making a change to a safety razor, but I was more concerned about the price of cartridge razors.    </li>
            <li>if I was to purchase again, I would get a model with a little better grip to it.</li>
            <li>I love this little piece.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really feel up to the time investment required to get back into straight razor shaving, but it occurred to me that a DE razor might provide a decent wetshave without the hassle of a straight.  </li>
            <li>It really should have a little mark of some kind on it - Side A and Side B or red dot/blue dot or something like that.  </li>
            <li>It really should have a little mark of some kind on it - Side A and Side B or red dot/blue dot or something like that.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t seem to be blade sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no issues with any slipping caused by the smooth handle.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Coming from 20 years of using a straight razor this is definately faster and does it with far fewer nicks.</li>
            <li>I expected a better product since England products are generally well made.</li>
            <li>straight razor, Feather AC DX raxor and this EJ is near the top!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I nicked myself a few times the first couple of times I shaved with it, but apparently your skin needs to become acclimated to it because now I don&#x27;t cut myself any longer and my skin feels better.  </li>
            <li>I realized, after using it a few times, that any more handle would throw the balance off and be burdensome in the hand.  </li>
            <li>This was my first modern double edge safety razor.  </li>
            <li>Normally I just use a gillette mach 3 razor</li>
            <li>I ordered this razor only a few days ago, and am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>So, my subconscious is giving this one a pretty high rating!</li>
            <li>These models are all very forgiving which makes any of them perfect for beginners who are trying to learn the proper technique without cutting their face to ribbons in the process.  </li>
            <li>The chroming on this razor is as thick as I&#x27;ve ever seen or felt and looks absolutely spectacular.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands of blades yet, as the included ones seem to work fine.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m rather happy with the performance of this razor so far, and it seems to hold up to long term shaving as well due to robust construction.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s billed as &amp;#34;Faux Ebony&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s really just a black smooth surface on the handle.</li>
            <li>But, it is true, there are other razors with much easier blade systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this is a fine razor for anyone either interested in traditional wet shaving or just looking for something new to add to their arsenal.</li>
            <li>Now, as I&#x27;m fairly new to shaving with a DE safety razor, I did have some concerns and questions.  </li>
            <li>Anyone new to DE shaving would do well to consider this piece.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They shipped me a brand new replacement razor within a week.</li>
            <li>but hey i like to try new things.</li>
            <li>Just purchased this new Edwin Jagger De86bl razor</li>
            <li>and i live it.</li>
            <li>Looks like new.</li>
            <li>At 35 I&#x27;m new to DE shaving.  </li>
            <li>, I recommend this razor to anyone who is looking to step up to a new DE razor.</li>
            <li>Its new</li>
            <li>Fundamentally this shave is way closer that my mach 3, Fusion and the new Gillette 4 blade swivel ball razor.</li>
            <li>Being new to DE safety razor shaving, I think I am leaning toward the longer handles.  </li>
            <li>any of that changes I&#x27;ll post new impressions.</li>
            <li>I am still new to using safety razors.</li>
            <li>I am new to safety razors,and have not cut myself once.</li>
            <li>Ordered this razor from Amazon for delivery in New Delhi, India, a week ago.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a new razor just because, this one will not disappoint you.  </li>
            <li>I can live with that</li>
            <li>I loved the shave and the minimal cost after the initial expense, but unfortunately the time and attention required for a quality (and safe) shave with a straight razor does not mesh well with the \\&quot;</li>
            <li>This is my first DE and my first razor for wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It makes the natural movements around the neck and those odd places like the jaw line under the ear and over the adams apple much more natural feeling.  </li>
            <li>Treat yourself to one of the few nice things left in life !</li>
            <li>/&gt;The razor blades are far (very far!)</li>
            <li>The quickest and closest shave is two quick passes in alternating directions rather than laboring with a single aggressive pass.</li>
            <li>As it is, the weight and length feel very natural to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy the few minutes spent doing fine trimming and shaving (I have a goatee</li>
            <li>The double edge feather blades on this razor did not give me a burn on the first pass of a new blade, like the Feather AC DX did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any more in-grown hairs and I have very little razor burn now.</li>
            <li>If I remember correctly, you pushed a little button on the side and the top gently popped open for you to change the blade.  </li>
            <li>I remember correctly, you pushed a little button on the side and the top gently popped open for you to change the blade.  </li>
            <li>Just be aware that this Razor has a short handle.  </li>
            <li>Your initial investment will be higher but these items are to be considered a lifetime investment.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that I was shaving with a double edged razor and hence was expecting a lot of knicks after my shave.</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor and I am not going back to my old one!</li>
            <li>This is my first double razor.</li>
            <li>This was my first double edge razor and I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li>This is my first double edged razor.</li>
            <li>Use short strokes at first.</li>
            <li>I ordered this razor after seeing it highly-recommended in several discussion boards, for the same reasons that many others are switching back to DE safety razors.</li>
            <li>There were times I went through 2-3 razors after not shaving for a while while completely massacring my face with those things, each time cursing how I just threw out 2-3 bucks just to shave once!</li>
            <li>It definitely took some getting used to (again, first timer) but</li>
            <li>The only thing that I do not like about this razor is the when the blade is installed it sticks out more on one side than the other.  </li>
            <li>sending a second email, in which I explained that I&#x27;d be letting others know about their customer service, they promptly replied, saying that my first email had never been received.</li>
            <li>first time I used it ,I nicked my upper lip and drew blood, something that has not happened in decades of using Gillette systems.</li>
            <li>I have just gone back to double edge shaving after giving them up many years ago to shave with multiple blade shavers that caused some ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>The razor arrived a full week before the expected date, in pristine condition.</li>
            <li>It also takes a little care to screw the head onto the body, because the threads don&#x27;t line up easily, and this could lead to a ruined razor with stripped threads if you don&#x27;t pay attention to what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That being said, I was about to upgrade my electric shaver when I first started reading reviews about old school double edge safety razors and decided to hold off on the new electric.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about these things, and this was my first safety razor, but it was highly rated by other sources (along with the Merkur)</li>
            <li>Have used Derby Extra razors, Shark blades, Gillete 7 o&#x27;clock and Feather high stainless.</li>
            <li>After a few nicks while learning how to use the razor I&#x27;m not able to get a great shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>But as it is, my ring finger and pinky don&#x27;t even fit on the handle, so it&#x27;s a bit odd.  </li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor, and I&#x27;ve been using it daily for nearly 6 months.  </li>
            <li>If you do have extra large hands this razor might not be suitable for you as it is a little on the  smaller side.</li>
            <li>Razor is very nice and is quite heavy, but this is light years better then that piece of Chinese crap that the Pawn star Rick endorses.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trick is keep a nice angle, and go slow!</li>
            <li>Before purchasing, I watched a few \\&quot;how to\\&quot; YouTube videos which were pretty valuable to help start off right.  </li>
            <li>The razor has a solid feel and is easy to hold--no slipping while shaving.</li>
            <li>I have used the Jagger now for the past three and a half weeks, loving every shave!</li>
            <li>Like many reviews on other sites, the handle is very smooth and can be a bit slick to hold when wet.</li>
            <li>My only reservation might be if you have large hands.</li>
            <li>specific razor was very comfortable as a few members on Reddit had mentioned.</li>
            <li>The handle is smaller than I expected but it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>I have to add a little pressure and go over the same spot many times, which still doesn’t always yield the results I’m looking for.  </li>
            <li>Will I have to be super careful compared to using, say, a Mach 3?&lt;br /&gt;-No!  </li>
            <li>It is extremely sturdy, and changing the blades is quick and painless.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an extremely quality razor, it could EASILY sell for double its asking price.</li>
            <li>It also came with 5 Derby Extra razor blades, which I really like.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I prefer the appearance of the faux-ebony handle to all stainless steel.</li>
            <li>you will want to have a bonfire for your old shavers- disposable, or electric.</li>
            <li>you will want to have a bonfire for your old shavers- disposable, or electric.</li>
            <li>far it has been quite the experience</li>
            <li>They scrape your face when going over concave parts like neck near near your chin.</li>
            <li>it gives a very close shave and has enough heft to appreciate how well it is made.</li>
            <li>then I tried my go to blade the Wilkinson Sword and lightened up on the pressure and WOW what a shave.</li>
            <li>I bought a second one for a friend for his birthday and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Box was classy and gave the feeling of luxury.</li>
            <li>I need to shave every day, but it is not heavy.</li>
            <li>Compared to that one, this EJ razor is far milder in terms of irritation, bumps, cuts, etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wrote to the company and got no answer so far...</li>
            <li>I gave this to my 19yr old son and he loves it.</li>
            <li>Bought for the boyfriend because he&#x27;s always wanted an old school safety razor.</li>
            <li>I was about 3 years old.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, something that&#x27;s 10 times as expensive will not knock your socks off ten times more than this, it will only be marginally better.</li>
            <li>He has somewhat sensitive skin and has had no issues using this razor.</li>
            <li>I am 72 years old and I have been using an electric shaver for about 15 years.</li>
            <li>The De86bl is really just the same!</li>
            <li>I am a complete rookie.</li>
            <li>Also, while you are dumping that old razor, get yourself a shave set with the soap, bowl, &amp; brush.</li>
            <li>They tend to snap completely off where the head screws into the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finished with my old Merkur.  </li>
            <li>This short handle razor works very well with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>recommended I go \\&quot;old school.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>but it actually handles very well.</li>
            <li>I need to take a second pass with both to get real close.</li>
            <li>but I gather it&#x27;s \\&quot;standard\\&quot; as far as DE razors go.</li>
            <li>I have tried different blades with it and have yet to cut or even so much nick.  </li>
            <li>So far he loves it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and each time I shaved</li>
            <li>if the handle had broke, I wouldn&#x27;t have been terribly surprised -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft brass.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not been a problem so far.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly and has saved me a ton of money on those crap 25 blade disposables.  </li>
            <li>I now own two of these razors from Edwin Jagger and both heads are broken.  </li>
            <li>The price of new razors is so high I switched back.</li>
            <li>After much reading on the subject of &#x27;First DE Razor&#x27;</li>
            <li>when ordering this specific Edwin Jagger was the fact that it&#x27;s handle is smooth, rather than textured like some of the other EJ.</li>
            <li>It becomes a major chore to un-screw the handle to whipe clean and dry the razor parts for the next use.    </li>
            <li>I was a little nervous at first with the smooth faux ebony handle, but these fears were unfounded as I have not slipped with it once, even with wet hands.  </li>
            <li>Better cutting of stubble; but not cutting or dragging, or pulling of the (well prepped; very sensitive) skin!</li>
            <li>I went back to double edged shaving to alleviate the high cost of modern razor cartridges.    </li>
            <li>Its important to watch some youtube videos on proper wet shaving techniques before you jump in full force and destroy your face.</li>
            <li>This was against my father advice who tried multiple blades for 1 month then went back to his Gillette Super Speed and an old English razor.</li>
            <li>The first razor I got, after my last electric died, was an inexpensive Chinese import.</li>
            <li>At first I saw that it was a short handle razor and was possibly thinking of returning.</li>
            <li>This is a razor, a safety razor no less, so there should be</li>
            <li>/&gt;The second one, this exact model, I&#x27;ve only had for a week.  </li>
            <li>(first pass should be with, second pass across, third against if you feel you need it</li>
            <li>The solid reviews and decent prices landed me on this Edwin Jagger model.</li>
            <li>Not exactly good build quality for such a popular razor.</li>
            <li>Maybe the guy who made mine was on vacation in china and had a few too many pints that day.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money, spend a little more on another brand</li>
            <li>A small crack wouldn&#x27;t have mattered much, but both coverings cracked to the point of becoming loose and moving around while shaving.  </li>
            <li>Everything about it seems high quality and built to last.  </li>
            <li>My husband highly recommends this razor to anyone especially a beginner.</li>
            <li>The top head with the screw connector is not available, although I saw the head advertised for almost the same price as the entire razor with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The handle was shorter than expected but during my first shave I noticed it felt</li>
            <li>I wish I spent a little more money on the &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The handle is fairly short, and the plastic is pretty slippery when it gets wet (I shave in the shower), and though it&#x27;s great for shaving your face, it is dangerous for your head.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I also considered a couple of the similarly priced Merkur razors, most reviews I read said that these were fairly similar performing razors, so the final decision came down to appearance.</li>
            <li>If you are new to DE razor shaving, know that different razors will &amp;#34;give</li>
            <li>I was reveiwing a new double edge shaver to replace the shavers I have now.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that this razor comes with the Derby brand blades which left much to be desired.</li>
            <li>When I was ready to graduate from my Weishi twist to open razor, I read extensively and decided to try this baby out.</li>
            <li>I have a few safety razors in my shave den, including this one, a Merkur 34C, a Merkur Futur, and two vintage Gilettes, a Slim Adjustable and a Super Speed.</li>
            <li>Now, I have a very sensitive skin and any razor that I&#x27;ve used have given me rash and made my face red.</li>
            <li>I found it really isn&#x27;t that hard or that tricky (except for right under the nose- that takes some effort).</li>
            <li>This will last you nearly 2 years!</li>
            <li>the more expensive Muhle use the exact same heads, except</li>
            <li>It was well balance that when I first shaved I was not nicked or cut like I have been before with other DE shavers.</li>
            <li>The little Weishi razor was really quite decent.  </li>
            <li>The Edwin Jagger razor is also less aggressive: if I pass the razor down my cheek after the stubble is mostly gone, I often don&#x27;t even feel the blade.</li>
            <li>More importantly, it does not suffer from the quality control issues that plague less expensive razors.  </li>
            <li>first one I had was a Chatsworth Style, imitation horn handle.  </li>
            <li>Not that this thing won&#x27;t cut or nick, but if you go slow while you&#x27;re learning and you read up or watch some tutorials, you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li>Bought a second for travel, my first is a few years old and still looks brand new.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is actually three pieces: The handle, and &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; piece, and the main head piece (no idea what the actual terms for these are).</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve fallen victim to shaving most of my adult life with the usual, big-brand-names with ever-increasing blade counts (3, 4, 5 and counting!).</li>
            <li>The second one was a little more rough.  </li>
            <li>The second one was a little more rough.  </li>
            <li>A little short but nice and heavy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After doing my research and making a bad purchase, I finally narrowed my choice to this beautiful DE Safety Razor.</li>
            <li>Fair enough, as you could potentially slice and dice your mug pretty bad if you hold it like a baseball bat.  </li>
            <li>Completely and utterly sold.</li>
            <li>and I have absolutely no regrets in picking it up.  </li>
            <li>One night I saw that &amp;#34;Micro-touch One&amp;#34; commercial with Rick from Pawn Star&#x27;s advertising an old school razor.</li>
            <li>You just like let it glide across and let the blade just barely touch you and the hair comes off.  </li>
            <li>So far I have only used the Derby extras (like those supplied) and Wilkinson Sword blades.  </li>
            <li>I will never go back to my old razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was quite surprised how short the handle is, which took a bit of getting used to.</li>
            <li>If used properly this thing cleaves through hair, much closer than I ever got with my cartridge razors, especially after a second</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only put in the Derby blade to the kit (Derby comes with the razor)</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only put in the Derby blade to the kit (Derby comes with the razor)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re considering DE shaving you might want to watch a few YouTube videos and definitely do research on the different types of razors available.</li>
            <li>It looks like the handle would be very slippery when used with wet hands, but I never had any problems with a slippery handle.  </li>
            <li>There is no drag at all with this shaver no matter what brand of razor you use.</li>
            <li>So I wanted to switch to a safety razor (also apparently known as a double-edge or DE razor)</li>
            <li>If they had been around during the 40s, one imagines a  jowl-cheeked Winston Churchill demanding his secretary replace his straight-razor after trying to shave during the blitz: &#x27;do call those Edwin Jagger fellows and have a safety razor sent, I damn near cut my throat during that last raid!&#x27;.</li>
            <li>completely turned a chore into a pleasurable hobby and without taking even the smallest step backward in the fineness of my shave, my shave quality has actually improved since moving on from the &amp;#34;five</li>
            <li>Feeling like I should complete the set I finally purchased this razor.</li>
            <li>this is it, but as far as lasting a lifetime like I had hoped, well, it just did not !!!!</li>
            <li>with a thick, smooth chrome finish you don&#x27;t see on anything anymore.</li>
            <li>The handle felt a little slippery and took some practice figuring out the right grip, but I don&#x27;t even think about it now.</li>
            <li>The handle is a little on the short side, but I got used to it fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>The price is hard to beat, and it is solidly built, and is easy to shave with.</li>
            <li>but it also looks cool, particularly when sitting in the bathroom with the black Edwin Jagger badger brush and a black ceramic shaving mug.</li>
            <li>The balance point is that second ring down, under the head, between the chrome, and the black handle top.</li>
            <li>I was prepared for a long session with this new razor but not so.</li>
            <li>Maybe the Futur was too heavy, but the gap is just right on this razor.  </li>
            <li>When I first held this razor in my hand I was blown away by the chrome and black.</li>
            <li>First DE razor I&#x27;ve ever owned and will never go back to other razors.  </li>
            <li>I tried Shark, Sharp, Feather, blades and same thing (although the Feather did not tear up my face - it breezed through my flesh like a hot samurai sword through butter) every time.  </li>
            <li>Keep your fingers and the handle dry (not hard to do) and your grip will not be a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The quality is something hard to find in this day and age, I just am starting to go back to shaving like I did back in High School, am going to go shave right now and will write another review once done !</li>
            <li>Only have had amazing shaves using this razor and my usual Proraso Green soap.</li>
            <li>It has a smooth grip handle that gets a little slippery when wet.  </li>
            <li>He absolutely adores it (along with all of the other products to go with the razor).</li>
            <li>Also, when I was younger and my beard not as tough, it would have worked better.  </li>
            <li>I take the whole thing apart after each shave and wash and dry the two pieces of the guard, the blade and the handle, so I&#x27;m used to handling the razor and threading it onto the little pegs and screwing the whole thing together now.  </li>
            <li>Not a single flaw.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly not a single cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do like the longer handle though, but I have had a few nicks while shaving, which doesn&#x27;t happen with any of the other razors I have used so far (cheap no-brand Chinese model,</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the smooth handle.  </li>
            <li>Years ago, when I was on active duty in the Marines, I went through a straight razor phase.  </li>
            <li>Pay the extra money for the version with the grip on the handle—the ebony handle gets really slippery when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li>I imagined it being bigger, its smaller than the old cartridge razor I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>It is my fourth double edge safety razor, and by far the easiest to shave with.</li>
            <li>Was kind of disappointed at first</li>
            <li>Not with a DE, the thick openings keep the hair out from clogging, even if it did just unscrew it a bit and clean it</li>
            <li>I have not used the Derby blades included with this product, but if you care to try them, make sure you try different brands of blades if the Derbys perform poorly to find what works for you.</li>
            <li>However, it is a slightly aggressive razor, so while I would recommend it highly, I would not recommend it as a &amp;#34;first razor&amp;#34; for someone new to double edge razor shaving.  </li>
            <li>This tiny bit of metal has been chromed over, so it&#x27;s not sharp, but I can feel it against my skin when I shave</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned with the length of the handle when I first saw it.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to at first, but it is a quality product.</li>
            <li>- Takes the same amount of time as using any major brand shavor</li>
            <li>High quality blade for a beginner to use to get started in wet shaving.</li>
            <li>The head is very heavy and it bends the actual razor blade into more of a curve that any of my other razors.  </li>
            <li>I have coarse beard and sensitive skin and have used proraso white for my trials with the various blades.  </li>
            <li>I have a few more to try including nacet, Gillette silver blue, Kai, feather, and a few others.  </li>
            <li>This exposed the copper beneath and is very unfortunate because otherwise I loved this razor.</li>
            <li>and it shaved really well, but only a few months after I got it, the faux ebony handle cracked right down the middle.</li>
            <li>As other posts have said this razor does have some heft to, similar to the Merkur 34C, but much lighter than the Merkur Future.</li>
            <li>It is not very aggressive and it is not adjustable, which are things that might cause a new DE shaver to cut or nick themselves.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a long time electric razor user, but wanted to get back in touch with my early DE shaving days.</li>
            <li>With the TTO design I always felt that the blade wasn&#x27;t being held firmly or that blade after blade sat exactly in the same place time and time again.  </li>
            <li>That was the only blade which I find not sharp enough, and with some extra push, I cut myself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started shaving as a young adult with a typical 2 blade plastic razor.</li>
            <li>Coupled together with a thick lather, a mild blade (Derby), and proper technique</li>
            <li>I know that giving it a fancy opening mechanism would mean moving parts, and moving parts would mean potential failure, but still... it feels like there&#x27;s got to be a more elegant way than dis-assembly to change the blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know that giving it a fancy opening mechanism would mean moving parts, and moving parts would mean potential failure, but still... it feels like there&#x27;s got to be a more elegant way than dis-assembly to change the blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just get a proper brush and some good shaving cream that does not contain any alcohol or nasty chemicals and enjoy, i have never enjoyed shaving so much in my life...</li>
            <li>Alot of little nicks and much irritation occured from these blades.</li>
            <li>The trade-offs are that it&#x27;s more likely to clog, and it&#x27;s not good for shaving other body parts.</li>
            <li>I was in the market for my first double edge safety razor, and based on reviews and suggestion on various sites, and after looking at a number of cheaper alternatives, I settled on the De86.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being as much as twice as expensive as some cheaper options, the De86 is still relatively inexpensive as far as double edge razors go.</li>

            <li> Just about perfect...</li>
            <li> You ARE going to have to take a month or so to find the best blades for your face, learn your technique, and teach yourself that you just don&#x27;t use pressure with these things (there will be blood otherwise).</li>
            <li> The chrome finish is perfect in all aspects.</li>
            <li> Great for gift giving!</li>
            <li> Awesome razor!  </li>

            <li> Excellent DE razor.</li>
            <li> This has made it an excellent choice for learning as the fool-proof blade loading allows me to concentrate on my technique without worrying about razor setup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Man what a great razor!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome razor.</li>
            <li> That being said, my buddy is very very happy with it.</li>
            <li> But no, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> One of the best things is...</li>
            <li> it locks the blade in; perfectly and evenly, every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found this razor to be the perfect weight and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome.</li>

            <li> I also got Edwin Jagger&#x27;s best badger brush because of the price</li>
            <li> Excellent razor.</li>
            <li> Six months on, and moving to DE razors is still one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> Again, this style is wonderful, but beware of the plastic coverings.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month  with absolutely wonderful results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the best shave of my life using this razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And if you want the best shave, throw the blade out after one use, it&#x27;s 13 cents, not going to break</li>
            <li> Might be perfect for some but not me.</li>

            <li> However, whether that would have been the case or not - the blade on this DE86 is perfectly aligned and held rock-solid in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This Razor is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Has a wonderful head on it, maybe one of the best in the business!!</li>

            <li> All the reviews saying how great this razor looks are spot on.</li>
            <li> All great except the Feathers which were like shaving with a plasma welder (too damn</li>
            <li> Might be overlooked as being a great razor for the beginner, as well as a very nice bald head razor.</li>
            <li> This is a handsome razor!!</li>
            <li> I can say that the razor is very nice.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m loving this razor!</li>
            <li> As many have commented, the build quality of the Edwin Jagger razors is superb.  </li>
            <li> Robust and sturdy, chrome looks amazing and the shave is incredible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not a perfect shaving solution, just cheaper than sticks, like the Gillette Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;I receive more cuts with this razor than sticks.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> Nice gift!</li>
            <li> I could see myself adding a more aggressive razor to my kit after I perfect my technique, but I don&#x27;t see myself ever getting rid of the EJ.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those plastic things never can do what the iron can :P</li>
            <li> The plating is impeccable.</li>
            <li> I have been using a &#x27;79 Gillette Speed Safe for those couple of years with the Dorco Platinum razors and have been very happy with DE shaving</li>

            <li> It is a good looking, good shaving razor until it breaks.  </li>
            <li> I believe that this is what gives me a superior shave as it is the biggest difference I can see in construction of it.  </li>
            <li> Unquestionably superior to multi-blade razors from the store.</li>
            <li> The Kelvin would be a good choice.</li>
            <li> The head attaches securely to the handle, and the blade centers itself perfectly every time.</li>
            <li> Razor looks good came with no damage.</li>

            <li> And what a smooth, wonderful glide it was.</li>

            <li> Good weight too.</li>
            <li> It has a good heft and fits my hand well.</li>
            <li> It shaves really good.</li>
            <li> For the price it really is a good razor.</li>

            <li> I paid a good price, and got a good razor.</li>
            <li> It shaves good too.</li>
            <li> Good news:</li>
            <li> Good quality, well made.</li>
            <li> so I just have to swap out the blades, and saw good reviews for this item.</li>
            <li> If used correctly with a good ASTRA or Derby blade, this razor does not nick or cut.</li>
            <li> The Derby blades do a good job for me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
            <li> He used one at my house and loved it.</li>
            <li> One note- the included blades aren&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li> I took a good recommendation online, and that&#x27;s what lead me to this one over the Merkur.</li>
            <li> Fantastic razor,shaves awesome.</li>
            <li> Hope your experience will be as good as mine.</li>
            <li> This one was recommended for beginners along with the Merkur HD and this one definitely is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Use a good shave soap with it and your face will look as if you havent even shaved.  </li>
            <li> for the price it is a good entry level safety razor.</li>
            <li> A good value reliable razor.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> I also have a Feather razor (the $ 20 by Jatai) and that handle is a good deal longer.</li>
            <li> good close shave.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that I was getting into an obsession, but I have loved every part about it.</li>

            <li> Excellent, mild razor.</li>

            <li> Just know that EJ doesn&#x27;t make garbage so anything you buy will look great and work even better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway I&#x27;m happy and hope to get better with practice.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason this razor has overwhelmingly 5-star reviews: it&#x27;s just that great.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this razor.  </li>

            <li> I absolutely love mine!</li>
            <li> He was so excited that and happy about the gift for him from me and agreed that I made a good choice.</li>
            <li> An excellent choice if you&#x27;re thinking of getting this as your first shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I must say that for my first safety razor, I thought I made the perfect choice!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll proceed to put it in a vice grip and see if I have better luck, but Edwin Jagger -- come on!</li>
            <li> Love it !</li>
            <li> Its pretty awesome.</li>

            <li> I love the Edwin Jagger!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I decided to return!  </li>
            <li> It is beautiful out of the box and delivers a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> pretty awesome razor until you drop it.</li>
            <li> I have always used cartridges, but even my first time with this was probably the best shave of my life.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and looks great.</li>
            <li> Great balance; easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li> Easily one of the best looking and comfortable razors in this price range.</li>
            <li> This is a fine razor with a great weight to it.</li>
            <li> Very nice looking and easy to assemble for use.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Great weight and balance, doesn&#x27;t slip, even with the smooth handle.</li>
            <li> The weight feels great in the hand and ensures a smooth shaving experience every time.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing.</li>
            <li> amazing-</li>
            <li> and  it blows my mind how amazing this razor is.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to anyone looking for a nice safety razor to start out with.</li>
            <li> This thing gives me the absolute best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy, with great heft in the head to provide sufficient pressure against the face, it&#x27;s a cinch to unscrew to replace the blade, and it looks great too.  </li>
            <li> The weight is perfect and makes the whole &amp;#34;let the razor&#x27;s weight do the work&amp;#34; thing a breeze.</li>
            <li> My three star is partly my own fault.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely thrilled with my decision to try this.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a kind of mini FAQ I put together based on my own concerns:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the result is good though it cost me more time every morning.</li>
            <li> I own a Merkur 180, a Parker 96R, and this razor, and</li>
            <li> I found the razor to be nicely balanced.  </li>
            <li> Nice, shiny and elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I own 4 DE razors...</li>
            <li> but gives a nice even shave.</li>
            <li> Was between the Merkur and Edwin Jagger, liked the handle on this one.</li>
            <li> It is stylish, it has a good weight</li>
            <li> Do yourself a good service and start shaving with a safety razor, you&#x27;ll get a better shave</li>
            <li> nice by the sink&lt;br /&gt;well</li>
            <li> Medium aggressiveness with a nice chrome finish on the head.</li>
            <li> , it has a nice finish.</li>
            <li> good safety razor love the look</li>
            <li> I own the ebony, ivory and chrome models.  </li>
            <li> After about two good uses, I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> but it fits in perfectly and really looks nice too.</li>
            <li> Looks nice also.</li>
            <li> I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell any difference and</li>
            <li> honestly have no clue why men switched from these to the plastic disposables.</li>
            <li> and she wants one just like it, because it was the best razor she ever used.</li>
            <li> Nice weight and feel.  </li>
            <li> I liked the set</li>
            <li> I did a ton of research and loved this razor more for the looks than anything else.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a nice weight to it</li>
            <li> Looking through the packaging that I kept, I see that there&#x27;s no mention of any kind of warranty.</li>
            <li> It comes with a 5-pack of derby blades which is nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d still recommend Edwin Jagger Razors (it shaved really nice before it broke)</li>
            <li> and I had to own one for myself.  </li>
            <li> Nice razor.</li>
            <li> It is well balanced so you won&#x27;t have to apply any real pressure or worry about nicking yourself if your grip isn&#x27;t perfect.</li>
            <li> Nice beginner razor.</li>
            <li> nice finish.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work well, nice shave.</li>
            <li> Nice construction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To use this kind of construction on a razor of this price and &#x27;pedigree&#x27; is shameful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the durability of this razor is still nice.</li>
            <li> Great razor, great price, very durable.</li>
            <li> They match up really nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice razor, but it slipped out of my hand in the shower and broke.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful and has a good weight to it, so it can easily slide across your skin, leaving you baby butt smooth.</li>
            <li> A very nice, comfortable razor.</li>
            <li> and the top is rounded perfectly to give you a consistent razor angle against your skin.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t much more expense than the competition, so if you positively love nice things, buy EJ!</li>
            <li> I also have a Ballie that was a pretty inexpensive but very good razor.  </li>
            <li> Free blades are a nice bonus!</li>
            <li> Attractive, good weight, not too aggressive, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon and the razor was replaced with a new one which is perfect.</li>
            <li> quite a beautiful razor, very elegant and really well crafted.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this razor,just superb.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve done a good job selling us on the idea that more blades on a razor is better, no matter WHAT the cost.</li>
            <li> The Jagger shaving heads are excellent and this razor looks very classy but the slickness of the handle is a deal killer for me.  </li>
            <li> and it cleans very easily.</li>
            <li> The Derby blades that it came with worked great as a first timer!</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely beautiful and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> but like I said they are old but work flawlessly with a variety of blades.</li>
            <li> So smooth, a good heft to it.</li>
            <li> First off this razor is beautiful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s diminutive size takes nothing away from the crisp lines and beautiful chrome</li>
            <li> So Disapointed, a beautiful razor to look at , but did not last, enjoyed it while it held together though, now will look for another brand and type of safety razor, if you are looking for a beautiful work of art for your Razor stand</li>
            <li> Not only is it beautiful but performs great as well.  </li>
            <li> This was my first foray into DE shaving, and I think it&#x27;s one of the best options available for beginners and long-time shavers alike.</li>
            <li> It turns out that super aggressive razor used with duller blades works amazing!</li>
            <li> Easy to use but follow the directions if you have never used this type of razor!  </li>
            <li> The DE by far give the best shaving experiences, shave closer than anything I have used before, and my skin feels a hundred times better.</li>
            <li> He had to order a different kind and is very happy now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very sturdy, nicely built and gives great shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> great product and very very cost efficient..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also of great quality and very very durable from what i can tell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this is a very good exception.</li>
            <li> I rinsed it again, and a very large (finger-nail sized) piece of the chrome plating fell off the top edge of the razor!!</li>
            <li> As a side note, it arrived three days early, a very pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> I have used MANY and own many razors and this is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> I have not nicked myself and can generally have a wonderfully close shave with 1 pass using the Wilkinsons.</li>
            <li> I had been eye balling this Edwin Jagger for some time now, but had put it off because I was pretty happy with my razor, but decided to splurge on myself and on something I use every day.  </li>
            <li> This is the first safety razor I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Also, be sure to assemble it correctly or your not going to get a good clean cut from it.</li>
            <li> I did a fine job of not gashing my face!</li>
            <li> Blades are held very securely, without a worry about them being misaligned.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and sleek look.</li>
            <li> This razor is very comfortable in the hand and while shaving.</li>
            <li> He said it gave him a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very smooth to shave with.</li>
            <li> It was a work of art and very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> a 4 pack of cartridges can run you a good $20 if you are lucky.</li>
            <li> This razor is super sleek and feels really good in your hand.</li>
            <li> First time using this kind of shaver and from the very start was completely impressed by the ease and closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quality is better than veery good and paired with the Shark Super Chrome (after going through a sampler pack)</li>
            <li> The head of the razor, in particular, is beautifully machined.</li>
            <li> The packaging on this razor is great, very high end feeling.</li>
            <li> If you look like the Brawny man, maybe you could get something more aggressive than this.</li>
            <li> Last thing, as everyone else says, DE razors are the best.</li>
            <li> how many blades were on that disposable razor, but this has changed all that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it, and this is a good razor to start with.</li>
            <li> This razor does an EXCELLENT job and feels solid in your hand.</li>
            <li> so I cannot say for sure that this would be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> t came with some Derby blades which were top notch.  </li>
            <li> However, this razor seems to be well received by most.</li>
            <li> I am a no-fuss type of guy when it comes to shaving, so I&#x27;m not doing more than one-pass.</li>
            <li> Jagger + Feather is a winning combination for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen a razor as well made and elegant as this one.  </li>
            <li> can pay more for a DE razor but why?</li>
            <li> Razor is very well made and performs great.</li>
            <li> but it turns out to be an advantage as it gives you better control.   </li>
            <li> Love Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li> This is a very fancy razor, which does a great job at shaving.</li>
            <li> , it makes so much more sense</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much more cost</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a gadget man, and i love how things work-</li>
            <li> Outstanding razor for the price.</li>
            <li> I was out of razor blades and decided I didn&#x27;t want to spend twenty dollars for four more.  </li>
            <li> Glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Like most experienced people say, let the weight of the razor do the work -- not so much pressure is needed as with the disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> may have gotten over confident with your handling of the razor and forgotten to let the weight of the razor do the work</li>
            <li> The Pearl is much more aggressive, but doesn&#x27;t necessaily give me a better shave.</li>
            <li> Like many of the reviewers here, I got into DE shaving to save on cost of razor blades.  </li>
            <li> This Edwin Jagger is top notch, and under priced.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> I have had for so many years.  </li>
            <li> I still have to perfect my technique but this is definitely the razor for beginners.</li>
            <li> From personal experience, I believe this is a excellent razor.  </li>
            <li> this razor is definitely the best.  </li>
            <li> Hoping it will serve for many years.</li>
            <li> love how the razor feels,</li>
            <li> I also have a Merkur 41 comb DE, this seems to shave more closely without being too aggressive.</li>
            <li> matter the angle or how many passes my beard always</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a more milder shave.  </li>
            <li> I researched for many days before purchasing this Jagger DE Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> The fit and finish looked absolutely perfect and the razor looked quite handsome with the Badger Brush and Clear Acrylic Stand that I purchased separately.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> 2 Edwin Jagger razors of which this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the &amp;#34;faux ebony&amp;#34; handle</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;m just more old-school.</li>
            <li> The box looks fancy and the razor itself is sexy.</li>
            <li> I look forward to many shaves.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a good weight to it and is easy to clean and change the blades.</li>
            <li> Once I used it, I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Love the Ebony handle.</li>
            <li> The jury is out as to which will ultimately be my favorite, but for now I&#x27;m using the Jagger and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the heft and build quality.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did my research.  </li>
            <li> well I can get a shave as closeas if not a bit better than my mach 3 ($$$)</li>
            <li> I use soap and a brush, waay better than foam in a can</li>
            <li> Good product worth the money</li>
            <li> I love this DE razor.</li>
            <li> This razor is top of the line.</li>
            <li> Let the blade do most of the work.</li>
            <li> love the feel of the razor.</li>
            <li> I love DE safety razors.</li>
            <li> I dialed into the EJ DE89 based mostly on the quality, and desire for a milder DE shaver to start with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for over four months and really love it.</li>
            <li> For me personally, I love this one.</li>
            <li> You will feel better.</li>
            <li> your wallet will fell better.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> It shaves better, is better constructed, and is cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Love this razor, good clean shave and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> So, I fired up my trusty Amazon to see if I could get a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I did not feel like anything was touching my skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll do more test to see if the burn improves.</li>
            <li> This razor is excellent, gives a close shave, and without the nicks and stubble left by the Futur.  </li>
            <li> I have some Wilkinson sword blades that I like better as they seem to give me a better shave though.</li>
            <li> My face is nice and smooth</li>
            <li> The handle and blades are amazing, but the quality of the head is cheap.  </li>
            <li> I would suspect that many of the buyers have already found this out.  </li>
            <li> I then tried it as well, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase, just bought a years supply of these same razors, [</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read some reviews and spring for better razors, maybe.  </li>
            <li> The chrome is top notch work</li>
            <li> No matter what the purists say, it is okay to use canned shave cream while getting used to this (or forever).</li>
            <li> If you get it, just make sure you let you kids know it isn&#x27;t something to touch.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would look based on the picture.  </li>
            <li> I just take my time and  make sure im not rushed or anything</li>
            <li> Enjoyed the craftsmanship of the razor.</li>
            <li> The overall finish on this razor is flawless.  </li>
            <li> I have another Edwin Jagger with the same head and the blade fits perfectly.  </li>
            <li> so i gave one more razor a try.</li>
            <li> Timeless, durable, and stylish.</li>
            <li> It sure beats the Parker 90R</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be pleased you did.</li>
            <li> Awesome double edge razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deceptive in that it works better without any pressure on</li>
            <li> I also bought a 32 blade mix pack (2 each of 16 brands) to try with it, so some blades may turn out better, but these work well for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic razor!  </li>
            <li> Best shave I have ever had, with Personna blue label blades.  </li>
            <li> And in my case, it seems to do it better than all the over-priced, multi-blade monstrosities I&#x27;ve stopped using.</li>
            <li> I still cannot believe how many shaves you can get out of one blade, either.</li>
            <li> and I cannot imagine a better razor.</li>
            <li> While putting a razor blade in requires a bit of assembly, the weighty feel and bonus five-pack of Derby blades more than makes up for it.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> The handle is compact, which is the appropriate size for the grip you need.</li>
            <li> razor itself is quite striking.</li>
            <li> It does, as others have proclaimed, look lovely.</li>
            <li> Skin is 110% better after shaving this way vs disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> After looking at it most of construction is plastic.</li>
            <li> I didn´t cut my self at all even put more pressure.</li>
            <li> You essentially get the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Operationally though, it works great and produces a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Operationally though, it works great and produces a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> This cuts smooth and effortlessly as it has a nice heft to it</li>
            <li> I love love love this razor.</li>
            <li> : Great for starters and those experienced in wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I invested in this.</li>
            <li> I find the shorter handle works better when shaving anyway.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this razor.</li>
            <li> make sure you rinse off the wax on the razors before inserting into the razor holder.</li>
            <li> great purchase, and a very classy-looking razor.</li>
            <li> There is a bit of a learning curve, but be patient and you will start having better quality shaves with no irritation.</li>
            <li> so i bought this in the hopes that it would be better for my razor bumps and im</li>
            <li> so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> im more than alright</li>
            <li> Frankly, my face feels better than ever.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t even nicked myself yet (of course now that I said something, I&#x27;m sure I will).</li>
            <li> 4 more words required.</li>
            <li> , it was a better more efficient shave than I had with the Parker 96r.</li>
            <li> more efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Out of all, feathers and gillette silver blues gave me the closest and most effortless shaves.  </li>
            <li> It is a fairly forgiving razor, not too aggressive but it strikes the right balance for me.</li>
            <li> What a mistake,,,,,,, do not buy this razor if you are looking for something to last many years, because this one will not !!!</li>
            <li> the Edwin Jagger razor is an excellent addition to the morning ritual most men wake up to.&lt;br /&gt;The Edwin Jagger compares favorably to the Merkur long handle safety razor, though slightly more &#x27;agressive&#x27; in nature.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The black handle is a nice touch and the balance is perfect.</li>
            <li> Has some heft to it yet very comfortable in hand, and easy to steer.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I bought one for myself!</li>
            <li> paired with a good blade and on my first try I didn&#x27;t even nick myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor sample that it comes with are pretty good as well but also try Feather razors.</li>
            <li> I got a pretty good deal on it as well.</li>
            <li> The chrome is great and the black handle makes it look very nice.  </li>
            <li> I think it provides a very nice shave and would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Product came new in box wrapped in tissue paper, and it has been great.</li>
            <li> At around 13 cents a blade delivered I am able to shave my beard and head twice easily before switching out blades, so you are looking at around 3 cents a shave if you just do your beard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Merkur works best with a safety razor that is very slightly larger than some cheap brands.</li>
            <li> Try to find a razor blade that works with your skin pair it with this razor for an experience you will only look forward too every morning (and yes I actually enjoy shaving every morning now) Happy Shaving!</li>
            <li> It is a solid product, has a nice weight to it, and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> Very classy look and great quality.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to clean when disassembled.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap and leave a very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> It feels more luxurious in a way with all the preparing and the smooth, comfortable shave that leaves a nice smooth face afterwards.</li>
            <li> Nice clean smooth shave every time..</li>
            <li> The quality and comfort of the shave is very good overall.</li>
            <li> , the fit and finish is great and overall it has a nice timeless look.  </li>
            <li> The chrome plating, fit, and finish on this razor are outstanding.</li>
            <li> When I felt comfortable with my technique, I wanted to move up to a better quality razor.  </li>
            <li> I use it to shave my legs and am extremely pleased with the quality of the shave and how smooth my legs feel.</li>
            <li> This one has a nicer feeling and more comfortable handle than the Merkur.  </li>
            <li> Also seems to fit better with the razors I found.  </li>
            <li> While it is true that a DE razor will require more time and a learned hand, the results are just as satisfying as that of any of the newest disposable cartridge razors out there.  </li>
            <li> The closed head razor is superb.</li>
            <li> After about a week, however, I was shaving effortlessly and naturally and achieving great results.</li>
            <li> I was able to comfortably grip it and glide it along my face.</li>
            <li> The feeling of having such control and precision with a razor is incredible.</li>
            <li> Fit and finish are top notch.  </li>
            <li> I had a cheap DE razor before it and am glad I got this.</li>
            <li> WOW -- great shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this one for roughly two years, and the handle still looks in perfect</li>
            <li> It is surprisingly satisfying the sound it makes and the feel of it working.</li>
            <li> I intend to return this one and hopefully get a better blade fit.  </li>
            <li> I find each blade lasts almost a week, which is pretty good considering how cheap they are.  </li>
            <li> You will always be able to get blades to fit it period.</li>
            <li> Has good weight, and very well made.</li>
            <li> any others to really give a fair comparison.</li>
            <li> It shaves very well and feels good to me.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much</li>
            <li> It also is not in the highest price tier for razors, meaning that it&#x27;s a great combination of cheap and easy to use but high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best way to shave with it will be in short, quick strokes.</li>
            <li> Got this for the boyfriend, he loved it and it looks very nice and classy on our bathroom sink with the SimplyBeautiful deluxe razor and brush stand and the Omega boar brush with the white handle.</li>
            <li> Easy to (dis)assemble.</li>
            <li> I bought an EJ prior to shaving using straights and for the most part I was completely happy shaving using it.</li>
            <li> to change blades; easily tightening and loosening handle.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and I never cut my face.</li>
            <li> If, you are not afraid to use double edge, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  - Easy to handle and hold</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble/disassemble.</li>
            <li> Changing the blade is fairly easy.</li>
            <li> Also, the razor blades, unlike the cartridges, can be easily recycled.</li>
            <li> The pack of blades it came with are very mild</li>
            <li> I found the dome on this prevented me from having an easy time under my nose, so with that, I deduct one star.</li>
            <li> The head and comb are 2 pieces, which unscrew from the handle, which allows for easy loading/unloading of your razor, as well as easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> I easily switch between the two.</li>
            <li> The blades that it comes with are decent, good for 3-5 shaves depending on your beard growth rate and thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good classic design.  </li>
            <li> from the beautiful plating, they fit the hand well, have a good weight, and are a forgiving razor.&lt;br /&gt;Teens just starting out, women, and experienced wet shavers can all enjoy a smooth, close, shave with this EJ product.</li>
            <li> I liked to weight very much, which is just a tad on the heavier side..</li>
            <li> Also, most gel shaving creams will work fine with the razor - there&#x27;s no reason to buy a brush and shave soap to go with it unless you just really want to be fancy for your own enjoyment.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am not giving it 5 starts is the handle is a little shorter than ideal but otherwise perfect.</li>
            <li> It is a solidly built, beautifully finished product.  </li>
            <li> and it went through my whiskers nicely on the first shave.  </li>
            <li> and it went through my whiskers nicely on the first shave.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this razor at first</li>
            <li> Good heft and the threads and fit of the machined parts seems high quality.  </li>
            <li> Very good, well built single blade razor.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and easy to use - true winner!  </li>
            <li> This company knows how to make fine razors.</li>
            <li> This razor is a fine piece.  </li>
            <li> it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a guy with a lighter beard this is probably fine.  </li>
            <li> I would call it a damn fine shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, i watched a lot of videos and saw people using these razors with a lot of ease and was amazed at how quickly it removed hair with not too many strokes..</li>
            <li> a super smooth and close shave!  </li>
            <li> or is this what true, good stainless steel is supposed to be like?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working on finding the right amount of lather (Proraso shaving cream), but for a first attempt I still got a good shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, liking it a lot.</li>
            <li> Ready to use, easy to use and has a nice chrome finish.</li>
            <li> this is my second safety razor, and to be honest I love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately, I can tell you it works fine with cheap canned shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> These little razors are excellent.</li>
            <li> Incredibly impressed with this little razor.</li>
            <li> kind of tricky to assemble and all that, but its a great little razor.</li>
            <li> I read very good things about those blades, but my old Gillette Sensor II Excel gives me a much closer shave on one pass than the Derby blades.</li>
            <li> I paired it with feather blades and it does its job very smoothly, just glides right over.</li>
            <li> As most wet shavers will tell you, what performance you get out of razors, creams, soaps, brushes, blades, etc., will greatly vary by user.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a huge issue for me because I wanted a &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; razor.</li>
            <li> it felt cheap</li>
            <li> The Jagger razor is very well finished and has a nice heft.</li>
            <li> I have never had a shave this smooth.  </li>
            <li> so opening the razor to replace blades is more fun and fascination than a chore.</li>
            <li> but maybe that&#x27;s just me being used to cheap</li>
            <li> the it primarily made of zinc and plastic.</li>
            <li> This razor trumps any commercially available cartridge razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I was nick free.  </li>
            <li> This razor is heavy and the finish is flawless.</li>
            <li> I have a light to medium beard.</li>
            <li> you haven&#x27;t ever used a double edge razor, this is a great one to start on.</li>
            <li> perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that the &amp;#34;faux ebony&amp;#34; handle might look cheap</li>
            <li> but it is attractive and is not especially slippery.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes steal it to shave my legs, closer shave than a cartridge 5-blade razor and replacement blades for this are dirt cheap.</li>
            <li> One of my problem areas when shaving are my cheeks, I could never seem to get them as smooth as I&#x27;d like, but after a couple passes with this, my cheeks are silky</li>
            <li> was worried the plastic handle would be too light</li>
            <li> , it may not be as grippy as a knurled handle, but I have had zero grip issues with the smooth handle.</li>
            <li> It works with Feather or Shark blades and is easy to take apart and clean when changing blades - unlike the Futur.  </li>
            <li> The blades are dirt cheap &amp;</li>
            <li> It shaves or but does not slide as smooth as my Merkur</li>
            <li> Overall, a great razor with mild/moderate aggressiveness, great looks and feels solid in the hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy shaving.</li>
            <li> It just requires deliberate, thoughtful strokes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I like that it&#x27;s not some cheaply made piece of metal.  </li>
            <li> In spite of the smooth handle I did not have a problem holding onto it.</li>
            <li> As either one is great,then just try diff blades to fit your beard and face..</li>
            <li> Save your money and enjoy this razor.  </li>
            <li> Looks great hanging on the stand I got for it next to my badger brush.  </li>
            <li> Edwin Jagger makes some fantastic stuff, and this razor is no exception.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was recommended to me by several people as a novice razor and it was a great choice.</li>
            <li> It seems a bit light.</li>
            <li> I use Proraso for my products, however feel free to use what you like.</li>
            <li> Dont buy the cheap blades though.  </li>
            <li> I truly enjoy this razor.</li>
            <li> It is also easy to keep clean without having water spots on it all the time.</li>
            <li> Quality is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> There is no added pressure needed when letting this glide across your skin which leads to an amazingly smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This razor isn&#x27;t too aggressive, which is great for starting out.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy the weight and design of this over all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heck, I enjoy shaving with this razor and look forward to it.</li>
            <li> Purchased two of these for family members and they&#x27;re fantastic shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Aside</li>
            <li> I really enjoy my razor.  </li>
            <li> Well, I cannot compare the EJ to the Merkur, but I can confidently say that after using the EJ twice I have never gotten better results from any cartridge or straight razor.  </li>
            <li> I use this razor with good old Barbasol from a can.  </li>
            <li> The chrome handle looks nice, and if you can afford it you should probably get it, but it makes absolutely no difference in the shave quality, so I suggest putting that $10 towards some good shave creme or blades</li>
            <li> So I called them directly, and they could not have been more courteous.</li>
            <li> Build quality is good, I like the fact that it comes apart completely rather than using the butterfly opening of the parker.</li>
            <li> I would have had a problem with it being too short but to my amazement the finger-tip grip with handle gently rested into my palm was actually a perfect form-factor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too aggressive, but it&#x27;s also not so soft that I can&#x27;t get a good shave with it.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely beautiful and wonderfully middle of the road for cutting..not aggressive...not mild.</li>
            <li> It is an elegantly designed razor and has just the right heft to it.</li>
            <li> for the razor itself, it is well build and solid feeling and does a very nice job.  </li>
            <li> It has a well weighted handle that gave me a smooth and clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I immediately liked the shorter handle on the EJ as I could almost tuck it in my hand, grip my fingers high up underneath the head and use it as an extension of my hand.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sure the week was just me learning, others may make it to a great shave in much less</li>
            <li> So I had no idea that using a double-edged razor is amazingly easy, and gives such good results.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the overall high reviews, the beautiful style/finish, and I think it&#x27;s a slightly better deal than the merkur.</li>
            <li> Makes me smile every time I pick it up!</li>
            <li> Great razor, just started with the safety razor style, and didn&#x27;t take long to get used to.</li>
            <li> I watched many videos before I chose my first DE razor</li>
            <li> It was my first safety razor and my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is the first safety razor I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I love it.</li>
            <li> originally purchased this razor specifically because it is recommended as a beginners safety razor.  </li>
            <li> I went with a Van Der Hagen Safety Razor first, and well wasnt completly satisfied</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and went with this one after so many recommended it.</li>
            <li> My first shave with this was absolutely stunning.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use it when it got here</li>
            <li> Great construction, tight fitting head (it doesnt wobble or anything).  </li>
            <li> The razor is well weighted and the blades that come with it are functional if a little un aggressive (not so great on more than a couple of days growth).</li>
            <li> It is my first double edge razor after 20 years of shaving with Gillette, it is beautiful</li>
            <li> As always with Amazon quick and free shipping.</li>
            <li> This makes it easier to clean and almost foolproof to put the blades in without bending them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly using the store brand ones from my local drug store, and I feel like they&#x27;re giving me a better shave than what came with the razor.</li>
            <li> the chrome is super smooth, and it will shave as close as you need.</li>
            <li> I have gone back to my dad&#x27;s era and as the old saying goes Father knows Best.</li>
            <li> , my first shave was smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> It is easy to feel when you have the right angle.</li>
            <li> Feel great on the hand, not too light, not too heavy, easy to cleanup and to change the blades.</li>
            <li> As sturdy and smart looking as DE razors two or more times the price.  </li>
            <li> escape me right now!</li>
            <li> The Edwin Jagger is the more gentle of the 2 I keep in rotation, but it still gives me a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Handle is a bit shorter than expected, but the razor has a nice weight to it that makes control very easy.</li>
            <li> The blades that come with it too are super sharp and I was able to get a close shave and good finish everytime.</li>
            <li> The razor looks very nice with its \\&quot;faux ebony\\&quot; handle, but I believe it is unsafe due to the ergonomic deficiencies caused by the smooth surface of the handle.</li>
            <li> The overall aesthetics of it are stellar and it appears to have great craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> The craftsmanship of this razor is beautiful and it fits very well in my hand and is well weighted (no pushing necessary).  </li>
            <li> I really wanted a Merkur, but shipping would have been more as I use Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to absolutely anyone looking for a better shave.  </li>
            <li> i decided to take the wasteful, disposable plastic elements out of my life, and was more than ready to eliminate disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Nothing, besides maybe a straight razor, will give you a better shave.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who wants a close shave with ease and in the end save lots of money from not spending more for the plastic shavers</li>
            <li> The razor-changing action is not as nice as the Merkur #34C.</li>
            <li> Compared to the SS it is much heavier at the head and there is a bit more gap between the blade and the safety bar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice safety razor after my father&#x27;s 30 old butterfly Gillette was lost.</li>
            <li> I purchase the Edwin Jagger DE86BL razor in late February and was very happy with the quality and feel of their product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s full rating is because of two things.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These (DE) things really do cut better, than multi-bladed marketing BS. ...</li>
            <li> but, I was able to drill a hole and add a stainless</li>
            <li> It costs about as much as a pack of Gillette Fusion blades, lasts longer, and is more eco-friendly considering its parts are recyclable.</li>
            <li> Razors go into a mini Altoids tin and when that&#x27;s full, to the recycling bin.</li>
            <li> with the same head, so it&#x27;s probably just as good.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wake up late and get in a rush with this beautiful razor!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the weight of it and it seems really well made.</li>
            <li> I have never had such a good shave in my life.</li>
            <li> No big deal, though, when 100 good blades cost</li>
            <li> Gives soft, nice shaves,</li>
            <li> After doing some research, I came across the Edwin Jagger De86bl safety razor after reading some reviews and all the stories were true.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good starter option, and this one definitely fits the bill.</li>
            <li> Comparing it to my dad&#x27;s DE razor from decades ago (no idea what brand), his had a cool butterfly mechanism.  </li>
            <li> So cool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it over and over and just can&#x27;t get the same good shave I get with my Merkur.  </li>
            <li> I loved this razor enough that when I dropped it on the tile floor and it broke, that I immediately ordered another one.</li>
            <li> Quality is top notch, very well made.</li>
            <li> You should shoot for comfortable/irritation-free shave, and when your skill set is ready, you should move on to more aggressive razors like open-comb razors or slants, which are known to cut hairs</li>
            <li> am still a DE noob, and have only been wetshaving for 2 months, but I can tell you that this razor will give you good shave</li>
            <li> Wow, when I first pulled this razor out of its box, I was blown away by how good looking it was.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety blade razor, and after two weeks, so far so good.</li>
            <li> A very gentle shaver, it made it easy for me to learn the art of wetshaving.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to continue to use cheap canned shaving cream which, while possibly not conducive to the best possible shave, is inexpensive and quick to apply.  </li>
            <li> So , finally decided to take the plunge with this Edwin Jagger and let me tell you it is so easy , i was nervous at first but after my first two strokes i realized that its not going to bite me unless i jam it in my face, i do make sure that i have a nice lather</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it looks beautiful, offers a close, smooth and painless shave and definitely value for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> Gives a great shave because I always have a sharp blade.  </li>
            <li> Settled on this razor because it seemed the best overall value (along with the Merkur of similar price), and it looked cool.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but each time I put in a new blade it always seats it at a symmetric proper angle on both sides, so I find it to be very reliable and top-notch quality.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to double edged razors and am very happy I did.</li>
            <li> The chrome finish is flawless and the whole razor just oozes quality and understated elegance.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a like a tiny, tiny annoyance in an otherwise perfect razor.  </li>
            <li> The Jagger has a smaller head than the Merkur, however, so I am able to get more of the hairs underneath my nose without slicing my face up.</li>
            <li> I upgraded to this razor from my consignment store acquired 1955 Gillette Super Speed.</li>
            <li> Super quality, close shaves, they also sent 5 Derby blades.  </li>
            <li> I like the way it comes apart for a quick cleaning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one issue I&#x27;ve had is that I noticed that rather quickly the chrome began to chip off of the head (</li>
            <li> It feels very substantial, like it will last a lifetime and is a great example of</li>
            <li> After some research, I bought 100 Astra Stainless Steel razors and they are far superior in my opinion.</li>
            <li> More important the blades are far cheaper.</li>
            <li> For now, though, I&#x27;m thrilled with this razor and the fact it sets me up for cheap blades into the future.</li>
            <li> so I quickly changed to Wilkinson Sword Classics and have Feathers ordered.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced next to a straight razor shave.  </li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to assemble/disassemble and clean and holds the razor blade very well</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it adds about five minutes to the morning routine (maybe more if you&#x27;re used to an electric razor, but a much better shave than an electric).</li>
            <li> Lastly, it comes packaged in a very elegant style.</li>
            <li> It will probably take most people longer, yes, but I find the process kind of relaxing and the extra time isn&#x27;t that much.  </li>
            <li> So far, with the Derby blades, I have been getting the best shaves of my life without the irritation other disposable razors leave.</li>
            <li> To do this safely at first I just put the head in a towel and held it securely in one hand and unscrewed it with the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> I have used Merkur, Gillette (fat boy and other classics) Parker, Ikon, and by far this is the best safety razor I have tried.</li>
            <li> That being said, yes, you do have to use a bit more finesse than with modern disposable blades and you can&#x27;t just \\&quot;slam\\&quot; this kind of razor against your face the same way either.  </li>
            <li> with this plus it feels nice taking a little longer and using a good shave soap and some decent aftershave.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend loves his new razor, much better than using disposable ones.</li>
            <li> I coupled this with a mug of soap and brush from Wal-Mart and get great shaves for lots less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super aggressive so maybe that might bug some people, but for beginners it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Blade replacement is not as easy on some models, but I don&#x27;t consider it that much of a pain.  </li>
            <li> I will say that the short handle was surprising when I first opened the package</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find a single issue with this gorgeous razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it came back like riding a bike, I guess once you shaved like this previously it just comes back, great shave, three passes, a nice thick proraso sandalwood shave cream followed by a nice shave balm, have forgotten what a nice feeling it is to have a shave like this, so glad I made this choice, and it will only get better as I collect more shave creams, lotions, and balms !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not adjustable, which I think makes it great for a beginner like me since there are fewer options to mess with.  </li>
            <li> Do NOT attempt to shave against-the-grain with this on your first time using a double-edge razor!  </li>
            <li> Six months later this is still the case and my beard never felt better!</li>
            <li> I do recommend that you have a post shave balm of any kind you like ready on hand if you are new to this stuff like me.</li>
            <li> The razor was a distinct improvement over my previous razor and the quality is great.</li>
            <li> Sharp looking (ha-ha, sorry), comfortable to hold with a nice balance of weight, and nice casing for the razor which provides me a weekly beautiful shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a little over 8 months and its by far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of pot metal, but at this price you&#x27;re hard pressed to find a good razor in a more durable material.</li>
            <li> While it was comfortable to use, it didn&#x27;t give me very close shaves.  </li>
            <li> This razor is amazing, and it&#x27;s going to last me a lifetime.</li>
            <li> and I honestly don&#x27;t like the feel of it overall, or how it felt gliding on my face buzzing.</li>
            <li> This razor sees the most action of any of them.</li>
            <li> I love old DE razors and have a few that are over 50 years old that still look and perform perfect</li>
            <li> I have like 5 years worth of replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice and solid</li>
            <li> Nice finish, solid razor.</li>
            <li> - Shaving actually fells nice</li>
            <li> My brother owns an Edwin Jagger DE89 Chrome and I wanted to buy something similar as I really liked the weight and performance.</li>
            <li> While shaving, I accidentally dropped the razor onto my counter top from about chin height, 2-3 feet and the head snapped completely off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since bought some nice shave soap that I like but am still working on a proper lather.</li>
            <li> I started out with a Weishi which did a poor at best job.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The head is heavy steel with nice chrome on it, and the handle, though plastic, still has a nice heft to it thanks to the metal on the end.</li>
            <li> Even on my coarse stubble, it was more comfortable than any disposable I have ever used, including the Gillette Proglide.</li>
            <li> After using it for over a year, I went and got a nice Ikon razor, and I still find myself going back to this razor from time to time.</li>
            <li> Paired with some good quality blades (I&#x27;ve become partial to Feather), you can expect a nice shave with this razor, and it appears built to last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to use this but it is a solid, nice razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit heavier than I expected, which is good.</li>
            <li> So far my favorite blades are Astra, bluebird and bolzano.  </li>
            <li> Great starter razor for those of you wanting to get back to the old ways and save some money over today&#x27;s overpriced blades.  </li>
            <li> Feels nice and solid.  </li>
            <li> , it comes with 5 derby extra blades and they work together nice</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> the rewards and pleasure of shaving will be worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the extra money to have nice things.  </li>
            <li> The razor has a nice solid feel to it and is just the right wieght.  </li>
            <li> For once, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34; to shave, the DE glides over easily removing pretty much everything, flip it over and glide it over again</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving with this safety razor started out fine the first several weeks, but now I&#x27;m getting more cuts and nicks!&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li> Just like many other people who have switched, I am in love.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you actually clean the thing after each shave, open it up and get the gunk out.</li>
            <li> just right agressive-ness</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get the Edwin Jagger to shave right up to my nostrils.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair comes right off now.  </li>
            <li> Price is right.</li>
            <li> Oh how I was right.</li>
            <li> I have the razor now about 6 months and no nicks, and balanced just right for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sharp, very sharp looking razor and a good addition of your first set of blades (get a sampler pack of blades as you want to compare them all!)</li>
            <li> Some like the butterfly opening razors, but this mechanism is much easier to clean, and there are no moving parts to break or bend or malfunction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s quick to take apart, easy to dry, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> First off, this is my first DE Safety Razor!</li>
            <li> the shorter, more stubby handle is relatively easy to grip and as others have noted is not slippery in wet hands as you might expect.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry, it&#x27;s a stunning razor that performs exceptionally!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a modern classic known for mild, smooth shaves.</li>
            <li> This razor was my first safety razor, and after I got over the initial fear of letting a bare razor touch my face, it worked great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  - great to travel with as it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> The stem on the Chinese one seems to be made out of much sturdier construction but the blade clogs fast and doesn&#x27;t provide as good a shave than the Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li> This was my first de safety razor, and all I can say is it was well worth the money..</li>
            <li> : Make sure to wet your face properly and apply a good lather of shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Also, I have sensitive skin and cut myself easily, so this level of aggressiveness is just right.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ll state clearly that this is purely my First-Day-Review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> replaced the first head with a cheap Chinese knock off which has lasted me over two years and still going strong.  </li>
            <li> The reviews of DE razors almost make it seem like you MUST use a fancy brush and the best possible cream, so I was a little nervous about ordering the Edwin Jagger</li>
            <li> You only need to go over most areas ONCE with a fresh razor in this</li>
            <li> I can already tell; this is way closer, and yet far more gentle on my troublesome neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This gives a fast quick shave.</li>
            <li> When you get used to wet shaving, this delivers a closer and more comfortable shave than any disposable I&#x27;ve yet used.</li>
            <li> It shaves very well, mild but thorough.  </li>
            <li> The design is simple and clean up is easy.</li>
            <li> just wish it had a more secure grip when wet with eather a longer handle and or</li>
            <li> The head assembly screws on perfectly to the handle, holding your razor blade in place solidly and making each pass predictable.</li>
            <li> but so far I have found it to be easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The black handle is gorgeous but does not have any type of grip or grooves</li>
            <li> I just find that it doesn’t expose enough of the blade to really get the kind of quality</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I expected and more!</li>
            <li> Nicely chromed, a good heft and gives a sense of being much more expensive than it actually is.</li>
            <li> I love the three piece design, and the black and chrome really look elegant.</li>
            <li> The thing looks so good, little fingers may be tempted.</li>
            <li> razor itself feels high quality and has a nice solid weight to it.</li>
            <li> The black handle is $10 cheaper than the chrome handle, but the black lacquer feels nice and smooth, and the handle still has a nice heft to it.  </li>
            <li> Very reasonable price, high quality product and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> several others and this Edwin Jagger has risen to the top of the list.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a bit more aggressive than my first razor, and that&#x27;s what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> This Razor is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> The handle is suppose to be short for this type of razor, but I&#x27;ve found that I get the most control the closer to the blades I hold it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This provides a VERY close shave!  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor off of a recommendation for a first timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found that the Derby Extra blades are acceptable for my beard, there may be better ones out there, but for the price (currently $0.14 ea), I can just change the blades more often.  </li>
            <li> I eventually went with a WSP El Grande, which appears to me to be exactly the same config, but has a diamond knurled handle which inspires more confidence when you shave.  </li>
            <li> Granted, it&#x27;s my first safety razor.</li>
            <li> The first time using this</li>
            <li> The first thing we try to look for is value, and understandably so because let&#x27;s face it..</li>
            <li> I am a beginner and had no trouble getting an extremely smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Has the quality that feels like it would last for many years.</li>
            <li> (Most likely ABS.)</li>
            <li> The more I try to get the stubble off, the more cuts I get, usually under my nose, on my chin, or on my Adam&#x27;s apple</li>
            <li> When I first received the item, the first thing I noticed was the box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not difficult but some users may find it meddlesome after a while.</li>
            <li> This is my first one.  </li>
            <li> Just shower, rub oil on and use hot water.  </li>
            <li> It has been exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> not a big issue, just make sure the soap is off your hand.</li>
            <li> This was my first try with a modern/old fashioned safety razor.</li>
            <li> My first one broke</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get the hang of it the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first DE razor and</li>
            <li> My first DE razor.</li>
            <li> I am knew to wet shaving, but have been using the Popular Feather razor and like it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for nothing better especially for the price!</li>
            <li> The craftsmanship has to be seen first hand to appreciate.</li>
            <li> This was the first safety razor I bought  </li>
            <li> This has been my first safety razor</li>
            <li> For those of you interested in trying DE shaving</li>
            <li> About a million times better than a plastic Gillette which costs the same.</li>
            <li> Mostly my fault for not realizing how fragile it was.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor as my first safety razor.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first, but then the day I got it my girlfriend called me and told me she shaved her legs with it</li>
            <li> I was interested in getting a safety razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now been using it consistently since May, so after 7 months, here&#x27;s my feedback:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It glides like a hot knife through butter on your whiskers and has not once nicked me on the face.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I must say that as I was working through my first minute of shaving with this I asked my wife \\&quot;Where</li>
            <li> had there been a bit &#x27;more&#x27; for extra value for the price...</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say what it was exactly</li>
            <li> so be aware of that.  </li>
            <li> , they promptly replied, saying that my first email had never been received.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first de razor</li>
            <li> This was the first DE razor I tried...</li>
            <li> (be sure to get a sampler pack when you order this, everyone&#x27;s face likes different</li>
            <li> Based on reviews, this was my first razor I purchased to move to safety razors.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> (I try to re-use until I can&#x27;t anymore--strop the blade between uses, etc.), but still pretty easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor.  </li>
            <li> The Derby blades also worked pretty well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was my first re-visit to a safety razor in three decades</li>
            <li> And I get the feeling that shaves with this razor will only get better.</li>
            <li> This is my first double edged safety razor, but I love it.  </li>
            <li> This was my first safety razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first double-edge razor I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Very close shave!  </li>
            <li> The first time my wife saw me standing there with the shaver in 3 pieces</li>
            <li> The first time my wife saw me standing there with the shaver in 3 pieces</li>
            <li> Amazon to this point has represented themselves well, and produced exactly what they said they would.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying the Future soon, but I&#x27;m glad I started with this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cheap children&#x27;s toys have a higher quality of construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first razor I ever bought.</li>
            <li> The Edwin Jagger also works well with the Derby blades that are more forgiving when you start off, or go back to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> I can tell you this much!</li>
            <li> Just be sure you get a proper case to keep the pieces from jostling together during travel.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because it seemed like a lot of people recommend this razor as first razor for person beginning to learn safety razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> first shave and</li>
            <li> I wondered; if I might need to order a few, to get a good one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comparing it with disposable razors is a bit on the heavy side, but is a weight that feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> still geting used to my neck after a few weeks but still just as good as my mach 3.</li>
            <li> Super high quality.</li>
            <li> some Shark Super Stainless wich also worked very will.  </li>
            <li> Have been trying out some different blades, and so far the Astra&#x27;s are giving me the best results, but I have to yet try out a really sharp Feather -</li>
            <li> /&gt;My first shave with Derby blades (one pass only - gently does it) was very smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually post reviews, but I have been shopping on Amazon for many years and have only good things to say about their customer service.</li>
            <li> 5 stars, its a keeper, you&#x27;ll never want to use anything else if you enjoy a nice, long lasting close shave and holds up.</li>
            <li> This is my first SE razor and it&#x27;s good enough to be my last!</li>
            <li> The handle on this model is smooth, &amp;#34;faux ebony&amp;#34; that looks very sharp but is perhaps not as secure as the chrome, lined handle featured on the EJ DE89 for some, but I have found it to be secure in the hand under normal conditions.</li>
            <li> I have two other safety razors (one at work, and one at home), neither of which is as nice as this one.</li>
            <li> Extra mild razor which is a great gift for new wet shavers.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell, if I step up from here to a straight edge, but for now I am more then content.</li>
            <li> Not only is this product a fair value, buying 100 razor packs is only ~$10 shipped!</li>
            <li> Also, I get as many shaves out of a Feather blade as I do with a Sensor 2 Excel carterThe Feather blades are three times as much money as the Derbys, but are still only one-third the cost of Sensor II cartridges.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;This certainly seems to fill the bill, first shave with it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a standard three-piece design like your grandfather&#x27;s Gillette, so blade changes are pretty easy.</li>
            <li> A $6 full metal razor that I had previously bought holds up better than this.</li>
            <li> the positive side, I like the shape/tolerances of the head.</li>
            <li> I was positive</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a positive thing for letting the weight and mass of the razor do the work for you rather than flipping the shaver around like you do with plastic cartridge</li>
            <li> but if this razor was made with any kind of quality metal whatsoever, this nearly 1/4\\&quot; bolt should have been able to take being thrown at a brick wall as hard as you can throw it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hopefully it holds up for a long time, because I am completely in love with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> for the De86bl, it is my first safety razor, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to its competition.</li>
            <li> I like this more than my Merkur long razor.  </li>
            <li> Edwin Jagger DE razor look really nice, but won&#x27;t the smooth handle be slippery?&lt;br /&gt;-Maybe only a bit slippery if you let your fingers and the handle get wet.  </li>
            <li> For a long time, I had been using the 3,4,5,6 blade gillete fusions and shicks, thinking that I would get a better shave.</li>
            <li> , pretty much all the work is done by the razor weight gliding on your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reason for 4 stars is that the razor doesn&#x27;t give you the closest shave, but you really shouldn&#x27;t shoot for the closest shave when you first start wetshaving.  </li>
            <li> The chrome finish is really slick and good looking.</li>
            <li> Replacing a razor blade is quick and easy, even with wet fingers.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to switch to a double-edge safety razor, and this was one of the most highly recommended razors in the &amp;#34;budget&amp;#34; price range.</li>
            <li> The razor is very mild, milder than the Gillette Fusion system that I used earlier (I use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> However, after experiencing almost no nicks after shaving my face on the first day, I felt comfortable attempting the head shave on the second.</li>
            <li> I would have liked a slightly longer handle, but I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> a simple stand or larger sampler of blades or something but 4 stars and my being very pleased is where it&#x27;s at!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty light but still has enough weight that you can just position the razor on your face and let the weight of the razor do the cutting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> handle feels short, but it allows for maximum flexibility with strong control.</li>
            <li> I have large man-hands, and the handle still fits and feels</li>
            <li> But that is a purely subjective decision.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the fact that the piece it self is pure craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> I chose the DE86 purely for aesthetics.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t add much to all the positive reviews out there as I basically agree with them.</li>
            <li> all the great reviews that you see for the DE89 can be applied here, only with a black handle.</li>
            <li> The craftsmanship is very visible here as an example of why you should spend the extra 10-20 bucks for a quality product instead of a product that will easily show its flaws</li>
            <li> Going old school was a great choice as I have a very thick and quick growing beard.</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with my choice, the black handle to offset all the chrome bits is very pleasing to the eye, and most importantly does not feel overly slick when wet</li>
            <li> /&gt;Its not a very aggressive razor, and is very smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weighty, solid, and finely crafted.</li>
            <li> but this thing has a large and very well-weighted head.</li>
            <li> The handle in this area has a nice little flange to grip between two fingers and a thumb, so someone was thinking when they designed this.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t look very grippy, but trust me, it is.</li>
            <li> you more of the blade&amp;#34; than others, so be careful what you buy.</li>
            <li> I like it better than my old butterfly style razor; there are less moving parts to clean or foul up.  </li>
            <li> It is also not an aggressive razor though it gives a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> and it is a real deal I got my for around $25!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the Edwin Jagger is priced much lower.</li>
            <li> Muhle razors are the ones you can find in the Art of Shaving stores and they are much expansive.</li>
            <li> Did not want to invest in a straight blade yet.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very ergonomic and in the shower it&#x27;s slippery</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wants to save money.  </li>
            <li> and/or shaving too fast.  </li>
            <li> this razor will offer a very close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> I am really quite blown away.  </li>
            <li> I used to dread shaving and skipped it as much as possible, but with this one, I actually enjoy shaving with it.</li>
            <li> Blades fit well, and it&#x27;s easier to get them centered properly than in my Mercur razor.</li>
            <li> Closest shave I have ever had with the exception of a straight razor shave at the barbers.</li>
            <li> The chrome finish was great and the construction of the whole razor feels solid and not cheap.</li>
            <li> I held it around there, and is was absolutely luxurious.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 3 piece that works very well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor along with a Parker to shave my head witth to move from using a straight razor.</li>
            <li> the shorter handle does really make it very maneuverable.</li>
            <li> But this really goes with any part of shaving using double-edge razor.</li>
            <li> I found I prefer a much sharper blade (Feathers, Gillette SharpEdge, etc).</li>
            <li> These razors are not meant to be tightened too much - just tighten it until it is snug.</li>
            <li> Much closer shave than multi blade razors.</li>
            <li> but as it turns out both the razor and handle are very well polished</li>
            <li> I use a towel to grip the ends of the head and twist it off, but once I slipped and cut my thumb very deeply.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> It fits well in the hand and is very responsive.  </li>
            <li> I pair this with Astra blades and it works really well for me.</li>
            <li> that my Merkur but not by much.</li>
            <li> I know it comes with a stainless handle also, but l like to look of the ebony.</li>
            <li> - Blades are very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> - Lots of different brands of blades will fit this.</li>
            <li> They shave very well for me.  </li>
            <li> I am not asking you to man up to a straight razor....</li>
            <li> My shaves are extra smooth and no one nick or cut.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> But I have tried straight edge safety razors with the intent to practice and learning.</li>
            <li> and I like real well.</li>
            <li> I think the closeness is comparable to a modern 5 blade cartridge razor.</li>
            <li> On the second shave I learned it wasn&#x27;t the razor but the cheap shave soap I bought at Wal Mart and my lack of lathering abilities.</li>
            <li> like i was thinking oh this looks too intense</li>
            <li> Weight of the razor helps you keep it on track without putting too much pressure on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He and my boyfriend both say (and so does the touch test) that it is a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Very well made, and it&#x27;s quite the looker sitting on the counter.</li>
            <li> Very well balanced razor.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really make sense to me why it broke.</li>
            <li> very natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was smooth, only took one pass, and didn&#x27;t hurt (except where I messed up my adams apple--user error).</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it was just a great look (like my Harley), has the same head as the more expensive EJs.</li>
            <li> He has never shaved with a safety razor until today and he absolutely loves this razor.</li>
            <li> The shave is so much smoother than a cartridge razor or an electric.</li>
            <li> Recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t have the center piece on backwards.</li>
            <li> Def a great way to get into the DE game.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made unit however if I had to do it again, I would opt for a razor with a bit longer handle and one with texture to the handle.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased a cheap double edged razor and it tore my skin up.</li>
            <li> The razor has absolutely zero space between the blade and the razor...</li>
            <li> (thanks to this goberment).</li>
            <li> I bought one cheap from china (used to cut all over my face) because this is the only one we can find here.</li>
            <li> many times it has to be used carefully.</li>
            <li> Better than expected quality for the price.</li>
            <li> #34;You broke it already?!&amp;#34;  I explained to her that that&#x27;s the way you&#x27;re supposed to change the blade, but I have to admit it really does feel like you&#x27;re breaking it.  </li>
            <li> #34;You broke it already?!&amp;#34;  I explained to her that that&#x27;s the way you&#x27;re supposed to change the blade, but I have to admit it really does feel like you&#x27;re breaking it.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t guess how much experience any of you have had with metal and bolts -</li>
            <li> It works very well and gives an aggressive shave with an Astra blade.</li>
            <li> I recommend the titanium coated Stainless Steel Blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it also clogs up too fast.  </li>
            <li> You have to be more careful with those I believe.  </li>
            <li> I really like the weight of the razor</li>
            <li> Leaves such a smooth surface</li>
            <li> I purchased this Razor as a gift for a very &amp;#34;High</li>
            <li> I have not had any gripping issues while my hands have been wet or with some shaving soap on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t shave for about 2 or 3 days to really test it and</li>
            <li> It is cheap and will last forever, and you will not regret the quality craftsmanship nor the quality shave!</li>
            <li> If that’s you, I’d absolutely recommend getting this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I’ve been wet shaving for many years</li>
            <li> It has a nice weight to it without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> and I was wondering if there is any kind of warranty on it, this is a metal heavy razor</li>
            <li> After many years of trying sensitive skin foams and gels as well as different brands of razor&#x27;s, I decided I had to try something</li>
            <li> and I own quite a few.</li>
            <li> On first glance the smooth ebony handle might make you think that it could possibly slip easily when wet, however this is not so.</li>
            <li> Which means that it will break easily with a even minor drop on your sink.  </li>
            <li> This was my first attempt to step outside the Electronic / Gillette disposables world and entire the amazing world of old school safety razors.</li>
            <li> After shaving I take it apart and put the blade out of the way after drying it, then I rince and dry the three parts of the razor and leave out for a good air dry.</li>
            <li> i did some research, and realized i wasn&#x27;t yet ready for a true straight razor and the almost strict religious upkeep factors of them...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to men looking to make the smart move to a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> I am slender and have a more contoured face and my beard grows straight out not curly, my mustache lays down and no matter how much I shave, stretch or change shaving direction I still have stubble.</li>
            <li> I just took the head from it, as my imitation horn is much more pleasing to the eye.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy another Edwin Jagger when this one&#x27;s gone, but if you keep it clean and polish it every so often, it should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a ridiculous value and too good to ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only got nicked because I was not as careful the second shave, because the first was so successful.  </li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t used any other safety razors, the ease of transition to this one after using disposables for so many years leads me to recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> With all the blades takes up less space than my more modern razors.  </li>
            <li> The chrome and black gives it a nice classy look.</li>
            <li> : It appears to be really solidly constructed, and also looks really good in the bathroom coupled with the black SimplyBeautiful badger brush and stand that I ordered from Amazon as well.)</li>
            <li> EJ shaves very close, very quickly with minimal effort and cleanup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I am new to the safety razor shaving community and by no means can speak purely from dog years of experience*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Later on I&#x27;ll put the blade back in and the razor back together and hang it on the stand, it looks to good on the counter to put away.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to from regular carts but after about 1 week I got a considerably better shave than any other I&#x27;ve had before, and it&#x27;s only got better since then</li>
            <li> The head holds the blade at a really nice angle for my beard, and the comb is deep enough to make it nearly foolproof.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE, so I can&#x27;t speak too much as far as comparing it to others.</li>
            <li> /&gt;EDIT (three years down the line): This thing is still doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, after I don&#x27;t know how many shaves.</li>
            <li> I prefer something with a little bit more heft to it but for the price, I won&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> The safest way to put a blade in the razor I&#x27;ve found is to turn the two parts upside-down on the counter and set the blade down onto it, steady the top, and screw in the handle.  </li>
            <li> I am from Venezuela and this kind of razor is used by very few people here.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I got this particular model in general but also in particular over a butterfly style because I had concerns of the blade being a little out of alignment.</li>
            <li> It is also a 3 piece razor, meaning that you have to unscrew the whole head to put a new razor in.</li>
            <li> In the end I chose the De86bl because I like the look of the black and chrome better.</li>
            <li> I also bought a black, and chrome handled, Silvertip badger brush; as a bit of a splurge (for me), and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> and I was able to use this razor the day it arrived with less razor burn than I was getting with my Gillette Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It sails thru my whiskers better than anything I have used before, and I have had much less irritation.</li>
            <li> also be realistic $25</li>
            <li> It is solid, heavy and looks good.  </li>
            <li> No matter what brand of blade I put in it, I can always get a decent shave.</li>
            <li> I get a decent shave, I haven&#x27;t cut myself yet, and it costs me about six cents a week for blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try till I use up all of my remaining free blades and decide on my next course of action.</li>
            <li> This is a good beginners razor as I had just a few nicks on my second shave.  </li>
            <li> Worth the investment &amp; I will save big money over time as the razors are so much cheaper then the 3,4 &amp; 5 blade razor heads</li>
            <li> I initially worried that the smooth handle would prove slippery, but so far I&#x27;ve had no problem with the grip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, the Derby razors I got are decent.</li>
            <li> From a personal perspective, I have been shaving for more than 10 years using different electric shavers and disposable blades</li>
            <li> the quality of this razor will most likely last you the rest of your life.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a decent safety razor with out breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> The black looks a bit more contemporary, though.</li>
            <li> I am just sorry that I fell into the trap of more blades are better.  </li>
            <li> Everybody says so, and it is SUCH an industrially artistic piece...</li>
            <li> The razor breaks down very easily for cleaning and looks the same as it did the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Super high quality razor that will last a lifetime,without breaking the bank!</li>
            <li> and so far I have quite a positive impression about it.</li>
            <li> With only small modifications in how you hold your razor and the amount of pressure that you apply, you will be receiving the closest, most comfortable shaves of your life.  </li>
            <li> so far I like it better than the normal cartridges, though you have to be a little more careful.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The chrome is particularly high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased a blade sampler pack that I have been using in conjunction with this and highly recommend that</li>
            <li> It included Derby razors which I recommend highly.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recomend this razor to anyone as a matter a fact</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Yes the price of this razor seems high</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> High quality feel and construction.  </li>
            <li> High quality materials and construction.  </li>
            <li> Also use high quality blades.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended buying Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> With high hopes on the Edwin Jagger, I figured why not give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this razor, but buying another one would be rewarding the manufacturer for making an inferior product, or at least rewarding them for poor customer service.</li>
            <li> Shaving with this razor also feels much more comfortable than my old Gillette Fusion, and much cleaner (very little stubble left).    </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about this other than it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say the same for other razors that I own.</li>
            <li> in all other ways, this razor seems built to last- the kind of thing that if we&#x27;d gone to atomic war decades ago, this would have been pulled out of the rubble and used by a scruffy-faced survivor.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about making a change to a safety razor, but I was more concerned about the price of cartridge razors.    </li>
            <li> if I was to purchase again, I would get a model with a little better grip to it.</li>
            <li> I love this little piece.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really feel up to the time investment required to get back into straight razor shaving, but it occurred to me that a DE razor might provide a decent wetshave without the hassle of a straight.  </li>
            <li> It really should have a little mark of some kind on it - Side A and Side B or red dot/blue dot or something like that.  </li>
            <li> It really should have a little mark of some kind on it - Side A and Side B or red dot/blue dot or something like that.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t seem to be blade sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no issues with any slipping caused by the smooth handle.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Coming from 20 years of using a straight razor this is definately faster and does it with far fewer nicks.</li>
            <li> I expected a better product since England products are generally well made.</li>
            <li> straight razor, Feather AC DX raxor and this EJ is near the top!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I nicked myself a few times the first couple of times I shaved with it, but apparently your skin needs to become acclimated to it because now I don&#x27;t cut myself any longer and my skin feels better.  </li>
            <li> I realized, after using it a few times, that any more handle would throw the balance off and be burdensome in the hand.  </li>
            <li> This was my first modern double edge safety razor.  </li>
            <li> Normally I just use a gillette mach 3 razor</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor only a few days ago, and am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> So, my subconscious is giving this one a pretty high rating!</li>
            <li> These models are all very forgiving which makes any of them perfect for beginners who are trying to learn the proper technique without cutting their face to ribbons in the process.  </li>
            <li> The chroming on this razor is as thick as I&#x27;ve ever seen or felt and looks absolutely spectacular.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands of blades yet, as the included ones seem to work fine.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m rather happy with the performance of this razor so far, and it seems to hold up to long term shaving as well due to robust construction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s billed as &amp;#34;Faux Ebony&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s really just a black smooth surface on the handle.</li>
            <li> But, it is true, there are other razors with much easier blade systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this is a fine razor for anyone either interested in traditional wet shaving or just looking for something new to add to their arsenal.</li>
            <li> Now, as I&#x27;m fairly new to shaving with a DE safety razor, I did have some concerns and questions.  </li>
            <li> Anyone new to DE shaving would do well to consider this piece.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They shipped me a brand new replacement razor within a week.</li>
            <li> but hey i like to try new things.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this new Edwin Jagger De86bl razor</li>
            <li> and i live it.</li>
            <li> Looks like new.</li>
            <li> At 35 I&#x27;m new to DE shaving.  </li>
            <li> , I recommend this razor to anyone who is looking to step up to a new DE razor.</li>
            <li> Its new</li>
            <li> Fundamentally this shave is way closer that my mach 3, Fusion and the new Gillette 4 blade swivel ball razor.</li>
            <li> Being new to DE safety razor shaving, I think I am leaning toward the longer handles.  </li>
            <li> any of that changes I&#x27;ll post new impressions.</li>
            <li> I am still new to using safety razors.</li>
            <li> I am new to safety razors,and have not cut myself once.</li>
            <li> Ordered this razor from Amazon for delivery in New Delhi, India, a week ago.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a new razor just because, this one will not disappoint you.  </li>
            <li> I can live with that</li>
            <li> I loved the shave and the minimal cost after the initial expense, but unfortunately the time and attention required for a quality (and safe) shave with a straight razor does not mesh well with the \\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is my first DE and my first razor for wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It makes the natural movements around the neck and those odd places like the jaw line under the ear and over the adams apple much more natural feeling.  </li>
            <li> Treat yourself to one of the few nice things left in life !</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor blades are far (very far!)</li>
            <li> The quickest and closest shave is two quick passes in alternating directions rather than laboring with a single aggressive pass.</li>
            <li> As it is, the weight and length feel very natural to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoy the few minutes spent doing fine trimming and shaving (I have a goatee</li>
            <li> The double edge feather blades on this razor did not give me a burn on the first pass of a new blade, like the Feather AC DX did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any more in-grown hairs and I have very little razor burn now.</li>
            <li> If I remember correctly, you pushed a little button on the side and the top gently popped open for you to change the blade.  </li>
            <li> I remember correctly, you pushed a little button on the side and the top gently popped open for you to change the blade.  </li>
            <li> Just be aware that this Razor has a short handle.  </li>
            <li> Your initial investment will be higher but these items are to be considered a lifetime investment.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time that I was shaving with a double edged razor and hence was expecting a lot of knicks after my shave.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and I am not going back to my old one!</li>
            <li> This is my first double razor.</li>
            <li> This was my first double edge razor and I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li> This is my first double edged razor.</li>
            <li> Use short strokes at first.</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor after seeing it highly-recommended in several discussion boards, for the same reasons that many others are switching back to DE safety razors.</li>
            <li> There were times I went through 2-3 razors after not shaving for a while while completely massacring my face with those things, each time cursing how I just threw out 2-3 bucks just to shave once!</li>
            <li> It definitely took some getting used to (again, first timer) but</li>
            <li> The only thing that I do not like about this razor is the when the blade is installed it sticks out more on one side than the other.  </li>
            <li> sending a second email, in which I explained that I&#x27;d be letting others know about their customer service, they promptly replied, saying that my first email had never been received.</li>
            <li> first time I used it ,I nicked my upper lip and drew blood, something that has not happened in decades of using Gillette systems.</li>
            <li> I have just gone back to double edge shaving after giving them up many years ago to shave with multiple blade shavers that caused some ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> The razor arrived a full week before the expected date, in pristine condition.</li>
            <li> It also takes a little care to screw the head onto the body, because the threads don&#x27;t line up easily, and this could lead to a ruined razor with stripped threads if you don&#x27;t pay attention to what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That being said, I was about to upgrade my electric shaver when I first started reading reviews about old school double edge safety razors and decided to hold off on the new electric.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about these things, and this was my first safety razor, but it was highly rated by other sources (along with the Merkur)</li>
            <li> Have used Derby Extra razors, Shark blades, Gillete 7 o&#x27;clock and Feather high stainless.</li>
            <li> After a few nicks while learning how to use the razor I&#x27;m not able to get a great shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> But as it is, my ring finger and pinky don&#x27;t even fit on the handle, so it&#x27;s a bit odd.  </li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor, and I&#x27;ve been using it daily for nearly 6 months.  </li>
            <li> If you do have extra large hands this razor might not be suitable for you as it is a little on the  smaller side.</li>
            <li> Razor is very nice and is quite heavy, but this is light years better then that piece of Chinese crap that the Pawn star Rick endorses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trick is keep a nice angle, and go slow!</li>
            <li> Before purchasing, I watched a few \\&quot;how to\\&quot; YouTube videos which were pretty valuable to help start off right.  </li>
            <li> The razor has a solid feel and is easy to hold--no slipping while shaving.</li>
            <li> I have used the Jagger now for the past three and a half weeks, loving every shave!</li>
            <li> Like many reviews on other sites, the handle is very smooth and can be a bit slick to hold when wet.</li>
            <li> My only reservation might be if you have large hands.</li>
            <li> specific razor was very comfortable as a few members on Reddit had mentioned.</li>
            <li> The handle is smaller than I expected but it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> I have to add a little pressure and go over the same spot many times, which still doesn’t always yield the results I’m looking for.  </li>
            <li> Will I have to be super careful compared to using, say, a Mach 3?&lt;br /&gt;-No!  </li>
            <li> It is extremely sturdy, and changing the blades is quick and painless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an extremely quality razor, it could EASILY sell for double its asking price.</li>
            <li> It also came with 5 Derby Extra razor blades, which I really like.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I prefer the appearance of the faux-ebony handle to all stainless steel.</li>
            <li> you will want to have a bonfire for your old shavers- disposable, or electric.</li>
            <li> you will want to have a bonfire for your old shavers- disposable, or electric.</li>
            <li> far it has been quite the experience</li>
            <li> They scrape your face when going over concave parts like neck near near your chin.</li>
            <li> it gives a very close shave and has enough heft to appreciate how well it is made.</li>
            <li> then I tried my go to blade the Wilkinson Sword and lightened up on the pressure and WOW what a shave.</li>
            <li> I bought a second one for a friend for his birthday and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Box was classy and gave the feeling of luxury.</li>
            <li> I need to shave every day, but it is not heavy.</li>
            <li> Compared to that one, this EJ razor is far milder in terms of irritation, bumps, cuts, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wrote to the company and got no answer so far...</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 19yr old son and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Bought for the boyfriend because he&#x27;s always wanted an old school safety razor.</li>
            <li> I was about 3 years old.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, something that&#x27;s 10 times as expensive will not knock your socks off ten times more than this, it will only be marginally better.</li>
            <li> He has somewhat sensitive skin and has had no issues using this razor.</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and I have been using an electric shaver for about 15 years.</li>
            <li> The De86bl is really just the same!</li>
            <li> I am a complete rookie.</li>
            <li> Also, while you are dumping that old razor, get yourself a shave set with the soap, bowl, &amp; brush.</li>
            <li> They tend to snap completely off where the head screws into the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finished with my old Merkur.  </li>
            <li> This short handle razor works very well with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> recommended I go \\&quot;old school.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but it actually handles very well.</li>
            <li> I need to take a second pass with both to get real close.</li>
            <li> but I gather it&#x27;s \\&quot;standard\\&quot; as far as DE razors go.</li>
            <li> I have tried different blades with it and have yet to cut or even so much nick.  </li>
            <li> So far he loves it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and each time I shaved</li>
            <li> if the handle had broke, I wouldn&#x27;t have been terribly surprised -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft brass.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not been a problem so far.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly and has saved me a ton of money on those crap 25 blade disposables.  </li>
            <li> I now own two of these razors from Edwin Jagger and both heads are broken.  </li>
            <li> The price of new razors is so high I switched back.</li>
            <li> After much reading on the subject of &#x27;First DE Razor&#x27;</li>
            <li> when ordering this specific Edwin Jagger was the fact that it&#x27;s handle is smooth, rather than textured like some of the other EJ.</li>
            <li> It becomes a major chore to un-screw the handle to whipe clean and dry the razor parts for the next use.    </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous at first with the smooth faux ebony handle, but these fears were unfounded as I have not slipped with it once, even with wet hands.  </li>
            <li> Better cutting of stubble; but not cutting or dragging, or pulling of the (well prepped; very sensitive) skin!</li>
            <li> I went back to double edged shaving to alleviate the high cost of modern razor cartridges.    </li>
            <li> Its important to watch some youtube videos on proper wet shaving techniques before you jump in full force and destroy your face.</li>
            <li> This was against my father advice who tried multiple blades for 1 month then went back to his Gillette Super Speed and an old English razor.</li>
            <li> The first razor I got, after my last electric died, was an inexpensive Chinese import.</li>
            <li> At first I saw that it was a short handle razor and was possibly thinking of returning.</li>
            <li> This is a razor, a safety razor no less, so there should be</li>
            <li> /&gt;The second one, this exact model, I&#x27;ve only had for a week.  </li>
            <li> (first pass should be with, second pass across, third against if you feel you need it</li>
            <li> The solid reviews and decent prices landed me on this Edwin Jagger model.</li>
            <li> Not exactly good build quality for such a popular razor.</li>
            <li> Maybe the guy who made mine was on vacation in china and had a few too many pints that day.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money, spend a little more on another brand</li>
            <li> A small crack wouldn&#x27;t have mattered much, but both coverings cracked to the point of becoming loose and moving around while shaving.  </li>
            <li> Everything about it seems high quality and built to last.  </li>
            <li> My husband highly recommends this razor to anyone especially a beginner.</li>
            <li> The top head with the screw connector is not available, although I saw the head advertised for almost the same price as the entire razor with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The handle was shorter than expected but during my first shave I noticed it felt</li>
            <li> I wish I spent a little more money on the &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The handle is fairly short, and the plastic is pretty slippery when it gets wet (I shave in the shower), and though it&#x27;s great for shaving your face, it is dangerous for your head.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I also considered a couple of the similarly priced Merkur razors, most reviews I read said that these were fairly similar performing razors, so the final decision came down to appearance.</li>
            <li> If you are new to DE razor shaving, know that different razors will &amp;#34;give</li>
            <li> I was reveiwing a new double edge shaver to replace the shavers I have now.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that this razor comes with the Derby brand blades which left much to be desired.</li>
            <li> When I was ready to graduate from my Weishi twist to open razor, I read extensively and decided to try this baby out.</li>
            <li> I have a few safety razors in my shave den, including this one, a Merkur 34C, a Merkur Futur, and two vintage Gilettes, a Slim Adjustable and a Super Speed.</li>
            <li> Now, I have a very sensitive skin and any razor that I&#x27;ve used have given me rash and made my face red.</li>
            <li> I found it really isn&#x27;t that hard or that tricky (except for right under the nose- that takes some effort).</li>
            <li> This will last you nearly 2 years!</li>
            <li> the more expensive Muhle use the exact same heads, except</li>
            <li> It was well balance that when I first shaved I was not nicked or cut like I have been before with other DE shavers.</li>
            <li> The little Weishi razor was really quite decent.  </li>
            <li> The Edwin Jagger razor is also less aggressive: if I pass the razor down my cheek after the stubble is mostly gone, I often don&#x27;t even feel the blade.</li>
            <li> More importantly, it does not suffer from the quality control issues that plague less expensive razors.  </li>
            <li> first one I had was a Chatsworth Style, imitation horn handle.  </li>
            <li> Not that this thing won&#x27;t cut or nick, but if you go slow while you&#x27;re learning and you read up or watch some tutorials, you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li> Bought a second for travel, my first is a few years old and still looks brand new.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is actually three pieces: The handle, and &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; piece, and the main head piece (no idea what the actual terms for these are).</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve fallen victim to shaving most of my adult life with the usual, big-brand-names with ever-increasing blade counts (3, 4, 5 and counting!).</li>
            <li> The second one was a little more rough.  </li>
            <li> The second one was a little more rough.  </li>
            <li> A little short but nice and heavy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After doing my research and making a bad purchase, I finally narrowed my choice to this beautiful DE Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> Fair enough, as you could potentially slice and dice your mug pretty bad if you hold it like a baseball bat.  </li>
            <li> Completely and utterly sold.</li>
            <li> and I have absolutely no regrets in picking it up.  </li>
            <li> One night I saw that &amp;#34;Micro-touch One&amp;#34; commercial with Rick from Pawn Star&#x27;s advertising an old school razor.</li>
            <li> You just like let it glide across and let the blade just barely touch you and the hair comes off.  </li>
            <li> So far I have only used the Derby extras (like those supplied) and Wilkinson Sword blades.  </li>
            <li> I will never go back to my old razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was quite surprised how short the handle is, which took a bit of getting used to.</li>
            <li> If used properly this thing cleaves through hair, much closer than I ever got with my cartridge razors, especially after a second</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only put in the Derby blade to the kit (Derby comes with the razor)</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only put in the Derby blade to the kit (Derby comes with the razor)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re considering DE shaving you might want to watch a few YouTube videos and definitely do research on the different types of razors available.</li>
            <li> It looks like the handle would be very slippery when used with wet hands, but I never had any problems with a slippery handle.  </li>
            <li> There is no drag at all with this shaver no matter what brand of razor you use.</li>
            <li> So I wanted to switch to a safety razor (also apparently known as a double-edge or DE razor)</li>
            <li> If they had been around during the 40s, one imagines a  jowl-cheeked Winston Churchill demanding his secretary replace his straight-razor after trying to shave during the blitz: &#x27;do call those Edwin Jagger fellows and have a safety razor sent, I damn near cut my throat during that last raid!&#x27;.</li>
            <li> completely turned a chore into a pleasurable hobby and without taking even the smallest step backward in the fineness of my shave, my shave quality has actually improved since moving on from the &amp;#34;five</li>
            <li> Feeling like I should complete the set I finally purchased this razor.</li>
            <li> this is it, but as far as lasting a lifetime like I had hoped, well, it just did not !!!!</li>
            <li> with a thick, smooth chrome finish you don&#x27;t see on anything anymore.</li>
            <li> The handle felt a little slippery and took some practice figuring out the right grip, but I don&#x27;t even think about it now.</li>
            <li> The handle is a little on the short side, but I got used to it fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> The price is hard to beat, and it is solidly built, and is easy to shave with.</li>
            <li> but it also looks cool, particularly when sitting in the bathroom with the black Edwin Jagger badger brush and a black ceramic shaving mug.</li>
            <li> The balance point is that second ring down, under the head, between the chrome, and the black handle top.</li>
            <li> I was prepared for a long session with this new razor but not so.</li>
            <li> Maybe the Futur was too heavy, but the gap is just right on this razor.  </li>
            <li> When I first held this razor in my hand I was blown away by the chrome and black.</li>
            <li> First DE razor I&#x27;ve ever owned and will never go back to other razors.  </li>
            <li> I tried Shark, Sharp, Feather, blades and same thing (although the Feather did not tear up my face - it breezed through my flesh like a hot samurai sword through butter) every time.  </li>
            <li> Keep your fingers and the handle dry (not hard to do) and your grip will not be a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The quality is something hard to find in this day and age, I just am starting to go back to shaving like I did back in High School, am going to go shave right now and will write another review once done !</li>
            <li> Only have had amazing shaves using this razor and my usual Proraso Green soap.</li>
            <li> It has a smooth grip handle that gets a little slippery when wet.  </li>
            <li> He absolutely adores it (along with all of the other products to go with the razor).</li>
            <li> Also, when I was younger and my beard not as tough, it would have worked better.  </li>
            <li> I take the whole thing apart after each shave and wash and dry the two pieces of the guard, the blade and the handle, so I&#x27;m used to handling the razor and threading it onto the little pegs and screwing the whole thing together now.  </li>
            <li> Not a single flaw.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly not a single cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do like the longer handle though, but I have had a few nicks while shaving, which doesn&#x27;t happen with any of the other razors I have used so far (cheap no-brand Chinese model,</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the smooth handle.  </li>
            <li> Years ago, when I was on active duty in the Marines, I went through a straight razor phase.  </li>
            <li> Pay the extra money for the version with the grip on the handle—the ebony handle gets really slippery when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> I imagined it being bigger, its smaller than the old cartridge razor I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> It is my fourth double edge safety razor, and by far the easiest to shave with.</li>
            <li> Was kind of disappointed at first</li>
            <li> Not with a DE, the thick openings keep the hair out from clogging, even if it did just unscrew it a bit and clean it</li>
            <li> I have not used the Derby blades included with this product, but if you care to try them, make sure you try different brands of blades if the Derbys perform poorly to find what works for you.</li>
            <li> However, it is a slightly aggressive razor, so while I would recommend it highly, I would not recommend it as a &amp;#34;first razor&amp;#34; for someone new to double edge razor shaving.  </li>
            <li> This tiny bit of metal has been chromed over, so it&#x27;s not sharp, but I can feel it against my skin when I shave</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned with the length of the handle when I first saw it.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to at first, but it is a quality product.</li>
            <li> - Takes the same amount of time as using any major brand shavor</li>
            <li> High quality blade for a beginner to use to get started in wet shaving.</li>
            <li> The head is very heavy and it bends the actual razor blade into more of a curve that any of my other razors.  </li>
            <li> I have coarse beard and sensitive skin and have used proraso white for my trials with the various blades.  </li>
            <li> I have a few more to try including nacet, Gillette silver blue, Kai, feather, and a few others.  </li>
            <li> This exposed the copper beneath and is very unfortunate because otherwise I loved this razor.</li>
            <li> and it shaved really well, but only a few months after I got it, the faux ebony handle cracked right down the middle.</li>
            <li> As other posts have said this razor does have some heft to, similar to the Merkur 34C, but much lighter than the Merkur Future.</li>
            <li> It is not very aggressive and it is not adjustable, which are things that might cause a new DE shaver to cut or nick themselves.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time electric razor user, but wanted to get back in touch with my early DE shaving days.</li>
            <li> With the TTO design I always felt that the blade wasn&#x27;t being held firmly or that blade after blade sat exactly in the same place time and time again.  </li>
            <li> That was the only blade which I find not sharp enough, and with some extra push, I cut myself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started shaving as a young adult with a typical 2 blade plastic razor.</li>
            <li> Coupled together with a thick lather, a mild blade (Derby), and proper technique</li>
            <li> I know that giving it a fancy opening mechanism would mean moving parts, and moving parts would mean potential failure, but still... it feels like there&#x27;s got to be a more elegant way than dis-assembly to change the blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know that giving it a fancy opening mechanism would mean moving parts, and moving parts would mean potential failure, but still... it feels like there&#x27;s got to be a more elegant way than dis-assembly to change the blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just get a proper brush and some good shaving cream that does not contain any alcohol or nasty chemicals and enjoy, i have never enjoyed shaving so much in my life...</li>
            <li> Alot of little nicks and much irritation occured from these blades.</li>
            <li> The trade-offs are that it&#x27;s more likely to clog, and it&#x27;s not good for shaving other body parts.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for my first double edge safety razor, and based on reviews and suggestion on various sites, and after looking at a number of cheaper alternatives, I settled on the De86.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being as much as twice as expensive as some cheaper options, the De86 is still relatively inexpensive as far as double edge razors go.</li>
            <li> His first couple of times using this razor did result in a few minor cuts, but that&#x27;s just because he was not used to this type of razor.</li>
            <li> razor was small enough to fit in your hand, and the blade was very sharp.</li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable to grip, although you need to keep it as dry as possible, it gets slick when soapy wet.</li>
            <li> black and chrome is an elegant little addition to any man&#x27;s shaving kit, suggesting the black tie and art deco clubs of the 20s and 30s.</li>
            <li> This razor was no different, I got the same amount or reddish than any other sensitive disposable.</li>
            <li> I love the way it looks but with wet hands it can get a little slick.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that Edwin Jagger apparently doesn&#x27;t make a long handle (4&amp;#34;) razor.</li>
            <li> The handle is much shorter than I expected (~3.25&amp;#34;), but I believe that&#x27;s very common for these types of razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that the blade changes are not quite as \\&quot;convenient.\\&quot; Its not hard or time consuming, I just wish it were a little faster and easier.</li>
            <li> Though it is smooth, it&#x27;s surprisingly not slippery at all, even with wet, soapy hands.</li>
            <li> I could see this razor lasting a long time and could not see going back to using cartridges again.</li>
            <li> I had been shopping around for a long time, researching different double edge razors.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed if you order this, but you might be hesitant to actually use it because it is so good looking.</li>
            <li> had worried, this black accented handle would be dull, or cheap plastic, and</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for a beginner and a everyday safety razor using shaver.  </li>
            <li> The Parker long-handle is a twist to open (TTO) design which is quick and slightly safer than the three piece design of the EJ-DE86 but not better.  </li>
            <li> The razor is hefty in your hand, and using the weight of the razor with very little, or no pressure, is enough to get through all of my toughest stubble and growth (properly prepared face, and proraso green tub certainly helps), down to a smoothly shaved face after a few passes.</li>
            <li> I usually use Wilkenson and they work very well</li>
            <li> Should last a LONG time.</li>
            <li> no why I waited so long to go back to the safety razor.</li>
            <li> But it was tiny compared to my Parker long handle</li>
            <li> Although the blades that come with it don&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> Long story short-</li>
            <li> Long story short-</li>
            <li> The quibbles are minor and since I bought this one, I have bought a different make safety razor, but I still seem to use this one!  </li>
            <li> Delivered yesterday, in 6 days flat.</li>
            <li> but this is apparently a \\&quot;no return\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Long stubble short stuble, no mater</li>
            <li> I almost gave up during that first week, but slowly I got the hang of it</li>
            <li> The razor still gleams like new with a little rub from a hand towel.  </li>
            <li> However that not really a major flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Should last a long time!</li>
            <li> So, I bypassed the cheap stuff and went straight to this bad boy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember when I have been able get such a close shave without cutting myself.</li>
            <li> I think the claims of being a closer shave are a bit exaggerated, but it should definitely save money now that Gillette isn&#x27;t giving away free razors anymore.</li>
            <li> The price is unbeatable for this level of quality, and I would definitely recommend this product to those just getting into traditional wet shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is fairly mild, not so irritating afterall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it has to be at least a millimeter thick or more.</li>
            <li> I pushed back on and it hasn&#x27;t come loose since.</li>
            <li> I expected to be able to get by, but the shave is smoother and less irritating.  </li>
            <li> Very poor quality metal to break as easily as it did.  </li>
            <li> bought this razor in Dec of 13 and dropped it into the sink as I was shaving form no more than 2 feet high.</li>
            <li> There is no shave like a DE, and it really isn&#x27;t that hard once you get the face prep</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have anything negative to say really.</li>
            <li> The whole face is at least medium, my neck needs shaving as well.  </li>
            <li> The long handled version is going to be a must for me since I am not a pygmy.</li>
            <li> these YouTube videos talk about doing multi-passes and how long you should work up the lather with the shaving soap --</li>
            <li> Parker 96R, EJ, BB Long Handled Razor).</li>
            <li> finally the faux ebony can be quite slippery when you are holding it with wet hands:</li>
            <li> However, I could understand; if someone just wanted a really long handle.</li>
            <li> I have used different blades in it and with the closed head, I had no learning curve to get used to the shave...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheaper in the long run.</li>
            <li> My skin certainly thanks me for it (more so after the first few shaves, although none were terrible).</li>
            <li> This shaver is a Double Edge Safety Razor not a straight edge safety</li>
            <li> but you have to think of it over the long term.</li>
            <li> You do have to be extra careful around any blemishes or moles-</li>
            <li> Make the investment and save money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan to have this razor for a long time.</li>
            <li> My wet shaving tools are the Semogue Boar Brush, Colonel Conk Santa fe Shave bowl, and currently using colonel conk almond soap, plus the colonel conk razor and brush stand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s done for safety - smaller gap, harder to slice up your face.  </li>
            <li> Hailing from Sheffield, England long known for its steel manufacture and reputation for excellence comes the Edwin Jagger line of safety</li>
            <li> I started with a 1959 Gillette FatBoy adjustable, retired that for a Parker 96r Long Handle and have used that ever since I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I like this razor but it has one major problem - the black handle is not knurled, ie: textured, and it needs to be.</li>
            <li> The reason I picked this razor as opposed to the Edwin Jagger DE89 was simply because it was cheaper, and also it has a black handle which personally I like better than just a cold all-metal handle.</li>
            <li> Subsequent uses of the same blade have been less so</li>
            <li> Although wary of the &amp;#34;starting costs&amp;#34; of wet shaving, I was afraid to buy a cheap Chinese razor and decide against wet shaving, which would leave me wondering if a better razor would have made the difference for me.</li>
            <li> This is the only safety razor that I have used, so I cannot compare the Edwin Jagger head to any other brand.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it is amazingly simple.</li>
            <li> It actually came assembled in the box with this piece reversed and caused some frustration until I tried it the other way around.</li>
            <li> the angle of the blade is such that unless you hold it at an extreme angle, it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut at all.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous because so many reviews of DE razors indicate that you should also be using a fancy shaving cream and an expensive brush.  </li>
            <li> There are other brands and models that have bigger gaps.  </li>
            <li> The handles don&#x27;t have much weight so it can be hard to hold onto them if your hands are wet.  </li>
            <li> (I dropped first one on very hard floor from some height</li>
            <li> i do not shave often (I&#x27;m Asian, and my &amp;#34;facial hair&amp;#34; grows very minimally, but it does grow...</li>
            <li> I give it one less star only because I wish I got the handle with knurling for some extra grip when my hands are wet.</li>
            <li> The chrome finish is heavy, shiny, the handle is deep and shiny blank</li>
            <li> my scalp survived without a single nick.</li>
            <li> However, after limited use both the ebony and the ivory plastic coverings have cracked.  </li>
            <li> After about two pints of blood loss and looking like I survived a Freddie Kruger movie, I discovered that you need to respect the single blade.</li>
            <li> but man up to a single edge.</li>
            <li> Shaving is also faster because the single blade on each side doesn&#x27;t clog up with hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That also sounds weird, but its true.</li>
            <li> Now the next rabbit hole to jump down is the aftershave, pre and post-shave balm-rabbit hole.</li>
            <li> I bought the less expensive VAN DER HAGAN set &amp; this works just fine.</li>
            <li> Faux Ebony Double Edge Safety Razor, Black]]</li>
            <li> I decided I had enough razor burns n bumps from the disposables and wanted to make the switch to something that caused me less issues.  </li>
            <li> There were a couple of reviews of the black portion cracking, but I can&#x27;t see how that would possibly happen.</li>
            <li> Took a few times to get used the direction to shave in as it isn&#x27;t as forgiving as a typical Gillette razor but the shave is much smoother and takes less strokes.</li>
            <li> If I had to come up with a negative, the Derby blades that are included are not very sharp as double edge blades go.</li>
            <li> the effectiveness of this probably depends on your skin type - I found that one pass of the razor cuts about 99% of all the hairs - an extra, small, careful pass in problem areas is enough to get the rest without re-lathering.</li>
            <li> I was given a gift set that included a Parker long handle razor, Parker badger shave brush, and other products.  </li>
            <li> I used to hate to shave, but now it&#x27;s one of my favorite parts of the day!</li>
            <li> Paired with a sharp blade (my choice is the Giillette Silver Blue or 7 O&#x27;clock Black) and you&#x27;ll wonder why you waited so long to switch!</li>
            <li> Annoyed by the price of Gillette multiple blade shaving systems, I decided to experiment and see if this single blade, old fashioned approach would work for me.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned that the handle might be too short</li>
            <li> My hands are a little on the larger size</li>
            <li> its actually become a little get a way for me..</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s on there you can pick it all up and tighten the last little bit.  </li>
            <li> Pick this up!an pick it all up and tighten the last little bit.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I wish was that the handle was a little longer</li>
            <li> one thing I will say is that I wish the handle was a little longer for my big hands!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the small handle, which somebody with very large hands may have trouble handling.</li>
            <li> this is the only blade i&#x27;ve used that actually gets the hard to cut hair just below the jawline.</li>
            <li> this is the only blade i&#x27;ve used that actually gets the hard to cut hair just below the jawline.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be harder or more painful, it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Now, it takes me at least ten, maybe seven if I&#x27;m rushing and doing only two passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately there is no such marking, and thus no way to tell how much each side of the blade has been used.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately there is no such marking, and thus no way to tell how much each side of the blade has been used.  </li>
            <li> There are no tool marks or rough edges.</li>
            <li> metal is all heavy, solid (steel?)</li>
            <li> razor is heavy, solid, and well made.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a straight razor and they do call it a safety razor for a reason.  </li>
            <li> I received my Edwin Jagger de86bl a few days back</li>
            <li> The shave was not as close as I expected it to be, however that could be attributed to my technique rather than the shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> however I found the handle a bit slippery with wet hands.</li>
            <li> I am really careful when shaving since i don&#x27;t want to harm my skin</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t find it that slippery when my hands are wet.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re going to want to be careful when unscrewing this that you don&#x27;t cut yourself.</li>
            <li> Shaving with it is a pleasure, the handle was shorter than I expected but as it turns out this wasn&#x27;t an issue as the balance is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a few nicks and razor bumps when experimenting with cross or against the grain shaving to see how close I can get.  </li>
            <li> Not really much else to say.</li>
            <li> The 3 piece design is dead simple to takedown, and when loaded with a blade, an un-intimidating amount of blade peeks through either side.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I noticed that double edge blades were appearing on drug store shelves, but not the razors.</li>
            <li> If cared for properly, i.e. all parts rinsed and dried after each shave, it still looks like it just came out of</li>
            <li> You also should absolutely not be using canned goop from the drug store, please spring for shaving soap/cream and a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the handle does get slippery when wet, but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> this razor is expensive, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t rough with the razor.</li>
            <li> Since I do not have a heavy beard, I can&#x27;t say if this razor will be aggressive enough for that type of whisker.</li>
            <li> a Mach 3...wish now that I hadn&#x27;t ever given up DE safety razor and wet soap shaving...</li>
            <li> This one can be a bit slippery when wet.  </li>
            <li> The handle is too short to hold firmly and</li>
            <li> I have been DE Safety and wet shaving for a couple years now.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with this razor for a few weeks now, and have finally learned the technique.</li>
            <li> head/screw is made of pot metal and will snap if you arent careful.</li>
            <li> No complaints, takes some time to get the hang of wet shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> , however I will say that you have to be careful using it because of this.  </li>
            <li> Some mentioned that the razor was slippery when wet.</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving about a year ago.</li>
            <li> I have to say shaving everyday is such a drag.</li>
            <li> This is not a good combination when you are handling a double edge razor blade either in the act of shaving or after washing the razor and trying to open it to dry out.</li>
            <li> Coating the handle in hot glue will make it easier to hold and less frustrating when soapy.</li>
            <li> The black faux-ebony handle doesn&#x27;t slip when my hands are wet with water or shaving cream, although I try to keep my hands mostly dry when I shave.</li>
            <li> Well, unless I was just curious on how other razors compared.</li>
            <li> The blade stayed sharp a lot longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Odd thing is I really do not feel a difference between my single blade and the others.</li>
            <li> the handle is thick black plastic, but in that retro way, not cheap and modern.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re an every other day shaver, like myself..</li>
            <li> Yes, 2 years for $35 to shave every other day.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely well made shaving tool.</li>
            <li> extremely pleased.&lt;br /&gt;right</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really evident in the pictures</li>
            <li> The Derby razors it came with cut sharp.</li>
            <li> for my other</li>
            <li> My only complaints are that at times it can get a bit slippery at times and I find the handle to be a bit small.</li>
            <li> i would have bought an adjustable or that extremely aggressive razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to contact Edwin Jagger about this, as I&#x27;ve heard they are extremely helpful and responsive and should replace this</li>
            <li> even with the notoriously sharp Feathers.</li>
            <li> With proper lubrication the razor and either of these blades does not seem excessively aggressive.  </li>
            <li> and I would have preferred a longerhandle as this one tends to get &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; in my hand as I swing it around to use the other side of the blade or maneuver it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like that fact that it seems to scrape off other layers of stuff on my face that have probably built up over the years of soap and abuse.</li>
            <li> Steep learning curve, I still trying to figure out what blades and other accessories I want/</li>
            <li> was shaving every day with a cartridge razor, and moved to shaving every other day when I started using this thing just because I could get away with it at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for using it, I have to say I was nervous going in with the razor sharp blade being exposed.</li>
            <li> (they are as sharp as you imagine).</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a defect, but I&#x27;m not likely to return to this brand for any other products.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to get into DE shaving, buy this first as it is not that expensive for the quality you get (Handmade in England) and the performance you will get out of it.</li>
            <li> I used different angles of approach and nothing got me past the design of it.  </li>
            <li> Extremely well crafted.</li>
            <li> Both shave well with sharp blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue with wet shaving, and I&#x27;m looking forward to trying other razors by Edwin Jagger!</li>
            <li> The plating appears very heavily applied and the plastic handle feels very solid.</li>
            <li> Be very careful when changing the blades.</li>
            <li> Seems very heavy and solid.</li>
            <li> It can be a little slick if your hand is wet but as long as you keep the handle and your hand dry</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars, but the handle came a little loose from tang of the razor about a year after I bought it.</li>
            <li> I would also advise that if you have thick whiskers you should use the Derby razors only once as the tend to have a bit of drag after that.&lt;br /&gt;Finally</li>
            <li> though slightly shorter than expected but not problematic at all.</li>
            <li> I thought the black shaft would be slippery and it can feel that way with foam and water on it, once you get a feel for the weight and balance its really not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing they make the handle so short in order to discourage you from using too much pressure and cutting yourself.  </li>
            <li> recommend it, you never get this feeling with conventional razors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a little shorter than I expected</li>
            <li> handle get&#x27;s a little slippery when wet</li>
            <li> If you are just starting out in wet shaving, take a serious look at the DE86bl.</li>
            <li> Granted, you should always have enough fear to respect such a sharp tool, you should not be afraid to use it daily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it might be hard, or might accidentally hack-up my face, after reading all the tips (do that); but it was not, that different, from cartridges (to use), after-all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor is smooth, feels like you cannot put it on a bad angle and feels safer than the Mach razors.  </li>
            <li> It is the least likely of my collection to cut, nick or scrape my face yet gives the smoothest shave of the lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> DE89Lbl Lined Detail Chrome Plated Double Edge Safety Razor]], but is (or at least was when I bought it) around $10 cheaper than the DE89L.</li>
            <li> if that&#x27;s not worth $30, what is?hat for yourself.</li>
            <li> if that&#x27;s not worth $30, what is?</li>
            <li> Review the listing yourself and see if you can find any mention of this unusual and unfair &amp;#34;no return&amp;#34; policy.  </li>
            <li> So far, I have not experienced any cuts since I made the switch.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I got sick and tired of buying low quality and overpriced disposable blades, but still preferred shaving with a blade as opposed to an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> make a habit of always reading the worst reviews first and then making my way up to four or five star reviews, and the impression that I got from reading the one and two star reviews was that people weren&#x27;t holding the razor at the right angle.  </li>
            <li> I hope to pass down to my son.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t torque it down, it&#x27;s not an engine part.</li>
            <li> And it will shave the hair down to the pore when held</li>
            <li> once I got it down</li>
            <li> The cost of shaving just went way down.</li>
            <li> The only down side to the heavy build is that it might not get into real tight spaces like under the nose.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Out of the factory this factory, this shaver was screwed together so tightly that it simply refuses to budge no matter how hard I tried to twist it</li>
            <li> I have had a few little nicks, just try to use very little pressure and a proper angle to avoid that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The blades that came with it are very sharp, and gave me on of the smoothest shaves I&#x27;ve had as yet.</li>
            <li> I will also try a few other soap/creams to give me some options.</li>
            <li> The head&#x27;s corners are very sharp and jab me repeatedly while shaving.  </li>
            <li> and it gets such a ridiculously close/smooth shave that is downright</li>
            <li> Now, time to also step away from my ridiculous gel and get some actual products!</li>
            <li> Closer shave with less irritation.</li>
            <li> I was up and running for less that $20.  </li>
            <li> I had previously.</li>
            <li> which is what I previously used.  </li>
            <li> This variant of the DE89 I got because I prefer the black handle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Short handle is easier to pack and takes up less room on my shower shelf when laying down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The black and chrome is a combination you&#x27;ll appreciate even if you don&#x27;t ride a black Harley.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m wasting less plastic, shaving closer, and haven&#x27;t slit my throat by accident yet.</li>
            <li> and I was looking to get a slight upgrade</li>
            <li> As a woman, I wish the handle was slightly longer, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> and I like the black handle.</li>
            <li> This may give just a touch more irritation but nothing terrible, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> and then I realized that the EJ-DE86 is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; and that my Parker was the odd man out.  </li>
            <li> The black handle?</li>
            <li> I like black.</li>
            <li> I was attracted to the black and chrome combo...to me</li>
            <li> Give it some time, way less irritation and way closer shave than electric or cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> And shave less often</li>
            <li> Then I decided I would upgrade my Mug, so I purchased the Edwin Jagger black porcelain apothecary style mug.</li>
            <li> the Derby blades (I used Feather blades previously) and to my luck</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve switched to this razor I get about 75% less ingrown hairs and a closer shave.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not good enough for me to switch.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend a try if you&#x27;re tired of spending so much on the plastic vibrating razors or the expensive shave &#x27;clubs.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I did a few searches and found the German brands too expensive and a little quirky.</li>
            <li> The threads on the head are tight.  </li>
            <li> Heavy means less shaving effort</li>
            <li> i do wish the handle was just a LITTLE longer, but that&#x27;s just because i&#x27;m used to the longer handle of disposables.</li>
            <li> Like I said before you&#x27;ll need to acclimate your skin to using this type of blade against it, and beside that you&#x27;ll need a little practice with the angle before attempting.  </li>
            <li> This razor seems to have a little finer plating and finish than the Merkur.</li>
            <li> My dad had one when I was a little kid</li>
            <li> This razor has just a little heft to it, but quite well balanced.</li>
            <li> so my skin is a little &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; but</li>
            <li> You just have to take a little time and let the weight of the shave head do the work.</li>
            <li> that makes it hug your skin with little effort.</li>
            <li> Could be a little heavier.</li>
            <li> Little to no &amp;#34;force&amp;#34; is needed when shaving or you&#x27;ll have nicks all over the place.  </li>
            <li> and I find this razor to be a little too forgiving.  </li>
            <li> It is far less expensive</li>
            <li> Then I wanted to get away from the stiff Boars hair brush and went with the black handle</li>
            <li> Hard to go wrong with this one unless you really have to have an aggressive tool.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because the blade doesn&#x27;t give you a very close shave that you end up going over 3-4 times and irritate your skin like crazy.</li>
            <li> An open secret is that this Edwin Jagger and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Doing a &amp;#34;wet shave&amp;#34; is an experience now, rather than a chore in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling smoother than the disposable razors I wasted a ton of money on, too.  </li>
            <li> My hands started to cramp after few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, a few weeks after receiving it I dropped it on my sink.</li>
            <li> After emailing the manufacturer (in the UK) and including a photo, nothing happened for a few days.</li>
            <li> Found this Edwin Jagger and debated over a few models from before picking this one.</li>
            <li> Tried a few types of blades and found that with this razor they were too aggressive ...</li>
            <li> I have had this a few months and the plating is already dulling and wearing off.  </li>
            <li> A few reviewers commented they are concerned about the threads on the handle that screw into the head stripping or breaking.</li>
            <li> What have I been missing all these years?</li>
            <li> I went to the electric when I tired of nicking up my face with the multiple bladed razors.  </li>
            <li> BUT, don&#x27;t get cocky like</li>
            <li> You get a few hairs stuck in them and you have to dump the thing.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> ( I think I was heavy handed being used to a cartridge razor)</li>
            <li> There is no cheap fix.  </li>
            <li> razor is heavy - surprisingly heavy for it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li> The razor has a heavy weight to it as well.</li>
            <li> I was in the Marine Corps for 5 years and everyday shaved.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for about 2 months now and have used it everyday.</li>
            <li> The tip is fairly heavy, so it&#x27;s not a balanced razor.</li>
            <li> Use this as an everyday razor......</li>
            <li> Heavy in the hand.</li>
            <li> I do, however, have a few nits to pick with the Jagger razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve got some heavy beard on the chin area.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> My everyday razor is the Merkur 34c</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not ashamed to admit I gave myself a few knicks as I went against the grain of my whiskers (a daring but ill-advised move).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few friends switched to this product for shaving and recommended it, I decided to try it for myself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and finally, not a huge fan of the razors that came included with the razor.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that is a little annoying is the smooth handle and this could be a problem only due to the use of knurled handle DE razors for years and bad habits it has produced.</li>
            <li> This razor&#x27;s handle is slick when wet, and a little hard to hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no more or less nicks than with the Mach 3</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed however to report that today while rinsing my razor under very hot water while shaving, I noticed a tiny little shard of chrome coming off from the side.</li>
            <li> It did not slip as other people wrote here, at least for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do yourself a favor, and read the other negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is the sharp corners.  </li>
            <li> The zinc is not strong, and if it is dropped, you will break off the head at the threaded portion.</li>
            <li> I mean, yeah, you might need 16 blades to take down one of the giants from Game of Thrones, but you only need one to eradicate the stubble of one&#x27;s face (or legs, m&#x27;lady).</li>
            <li> I have been very careful cleaning and maintaining this razor, had my old Gillette since High school and threw it away when this once came, sick to my stomach now !!!!!</li>
            <li> Cartridge razors always disappointed me, there was always a small patch of fuzz that I just couldn&#x27;t get without making one too many passes with the old gillette, resulting in painful cuts and razor burn.</li>
            <li> so I thought it was a bad razor at first.  </li>
            <li> I use to get razor bumps and pretty bad irritation on my face and neck, but since switching to the DE safety razor I have had no more issues.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t have the dropsies, I would give this razor 5 stars, but the handle is just a little too brittle for someone as clumsy as me.</li>
            <li> and you will have very little or no razor burn or irritation.  </li>
            <li> Very little irritation (I am still a newbie) and almost no razor burn.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s hardly any waste when you change out the blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small learning curve.</li>
            <li> well,the one point that i worry may fail in the future is the razor head screwing into the handle, with the razor bed resting between them.</li>
            <li> I usually shave in the shower</li>
            <li> But despite these issues I still gave it four stars because the downsides are small.</li>
            <li> No more nicks, no more razor bumps, no more irritation,</li>
            <li> no more ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> That said the small size isn&#x27;t a problem for me.</li>
            <li> I worried about the handle being slick</li>
            <li> He usually uses Gillete ProGlide and those types.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think that all razor blades are created equal, but you&#x27;d be wrong.</li>
            <li> There is not much more</li>
            <li> I find it necessary to hold it just under the head,which for me is uncomfortable and limits motion.</li>
            <li> By the way I use a very basic foam and brush from the drugstore, I didn&#x27;t bother buying an expensive one.</li>
            <li> Just what your bathroom has been missing!</li>
            <li> Its very nicely heavy!</li>
            <li> The handle is small by look</li>
            <li> No more razor burn.</li>
            <li> After using electric razors for my face the past 25 years with disposables for the sideburns, I decided I needed a change when the cartridge hit 5 blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used feather blades - after using the Feather AC DX, i&#x27;m not sure I can change.</li>
            <li> The problem is that the gap between the blade and the blade holder is too narrow to get the thick whiskers</li>
            <li> Those saying it is too slippery to hold make no sense to me after using it for the past four weeks.</li>
            <li> The razor is a bit on the heavy side, and when it is wet, it is difficult to grip.</li>
            <li> As for cutting myself, there haven&#x27;t been any major blood lettings.</li>
            <li> It feels as though the blade is at one with the razor when it&#x27;s twisted down tight.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, this is pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still hard sometimes to not put pressure on it like a disposable junk 3-blade razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Derby&#x27;s, too dull</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a month of use, from tough shaving where I haven&#x27;t shaved in days, to everyday shaving (and I also shave my head)...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave feedback, but I wanted to on this product for all the men (and women) sick and tired of the exuberant prices charged today for your typical razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving took some getting used to; the first time I tried, I nicked my neck up pretty badly and had terrible razor burn.</li>
            <li> The bundled Derby Extra blades were a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> This sucker needs to be at a 45 degree angle to your face or it won&#x27;t cut anything.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just aggressive enough for my beard, while not being dangerous for me to use.</li>
            <li> once a month as soap scum builds up on the chrome.</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with ingrown hairs and rashes when shaving which really sucks being in the army.</li>
            <li> because I was sick of paying big bucks for replacement blades on mediocre commercial razors.  </li>
            <li> It still works, but the absence of a grip feels awkward and this thing is going to impress nobody- try not to drop it.  </li>
            <li> I mean I did drop</li>
            <li> I would seriously try it.</li>
            <li> It shaves ridiculously close probably no matter what blades you use, but i do think there is a difference in blade quality.</li>
            <li> Dunno why I thought I needed 16 blades with which to shave - seriously.</li>
            <li> Got tired of always having a dull razor (or a throw-away) in the house</li>
            <li> not sure what ill do with it now.</li>
            <li> My first shave with this razor was terrible.</li>
            <li> I feel like I would have to literally try very hard to nick myself with this razor.  </li>
            <li> it is expensive and hard to find here</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t explain how frustrating those disposables are.</li>
            <li> and now I have another broken head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying $16/month for a name brand razor and my barber</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with plenty of DE razors before and this is the absolute worst.</li>
            <li> If you are tired of buying razors at the store that they don&#x60;t supply blades for after a year or so.</li>
            <li> - were it not for the poor construction.</li>
            <li> SP &#x3D; too irritating to my neck</li>
            <li> I get a bit sick to my stomach just thinking about the money I spent over the decades, the frustration I have had, and the torn up skin to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I feel so stupid to have waited this long to try this razor, and anyone reading this review of mine, please dont be nervous or scared</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad one, but I recommend not screwing the handle on too tightly.</li>
            <li> Decided to give the safety razors a try, as i was tired of the expensive blades on tho&#x27;s multiblade shavers.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.    </li>
            <li> the fat blade area made it difficult to shave in areas.</li>
            <li> After continued problems and not so close a shave with the expensive Merkur Futur, I decided to go to a non-adjustable razor.  </li>
            <li> Shaving with a DE razor is complicated, there&#x27;s a reason we moved as a society away from DE razors to cartridge razors.  </li>
            <li> I tried to go back to a Gillette Mach 3 one time and it felt terrible compared to the Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad.</li>
            <li> am the sad owner of a blood drawing razor blade and my faith in Amazon is shaken.</li>
            <li> You can&#x60;t go wrong with a razor like this, it WORKS.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I&#x27;m not saying that the razor should survive such abuse - just that a metal bolt breaking under the force of a 3 ft drop indicates TERRIBLE choice of materials and</li>
            <li> but for the price silly to return.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with either the Jagger or the Feather.</li>
            <li> Lately, though, I have been growing increasingly disappointed with the tendency of the Mach 3 to decrease in quality while simultaneously increase in price.  </li>
            <li> i was afraid when i bought it because i had bad experience with other razors, but this one rocks!!!!</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t that crazy?</li>
            <li> If you get irritation from shaving with those crazy multi blade razors this thing is a god-send.</li>
            <li> I am afraid to purchase another or recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> like cutting butter or shaving ice.</li>
            <li> You wont be sorry!</li>
            <li> However the handle is slippery as glass making it very difficult to hold.</li>
            <li> Albeit, if you go against the grain you&#x27;re going to have a bad time</li>
            <li> I got this bad boy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to give it a bad rating for that though.</li>
            <li> Not too bad.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m frankly shocked that the designers have not addressed</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m frankly shocked that the designers have not addressed</li>
            <li> When it hit the floor the Faux Ebony portion of the handle cracked and snapped off of the handle, revealing an ugly brass interior.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor on the recommendation of Reddit&#x27;s &amp;#34;Wicked Edge&amp;#34; subreddit, and boy does it deliver some sick results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still disappointed in the quality of the razor, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still disappointed in the quality of the razor, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I used to hate shaving...</li>
            <li> Absolutely hate the merkur and derby.  </li>
            <li> But this bad boy is the SH!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this razor to be a real disappointment.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> or I would break out terribly.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone - even beginners; I am a horrible shaver and if I haven&#x27;t accidentally cut my carotid with this tool, so won&#x27;t you.</li>
            <li> I watched a bunch of online videos and was fearing the worst for a break-in period.</li>

            <li> Just about perfect... it doesn&#x27;t look very grippy, but trust me, it is. Also, I have sensitive skin and cut myself easily, so this level of aggressiveness is just right. If you are new to DE razor shaving, know that different razors will &amp;#34;give you more of the blade&amp;#34; than others, so be careful what you buy. If you look like the Brawny man, maybe you could get something more aggressive than this. I would have given it 5 stars, but the handle came a little loose from tang of the razor about a year after I bought it. I pushed back on and it hasn&#x27;t come loose since. Otherwise, 5 stars. Last thing, as everyone else says, DE razors are the best. I used to get razor bumps and crappy shaves no matted how many blades were on that disposable razor, but this has changed all that. You ARE going to have to take a month or so to find the best blades for your face, learn your technique, and teach yourself that you just don&#x27;t use pressure with these things (there will be blood otherwise). After that, you&#x27;ll be a convert. It&#x27;s worth it, and this is a good razor to start with.</li>
            <li> Beautiful razor with great &amp;#34;curb appeal&amp;#34; and it provides a good shave.</li>
            <li> I am sold on this! Completely and utterly sold. This was my first attempt to step outside the Electronic / Gillette disposables world and entire the amazing world of old school safety razors. Only time will tell, if I step up from here to a straight edge, but for now I am more then content. This razor does an EXCELLENT job and feels solid in your hand. The overall aesthetics of it are stellar and it appears to have great craftsmanship. Hopefully it holds up for a long time, because I am completely in love with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s also be realistic $25 is not going to break the bank for an entry Safety Razor. This is an attempt to step outside the mainstream world of mach 3, quatro, etc etc.. whatever the heck they&#x27;re releasing nowadays for Gillette. Not only is this product a fair value, buying 100 razor packs is only ~$10 shipped! If you&#x27;re an every other day shaver, like myself.. This will last you nearly 2 years! Yes, 2 years for $35 to shave every other day. If you&#x27;re a daily shaver it will last you ~ 1 year. Isn&#x27;t that crazy? $35 in razors for one year of shaving every day. That&#x27;s a ridiculous value and too good to ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I stepped away from electronic shaving - it felt cheap and I honestly don&#x27;t like the feel of it overall, or how it felt gliding on my face buzzing. The Safety Razor feels EXCELLENT on your face and glides so smoothly. Albeit, if you go against the grain you&#x27;re going to have a bad time (Don&#x27;t ask me how I know this now). You only need to go over most areas ONCE with a fresh razor in this and it gets such a ridiculously close/smooth shave that is downright perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s to hoping the razor holds up for a while! Now, time to also step away from my ridiculous gel and get some actual products!</li>
            <li> It is a good looking, good shaving razor until it breaks.  It is solid, heavy and looks good.  The handle is fairly short, and the plastic is pretty slippery when it gets wet (I shave in the shower), and though it&#x27;s great for shaving your face, it is dangerous for your head.  I was fairly happy with it it though, until it broke at the threads, like others I see in the reviews.  Very poor quality metal to break as easily as it did.  Not a frugal alternative when the $30 head can&#x27;t last a year.</li>
            <li> This razor should be used as the benchmark of quality basic 3-piece safety razors. It has a hefty quality weight to it and each of the three pieces all feel well made. The chrome finish is perfect in all aspects. Not a single flaw. Lastly, it comes packaged in a very elegant style. Great for gift giving!</li>
            <li> A closer shave and saving a ton of money on blades</li>
            <li> I recently switched to double edged razors and am very happy I did. Closer shave with less irritation. Not to mention the blades cost a fraction of a fraction of a cost of cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the De86bl, it is my first safety razor, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to its competition. I can say that the razor is very nice. It feels like a quality piece when it&#x27;s siting in my hand. It has a nice weight to it without being too heavy. It also looks great. I would recommend this razor to anyone looking for a nice safety razor to start out with.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and easy to use - true winner!  I like it better than my old butterfly style razor; there are less moving parts to clean or foul up.  Great shave.</li>
            <li> Awesome razor!  I have several others and this Edwin Jagger has risen to the top of the list.  The head is very heavy and it bends the actual razor blade into more of a curve that any of my other razors.  I believe that this is what gives me a superior shave as it is the biggest difference I can see in construction of it.  I also have a Ballie that was a pretty inexpensive but very good razor.  I dropped it in the showing and it bent the guard.  This one looks like it would break the floor prior to bending, it is that robust.  The only down side to the heavy build is that it might not get into real tight spaces like under the nose.  I don&#x27;t shame my moustache so I cannot say for sure that this would be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I t came with some Derby blades which were top notch.  I usually use Wilkenson and they work very well and I tried with some Shark Super Stainless wich also worked very will.  It really doesn&#x27;t seem to be blade sensitive.  It is also not an aggressive razor though it gives a really close shave.  It is the least likely of my collection to cut, nick or scrape my face yet gives the smoothest shave of the lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this and it is a real deal I got my for around $25!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would and have recommended it to a friend!</li>
            <li> Very nice safety razor. Sharp looking (ha-ha, sorry), comfortable to hold with a nice balance of weight, and nice casing for the razor which provides me a weekly beautiful shave. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have a few safety razors in my shave den, including this one, a Merkur 34C, a Merkur Futur, and two vintage Gilettes, a Slim Adjustable and a Super Speed. This razor sees the most action of any of them. It is a fairly forgiving razor, not too aggressive but it strikes the right balance for me. As most wet shavers will tell you, what performance you get out of razors, creams, soaps, brushes, blades, etc., will greatly vary by user. However, this razor seems to be well received by most. It is an elegantly designed razor and has just the right heft to it. It comes in three pieces, so the head and comb come apart separately for easier cleaning. On first glance the smooth ebony handle might make you think that it could possibly slip easily when wet, however this is not so. I think this is a fine razor for anyone either interested in traditional wet shaving or just looking for something new to add to their arsenal.</li>
            <li> Ahh, just like when I was 16 and using my dad&#x27;s double-edged razor. This beauty works like a charm. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Wonderful razor that is both beautiful and functional. Easily one of the best looking and comfortable razors in this price range. The chrome plating, fit, and finish on this razor are outstanding. There are no tool marks or rough edges. An open secret is that this Edwin Jagger and the more expensive Muhle use the exact same heads, except the Edwin Jagger is priced much lower. Muhle razors are the ones you can find in the Art of Shaving stores and they are much expansive. These Edwin Jagger safety razors are a great bargain.</li>
            <li> Feel great on the hand, not too light, not too heavy, easy to cleanup and to change the blades. Looks great in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I went back to double edged shaving to alleviate the high cost of modern razor cartridges.    The Jagger razor is very well finished and has a nice heft. The chrome is particularly high quality. Blades are held very securely, without a worry about them being misaligned. Like many reviews on other sites, the handle is very smooth and can be a bit slick to hold when wet. With that said, I have never had a problem holding or dropping the razor.    The bundled Derby Extra blades were a bit disappointing. I read very good things about those blades, but my old Gillette Sensor II Excel gives me a much closer shave on one pass than the Derby blades. I am a no-fuss type of guy when it comes to shaving, so I&#x27;m not doing more than one-pass. Sorry.    I then tried Feather double edged blades with the Jagger razor, and I must say the difference between the Derby and Feather was night and day. The Feather blade glided effortlessly over my face, as if there wasn&#x27;t a blade in the razor. It shaved (on one pass) as close as my Sensor II Excel, and with no nicks or cuts. Also, I get as many shaves out of a Feather blade as I do with a Sensor 2 Excel carterThe Feather blades are three times as much money as the Derbys, but are still only one-third the cost of Sensor II cartridges.    Jagger + Feather is a winning combination for me.</li>
            <li> Perfect handle weight and good shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently started wetshaving with soap in a mug, a bristle brush, and adouble-edgee safety razor.  The first razor I got, after my last electric died, was an inexpensive Chinese import. I wanted to find out if wetshaving was for me without investing a lot of money. I was up and running for less that $20.  The little Weishi razor was really quite decent.  A very gentle shaver, it made it easy for me to learn the art of wetshaving.  While it was comfortable to use, it didn&#x27;t give me very close shaves.  My five-o&#x27;clock shadow seemed to arrive mid-afternoon.      When I felt comfortable with my technique, I wanted to move up to a better quality razor.  I&#x27;m totally happy I picked the Edwin Jagger.  It is a solidly built, beautifully finished product.  I&#x27;ve never seen a razor as well made and elegant as this one.  It&#x27;s definitely a bit more aggressive than my first razor, and that&#x27;s what I was looking for.  It delivers great shaves, and now that I know what I&#x27;m doing, with no razor burn.  And best of all, the Amazon price was the best on the internet.  I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well. Took a few times to get used the direction to shave in as it isn&#x27;t as forgiving as a typical Gillette razor but the shave is much smoother and takes less strokes. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Years ago, when I was on active duty in the Marines, I went through a straight razor phase.  I loved the shave and the minimal cost after the initial expense, but unfortunately the time and attention required for a quality (and safe) shave with a straight razor does not mesh well with the \\&quot;****, shower, shave, and hit the road\\&quot; lifestyle of the Marine Corps.  So back to the Mach 3 I went as a matter of convenience and time management.   Lately, though, I have been growing increasingly disappointed with the tendency of the Mach 3 to decrease in quality while simultaneously increase in price.  I didn&#x27;t really feel up to the time investment required to get back into straight razor shaving, but it occurred to me that a DE razor might provide a decent wetshave without the hassle of a straight.  I shopped around, read some reviews, and settled on this Edwin Jagger.  I really wanted a Merkur, but shipping would have been more as I use Amazon Prime.  Well, I cannot compare the EJ to the Merkur, but I can confidently say that after using the EJ twice I have never gotten better results from any cartridge or straight razor.  This thing gives me the absolute best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  It&#x27;s very sturdy, with great heft in the head to provide sufficient pressure against the face, it&#x27;s a cinch to unscrew to replace the blade, and it looks great too.  It&#x27;s not adjustable, which I think makes it great for a beginner like me since there are fewer options to mess with.  I&#x27;d recommend this to absolutely anyone looking for a better shave.  Now I get to go shop around for different shave soaps and creams.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love mine! You won&#x27;t be sorry, it&#x27;s a stunning razor that performs exceptionally! I won&#x27;t use anything else, and it has an old-world quality, well crafted and awesome!</li>
            <li> This is an extremely well made shaving tool. The chrome finish is flawless and the whole razor just oozes quality and understated elegance. The weight is perfect and makes the whole &amp;#34;let the razor&#x27;s weight do the work&amp;#34; thing a breeze. I&#x27;ve had no issues with any slipping caused by the smooth handle.&lt;br /&gt;You can pay more for a DE razor but why?</li>
            <li> Impressed with this razor. Razor is very well made and performs great. The best way to shave with it will be in short, quick strokes. I came from using store brand disposables, then moving on to that Dollar Shave Razor Club deal that sent 4 blades each month. Paired with Shave Butter, this razor is great.</li>
            <li> It a great Safety razor.  My three star is partly my own fault.  It has a smooth grip handle that gets a little slippery when wet.  I&#x27;ll probably buy the same brand with a textured handle soon.</li>
            <li> This razor exceeded my expectations.  I was a little concerned that the handle might be too short but it turns out to be an advantage as it gives you better control.   As others have pointed out, both the finish and build quality are exceptional, and the balance is superb.  It&#x27;s a wonderful tool and a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> First DE razor I&#x27;ve ever owned and will never go back to other razors.  This Razor is exactly as advertised.  Just be aware that this Razor has a short handle.  It took me a while to get used to, but now I don&#x27;t even think about it.  The razor has a solid feel and is easy to hold--no slipping while shaving. It also came with 5 Derby Extra razor blades, which I really like.  I&#x27;m happy I bought this DE razor.</li>
            <li> Just a truly great shaving razor. No matter what brand of blade I put in it, I can always get a decent shave. I can&#x27;t say the same for other razors that I own. If you are just starting out in wet shaving, take a serious look at the DE86bl. The DE89 series is very popular too.</li>
            <li> Makes me smile every time I pick it up!</li>
            <li> I love how well this works compared to the gimmicky expensive modern blades and razors.  I have never had a shave this smooth.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t expect was for it to feel like I was holding a toy razor.  The long handled version is going to be a must for me since I am not a pygmy.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. Looks great, perfect weight and balance, and it provides a superior shave. Very Good Quality for the price.  I would buy it again, and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> So happy that I made the switch to DE safety razor. Did not want to invest in a straight blade yet. Absolutely thrilled with my decision to try this. Product shows no signs of wear, no rust, or discoloration. Easy to (dis)assemble. Small learning curve. I stopped nicking myself after about 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> I had a Parker don&#x27;t remember the model and it was always leaving razor burn.  Same blades, this razor does not.  Go figure.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Love Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li> Excellent, mild razor. Might be overlooked as being a great razor for the beginner, as well as a very nice bald head razor. Hard to go wrong with this one unless you really have to have an aggressive tool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this EJ for about a month now and I have absolutely no regrets in picking it up.  I look forward to shaving now.  Buy this along with the VDH starter kit and you will be getting some of the best shaves of your life.</li>
            <li> This is a very fancy razor, which does a great job at shaving. The razor is very mild, milder than the Gillette Fusion system that I used earlier (I use [[ASIN:B0077LAJT2 Personna Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count]] with this razor). Shaving with this razor also feels much more comfortable than my old Gillette Fusion, and much cleaner (very little stubble left).    The razor has a good weight, and feels nice to hold, use, and look at. The black faux-ebony handle doesn&#x27;t slip when my hands are wet with water or shaving cream, although I try to keep my hands mostly dry when I shave. The razor head (the business end) is the same as the [[ASIN:B003LW4L2W Edwin Jagger DE89bl Chrome Plated Double Edge Safety Razor]] and the [[ASIN:B002RBF1PO Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl Lined Detail Chrome Plated Double Edge Safety Razor]], but is (or at least was when I bought it) around $10 cheaper than the DE89L. Personally, I prefer the appearance of the faux-ebony handle to all stainless steel.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for a couple of months now and could not be more happy with my purchase. After a few nicks while learning how to use the razor I&#x27;m not able to get a great shave with no irritation.  The razor breaks down very easily for cleaning and looks the same as it did the first time I used it. I could see this razor lasting a long time and could not see going back to using cartridges again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman and bought one as a gift for a guy over a year ago... I loved it so much that I bought one for myself! I use it to shave my legs and am extremely pleased with the quality of the shave and how smooth my legs feel. Unquestionably superior to multi-blade razors from the store. I have no idea why everyone doesn&#x27;t use this type of razor, it makes so much more sense and it&#x27;s so much more cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the handle design. It isn&#x27;t very ergonomic and in the shower it&#x27;s slippery and I drop it all the time.</li>
            <li> i decided to take the wasteful, disposable plastic elements out of my life, and was more than ready to eliminate disposable razors. i did some research, and realized i wasn&#x27;t yet ready for a true straight razor and the almost strict religious upkeep factors of them...i wanted a middle ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i researched online and through amazon, reading the reviews of a ton of this type before settling on this one. it came, and my face and i are extremely pleased.&lt;br /&gt;right off the bat, the heft and quality show how well made it is. i&#x27;m a gadget man, and i love how things work- so opening the razor to replace blades is more fun and fascination than a chore. i&#x27;m amazed the solution to a great shave can be so simple.&lt;br /&gt;the metal is all heavy, solid (steel?) with a thick, smooth chrome finish you don&#x27;t see on anything anymore. this isn&#x27;t going to flake off or turn color...it has to be at least a millimeter thick or more. or is this what true, good stainless steel is supposed to be like? either way, it&#x27;s solid.&lt;br /&gt;the handle is well made and i don&#x27;t forsee it falling apart. the handle is thick black plastic, but in that retro way, not cheap and modern. i do wish the handle was just a LITTLE longer, but that&#x27;s just because i&#x27;m used to the longer handle of disposables. i&#x27;m already acclimating to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why is it not 5 stars? well,the one point that i worry may fail in the future is the razor head screwing into the handle, with the razor bed resting between them. it &#x27;s only friction-held, nothing snaps or locks in, and the parts are so well chromed, friction is achieved by tightening the heck out of it all- which i fear may strip the threading one day. but maybe that&#x27;s just me being used to cheap products- in all other ways, this razor seems built to last- the kind of thing that if we&#x27;d gone to atomic war decades ago, this would have been pulled out of the rubble and used by a scruffy-faced survivor. it&#x27;s that retro, well made and solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh and the shave! well, i&#x27;ll let you discover that for yourself. you will want to have a bonfire for your old shavers- disposable, or electric. this is the only blade i&#x27;ve used that actually gets the hard to cut hair just below the jawline. if that&#x27;s not worth $30, what is?hat for yourself. you will want to have a bonfire for your old shavers- disposable, or electric. this is the only blade i&#x27;ve used that actually gets the hard to cut hair just below the jawline. if that&#x27;s not worth $30, what is?</li>
            <li> kind of tricky to assemble and all that, but its a great little razor.</li>
            <li> If you get irritation from shaving with those crazy multi blade razors this thing is a god-send. My neck used to sting and burn after shaving but after I got this I&#x27;ve had no problems at all! Not to mention it gives the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Outstanding razor for the price. Very smooth and sleek look. Works great and better than the Merkur I had previously. I definitely recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> Only have had amazing shaves using this razor and my usual Proraso Green soap. The only issue is the Derby Blades that come packaged with it, invest in some Astras or Feathers.</li>
            <li> I was out of razor blades and decided I didn&#x27;t want to spend twenty dollars for four more.  I realized my dad shaved with one of these every day without fatal injury, I figured I could too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is not a religious event for me, it&#x27;s a chore I have to do every morning.  I use this razor with good old Barbasol from a can.  I get a decent shave, I haven&#x27;t cut myself yet, and it costs me about six cents a week for blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is heavy, solid, and well made.  I like it.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to save money.  I have no idea if its the best razor in the world and will change your life.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with this DE razor for a couple of months and I wish I had started shaving this way from the beginning. I remeber my dad shaving with a DE razor when I was younger but a year or two before I started shaving he dropped it and the handle broke, and there were no replacements to be found at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing a &amp;#34;wet shave&amp;#34; is an experience now, rather than a chore in my humble opinion. It feels more luxurious in a way with all the preparing and the smooth, comfortable shave that leaves a nice smooth face afterwards. The only downfall is that this razor comes with the Derby brand blades which left much to be desired. Alot of little nicks and much irritation occured from these blades. I recommend searching around for a different brand. A better blade combined with this razor makes for a great shave.</li>
            <li> My husband was overwrought when I purchased this item for him. He was so excited that and happy about the gift for him from me and agreed that I made a good choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving every day for 5 days with this razor (paired with Astra blades), and this is my impression:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is excellent - the chrome is super-shiny, the pieces fit together snug, the blade becomes perfectly aligned to head, and the design has a nice flow to it.  The handle is suppose to be short for this type of razor, but I&#x27;ve found that I get the most control the closer to the blades I hold it.  The handle in this area has a nice little flange to grip between two fingers and a thumb, so someone was thinking when they designed this.  The black handle is $10 cheaper than the chrome handle, but the black lacquer feels nice and smooth, and the handle still has a nice heft to it.  The chrome handle looks nice, and if you can afford it you should probably get it, but it makes absolutely no difference in the shave quality, so I suggest putting that $10 towards some good shave creme or blades instead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this razor: on close inspection there&#x27;s a bit of burr on the corner-edge of the head piece.  This tiny bit of metal has been chromed over, so it&#x27;s not sharp, but I can feel it against my skin when I shave and it&#x27;s a like a tiny, tiny annoyance in an otherwise perfect razor.  How this passed inspection I do not know!  I think I may take a tiny file to it to see what can be done - I can&#x27;t RMA it because then I&#x27;ll be without a razor!  This was not enough to dock a star.  Maybe 1/16th of a star?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This provides a VERY close shave!  It leaves my skin feeling smoother than the disposable razors I wasted a ton of money on, too.  I nicked myself a few times the first couple of times I shaved with it, but apparently your skin needs to become acclimated to it because now I don&#x27;t cut myself any longer and my skin feels better.  Grown-in hairs have disappeared nearly completely, in only 5 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else?  Oh!  Do NOT attempt to shave against-the-grain with this on your first time using a double-edge razor!  Like I said before you&#x27;ll need to acclimate your skin to using this type of blade against it, and beside that you&#x27;ll need a little practice with the angle before attempting.  Furthermore, some people like to re-lather and shave in multiple angles - the effectiveness of this probably depends on your skin type - I found that one pass of the razor cuts about 99% of all the hairs - an extra, small, careful pass in problem areas is enough to get the rest without re-lathering.</li>
            <li> I like this more than my Merkur long razor.  This one has a nicer feeling and more comfortable handle than the Merkur.  Also seems to fit better with the razors I found.  The Merkur works best with a safety razor that is very slightly larger than some cheap brands.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor off of a recommendation for a first timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it has been quite the experience and I&#x27;m loving this razor! I purchased a blade sampler pack that I have been using in conjunction with this and highly recommend that over buying a pack of 100 blade if you&#x27;re just starting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue with wet shaving, and I&#x27;m looking forward to trying other razors by Edwin Jagger!</li>
            <li> Like many others, I got sick and tired of buying low quality and overpriced disposable blades, but still preferred shaving with a blade as opposed to an electric shaver.  That being said, I was about to upgrade my electric shaver when I first started reading reviews about old school double edge safety razors and decided to hold off on the new electric.  Glad I did.  After several weeks of taking my time to make a decision, I went with the Edwin Jagger De86bl and at this point have no complaints.  Everything about it seems high quality and built to last.  Now, as I&#x27;m fairly new to shaving with a DE safety razor, I did have some concerns and questions.  Here&#x27;s a kind of mini FAQ I put together based on my own concerns:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m concerned I&#x27;ll slice up my face with one of these things.  Will I have to be super careful compared to using, say, a Mach 3?&lt;br /&gt;-No!  It&#x27;s not a straight razor and they do call it a safety razor for a reason.  I&#x27;ve had no more or less nicks than with the Mach 3 which is what I previously used.  That being said, yes, you do have to use a bit more finesse than with modern disposable blades and you can&#x27;t just \\&quot;slam\\&quot; this kind of razor against your face the same way either.  Before purchasing, I watched a few \\&quot;how to\\&quot; YouTube videos which were pretty valuable to help start off right.  Like most experienced people say, let the weight of the razor do the work -- not so much pressure is needed as with the disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Edwin Jagger DE razor look really nice, but won&#x27;t the smooth handle be slippery?&lt;br /&gt;-Maybe only a bit slippery if you let your fingers and the handle get wet.  Keep your fingers and the handle dry (not hard to do) and your grip will not be a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with this safety razor started out fine the first several weeks, but now I&#x27;m getting more cuts and nicks!&lt;br /&gt;-You may have gotten over confident with your handling of the razor and forgotten to let the weight of the razor do the work and/or shaving too fast.  Back off on the pressure and take your time.&lt;br /&gt;-Change the blade.  Remember one of the great benefits of going this route -- the blades are cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All these YouTube videos talk about doing multi-passes and how long you should work up the lather with the shaving soap -- is shaving going to take forever now?&lt;br /&gt;-No, not forever.  It will probably take most people longer, yes, but I find the process kind of relaxing and the extra time isn&#x27;t that much.  Besides, the number of passes is up to you and your individual \\&quot;beard management\\&quot; needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, very happy with this product.  I also recommend the Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury Shave Set, which I ordered along with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your s(h)avings.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a modern classic known for mild, smooth shaves. This variant of the DE89 I got because I prefer the black handle. Anyone new to DE shaving would do well to consider this piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat-- the it primarily made of zinc and plastic. The zinc is not strong, and if it is dropped, you will break off the head at the threaded portion. Don&#x27;t drop it, and it will last.</li>
            <li> Very nice looking, very nice balance, just right agressive-ness so I don&#x27;t irritate my face. Nice clean smooth shave every time.. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent DE razor. I bought it over a month ago, and had some very good shaves with it. Have been trying out some different blades, and so far the Astra&#x27;s are giving me the best results, but I have to yet try out a really sharp Feather - on my list to try. I am switching between this and Pearl SBF-15 Twist to Open which I also purchased recently. The Pearl is much more aggressive, but doesn&#x27;t necessaily give me a better shave. I do like the longer handle though, but I have had a few nicks while shaving, which doesn&#x27;t happen with any of the other razors I have used so far (cheap no-brand Chinese model, Parker 96R, EJ, BB Long Handled Razor). The Edwin Jagger is the more gentle of the 2 I keep in rotation, but it still gives me a clean shave. Well recommended.</li>
            <li> Like many of the reviewers here, I got into DE shaving to save on cost of razor blades.  The quality of this razor is unquestionable.  The finish is like a precision surgical instrument.  The weight seems balanced once you realize the importance of that while shaving.  I was a little concerned with the length of the handle when I first saw it.  I realized, after using it a few times, that any more handle would throw the balance off and be burdensome in the hand.  A DE razor isn&#x27;t held in the same manner as a cartridge style.  While it is true that a DE razor will require more time and a learned hand, the results are just as satisfying as that of any of the newest disposable cartridge razors out there.  I do find that it takes about 3 passes to get as close of a shave as my Gillette Fusion, I don&#x27;t believe anyone will dispute this.  Your initial investment will be higher but these items are to be considered a lifetime investment.  I have found that the Derby Extra blades are acceptable for my beard, there may be better ones out there, but for the price (currently $0.14 ea), I can just change the blades more often.  Bottom Line:  If you commit to DE shaving, this is the last razor you will ever have to buy.</li>
            <li> I had been shopping around for a long time, researching different double edge razors. I kept coming back to this one, so finally I jumped on it. So far, with the Derby blades, I have been getting the best shaves of my life without the irritation other disposable razors leave. For a long time, I had been using the 3,4,5,6 blade gillete fusions and shicks, thinking that I would get a better shave. Nothing, besides maybe a straight razor, will give you a better shave. This Edwin Jagger is top notch, and under priced. It is a very nice razor, and I hope it lasts me for years to come. My only criticism is that the blade changes are not quite as \\&quot;convenient.\\&quot; Its not hard or time consuming, I just wish it were a little faster and easier.</li>
            <li> I received my Edwin Jagger de86bl a few days back and so far I have quite a positive impression about it. This is the first time that I was shaving with a double edged razor and hence was expecting a lot of knicks after my shave. Surprisingly not a single cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not a very aggressive razor, and is very smooth. The shave was not as close as I expected it to be, however that could be attributed to my technique rather than the shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside however I found the handle a bit slippery with wet hands. However that not really a major flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its quite a beautiful razor, very elegant and really well crafted. Having butter fingers I dropped it twice today, however thankfully the construction is quite simple and solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it looks beautiful, offers a close, smooth and painless shave and definitely value for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003LW4LJK Edwin Jagger De86bl Faux Ebony Double Edge Safety Razor, Black]]</li>
            <li> First time using this kind of shaver and from the very start was completely impressed by the ease and closeness of the shave.  It included Derby razors which I recommend highly.  I would recommend to anyone who wants a close shave with ease and in the end save lots of money from not spending more for the plastic shavers</li>
            <li> Pay the extra money for the version with the grip on the handle—the ebony handle gets really slippery when it&#x27;s wet. The razor-changing action is not as nice as the Merkur #34C. The Jagger has a smaller head than the Merkur, however, so I am able to get more of the hairs underneath my nose without slicing my face up.</li>
            <li> The Jagger shaving heads are excellent and this razor looks very classy but the slickness of the handle is a deal killer for me.  I eventually went with a WSP El Grande, which appears to me to be exactly the same config, but has a diamond knurled handle which inspires more confidence when you shave.  I would buy a Jagger razor but would pick one with the rubber handle or one with some pattern on the handle.  The Kelvin would be a good choice.</li>
            <li> Great razor, just started with the safety razor style, and didn&#x27;t take long to get used to. Free blades are a nice bonus!</li>
            <li> I was in the market for my first double edge safety razor, and based on reviews and suggestion on various sites, and after looking at a number of cheaper alternatives, I settled on the De86.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being as much as twice as expensive as some cheaper options, the De86 is still relatively inexpensive as far as double edge razors go. More importantly, it does not suffer from the quality control issues that plague less expensive razors.  As many have commented, the build quality of the Edwin Jagger razors is superb.  The head attaches securely to the handle, and the blade centers itself perfectly every time. This has made it an excellent choice for learning as the fool-proof blade loading allows me to concentrate on my technique without worrying about razor setup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I also considered a couple of the similarly priced Merkur razors, most reviews I read said that these were fairly similar performing razors, so the final decision came down to appearance. In the end I chose the De86bl because I like the look of the black and chrome better.</li>
            <li> It is my first double edge razor after 20 years of shaving with Gillette, it is beautiful I&#x27;m still improving my skills but the result is good though it cost me more time every morning.</li>
            <li> I upgraded to this razor from my consignment store acquired 1955 Gillette Super Speed. Compared to the SS it is much heavier at the head and there is a bit more gap between the blade and the safety bar. Coupled together with a thick lather, a mild blade (Derby), and proper technique this razor will offer a very close shave with no irritation. So far, I have not experienced any cuts since I made the switch. The plating appears very heavily applied and the plastic handle feels very solid. The price is unbeatable for this level of quality, and I would definitely recommend this product to those just getting into traditional wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Razor looks good came with no damage. Derby s it came with r good but I needed something   Sharper, buying sample pack of blades now</li>
            <li> After going thru reviews of razors from multiple manufacturers, settled on this razor.  Form me the handle was a bit too short. My hands started to cramp after few minutes.  May be it was the blade(the ones that came with the razor) I used, but I had to do multiple passes on my face to get a close shave as I did with my triple blade shaver.  Also I would prefer to have a butterfly type razor for ease of cleaning and changing the blades. It becomes a major chore to un-screw the handle to whipe clean and dry the razor parts for the next use.    I&#x27;ll try till I use up all of my remaining free blades and decide on my next course of action.</li>
            <li> This razor trumps any commercially available cartridge razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. Robust and sturdy, chrome looks amazing and the shave is incredible.</li>
            <li> When I was ready to graduate from my Weishi twist to open razor, I read extensively and decided to try this baby out. Man what a great razor! Shaves as great as it looks. Great weight and balance, doesn&#x27;t slip, even with the smooth handle. Middilingly aggressive without being overly so. I love the three piece design, and the black and chrome really look elegant. Super high quality razor that will last a lifetime,without breaking the bank!</li>
            <li> I love this razor. Granted, it&#x27;s my first safety razor. But it&#x27;s great. The ebony grip could use some texture. My next razor withh probably be a knurled shaft grip. This is just too slippery when it gets wet/foamy.</li>
            <li> I decided I had enough razor burns n bumps from the disposables and wanted to make the switch to something that caused me less issues.  The craftsmanship of this razor is beautiful and it fits very well in my hand and is well weighted (no pushing necessary).  This is a good beginners razor as I had just a few nicks on my second shave.  The first time using this I was nick free.  I only got nicked because I was not as careful the second shave, because the first was so successful.  I would also advise that if you have thick whiskers you should use the Derby razors only once as the tend to have a bit of drag after that.&lt;br /&gt;Finally I am already seeing a fading in the unsightly razor burns I have had for so many years.  All in all a great razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this is a very good exception. We all have been in that shave isle at your local retail store, looking for a less than decent cartridge to replace the one in our (and currently my former) Gillette Fusion razor. The first thing we try to look for is value, and understandably so because let&#x27;s face it.. a 4 pack of cartridges can run you a good $20 if you are lucky. One night I saw that &amp;#34;Micro-touch One&amp;#34; commercial with Rick from Pawn Star&#x27;s advertising an old school razor. This sparked enough interest for me to give DE safety razor shaving a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I am new to the safety razor shaving community and by no means can speak purely from dog years of experience*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;After doing my research and making a bad purchase, I finally narrowed my choice to this beautiful DE Safety Razor. The reason I picked this razor as opposed to the Edwin Jagger DE89 was simply because it was cheaper, and also it has a black handle which personally I like better than just a cold all-metal handle. Even though this was a cheaper Edwin Jagger model, it surpassed all of my expectations. I still have to perfect my technique but this is definitely the razor for beginners. Try to find a razor blade that works with your skin pair it with this razor for an experience you will only look forward too every morning (and yes I actually enjoy shaving every morning now) Happy Shaving!</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about making a change to a safety razor, but I was more concerned about the price of cartridge razors.    I expected to be able to get by, but the shave is smoother and less irritating.  I am really quite blown away.  This is the only safety razor that I have used, so I cannot compare the Edwin Jagger head to any other brand.  From personal experience, I believe this is a excellent razor.  I am a beginner and had no trouble getting an extremely smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Wow, when I first pulled this razor out of its box, I was blown away by how good looking it was. It&#x27;s honestly gorgeous. It&#x27;s not really evident in the pictures but this thing has a large and very well-weighted head. It&#x27;s an extremely quality razor, it could EASILY sell for double its asking price. I own a Merkur 180, a Parker 96R, and this razor, and this razor is definitely the best.  You will not be disappointed if you order this, but you might be hesitant to actually use it because it is so good looking. I know I was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice safety razor after my father&#x27;s 30 old butterfly Gillette was lost. This is absolutely beautiful and exactly what I was looking for. Has the quality that feels like it would last for many years. The black handle is a nice touch and the balance is perfect. The Derby razors it came with cut sharp. Don&#x27;t have anything negative to say really. Hoping it will serve for many years.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE and my first razor for wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I love how the razor feels, paired with a good blade and on my first try I didn&#x27;t even nick myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother using the blades that comes with the razor. That was the only blade which I find not sharp enough, and with some extra push, I cut myself.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a really great razor.  No frills but does the job.  I usually shave in the shower and I don&#x27;t find that this razor slips or clogs.</li>
            <li> Like the razor, but wish the corners were rounded.  They scrape your face when going over concave parts like neck near near your chin.</li>
            <li> This was my first modern double edge safety razor.  I found the razor to be nicely balanced.  I was a little nervous at first with the smooth faux ebony handle, but these fears were unfounded as I have not slipped with it once, even with wet hands.  I used to dread shaving and skipped it as much as possible, but with this one, I actually enjoy shaving with it.</li>
            <li> The razor is great and feels well constructed. The only reason I am not giving it 5 starts is the handle is a little shorter than ideal but otherwise perfect. The razor is well weighted and the blades that come with it are functional if a little un aggressive (not so great on more than a couple of days growth). This is my first safety razor and I am not going back to my old one!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually post reviews, but I have been shopping on Amazon for many years and have only good things to say about their customer service. In this case, I did not not have to get Amazon involved. I purchase the Edwin Jagger DE86BL razor in late February and was very happy with the quality and feel of their product. it gives a very close shave and has enough heft to appreciate how well it is made. Unfortunately, a few weeks after receiving it I dropped it on my sink. The head snapped off, leaving part of the screw buried inside the handle. After emailing the manufacturer (in the UK) and including a photo, nothing happened for a few days. So I called them directly, and they could not have been more courteous. They shipped me a brand new replacement razor within a week.</li>
            <li> This is my third Edwin Jagger DE. Purchased this as a backup  for my other (I dropped first one on very hard floor from some height and I had to replace it.) This company knows how to make fine razors. I doubt I will ever purchase a DE from anyone else!</li>
            <li> This razor&#x27;s handle is slick when wet, and a little hard to hold. (Most likely ABS.) Coating the handle in hot glue will make it easier to hold and less frustrating when soapy. (Sugru or silicone will work. Standard glue not recommended.) It doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy, but it&#x27;s not durable: I flew with this razor in an outside pocket of my luggage, and the handle cracked. It also takes a little care to screw the head onto the body, because the threads don&#x27;t line up easily, and this could lead to a ruined razor with stripped threads if you don&#x27;t pay attention to what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, I like the shape/tolerances of the head. Blades fit well, and it&#x27;s easier to get them centered properly than in my Mercur razor. The Edwin Jagger razor is also less aggressive: if I pass the razor down my cheek after the stubble is mostly gone, I often don&#x27;t even feel the blade. The trade-offs are that it&#x27;s more likely to clog, and it&#x27;s not good for shaving other body parts.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome razor. The quality is perfect &amp; it looks great too. Closest shave I have ever had with the exception of a straight razor shave at the barbers. Worth the investment &amp; I will save big money over time as the razors are so much cheaper then the 3,4 &amp; 5 blade razor heads</li>
            <li> Super quality, close shaves, they also sent 5 Derby blades.  Highly recommended.  I also have a Merkur 41 comb DE, this seems to shave more closely without being too aggressive.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift so I can&#x27;t comment as to it&#x27;s specific functionality. That being said, my buddy is very very happy with it. He&#x27;s a noob, so I take it with a grain of salt, but he hasn&#x27;t reported any issues with it.</li>
            <li> I bought an EJ prior to shaving using straights and for the most part I was completely happy shaving using it. The chrome finish was great and the construction of the whole razor feels solid and not cheap. The blades that come with it too are super sharp and I was able to get a close shave and good finish everytime. The only reason why I do not give it it&#x27;s full rating is because of two things. The handle is a bit too short for me. That does cause me a bit of hand fatigue while doing a 3 pass: -0.5 star and finally the faux ebony can be quite slippery when you are holding it with wet hands: -0.5 star&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was to ever get another safety razor, I would get one with a longer handle and definitely something else besides faux ebony!</li>
            <li> If looks could kill that this thing would be a beast. Normally I just use a gillette mach 3 razor but hey i like to try new things. I gave this baby a whirl and what i got in return were several cuts. I am really careful when shaving since i don&#x27;t want to harm my skin but this thing made me bleed in 3 spots. I think it&#x27;s because the blade doesn&#x27;t give you a very close shave that you end up going over 3-4 times and irritate your skin like crazy. afterwards my face felt like fire. i wish i could return this thing but i cant. not sure what ill do with it now.</li>
            <li> I get a great shave with this razor every day. I like the way it comes apart for a quick cleaning. After shaving I take it apart and put the blade out of the way after drying it, then I rince and dry the three parts of the razor and leave out for a good air dry. Later on I&#x27;ll put the blade back in and the razor back together and hang it on the stand, it looks to good on the counter to put away. As always with Amazon quick and free shipping.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a great DE razor this is a great buy. Has good weight, and very well made. You wont be sorry!</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness! Get this now. There&#x27;s no issue with handle. It&#x27;s weighty, solid, and finely crafted. There&#x27;s no issue with slippage. The balance point is that second ring down, under the head, between the chrome, and the black handle top. I held it around there, and is was absolutely luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it might be hard, or might accidentally hack-up my face, after reading all the tips (do that); but it was not, that different, from cartridges (to use), after-all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These (DE) things really do cut better, than multi-bladed marketing BS. ...Better cutting of stubble; but not cutting or dragging, or pulling of the (well prepped; very sensitive) skin! I can already tell; this is way closer, and yet far more gentle on my troublesome neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is beautiful. It&#x27;s a work of art. I wondered; if I might need to order a few, to get a good one. But no, it&#x27;s perfect. One of the best things is... it locks the blade in; perfectly and evenly, every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no problem, whatsoever; with the handle length. It seems longer in your hand. However, I could understand; if someone just wanted a really long handle. I just don&#x27;t, and I thought perhaps, I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had worried, this black accented handle would be dull, or cheap plastic, and no. it&#x27;s absolutely beautiful. I also bought a black, and chrome handled, Silvertip badger brush; as a bit of a splurge (for me), and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will they be heirlooms? Probably. Go for it! (No affiliation with the sellers)</li>
            <li> I think this is a very good razor. It is well manufactured and is pleasing to the eye. I like that it has a bit of weight to it and it cleans very easily. My only complaints are that at times it can get a bit slippery at times and I find the handle to be a bit small. But despite these issues I still gave it four stars because the downsides are small.</li>
            <li> Nice, shiny and elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing it with disposable razors is a bit on the heavy side, but is a weight that feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> This is my first double razor. The razor sample that it comes with are pretty good as well but also try Feather razors. Those are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I like it but, it&#x27;s not a miraculous solution. I am slender and have a more contoured face and my beard grows straight out not curly, my mustache lays down and no matter how much I shave, stretch or change shaving direction I still have stubble. Everyone is different. The more I try to get the stubble off, the more cuts I get, usually under my nose, on my chin, or on my Adam&#x27;s apple so, I touch up those areas with a stick and using the sticks this way last forever. I just can&#x27;t get the Edwin Jagger to shave right up to my nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Razor blades are cheaper than stick razors.&lt;br /&gt;Short handle is easier to pack and takes up less room on my shower shelf when laying down.&lt;br /&gt;Short handle does not affect my grip or use.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to change blades; easily tightening and loosening handle.&lt;br /&gt;Nice finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Not a perfect shaving solution, just cheaper than sticks, like the Gillette Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;I receive more cuts with this razor than sticks.&lt;br /&gt;No matter the angle or how many passes my beard always stubble, just my face I guess.&lt;br /&gt;Slick handle is slippery in the shower only with soapy hands. Rinsed hands are no problem.&lt;br /&gt;I dropped it in the shower and the head broke off but, I was able to drill a hole and add a stainless screw.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t have adjustable blade angles. (I want to try the adjustable one)</li>
            <li> The handle is smaller than I expected but it works just fine.  It is very attractive and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very classy look and great quality.  A razor I hope to pass down to my son.</li>
            <li> I love old DE razors and have a few that are over 50 years old that still look and perform perfect but like I said they are old but work flawlessly with a variety of blades. I did a few searches and found the German brands too expensive and a little quirky. Found this Edwin Jagger and debated over a few models from before picking this one. This razor is heavy and the finish is flawless. Tried a few types of blades and found that with this razor they were too aggressive ... Was kind of disappointed at first then I tried my go to blade the Wilkinson Sword and lightened up on the pressure and WOW what a shave. The only thing that is a little annoying is the smooth handle and this could be a problem only due to the use of knurled handle DE razors for years and bad habits it has produced. The handle can become slippery causing your control to suffer a bit but found that issue can be minimized by just not dipping the entire razor into the rinse water and not getting shaving cream on the handle during the shaving process.</li>
            <li> Very nice razor.  It&#x27;s a more milder shave.  It&#x27;s a 3 piece that works very well.  I liked to weight very much, which is just a tad on the heavier side..</li>
            <li> I bought this razor along with a Parker to shave my head witth to move from using a straight razor. I paired it with feather blades and it does its job very smoothly, just glides right over. Coming from 20 years of using a straight razor this is definately faster and does it with far fewer nicks. Build quality is good, I like the fact that it comes apart completely rather than using the butterfly opening of the parker. This makes it easier to clean and almost foolproof to put the blades in without bending them.  I would highly recomend this razor to anyone as a matter a fact I bought a second one for a friend for his birthday and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Got tired of always having a dull razor (or a throw-away) in the house so I ordered this with lots of blades! With all the blades takes up less space than my more modern razors.  Gives a great shave because I always have a sharp blade.  I coupled this with a mug of soap and brush from Wal-Mart and get great shaves for lots less.</li>
            <li> When I first received the item, the first thing I noticed was the box. Box was classy and gave the feeling of luxury. When I first held this razor in my hand I was blown away by the chrome and black. Good weight and well balanced.</li>
            <li> Was hesitant in spending to upgrade my DE razor but decide to give it a shot and this shaver is simply amazing! It&#x27;s weight is good and i don&#x27;t find it that slippery when my hands are wet. The chrome finish is really slick and good looking. An excellent choice if you&#x27;re thinking of getting this as your first shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only nuisance i feel would be the way to change the blades.It&#x27;s not difficult but some users may find it meddlesome after a while.</li>
            <li> I researched for many days before purchasing this Jagger DE Safety Razor. I must say that for my first safety razor, I thought I made the perfect choice! I found this razor to be the perfect weight and the shorter handle does really make it very maneuverable. The fit and finish looked absolutely perfect and the razor looked quite handsome with the Badger Brush and Clear Acrylic Stand that I purchased separately. I have used the Jagger now for the past three and a half weeks, loving every shave! (I tried Feather, Derby and Lord blades...and the Lord blades are my favorite!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed however to report that today while rinsing my razor under very hot water while shaving, I noticed a tiny little shard of chrome coming off from the side. I rinsed it again, and a very large (finger-nail sized) piece of the chrome plating fell off the top edge of the razor!! This exposed the copper beneath and is very unfortunate because otherwise I loved this razor. I am afraid to purchase another or recommend this product to anyone. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome. I love it. Another gift I got from my wife. She&#x27;s awesome for buying me this awesome gift.</li>
            <li> This razor is very comfortable in the hand and while shaving. The weight feels great in the hand and ensures a smooth shaving experience every time. It takes a little getting used to at first, but it is a quality product.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple months of learning how to shave with a DE.  This is my first one.  Now that I have the hang of it, it seems to be a good one, that is, it does its job.  Going from regular razors, my tendency was to press the blade into my face so I thought it was a bad razor at first.  You just like let it glide across and let the blade just barely touch you and the hair comes off.  I use EVOO instead of shaving cream.  Just shower, rub oil on and use hot water.  Hair comes right off now.  A good bonus is I have like 5 years worth of replacement blades.  Yay!</li>
            <li> I have had this a few months and the plating is already dulling and wearing off.  I shave 1-2x a week and rinse it off and put it on a stand to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not even a great value nor a great shaver.  If i had to do it again (eventually i will) i would have bought an adjustable or that extremely aggressive razor.  It turns out that super aggressive razor used with duller blades works amazing!</li>
            <li> I recently decided to switch to a double-edge safety razor, and this was one of the most highly recommended razors in the &amp;#34;budget&amp;#34; price range. And it&#x27;s excellent. I don&#x27;t have (and haven&#x27;t used) any others to really give a fair comparison. The handle is much shorter than I expected (~3.25&amp;#34;), but I believe that&#x27;s very common for these types of razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is actually three pieces: The handle, and &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; piece, and the main head piece (no idea what the actual terms for these are). The handle unscrews from the head and allows you to sandwich the blade in between the two head pieces. You&#x27;re going to want to be careful when unscrewing this that you don&#x27;t cut yourself. But this really goes with any part of shaving using double-edge razor. .I only mention it because some people may prefer a razor with a different style of inserting the blade itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one issue I&#x27;ve had is that I noticed that rather quickly the chrome began to chip off of the head (the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; piece in the middle). I&#x27;m going to contact Edwin Jagger about this, as I&#x27;ve heard they are extremely helpful and responsive and should replace this piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally did not like the Derby blades that were included. I found I prefer a much sharper blade (Feathers, Gillette SharpEdge, etc). I don&#x27;t think this should dissuade any one from buying this razor, however, since the blades themselves are really a personal preference each person has to make for themselves.</li>
            <li> This was my first double edge razor and I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Truth be told I read a lot of articles before hand and I was able to use this razor the day it arrived with less razor burn than I was getting with my Gillette Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This specific razor was very comfortable as a few members on Reddit had mentioned. I&#x27;m not planning on going back any time soon.</li>
            <li> I own 4 DE razors...2 Edwin Jagger razors of which this is my favorite. The black and chrome is a combination you&#x27;ll appreciate even if you don&#x27;t ride a black Harley. The price is excellent. The closed head razor is superb. I have used different blades in it and with the closed head, I had no learning curve to get used to the shave...even with the notoriously sharp Feathers. I have a light to medium beard. I need to shave every day, but it is not heavy. One or sometimes two passes and I&#x27;m done shaving. This razor is amazing. I have a styptic pencil and have not even needed to use it. The quality of the chrome looks like this razor should be sold in a jewelry store.</li>
            <li> I got into double edge shaving using a cheapie no-name razor I bought in Ecuador. Compared to that one, this EJ razor is far milder in terms of irritation, bumps, cuts, etc. but gives a nice even shave. With one pass I can get a great shave, two or more passes will get close to perfectly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is excellent. A few reviewers commented they are concerned about the threads on the handle that screw into the head stripping or breaking. These razors are not meant to be tightened too much - just tighten it until it is snug. If you do this, there should be no issues with the threads failing on the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t ever used a double edge razor, this is a great one to start on.</li>
            <li> Not Even in the Sink!!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this razor in Dec of 13 and dropped it into the sink as I was shaving form no more than 2 feet high. The head broke off at the screw and I was wondering if there is any kind of warranty on it, this is a metal heavy razor and i didn&#x27;t think it was so delicate.&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to the company and got no answer so far...&lt;br /&gt;Really, this is advertised as the finest hand made razor made in England by craftsmen. Maybe the guy who made mine was on vacation in china and had a few too many pints that day.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money, spend a little more on another brand</li>
            <li> I just received mine and just as I was preparing to unscrew it&#x27;s head from the handle and start using it, I found that I simply can&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the factory this factory, this shaver was screwed together so tightly that it simply refuses to budge no matter how hard I tried to twist it open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll proceed to put it in a vice grip and see if I have better luck, but Edwin Jagger -- come on! This is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I would never return to any multiple blade razor again. This gives a fast quick shave. Feels great in the hand.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price, high quality product and quick delivery. Overall I&#x27;m rather happy with the performance of this razor so far, and it seems to hold up to long term shaving as well due to robust construction.</li>
            <li> High quality blade for a beginner to use to get started in wet shaving. Love it.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 19yr old son and he loves it. Now He uses the same type razor as his Dad and GrandFather. Much closer shave than multi blade razors.</li>
            <li> Very nicely made razor, perfect blade alignment.  Shaving with it is a pleasure, the handle was shorter than I expected but as it turns out this wasn&#x27;t an issue as the balance is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that the &amp;#34;faux ebony&amp;#34; handle might look cheap but as it turns out both the razor and handle are very well polished, the fit and finish is great and overall it has a nice timeless look.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor, it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> Be very careful when changing the blades. I use a towel to grip the ends of the head and twist it off, but once I slipped and cut my thumb very deeply.&lt;br /&gt;Once you get used to shaving with this thing, though, you will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> Impressively well built and delivers an excellent shave.  As sturdy and smart looking as DE razors two or more times the price.  I initially worried that the smooth handle would prove slippery, but so far I&#x27;ve had no problem with the grip.</li>
            <li> It has been exactly what I wanted.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about the &amp;#34;faux ebony&amp;#34; handle but it is attractive and is not especially slippery.  Good heft and the threads and fit of the machined parts seems high quality.  Should last a LONG time. So far I have only used the Derby extras (like those supplied) and Wilkinson Sword blades.  With proper lubrication the razor and either of these blades does not seem excessively aggressive.  I&#x27;ve gotten a few nicks and razor bumps when experimenting with cross or against the grain shaving to see how close I can get.  The quickest and closest shave is two quick passes in alternating directions rather than laboring with a single aggressive pass. It is far less expensive and I prefer the feel and results to the &amp;#34;super - mach - quad&amp;#34; yada yada I was caught in.  Guess I&#x27;m just more old-school.</li>
            <li> Bought for the boyfriend because he&#x27;s always wanted an old school safety razor. Was between the Merkur and Edwin Jagger, liked the handle on this one. Works like a charm and came with 5 Derby razors. I sometimes steal it to shave my legs, closer shave than a cartridge 5-blade razor and replacement blades for this are dirt cheap.</li>
            <li> Uses the Muhle shave head and is of excellent quality. The chrome and black gives it a nice classy look.</li>
            <li> Got into DE shaving as a way to reduce skin irritation and bumps, and potentially save money. Settled on this razor because it seemed the best overall value (along with the Merkur of similar price), and it looked cool. The blades that it comes with are decent, good for 3-5 shaves depending on your beard growth rate and thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving took some getting used to; the first time I tried, I nicked my neck up pretty badly and had terrible razor burn. After about a week, however, I was shaving effortlessly and naturally and achieving great results. No more nicks, no more razor bumps, no more irritation, no more ingrown hairs. The only caveat is that shaving with this takes longer. Before, I could shave in about five minutes. Now, it takes me at least ten, maybe seven if I&#x27;m rushing and doing only two passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering DE shaving, give this a whirl. It costs about as much as a pack of Gillette Fusion blades, lasts longer, and is more eco-friendly considering its parts are recyclable. Razors go into a mini Altoids tin and when that&#x27;s full, to the recycling bin. When you get used to wet shaving, this delivers a closer and more comfortable shave than any disposable I&#x27;ve yet used.</li>
            <li> like cutting butter or shaving ice. i dont cut myself when i touch my face anymore. gives a pleasant feeling of cleanliness afterwards.</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor when it was on sale, it was almost 50% off so I jumped at the opportunity to order it. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try using a safety razor for a while now. Cartridge razors always disappointed me, there was always a small patch of fuzz that I just couldn&#x27;t get without making one too many passes with the old gillette, resulting in painful cuts and razor burn. So after receiving this razor from UPS I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. There is a sense of class that comes with this razor. The box looks fancy and the razor itself is sexy. I imagined it being bigger, its smaller than the old cartridge razor I&#x27;m used to. That said the small size isn&#x27;t a problem for me. I was able to comfortably grip it and glide it along my face. And what a smooth, wonderful glide it was. I&#x27;m still working on finding the right amount of lather (Proraso shaving cream), but for a first attempt I still got a good shave. One of my problem areas when shaving are my cheeks, I could never seem to get them as smooth as I&#x27;d like, but after a couple passes with this, my cheeks are silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That alone warrants a 5 star for me. The feeling of having such control and precision with a razor is incredible. I look forward to many shaves. Now the next rabbit hole to jump down is the aftershave, pre and post-shave balm-rabbit hole.</li>
            <li> This razor is a fine piece.  Well made and a pleasure to use, as well as being aesthetically pleasing.  However, it is a slightly aggressive razor, so while I would recommend it highly, I would not recommend it as a &amp;#34;first razor&amp;#34; for someone new to double edge razor shaving.  It fits well in the hand and is very responsive.  It is also a very good value for the price.  I pair this with Astra blades and it works really well for me.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my nephew - he was very happy to get it.  It was packaged well and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> It shaves very well, mild but thorough.  Fit and finish are top notch.  I would recommend EJ&#x27;s for all levels of shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> beautiful and well made, performs well. if I was to purchase again, I would get a model with a little better grip to it. not a big issue, just make sure the soap is off your hand.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. I had a cheap DE razor before it and am glad I got this. It&#x27;s got a good weight to it and is easy to clean and change the blades. I have recommended this razor to everyone that has asked me.</li>
            <li> I was reveiwing a new double edge shaver to replace the shavers I have now. At first I saw that it was a short handle razor and was possibly thinking of returning. Once I used it, I fell in love with it. It was well balance that when I first shaved I was not nicked or cut like I have been before with other DE shavers. The design is simple and clean up is easy. I even get a closer shave every time I use this razor. I even I got a start up of 5 DE blades with my shaver. Even today I still use this shaver and got rid of my fusion razor.</li>
            <li> Good classic design.  Extra mild razor which is a great gift for new wet shavers.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Merkur 34 razor for about 3 years now. Just purchased this new Edwin Jagger De86bl razor and i live it. The razor may be a bit lighter that my Merkur but not by much. This razor seems to have a little finer plating and finish than the Merkur. Love the Ebony handle. I know it comes with a stainless handle also, but l like to look of the ebony. The jury is out as to which will ultimately be my favorite, but for now I&#x27;m using the Jagger and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. It is stylish, it has a good weight and it&#x27;s inexpensive. Do yourself a good service and start shaving with a safety razor, you&#x27;ll get a better shave and it&#x27;s cheaper in the long run.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m wasting less plastic, shaving closer, and haven&#x27;t slit my throat by accident yet.</li>
            <li> This was my first try with a modern/old fashioned safety razor. I always have had problems with ingrown hairs, especially on my neck area and could shave only twice a week or I would break out terribly. This is using disposable razors, 5 blade razors, electric razors, all the standard stuff.&lt;br /&gt;So I got this bad boy and I love it. It sails thru my whiskers better than anything I have used before, and I have had much less irritation. I can now shave every two days without breaking out. I have had a few little nicks, just try to use very little pressure and a proper angle to avoid that.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried the plastic handle would be too light but it&#x27;s nice and solid I love the heft and build quality.</li>
            <li> I watched many videos before I chose my first DE razor and I&#x27;m glad I did my research.  Not only is it beautiful but performs great as well.  I give it one less star only because I wish I got the handle with knurling for some extra grip when my hands are wet.</li>
            <li> pros&lt;br /&gt;good shave&lt;br /&gt;has som weight to it&lt;br /&gt;easy enough to change blades&lt;br /&gt;looks nice by the sink&lt;br /&gt;well made&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons&lt;br /&gt;slipery handle&lt;br /&gt;dose not make food&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thoughts&lt;br /&gt;would like a longer handle on it or maybe a textured grip.  I hold the razor all the way up on the handle under the razor head for stability.  this razor works well I can get a shave as closeas if not a bit better than my mach 3 ($$$) takes sum time to get used to it as it requiers a bit mor dextarity and understanding of how your hair grows on your face.  still geting used to my neck after a few weeks but still just as good as my mach 3. I use soap and a brush, waay better than foam in a can no mater what you shave with.  Good product worth the money just wish it had a more secure grip when wet with eather a longer handle and or textured grip and it comes with blades +1</li>
            <li> I love this DE razor. My first one broke and I was looking to get a slight upgrade and this fit the bill perfectly. The handle is a little on the short side, but I got used to it fairly quickly. Seems very heavy and solid. Should last a long time!</li>
            <li> This is my first double edged razor. My dad had one when I was a little kid and I cut my face with it. I was about 3 years old. After about 38 years later, I thought I&#x27;d give it a second chance. I&#x27;ve watched youtube videos, read reviews about it and so I finally just nutted up and did it. What have I been missing all these years? It&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s easy and I never cut my face. This razor is top of the line. I can&#x27;t see going to anything lesser. Well, unless I was just curious on how other razors compared. If you&#x27;re on the fence on getting one, just get it and give it a whirl. Don&#x27;t press hard. Use short strokes at first. Let the blade do most of the work. You&#x27;ll get the hang of it the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor was so good that I ended up getting them as presents to my bestman and groomsmen. I had their initials engraved. Nice gift!</li>
            <li> love the feel of the razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with it a couple of times now and I&#x27;ll have to say that it&#x27;s performing flawlessly. It&#x27;s billed as &amp;#34;Faux Ebony&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s really just a black smooth surface on the handle. There were a couple of reviews of the black portion cracking, but I can&#x27;t see how that would possibly happen. This is a razor, a safety razor no less, so there should be ZERO wear an tear from pressure. Their kids probably dropped it on the floor when they weren&#x27;t around. Same with the shearing of the threaded portion that the head attaches to. Don&#x27;t torque it down, it&#x27;s not an engine part. It&#x27;s really a great looking product and the angle it holds the razor is great and forgiving. I would buy this again in a heartbeat. Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, something that&#x27;s 10 times as expensive will not knock your socks off ten times more than this, it will only be marginally better. Also, this is the DE89 head on here, so all the great reviews that you see for the DE89 can be applied here, only with a black handle. I personally think this looks better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT (three years down the line): This thing is still doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, after I don&#x27;t know how many shaves. NO problems, no defects. Looks like new. Not really much else to say.</li>
            <li> I gave this razor to my husband for his birthday and he loves it.  He said it gave him a very smooth shave.  He did say, he wished the handle was longer but, it has a great weighty feel to it.  If, you are not afraid to use double edge, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Nice finish, solid razor. My first DE razor and it&#x27;s very smooth to shave with. Good weight too. Liking the Derby blades, but ordered others to try.</li>
            <li> Great razor fort a beginner. Medium aggressiveness with a nice chrome finish on the head. Cheaper than the regular EJ de89l with the same head, so it&#x27;s probably just as good. It&#x27;s made of pot metal, but at this price you&#x27;re hard pressed to find a good razor in a more durable material.</li>
            <li> I love DE safety razors. Great shave and value and this one is a work of art. Super high quality. You can tell a lot of attention went into the construction and design. I did a lot of research and am extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> After much reading on the subject of &#x27;First DE Razor&#x27; I dialed into the EJ DE89 based mostly on the quality, and desire for a milder DE shaver to start with. So far I am very happy with my choice, the black handle to offset all the chrome bits is very pleasing to the eye, and most importantly does not feel overly slick when wet, it may not be as grippy as a knurled handle, but I have had zero grip issues with the smooth handle. The 3 piece design is dead simple to takedown, and when loaded with a blade, an un-intimidating amount of blade peeks through either side. The razor is hefty in your hand, and using the weight of the razor with very little, or no pressure, is enough to get through all of my toughest stubble and growth (properly prepared face, and proraso green tub certainly helps), down to a smoothly shaved face after a few passes. I could see myself adding a more aggressive razor to my kit after I perfect my technique, but I don&#x27;t see myself ever getting rid of the EJ.</li>
            <li> At 35 I&#x27;m new to DE shaving.  The Derby blades that it came with worked great as a first timer! Very nice craftsmanship and you can&#x27;t beat the price for what you get.  I worried about the handle being slick but it wasn&#x27;t at all.  I would highly recommend to men looking to make the smart move to a safety razor.  I also got Edwin Jagger&#x27;s best badger brush because of the price and I&#x27;m just as happy with it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor. He has somewhat sensitive skin and has had no issues using this razor. His first couple of times using this razor did result in a few minor cuts, but that&#x27;s just because he was not used to this type of razor. He usually uses Gillete ProGlide and those types. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor. Great weight though slightly shorter than expected but not problematic at all. In fact I get the feeling that the shortness aids in proper technique.</li>
            <li> My first DE razor. It was either this or the Merkur, but the latter didn&#x27;t ship to Japan. It has a good heft and fits my hand well. Not only that, but it also looks cool, particularly when sitting in the bathroom with the black Edwin Jagger badger brush and a black ceramic shaving mug. Six months on, and moving to DE razors is still one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve made. My skin certainly thanks me for it (more so after the first few shaves, although none were terrible). I have been using this with Personna DE razor blades and have found it to be a great match for my skin. Next, I want to load it with the Feather blades.</li>
            <li> It has some weight on it, so you can control the direction of the shave better.&lt;br /&gt;Looks very nice, it has a nice finish.</li>
            <li> I had to buy this razor to see what the talk was all about. I am knew to wet shaving, but have been using the Popular Feather razor and like it. But this bad boy is the SH!#, I recommend this razor to anyone who is looking to step up to a new DE razor. It shaves really good. Can&#x27;t ask for nothing better especially for the price! Great seller as well.</li>
            <li> Pros: This razor was my first safety razor, and after I got over the initial fear of letting a bare razor touch my face, it worked great. Granted, you should always have enough fear to respect such a sharp tool, you should not be afraid to use it daily. It takes some getting used to from regular carts but after about 1 week I got a considerably better shave than any other I&#x27;ve had before, and it&#x27;s only got better since then (I&#x27;m sure the week was just me learning, others may make it to a great shave in much less time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I can&#x27;t think of anything I would change about this razor. It&#x27;s not super aggressive so maybe that might bug some people, but for beginners it&#x27;s great. It is also a 3 piece razor, meaning that you have to unscrew the whole head to put a new razor in. This isn&#x27;t a huge issue for me because I wanted a &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; razor. To do this safely at first I just put the head in a towel and held it securely in one hand and unscrewed it with the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: The razor works great. I picked up 100 Astra blades with it as well, and will be set for about a year (all in 38 USD for this razor, 10 USD for extra blades, 8 USD for a shaving kit). The packaging on this razor is great, very high end feeling. Edwin Jagger makes some of the most beautiful stuff and the pictures here do not do the product justice. The craftsmanship has to be seen first hand to appreciate. Just know that EJ doesn&#x27;t make garbage so anything you buy will look great and work even better. If you&#x27;re a beginner, keep practicing with it. I almost gave up during that first week, but slowly I got the hang of it and my skin stopped getting irritated.</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor after seeing it highly-recommended in several discussion boards, for the same reasons that many others are switching back to DE safety razors. I shaved my head daily with disposable razors, but was going to wait a while before attempting it with the Jagger De86bl. However, after experiencing almost no nicks after shaving my face on the first day, I felt comfortable attempting the head shave on the second. It went splendidly, by the way...my scalp survived without a single nick. Although I haven&#x27;t used any other safety razors, the ease of transition to this one after using disposables for so many years leads me to recommend it highly. (P.S.: It appears to be really solidly constructed, and also looks really good in the bathroom coupled with the black SimplyBeautiful badger brush and stand that I ordered from Amazon as well.)</li>
            <li> I have used Merkur, Gillette (fat boy and other classics) Parker, Ikon, and by far this is the best safety razor I have tried. fully recommended!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for over four months and really love it. The handle is comfortable to grip, although you need to keep it as dry as possible, it gets slick when soapy wet. The razor was a distinct improvement over my previous razor and the quality is great. It feels very substantial, like it will last a lifetime and is a great example of British quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well will all blades I&#x27;ve tried although the jury is still out on which blade will become my daily blade.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, liking it a lot. As a woman, I wish the handle was slightly longer, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I would have given this razor 5 stars except that after 14 months of use the screw snapped off the head while I was changing the blade. For the price it really is a good razor.</li>
            <li> good safety razor love the look</li>
            <li> This razor has just a little heft to it, but quite well balanced. The quality and comfort of the shave is very good overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from shave burn ever since I started shaving. After many years of trying sensitive skin foams and gels as well as different brands of razor&#x27;s, I decided I had to try something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some research, I decided to try a safety razor. I read that it made a difference for lots of guy&#x27;s who have had the same issues as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s - NO RAZOR BURN AT ALL!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  - Shaving actually fells nice (no skin pulling)&lt;br /&gt;  - Takes the same amount of time as using any major brand shavor&lt;br /&gt;  - Blades are very inexpensive. This type of razor saves lots of $$$$&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;  - Lots of different brands of blades will fit this. You can find a blade that suites your wants.&lt;br /&gt;  - Easy to handle and hold&lt;br /&gt;  - great to travel with as it&#x27;s small&lt;br /&gt;  - I feel great after a shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s - no way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about trying any safety razor of any type, go for it. For me personally, I love this one.</li>
            <li> I thought I would treat myself to a good shave. This was the first safety razor I bought  It lives up to it name and reputation</li>
            <li> This is a great style of safety razor.  I own the ebony, ivory and chrome models.  They shave very well for me.  However, after limited use both the ebony and the ivory plastic coverings have cracked.  They were not dropped or abused.  A small crack wouldn&#x27;t have mattered much, but both coverings cracked to the point of becoming loose and moving around while shaving.  Again, this style is wonderful, but beware of the plastic coverings.  I suggest going with the chrome model instead.</li>
            <li> Very good quality.  The only reason that it is not 5 stars for me is the handle is to short.</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and I have been using an electric shaver for about 15 years. The convenience was great but that&#x27;s all. I went to the electric when I tired of nicking up my face with the multiple bladed razors.  A few months ago I noticed that double edge blades were appearing on drug store shelves, but not the razors. I hunted the drug stores to find the traditional safety razors without any luck at all.  Why did the stores sell the blades if they weren&#x27;t selling the razors?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that Amazon had several brands of safety razors to choose from and purchased the Edwin Jagger De86bl. I have been using it for about a month  with absolutely wonderful results. I don&#x27;t remember when I have been able get such a close shave without cutting myself. I don&#x27;t no why I waited so long to go back to the safety razor. Love it !</li>
            <li> This has been my first safety razor and I&#x27;m loving it so far. My girlfriend calls it a &amp;#34;very manly razor.&amp;#34; There was a purr at the end of that sentence, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s weighty, so you don&#x27;t need to force it against your face while you&#x27;re shaving. Just hang on and let gravity do its thing. The head assembly screws on perfectly to the handle, holding your razor blade in place solidly and making each pass predictable. Replacing a razor blade is quick and easy, even with wet fingers. I would have liked a slightly longer handle, but I&#x27;m not complaining. I have large man-hands, and the handle still fits and feels just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue--as is the case with safety razors--is the pack of included razor blades. These may or may not work for your face and beard. You&#x27;d think that all razor blades are created equal, but you&#x27;d be wrong. If these don&#x27;t work for you, buy a variety pack of blades and see what does.</li>
            <li> This razor looks absolutely beautiful and is perfect for beginners interested in experiencing DE shaving. It uses a basic screw in locking system that makes changing razors very simple. For those of you interested in trying DE shaving I would seriously try it. I&#x27;ve been doing it for two weeks and it feels amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the best shave of my life using this razor.</li>
            <li> After about two good uses, I fell in love with it. BUT, don&#x27;t get cocky like I did one morning. After about two pints of blood loss and looking like I survived a Freddie Kruger movie, I discovered that you need to respect the single blade. Don&#x27;t wake up late and get in a rush with this beautiful razor!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My brother owns an Edwin Jagger DE89 Chrome and I wanted to buy something similar as I really liked the weight and performance. The De86bl is really just the same! I was a bit reluctant about having the (plastic?) ebony body but it fits in perfectly and really looks nice too. I would recommend it to anyone - even beginners; I am a horrible shaver and if I haven&#x27;t accidentally cut my carotid with this tool, so won&#x27;t you.</li>
            <li> There is not much more I can say that the others have not covered. It shaves very well and feels good to me. Looks nice also. Like a million bucks for only a fraction of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the plunge, be a man, stop wasting plastic disposables in the landfill that your children and their children will have to deal with. I am not asking you to man up to a straight razor....but man up to a single edge. You a big boy or a pansy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man up and buy this. You will feel better. your wallet will fell better. and the environment will thank you.</li>
            <li> Beautiful razor. I would buy this again. It was my first safety razor and my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  It works perfectly and has saved me a ton of money on those crap 25 blade disposables.  It shaves better, is better constructed, and is cheaper.  What is there not to like?</li>
            <li> Love this razor, good clean shave and easy to handle.  I will purchase another...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave feedback, but I wanted to on this product for all the men (and women) sick and tired of the exuberant prices charged today for your typical razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started shaving as a young adult with a typical 2 blade plastic razor. Then the 3 blade came out, which was a great improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, the 5 blade came out which I switched to. I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell any difference and the fat blade area made it difficult to shave in areas. So eventually I switched back to the three blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, the prices of these razors have sky rocketed. So, I fired up my trusty Amazon to see if I could get a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened upon these DE razors, and said what the heck, I will give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of use, from tough shaving where I haven&#x27;t shaved in days, to everyday shaving (and I also shave my head)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly have no clue why men switched from these to the plastic disposables. The DE by far give the best shaving experiences, shave closer than anything I have used before, and my skin feels a hundred times better. For once, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34; to shave, the DE glides over easily removing pretty much everything, flip it over and glide it over again and you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t explain how frustrating those disposables are. You get a few hairs stuck in them and you have to dump the thing. There were times I went through 2-3 razors after not shaving for a while while completely massacring my face with those things, each time cursing how I just threw out 2-3 bucks just to shave once! Not with a DE, the thick openings keep the hair out from clogging, even if it did just unscrew it a bit and clean it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of use with the DE I was hooked. I ordered in a bristle brush and some shaving soap and found shaving Nirvana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things I will mention. My hands are a little on the larger size and I would have preferred a longerhandle as this one tends to get &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; in my hand as I swing it around to use the other side of the blade or maneuver it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the Derby razors I got are decent. After some research, I bought 100 Astra Stainless Steel razors and they are far superior in my opinion. At around 13 cents a blade delivered I am able to shave my beard and head twice easily before switching out blades, so you are looking at around 3 cents a shave if you just do your beard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you want the best shave, throw the blade out after one use, it&#x27;s 13 cents, not going to break the bank!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am never going back to the nonsense the shaving companies have raised me to &amp;#34;believe&amp;#34; about disposables. I get a bit sick to my stomach just thinking about the money I spent over the decades, the frustration I have had, and the torn up skin to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And LADIES, try these on your legs and thank me later!</li>
            <li> A beautiful razor.However the handle is slippery as glass making it very difficult to hold.I find it necessary to hold it just under the head,which for me is uncomfortable and limits motion.Might be perfect for some but not me.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor that I even had!!! feels &amp; look so good!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it, you never get this feeling with conventional razors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those plastic things never can do what the iron can :P</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t add much to all the positive reviews out there as I basically agree with them. From a personal perspective, I have been shaving for more than 10 years using different electric shavers and disposable blades but I always had razor bumps and pimples. Not even 1 month into shaving with the EJ (with Astra SP blades) my pimples almost disappeared. Six months later this is still the case and my beard never felt better! By the way I use a very basic foam and brush from the drugstore, I didn&#x27;t bother buying an expensive one.</li>
            <li> I paid a good price, and got a good razor. This thing is weighty in the hand. It shaves good too. Still using it, never go back to cartridges.</li>
            <li> WOW -- great shave.  I have owned it for several weeks now.  I will never go back to my old razor.  I  use edge shaving gel for added protection instead of shaving soap or cream.  My shaves are extra smooth and no one nick or cut.  More important the blades are far cheaper.</li>
            <li> About a million times better than a plastic Gillette which costs the same.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, especially for the price. Handle is a bit shorter than expected, but the razor has a nice weight to it that makes control very easy.</li>
            <li> I think it is a great product. It did not slip as other people wrote here, at least for me. The shaving was the smoothest I&#x27;ve ever had. I did not feel like anything was touching my skin. Now, I have a very sensitive skin and any razor that I&#x27;ve used have given me rash and made my face red. This razor was no different, I got the same amount or reddish than any other sensitive disposable. I&#x27;m not going to give it a bad rating for that though. Maybe I&#x27;ll do more test to see if the burn improves.</li>
            <li> After continued problems and not so close a shave with the expensive Merkur Futur, I decided to go to a non-adjustable razor.  This razor is excellent, gives a close shave, and without the nicks and stubble left by the Futur.  Maybe the Futur was too heavy, but the gap is just right on this razor.  It works with Feather or Shark blades and is easy to take apart and clean when changing blades - unlike the Futur.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I am a complete rookie. I literally know nothing about this style of shaving. But I have tried straight edge safety razors with the intent to practice and learning. This shaver is a Double Edge Safety Razor not a straight edge safety so I figure its going to me simpler that what I have already tried. Its pretty awesome. I thought the black shaft would be slippery and it can feel that way with foam and water on it, once you get a feel for the weight and balance its really not. The hold and grip of this shaver is quite forgiving. It shaves ridiculously close probably no matter what blades you use, but i do think there is a difference in blade quality. I used the derby razor blades and have shaved twice. Its new so my skin is a little &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; but the Nivea Post Shave Balm I already had is perfect for this. I do recommend that you have a post shave balm of any kind you like ready on hand if you are new to this stuff like me. Fundamentally this shave is way closer that my mach 3, Fusion and the new Gillette 4 blade swivel ball razor. I also like that fact that it seems to scrape off other layers of stuff on my face that have probably built up over the years of soap and abuse. That also sounds weird, but its true. Make sure you actually clean the thing after each shave, open it up and get the gunk out. 5 stars, its a keeper, you&#x27;ll never want to use anything else if you enjoy a nice, long lasting close shave and holds up. Feel like a man again, get one.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a few weeks now and I like real well. I am still working on getting used to using it. I have some Wilkinson sword blades that I like better as they seem to give me a better shave though. I would recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> You are probably asking yourself if you should try a double edge safety razor like I was myself a couple  months ago. The answer is yes. The overpriced blades for my so called high-tech multiple-blade supersonic razor just kept going up &amp; up and I had enough. The two biggest issues with multiple-blade razors are blade price &amp; the constant clogging. Yes the price of this razor seems high but you have to think of it over the long term. The blades are dirt cheap &amp; the quality of this razor will most likely last you the rest of your life. This razor is giving me the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had. I didn&#x27;t like the DERBY blades that came with this but you might. I recommend that you try out different blades (sampler pack) because preferences differ. I prefer the WILKINSON SWORD blades because they are sharper in my opinion. Also, while you are dumping that old razor, get yourself a shave set with the soap, bowl, &amp; brush. I bought the less expensive VAN DER HAGAN set &amp; this works just fine.</li>
            <li> Good news: My face is nice and smooth&lt;br /&gt;Bad news: I look like I was  in a fight with a cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a learning curve here so if you are not used to a DE there are lots of videos online but I am guessing practice is key ( I think I was heavy handed being used to a cartridge razor) and I also think I attempted a cross pass to soon before mastering with the grain pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I&#x27;m happy and hope to get better with practice.</li>
            <li> The handle and blades are amazing, but the quality of the head is cheap.  I now own two of these razors from Edwin Jagger and both heads are broken.  They tend to snap completely off where the head screws into the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one I had was a Chatsworth Style, imitation horn handle.  I had the this model for one month before the head snapped off when being transported in luggage.  Mostly my fault for not realizing how fragile it was.  I&#x27;ve had this one for roughly two years, and the handle still looks in perfect shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second one, this exact model, I&#x27;ve only had for a week.  While shaving, I accidentally dropped the razor onto my counter top from about chin height, 2-3 feet and the head snapped completely off.  The handles don&#x27;t have much weight so it can be hard to hold onto them if your hands are wet.  Only my second time using the razor and now I have another broken head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced the first head with a cheap Chinese knock off which has lasted me over two years and still going strong.  I just took the head from it, as my imitation horn is much more pleasing to the eye.  The stem on the Chinese one seems to be made out of much sturdier construction but the blade clogs fast and doesn&#x27;t provide as good a shave than the Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li> Good quality, well made. Shaves my face and my wife&#x27;s legs well just the same.</li>
            <li> This is the first safety razor I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I love it. It&#x27;s heavy and built very well. Easy to use and looks great.</li>
            <li> Good quality razor! Easy to assemble/disassemble. No pitting or corrosion even after several months of use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about these things, and this was my first safety razor, but it was highly rated by other sources (along with the Merkur) so I got it. Definitely still learning but so far I like it better than the normal cartridges, though you have to be a little more careful. Steep learning curve, I still trying to figure out what blades and other accessories I want/need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was quite surprised how short the handle is, which took a bit of getting used to. I think if I were to buy another it would be one with a longer handle.</li>
            <li> I like the size and feel.  It shaves or but does not slide as smooth as my Merkur</li>
            <li> Look, I thought the Edwin Jagger would be a durable razor.  Well the head broke off while I was shaving.  I finished with my old Merkur.  The Edwin Jagger head is a cast alloy.  Which means that it will break easily with a even minor drop on your sink.  With mine, there must have been a crack during shipping, because it was not dropped.  I would suspect that many of the buyers have already found this out.  There is no cheap fix.  The top head with the screw connector is not available, although I saw the head advertised for almost the same price as the entire razor with Amazon.  I expected a better product since England products are generally well made.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as my first safety razor. I was hesitant at first, but then the day I got it my girlfriend called me and told me she shaved her legs with it and she wants one just like it, because it was the best razor she ever used. I then tried it as well, and I love it. I wont ever go back!</li>
            <li> Being new to DE safety razor shaving, I think I am leaning toward the longer handles.  But that is a purely subjective decision.  This short handle razor works very well with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> I was interested in getting a safety razor so I just have to swap out the blades, and saw good reviews for this item. I picked it up, and bought some extra razors and I&#x27;ve enjoyed a nice, close shave ever since!</li>
            <li> Well built shaver, you won&#x27;t have to worry about dropping it. I stopped using this type of razor 30 yrs ago. The price of new razors is so high I switched back. Odd thing is I really do not feel a difference between my single blade and the others.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor, and I&#x27;ve been using it daily for nearly 6 months.  Solid, quality construction.  The threads on the head are tight.  Nice weight and feel.  The razor still gleams like new with a little rub from a hand towel.  Very easy to clean when disassembled.  No need to get a pricier and possibly lower quality razor from the competitors.</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor only a few days ago, and am very pleased with the result. The razor arrived a full week before the expected date, in pristine condition. It fits well in the hand, heavy enough to be comfortable, but not so heavy as to make shaving difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The blades that came with it are very sharp, and gave me on of the smoothest shaves I&#x27;ve had as yet. No razor burn at all. Very happy with this purchase, just bought a years supply of these same razors, [[ASIN:B004SGKMA0 Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades, 100 Count]]. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great finish, very good quality product. I am extremely happy with it. In fact, this is my second Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li> Great Razor. I loved it so much I got another one for my Granpa</li>
            <li> Very good, well built single blade razor. I just used it and got the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in years. Only problem is I have a disability in my hands and I wish the handle was a bit longer. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this is my second safety razor, and to be honest I love it!, I have great shaves and  I was thinking maybe the handle was going to be a problem, but on the contraire, its comfortable and has a great feel to it. if you are looking for a decent safety razor with out breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait until I had been using this thing for a while before reviewing it.  I&#x27;ve now been using it consistently since May, so after 7 months, here&#x27;s my feedback:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  I have had no issues with rust or the finish falling apart.  If cared for properly, i.e. all parts rinsed and dried after each shave, it still looks like it just came out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Handle length doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I have big hands, but I have also never used a longer handled safety razor.  Maybe if I had experience with longer handled razors, I would be complaining about this. As it is, the weight and length feel very natural to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Shave closeness:  If used properly this thing cleaves through hair, much closer than I ever got with my cartridge razors, especially after a second pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Blade replacement is not as easy on some models, but I don&#x27;t consider it that much of a pain.  I take the whole thing apart after each shave and wash and dry the two pieces of the guard, the blade and the handle, so I&#x27;m used to handling the razor and threading it onto the little pegs and screwing the whole thing together now.  But, it is true, there are other razors with much easier blade systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Blade is not adjustable, which some people are going to look for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally purchased this razor specifically because it is recommended as a beginners safety razor.  It is not very aggressive and it is not adjustable, which are things that might cause a new DE shaver to cut or nick themselves.  Not that this thing won&#x27;t cut or nick, but if you go slow while you&#x27;re learning and you read up or watch some tutorials, you&#x27;ll be fine.  I&#x27;ve only had to bust out the styptic a couple of times in my 7 month experience with the razor.  It also is not in the highest price tier for razors, meaning that it&#x27;s a great combination of cheap and easy to use but high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make a habit of always reading the worst reviews first and then making my way up to four or five star reviews, and the impression that I got from reading the one and two star reviews was that people weren&#x27;t holding the razor at the right angle.  This sucker needs to be at a 45 degree angle to your face or it won&#x27;t cut anything.  You shouldn&#x27;t be dragging the guard across your face.  Held properly, the only thing in contact with your skin is the tip of that razor blade.  And it will shave the hair down to the pore when held properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s not like, hating on those people.  Shaving with a DE razor is complicated, there&#x27;s a reason we moved as a society away from DE razors to cartridge razors.  When shaving you need to consider blade angle, blade pressure (which should be none) and the grain of your beard (first pass should be with, second pass across, third against if you feel you need it and it isn&#x27;t going to chew your face up).  You also should absolutely not be using canned goop from the drug store, please spring for shaving soap/cream and a shaving brush. If that sounds like a lot of hassle to you just to shave, then don&#x27;t buy a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shaving every day with a cartridge razor, and moved to shaving every other day when I started using this thing just because I could get away with it at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and finally, not a huge fan of the razors that came included with the razor.  I&#x27;d read some reviews and spring for better razors, maybe.  I&#x27;m honestly using the store brand ones from my local drug store, and I feel like they&#x27;re giving me a better shave than what came with the razor.</li>
            <li> I have used MANY and own many razors and this is my all time favorite. If used correctly with a good ASTRA or Derby blade, this razor does not nick or cut. It glides like a hot knife through butter on your whiskers and has not once nicked me on the face. The chrome on this razor reminds me of a 63 corvette bumper. It is THE BEST shaving razor I own and I own quite a few.</li>
            <li> This is my first SE razor and it&#x27;s good enough to be my last! I love the weight of it and it seems really well made. It definitely took some getting used to (again, first timer) but once I got it down I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor. I hadn&#x27;t heard of them until a week or so before I bought this one. I was tired of paying $16/month for a name brand razor and my barber recommended I go \\&quot;old school.\\&quot; I&#x27;m hooked. I will say that the short handle was surprising when I first opened the package but it actually handles very well. I do not find it slippery either and have used it in the shower. Although I bought it for function and cost savings, I have to say the thing looks amazing- like a work of art. The chrome is top notch work and I like the black handle. The Derby blades do a good job for me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for using it, I have to say I was nervous going in with the razor sharp blade being exposed. I watched a bunch of online videos and was fearing the worst for a break-in period. I found it really isn&#x27;t that hard or that tricky (except for right under the nose- that takes some effort). It is easy to feel when you have the right angle. You just have to take a little time and let the weight of the shave head do the work. It is surprisingly satisfying the sound it makes and the feel of it working. I&#x27;m not one for nostalgia either- I never watched my grandpa shave with a safety razor or anything like that. I think the closeness is comparable to a modern 5 blade cartridge razor. I need to take a second pass with both to get real close. And I break the rules and go against the grain with both and lived to tell the tail. This may give just a touch more irritation but nothing terrible, especially for the price. As for cutting myself, there haven&#x27;t been any major blood lettings. You do have to be extra careful around any blemishes or moles- the blade will nick them before you know it (they are as sharp as you imagine). Other than that, it is amazingly simple. I don&#x27;t know why people stopped using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caution I&#x27;d have is not to get too sucked in by the safety razor/old fashioned shaving fanatics. I think some of the irritation complaints I see onthese razors for sale (all brands) is because people change everything at once and go to the traditional soaps too. My first shave with this razor was terrible. On the second shave I learned it wasn&#x27;t the razor but the cheap shave soap I bought at Wal Mart and my lack of lathering abilities. No matter what the purists say, it is okay to use canned shave cream while getting used to this (or forever). I did and it was great. I&#x27;ve since bought some nice shave soap that I like but am still working on a proper lather. When I&#x27;m in a hurry, I go back to the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely intend to stick with using this razor. I may even end up collecting them. If you get it, just make sure you let you kids know it isn&#x27;t something to touch. The thing looks so good, little fingers may be tempted.</li>
            <li> This razor by Edwin-Jagger met all my needs and performs flawlessly during wetshaving. The 3-piece head design works well for me with several different blade types. Although the three piece design of this razor can lead to errors when replacing blades, if care is taken to assemble it correctly, there should be no problem. I have not used the Derby blades included with this product, but if you care to try them, make sure you try different brands of blades if the Derbys perform poorly to find what works for you. The handle on this model is smooth, &amp;#34;faux ebony&amp;#34; that looks very sharp but is perhaps not as secure as the chrome, lined handle featured on the EJ DE89 for some, but I have found it to be secure in the hand under normal conditions. Overall, a great razor with mild/moderate aggressiveness, great looks and feels solid in the hand.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ll state clearly that this is purely my First-Day-Review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I must say that as I was working through my first minute of shaving with this I asked my wife \\&quot;Where has this been all my life!?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s so I remember my Dad&#x27;s DE razor fondly but I&#x27;ve fallen victim to shaving most of my adult life with the usual, big-brand-names with ever-increasing blade counts (3, 4, 5 and counting!). However, the highway robbery which is a five pack of cartridges for $15 finally galled me enough I said \\&quot;No more!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy shaving. I enjoy the few minutes spent doing fine trimming and shaving (I have a goatee so I only shave neck, jawline, cheeks). I was prepared for a long session with this new razor but not so. It&#x27;s included blades gave me an awesome shave in no time at all. It just requires deliberate, thoughtful strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is heavy - surprisingly heavy for it&#x27;s size. It&#x27;s a bit \\&quot;small\\&quot; in terms of handle length but I gather it&#x27;s \\&quot;standard\\&quot; as far as DE razors go. I was positive I would have had a problem with it being too short but to my amazement the finger-tip grip with handle gently rested into my palm was actually a perfect form-factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a starter (and probably long-term) razor this is beautiful. The chrome finish is heavy, shiny, the handle is deep and shiny blank and it&#x27;s gorgeous. The weight, again, is heavier than it looks and that&#x27;s a positive thing for letting the weight and mass of the razor do the work for you rather than flipping the shaver around like you do with plastic cartridge styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given a fifth star rating had there been a bit &#x27;more&#x27; for extra value for the price... a simple stand or larger sampler of blades or something but 4 stars and my being very pleased is where it&#x27;s at!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I got this particular model in general but also in particular over a butterfly style because I had concerns of the blade being a little out of alignment.However, whether that would have been the case or not - the blade on this DE86 is perfectly aligned and held rock-solid in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to shaving with this today because I want to - not need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any of that changes I&#x27;ll post new impressions. For now, though, I&#x27;m thrilled with this razor and the fact it sets me up for cheap blades into the future.</li>
            <li> This Razor is awesome!!! i was afraid when i bought it because i had bad experience with other razors, but this one rocks!!!!</li>
            <li> A little short but nice and heavy.  Glides over my face with no pressure needed and an incredibly close shave.  My time with Gillette and Schick is over!</li>
            <li> This razor is super sleek and feels really good in your hand. The razor has a heavy weight to it as well.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would look based on the picture.  The chrome is great and the black handle makes it look very nice.  The razor has a nice solid feel to it and is just the right wieght.  It can be a little slick if your hand is wet but as long as you keep the handle and your hand dry it works just fine.  I think it provides a very nice shave and would highly recommend it.  This is my first DE razor so I don&#x27;t have experience with others but so far I have found it to be easy to use.  I&#x27;ll never go back to the multi-cartidge razors again.</li>
            <li> I am still new to using safety razors. I started out with a Weishi which did a poor at best job. After about a month the Weishi had to go. There is no comparison from the Weishi to the Edwin Jagger. I have never had such a good shave in my life. I just wish I would have started with the Edwin Jagger and never bought the Weishi. My only complaint is that the handle does get slippery when wet, but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> I feel so stupid to have waited this long to try this razor, and anyone reading this review of mine, please dont be nervous or scared like i was thinking oh this looks too intense or maybe i might cut myself and all that. I have been using all the different 2 blade, 3 blade even 5 blade cartridges... always had the tugging and pulling and razor burns, then recently switched to electrics and some worked well on the cheeks but the neck they just could not cut properly..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, i watched a lot of videos and saw people using these razors with a lot of ease and was amazed at how quickly it removed hair with not too many strokes.. So , finally decided to take the plunge with this Edwin Jagger and let me tell you it is so easy , i was nervous at first but after my first two strokes i realized that its not going to bite me unless i jam it in my face, i do make sure that i have a nice lather and i dont use any of that canned stuff... Just get a proper brush and some good shaving cream that does not contain any alcohol or nasty chemicals and enjoy, i have never enjoyed shaving so much in my life... its actually become a little get a way for me.. I just take my time and  make sure im not rushed or anything.. I dont think anything cuts this close.. this is also a great razor for beginners in my opinion...If your reading this, do your self a favor and just get it.. great product and very very cost efficient..</li>
            <li> I was given a gift set that included a Parker long handle razor, Parker badger shave brush, and other products.  I liked the set but the razor was sort of middle of the road for me.  I can&#x27;t say what it was exactly but it always left my face sore for hours afterwards.  I tried Shark, Sharp, Feather, blades and same thing (although the Feather did not tear up my face - it breezed through my flesh like a hot samurai sword through butter) every time.  I did a ton of research and loved this razor more for the looks than anything else.  It&#x27;s from Sheffield, England which I&#x27;ve been to and I like that it&#x27;s not some cheaply made piece of metal.  The chroming on this razor is as thick as I&#x27;ve ever seen or felt and looks absolutely spectacular.  The black handle is gorgeous but does not have any type of grip or grooves so be aware of that.  The biggest thing about it to me was it was tiny!  But it was tiny compared to my Parker long handle and then I realized that the EJ-DE86 is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; and that my Parker was the odd man out.  I immediately liked the shorter handle on the EJ as I could almost tuck it in my hand, grip my fingers high up underneath the head and use it as an extension of my hand.  It makes the natural movements around the neck and those odd places like the jaw line under the ear and over the adams apple much more natural feeling.  The Parker long-handle is a twist to open (TTO) design which is quick and slightly safer than the three piece design of the EJ-DE86 but not better.  With the TTO design I always felt that the blade wasn&#x27;t being held firmly or that blade after blade sat exactly in the same place time and time again.  The blade does all of that in the EJ-DE86.  It feels as though the blade is at one with the razor when it&#x27;s twisted down tight.  The safest way to put a blade in the razor I&#x27;ve found is to turn the two parts upside-down on the counter and set the blade down onto it, steady the top, and screw in the handle.  Once it&#x27;s on there you can pick it all up and tighten the last little bit.  So far I&#x27;ve only put in the Derby blade to the kit (Derby comes with the razor) and it went through my whiskers nicely on the first shave.  The second one was a little more rough.  I purchased a mixed sample pack of blades and look forward to trying them all out.  This is an immensely superior piece of kit for the price!  I love it and it looks gorgeous sitting on the sink!  Pick this up!an pick it all up and tighten the last little bit.

            <li> Enjoyed the craftsmanship of the razor. Weight of the razor helps you keep it on track without putting too much pressure on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharp, very sharp looking razor and a good addition of your first set of blades (get a sampler pack of blades as you want to compare them all!) The craftsmanship is very visible here as an example of why you should spend the extra 10-20 bucks for a quality product instead of a product that will easily show its flaws soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it and would probably buy it again!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son for Christmas. He used one at my house and loved it. So, I bought him one. He and my boyfriend both say (and so does the touch test) that it is a very close shave. Although the blades that come with it don&#x27;t last that long. He had to order a different kind and is very happy now.</li>
            <li> This is a handsome razor!! It&#x27;s also of great quality and very very durable from what i can tell. Has a wonderful head on it, maybe one of the best in the business!!</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> The overall finish on this razor is flawless.  The only thing that I do not like about this razor is the when the blade is installed it sticks out more on one side than the other.  I have another Edwin Jagger with the same head and the blade fits perfectly.  In spite of the smooth handle I did not have a problem holding onto it. I intend to return this one and hopefully get a better blade fit.  If the blade had fitted perfectly I would have given it 5 stars.  All in all I like this razor and do recommend it for the newby to DE shaving and the experienced shaver as well. I think Edwin Jagger is the best razor for the money on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I contacted Amazon and the razor was replaced with a new one which is perfect. I am revising my review from 4 to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this safety razor daily now for a couple of months and it is great! The blade stayed sharp a lot longer than I expected. The weight is balanced perfectly. I tried to go back to a Gillette Mach 3 one time and it felt terrible compared to the Edwin Jagger. The handle felt a little slippery and took some practice figuring out the right grip, but I don&#x27;t even think about it now. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Decided to give the safety razors a try, as i was tired of the expensive blades on tho&#x27;s multiblade shavers.  I went with a Van Der Hagen Safety Razor first, and well wasnt completly satisfied so i gave one more razor a try. And went with the Edwin Jagger. ---  IM SOLD and luv it...--Either this one , or Merkur would be great for anyone getting into a de razor..As either one is great,then just try diff blades to fit your beard and face..Dont listen to which of these two shavers are best, as thier equil,..  Now i just got to exper with diff blades.  For anyone giving these razors a try, Do yourself a favor and get the edwin jagger safety razor..Or go with a merkur.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> As if it&#x27;s needed, I&#x27;ll add to the accolades for this razor. The head holds the blade at a really nice angle for my beard, and the comb is deep enough to make it nearly foolproof. There&#x27;s a nice weight to it that makes it hug your skin with little effort. The plating is impeccable. Timeless, durable, and stylish. Just what your bathroom has been missing! Some like the butterfly opening razors, but this mechanism is much easier to clean, and there are no moving parts to break or bend or malfunction. I don&#x27;t even open mine after using it. Just rinse. Nothing accumulates in it. Even on a 4 day beard. The bed holds the blade, the cap bends it to the proper angle and the handle screws them together to make it all happen. Primitive. Indestructible. The black handle? I can take it or leave it. I like black. I like chrome. I like turned chrome. The black looks a bit more contemporary, though. Its effectiveness is what matters, and it&#x27;s a beauty in every way. One note- the included blades aren&#x27;t that good. Order some Feather blades with it. Trust me. I wouldn&#x27;t lie to you. It&#x27;s just aggressive enough for my beard, while not being dangerous for me to use. I never cut myself with it. It sure beats the Parker 90R I tried before it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 11/02/13&lt;br /&gt;I overestimated it. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have called it \\&quot;indestructible\\&quot;. The threaded nub that protrudes from the head and screws into the handle snapped in two while I was dragging it across my face. Upon inspection, it&#x27;s not plated brass or steel, but pot metal. Looking through the packaging that I kept, I see that there&#x27;s no mention of any kind of warranty. An email to Edwin Jagger has been ignored for over a week. Maybe I just got a bad one, but I recommend not screwing the handle on too tightly. I&#x27;m sad. I love this razor, but buying another one would be rewarding the manufacturer for making an inferior product, or at least rewarding them for poor customer service. Caveat Emptor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another update: 11/25/13&lt;br /&gt;After sending a second email, in which I explained that I&#x27;d be letting others know about their customer service, they promptly replied, saying that my first email had never been received. Okay. Long story short- they sent me a replacement head, a 5 pack of Derby blades, and a sample of their shaving soap. So, I guess I&#x27;ll give them the benefit of the doubt and rate their customer service as \\&quot;good\\&quot;. Still disappointed in the quality of the razor, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet another: 1/25/14&lt;br /&gt;It broke again. As I was changing the blade, the nub on the replacement head snapped off. I&#x27;m done with Edwin Jagger razors.&lt;br /&gt;After sending a second email, in which I explained that I&#x27;d be letting others know about their customer service, they promptly replied, saying that my first email had never been received. Okay. Long story short- they sent me a replacement head, a 5 pack of Derby blades, and a sample of their shaving soap. So, I guess I&#x27;ll give them the benefit of the doubt and rate their customer service as \\&quot;good\\&quot;. Still disappointed in the quality of the razor, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet another: 1/25/14&lt;br /&gt;It broke again. As I was changing the blade, the nub on the replacement head snapped off. I&#x27;m done with Edwin Jagger razors.</li>
            <li> And wanted a quality razor, rather than shopping around for something from the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This certainly seems to fill the bill, first shave with it was very pleasant with the enclosed blade type.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason this razor has overwhelmingly 5-star reviews: it&#x27;s just that great. The head is heavy steel with nice chrome on it, and the handle, though plastic, still has a nice heft to it thanks to the metal on the end. Though it is smooth, it&#x27;s surprisingly not slippery at all, even with wet, soapy hands. The design of the head is prettty great, too. It&#x27;s not too aggressive, but it&#x27;s also not so soft that I can&#x27;t get a good shave with it. It&#x27;s a standard three-piece design like your grandfather&#x27;s Gillette, so blade changes are pretty easy. If I had to come up with a negative, the Derby blades that are included are not very sharp as double edge blades go. No big deal, though, when 100 good blades cost $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr: this razor is expensive, but it&#x27;s totally worth it. If you&#x27;re making the switch to an old-school safety razor and can afford this one, buy it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this razor.  High quality feel and construction.  My only complaint is the smooth handle.  I love the way it looks but with wet hands it can get a little slick.  Hasn&#x27;t been an issue yet, but my next safety razor will have a knurled handle.</li>
            <li> Annoyed by the price of Gillette multiple blade shaving systems, I decided to experiment and see if this single blade, old fashioned approach would work for me. However I assumed Amazon would honor its policy of allowing for return or would not have ordered the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it ,I nicked my upper lip and drew blood, something that has not happened in decades of using Gillette systems. So I placed it back in the box and applied for a return, to learn I cannot.  Review the listing yourself and see if you can find any mention of this unusual and unfair &amp;#34;no return&amp;#34; policy.  Costco would not have treated me this shabbily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am the sad owner of a blood drawing razor blade and my faith in Amazon is shaken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this daily since 2012, couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase. Needs to be cleaned approx. once a month as soap scum builds up on the chrome.</li>
            <li> A beautiful razor with a flawless finish. It comes with a 5-pack of derby blades which is nice. It&#x27;s my first de razor so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but each time I put in a new blade it always seats it at a symmetric proper angle on both sides, so I find it to be very reliable and top-notch quality. I was trying to decide between this and the merkur of similar price. I bought this because of the overall high reviews, the beautiful style/finish, and I think it&#x27;s a slightly better deal than the merkur. WINNING!</li>
            <li> This is a fine razor with a great weight to it. It feels like a product of quality construction and is durable. Changing the blade is fairly easy. My only complaint is the small handle, which somebody with very large hands may have trouble handling.</li>
            <li> After months of hesitation, I decided to try shaving with a safety razor. The solid reviews and decent prices landed me on this Edwin Jagger model. I also picked up a set of Feather blades as recommended by my wife, who is a cosmetologist and uses Feather blades in her salon. Thanks to a few tutorials on youtube (see user mantic79), my first shave was smooth and easy. Even on my coarse stubble, it was more comfortable than any disposable I have ever used, including the Gillette Proglide. The comfort and cost savings has sold me for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link to youtube tutorials: [...]</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and went with this one after so many recommended it. Works well, and with the price of blades a lot cheaper than cartridge razors I couldn&#x27;t be happpier.</li>
            <li> This was my first foray into DE shaving, and I think it&#x27;s one of the best options available for beginners and long-time shavers alike. The price is hard to beat, and it is solidly built, and is easy to shave with. After using it for over a year, I went and got a nice Ikon razor, and I still find myself going back to this razor from time to time.</li>
            <li> Great Product! It&#x27;s everything I expected and more! If you are into this it is perfect! Great delivery and I still can&#x27;t believe that it was made.</li>
            <li> I have to say shaving everyday is such a drag. I was in the Marine Corps for 5 years and everyday shaved. I have had this razor for about 2 months now and have used it everyday. I actually look forward to making my face feel like silk in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My setup:&lt;br /&gt;This razor&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Creme http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007MW2ZW/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o05_s00_i00&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Brush http://www.amazon.com/Tweezerman-2801-h-Mens-Shaving-Brush/dp/B000G647Y8/ref&#x3D;pd_bxgy_bt_img_y&lt;br /&gt;Stand http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B8E77M/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o04_s00_i00</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be pleased you did. This is a great razor for those looking into getting started with wetshaving. Holding it in your hand, it feels like it would survive the apocalypse. Very well made, and it&#x27;s quite the looker sitting on the counter. Just buy it and be happy.</li>
            <li> This was the first DE razor I tried... I&#x27;m hooked for life. There is no shave like a DE, and it really isn&#x27;t that hard once you get the face prep down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too aggressive, which is perfect for those learning. Comes with 5 derby blades which are now my blade of choice. (be sure to get a sampler pack when you order this, everyone&#x27;s face likes different blades)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two times of using this and I literally threw my fusion in the trash can.</li>
            <li> I like this razor but it has one major problem - the black handle is not knurled, ie: textured, and it needs to be. The razor is a bit on the heavy side, and when it is wet, it is difficult to grip. This is not a good combination when you are handling a double edge razor blade either in the act of shaving or after washing the razor and trying to open it to dry out. The razor looks very nice with its \\&quot;faux ebony\\&quot; handle, but I believe it is unsafe due to the ergonomic deficiencies caused by the smooth surface of the handle. Although I just ordered this razor, I will soon order another and only use this one as a back up.</li>
            <li> Works great, follow the recommendations elsewhere (don&#x27;t press, don&#x27;t rush).  Only cut myself once with this and that was because I was trying to rush.</li>
            <li> Very well balanced razor.  High quality materials and construction.  I am just sorry that I fell into the trap of more blades are better.  Save your money and enjoy this razor.  Easy to use but follow the directions if you have never used this type of razor!  No pressure against your beard is needed.  Let the weight of the razor do the work and you will have very little or no razor burn or irritation.  Also use high quality blades.</li>
            <li> I really liked this razor at first and it shaved really well, but only a few months after I got it, the faux ebony handle cracked right down the middle. Needless to say, this is pretty disappointing. I wasn&#x27;t rough with the razor. I took it apart and cleaned it after each use.  It doesn&#x27;t really make sense to me why it broke. I&#x27;d still recommend Edwin Jagger Razors (it shaved really nice before it broke), I&#x27;d just go with a metal handle next time.</li>
            <li> I love this little piece. One of the things that I like the most, besides being a very nicely craft product, its the weight. Its very nicely heavy! Heavy means less shaving effort, pretty much all the work is done by the razor weight gliding on your skin. Gives soft, nice shaves,</li>
            <li> Closest shave I have ever had.  The handle was shorter than expected but during my first shave I noticed it felt very natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Looks great hanging on the stand I got for it next to my badger brush.  Make the investment and save money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor blades are far (very far!) cheaper than buying those mach 3 or fusion cartridges.  Also, the razor blades, unlike the cartridges, can be easily recycled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time electric razor user, but wanted to get back in touch with my early DE shaving days. This is a well made, well balanced and very nicely finished DE razor. I was contemplating a Merkur, but the faux-ebony on this Jagger is what caught my eye. Has some heft to it yet very comfortable in hand, and easy to steer. Paired with some good quality blades (I&#x27;ve become partial to Feather), you can expect a nice shave with this razor, and it appears built to last.</li>
            <li> Based on reviews, this was my first razor I purchased to move to safety razors.  I have tried different blades with it and have yet to cut or even so much nick.  The handle is small by look but once you hold and use it...perfect.  Very nice looking and easy to assemble for use.</li>
            <li> Awesome double edge razor. Its perfectly balanced and extremely easy to shave with. I prefer the Dorco ST301 blades over the Derby blades... But its all preference. I&#x27;ve had this for a little over 8 months and its by far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I used to hate shaving... And now I look forward to it. I highly recommended buying Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li> Bought a second for travel, my first is a few years old and still looks brand new.  No rust or tarnish, nothing.  Would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to use this but it is a solid, nice razor. The tip is fairly heavy, so it&#x27;s not a balanced razor.</li>
            <li> My first shave with this was absolutely stunning. It was smooth, only took one pass, and didn&#x27;t hurt (except where I messed up my adams apple--user error). Subsequent uses of the same blade have been less so (I try to re-use until I can&#x27;t anymore--strop the blade between uses, etc.), but still pretty easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit heavier than I expected, which is good. It&#x27;s still hard sometimes to not put pressure on it like a disposable junk 3-blade razor. It&#x27;s deceptive in that it works better without any pressure on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quick to take apart, easy to dry, and easy to use. It comes with five derby blades, which work great for me. I also bought a 32 blade mix pack (2 each of 16 brands) to try with it, so some blades may turn out better, but these work well for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> So far he loves it. I took a good recommendation online, and that&#x27;s what lead me to this one over the Merkur.</li>
            <li> I started my de shaving experience with this razor 2 weeks ago and have not looked back.  This razor is extremely gentle and I have tried a few different blades.  So far my favorite blades are Astra, bluebird and bolzano.  I have a few more to try including nacet, Gillette silver blue, Kai, feather, and a few others.  Absolutely hate the merkur and derby.  I have coarse beard and sensitive skin and have used proraso white for my trials with the various blades.  I will also try a few other soap/creams to give me some options.</li>
            <li> Great balance; easy to maintain.  An excellent choice for anyone who is entering this realm of shaving.  Price is right. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Fantastic razor,shaves awesome. I am new to safety razors,and have not cut myself once. No more razor burn. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this razor,just superb.</li>
            <li> Just like many other people who have switched, I am in love.  I wish I spent a little more money on the &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; opening. This one is twist off.  Not too bad. But still, if I would do it all over again.  I would say this is still a great product.  I haven&#x27;t cut myself once on it. Definitely check out videos on how to use one of these and you&#x27;ll be set!</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic razor!  I wish I had bought this several years ago.  Best shave I have ever had, with Personna blue label blades.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I started using a safety razor a couple years ago, and will never consider using anything else. I had a cheaper $20 safety razor that finally stopped tightening, so I picked this one up after reading the reviews. It is a solid product, has a nice weight to it, and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve done a good job selling us on the idea that more blades on a razor is better, no matter WHAT the cost. But the &amp;#34;low tech,&amp;#34; double-edge safety razor STILL gets the job done. And in my case, it seems to do it better than all the over-priced, multi-blade monstrosities I&#x27;ve stopped using. I love the Edwin Jagger! I still cannot believe how many shaves you can get out of one blade, either. The cost of shaving just went way down.</li>
            <li> After using electric razors for my face the past 25 years with disposables for the sideburns, I decided I needed a change when the cartridge hit 5 blades. My son was using the big M 180 German brand and loves it. Since I&#x27;m German/Italian, I lean toward German engineering, but kept researching. I saw this DE86 on Amazon and read the reviews here and elsewhere. I was attracted to the black and chrome combo...to me it was just a great look (like my Harley), has the same head as the more expensive EJs. The pictures don&#x27;t do it justice and I cannot imagine a better razor. It is absolutely beautiful and wonderfully middle of the road for cutting..not aggressive...not mild. The pack of blades it came with are very mild so I quickly changed to Wilkinson Sword Classics and have Feathers ordered. I have not nicked myself and can generally have a wonderfully close shave with 1 pass using the Wilkinsons. I had bought a septic pencil when I switched to DE and have not used it yet. Since I do not have a heavy beard, I can&#x27;t say if this razor will be aggressive enough for that type of whisker. I can&#x27;t wait to try this razor with the Feather blade.Hope your experience will be as good as mine.</li>
            <li> This was my first de safety razor, and all I can say is it was well worth the money.. I was introduced to DE safety razors from a friend and he let me try a  gillete butterfly opening and I had to own one for myself.  After doing some research, I came across the Edwin Jagger De86bl safety razor after reading some reviews and all the stories were true. I would highly recommend this product for a beginner and a everyday safety razor using shaver.  I would give this review 5 stars if it had a butterfly opening.</li>
            <li> My husband highly recommends this razor to anyone especially a beginner. He has never shaved with a safety razor until today and he absolutely loves this razor. The shave is so much smoother than a cartridge razor or an electric. If you&#x27;re considering DE shaving you might want to watch a few YouTube videos and definitely do research on the different types of razors available. This one was recommended for beginners along with the Merkur HD and this one definitely is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Edwin Jagger makes some fantastic stuff, and this razor is no exception. While putting a razor blade in requires a bit of assembly, the weighty feel and bonus five-pack of Derby blades more than makes up for it. This razor is amazing, and it&#x27;s going to last me a lifetime. As a side note, it arrived three days early, a very pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> Great starter razor for those of you wanting to get back to the old ways and save some money over today&#x27;s overpriced blades.  I found the dome on this prevented me from having an easy time under my nose, so with that, I deduct one star.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor.  i do not shave often (I&#x27;m Asian, and my &amp;#34;facial hair&amp;#34; grows very minimally, but it does grow... lol.  Anyway, this is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced next to a straight razor shave.  It came with the Derby blades, but I went ahead and ordered the Feather blades as I used those before from a friend and prefer those.  Great construction, tight fitting head (it doesnt wobble or anything).  Feels nice and solid.  Recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> Great!! Great quality, great weight, great style..... Use this as an everyday razor...... Love it</li>
            <li> Nice razor. I was looking for a good starter option, and this one definitely fits the bill. It is extremely sturdy, and changing the blades is quick and painless. And it looks great to boot! I plan to have this razor for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a well constructed, forgiving razor. I got a pretty good deal on it as well. It is well balanced so you won&#x27;t have to apply any real pressure or worry about nicking yourself if your grip isn&#x27;t perfect. The blade gap is just enough to give me a close shave on one pass but not enough to cause razor burn. The handle is compact, which is the appropriate size for the grip you need. The Derby blades also worked pretty well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was recommended to me by several people as a novice razor and it was a great choice. Just make sure you don&#x27;t have the center piece on backwards. It actually came assembled in the box with this piece reversed and caused some frustration until I tried it the other way around.</li>
            <li> Nice beginner razor. Made in England. nice finish. My biggest gripe is with the weight. It seems a bit light. I prefer something with a little bit more heft to it but for the price, I won&#x27;t complain too much. Def a great way to get into the DE game.</li>
            <li> Razor is very nice and is quite heavy, but this is light years better then that piece of Chinese crap that the Pawn star Rick endorses. A very nice, comfortable razor.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had/used a DE safety razor for some years having fallen for using a Mach 3...wish now that I hadn&#x27;t ever given up DE safety razor and wet soap shaving...a super smooth and close shave!  My only complaint is that Edwin Jagger apparently doesn&#x27;t make a long handle (4&amp;#34;) razor.</li>
            <li> This was my first re-visit to a safety razor in three decades and I&#x27;m glad I decided to return!  This is a very well made unit however if I had to do it again, I would opt for a razor with a bit longer handle and one with texture to the handle.  This one can be a bit slippery when wet.  I read reviews mentioning these items before I purchased this razor but still decided to proceed with it.  The quibbles are minor and since I bought this one, I have bought a different make safety razor, but I still seem to use this one!  So, my subconscious is giving this one a pretty high rating!</li>
            <li> I had purchased a cheap double edged razor and it tore my skin up. I have sensitive skin and each time I shaved, it looked like I was in a fight with a mountain lion. With high hopes on the Edwin Jagger, I figured why not give it a shot. I was not disappointed. It is beautiful out of the box and delivers a smooth shave. I use Proraso for my products, however feel free to use what you like. The price and value can&#x27;t be beat. Try it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Make sure to wet your face properly and apply a good lather of shaving soap. Reduces the chance of cuts.</li>
            <li> TThe handle is slippery.  Should have gotten knurled.  The head is great though and chrome finish is also very good.</li>
            <li> EJ makes a wonderful head. I gift this razor for my buddies who I&#x27;m encouraging to shave like men and leave the multi-blade disposables to their wives.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> I have never used a safety razor before and this razor came recommended.by a friend. So far so good. Only thing I wish was that the handle was a little longer</li>
            <li> Ordered this razor from Amazon for delivery in New Delhi, India, a week ago. Delivered yesterday, in 6 days flat. Very impressed by delivery speed and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is quite striking. Nicely chromed, a good heft and gives a sense of being much more expensive than it actually is. The head of the razor, in particular, is beautifully machined. Well done, Mr. factory worker from Sheffield, England! Well done indeed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shave with Derby blades (one pass only - gently does it) was very smooth. The weight of the razor does all the work, no need to slash and jab a la &#x27;Mock 3&#x27; or &#x27;Fission&#x27;. Very little irritation (I am still a newbie) and almost no razor burn. And I get the feeling that shaves with this razor will only get better. Can&#x27;t wait to order a sample pack of razor blades and creams and lotions from around the world!</li>
            <li> It does, as others have proclaimed, look lovely. Chrome finish is superb and the handle looks smashing (it matchse my Parker badger hair brush to a T... the reason I bought it).  BUT. The razor has absolutely zero space between the blade and the razor... meaning that I literally can&#x27;t even shave with it. I&#x27;ve shaved with plenty of DE razors before and this is the absolute worst. It&#x27;s like rubbing a razor with no blade across my skin, it doesn&#x27;t even remove hair. Tried to return to Amazon but this is apparently a \\&quot;no return\\&quot; item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supremely disappointed, Edwin Jagger. Not sure if this is a defect, but I&#x27;m not likely to return to this brand for any other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this razor to be a real disappointment. The handle is too short to hold firmly and the angle of the blade is such that unless you hold it at an extreme angle, it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut at all. I will look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This is my first double edged safety razor, but I love it.  Wont go back to disposables ever.  Dont buy the cheap blades though.  Tried it and wont do it again.  I use the derby blades that came with this package and nothing else now.  If you use this method of shaving properly, you wont shave with disposables again!  Use a good shave soap with it and your face will look as if you havent even shaved.  NO irritation at all with this method of shaving.  Skin is 110% better after shaving this way vs disposable razors.  AWESOME</li>
            <li> Seemed to work well, nice shave. However, dropped off sink broke into three pieces. After looking at it most of construction is plastic. Went with another make to replace.</li>
            <li> This was my first safety razor.  It was a work of art and very comfortable to use.  It looks like the handle would be very slippery when used with wet hands, but I never had any problems with a slippery handle.  A great razor for beginners and experts alike.  Would highly recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and well packaged. The razor is beautiful, easy to use and one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had. I truly enjoy this razor. I would recommend anyone looking to get a safety razor to go for this one.</li>
            <li> I am from Venezuela and this kind of razor is used by very few people here. I Used to shave with regular guillette match 3 by now it is expensive and hard to find here (thanks to this goberment). I decided to switch to safety razor I bought one cheap from china (used to cut all over my face) because this is the only one we can find here. Merkur and Muehle are the best I havent´try them so I can say so yet. I have to say this Edwin Jagger Double edge it awesome, it comes with 5 derby extra blades and they work together nice I didn´t cut my self at all even put more pressure. I tried with guillette and dorco blue titanium and they shave so close that cut my self many times it has to be used carefully.</li>
            <li> Better than expected quality for the price. It feels sturdy and solid like it will last forever. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any plastic on this razor.</li>
            <li> Heavy in the hand. Nice construction. I would only ask for about another inch of length. The short handle causes me to be too handsy with the shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used your standard Gillette/Schick razors, Thiers Issard straight razor, Feather AC DX raxor and this EJ is near the top!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this EJ shaves very close, very quickly with minimal effort and cleanup. You essentially get the best of both worlds. You have the low cost of the razor and disposable blades. But it never clogs up and there&#x27;s hardly any waste when you change out the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used feather blades - after using the Feather AC DX, i&#x27;m not sure I can change. The profile almost looks like it won&#x27;t cut aggressively enough, but i have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You still have to prep your skin, but not to the degree of that for a straigh razor shave. The double edge feather blades on this razor did not give me a burn on the first pass of a new blade, like the Feather AC DX did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle feels short, but it allows for maximum flexibility with strong control. i fear a longer handle would get in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The EJ is also easier to place a blade than the Feather AC DX.</li>
            <li> I used multi-blade safety razors since I started shaving 10 years ago. So I had no idea that using a double-edged razor is amazingly easy, and gives such good results. I haven&#x27;t had any more in-grown hairs and I have very little razor burn now. Shaving is also faster because the single blade on each side doesn&#x27;t clog up with hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself feels high quality and has a nice solid weight to it. It&#x27;s the first double-edge razor I&#x27;ve used so I don&#x27;t have any others to compare it to, but I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I figured that there was something different about the design a d that it would only benifit in the shave. Oh how I was right. This design only enhances the shave. There is no drag at all with this shaver no matter what brand of razor you use.</li>
            <li> This is a nice unit and has a good heft and excellent quality. It is also easy to keep clean without having water spots on it all the time. I combined this with a nice brush and holder set and have been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Quality is fantastic.  Chrome is flawless.  I love this razor.</li>
            <li> These little razors are excellent. Takes about a week to two weeks for your face to get used to it. Very close shave!  Could be a little heavier. I did notice that EJ now sells a heavier model and I will try that next. This one is great though. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> So I wanted to switch to a safety razor (also apparently known as a double-edge or DE razor) because I was sick of paying big bucks for replacement blades on mediocre commercial razors.  Plus, they tend to get gummed up and just don&#x27;t work so great in my opinion.  I was a little nervous because so many reviews of DE razors indicate that you should also be using a fancy shaving cream and an expensive brush.  I&#x27;m one of those people who waits until the last possible minute to finally roll out of bed in the morning and thus I don&#x27;t have any extra time to add anything to my routine.  If it takes an extra 30 seconds to work up a proper lather with a brush and shave cream or soap, that&#x27;s 30 seconds I don&#x27;t have.  I wanted to continue to use cheap canned shaving cream which, while possibly not conducive to the best possible shave, is inexpensive and quick to apply.  The reviews of DE razors almost make it seem like you MUST use a fancy brush and the best possible cream, so I was a little nervous about ordering the Edwin Jagger razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I can tell you it works fine with cheap canned shaving cream.  No problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the razor itself, it is well build and solid feeling and does a very nice job.  I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands of blades yet, as the included ones seem to work fine.  I find each blade lasts almost a week, which is pretty good considering how cheap they are.  I do, however, have a few nits to pick with the Jagger razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The handle is too short.  I&#x27;m guessing they make the handle so short in order to discourage you from using too much pressure and cutting yourself.  Fair enough, as you could potentially slice and dice your mug pretty bad if you hold it like a baseball bat.  But as it is, my ring finger and pinky don&#x27;t even fit on the handle, so it&#x27;s a bit odd.  No big deal, but odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Comparing it to my dad&#x27;s DE razor from decades ago (no idea what brand), his had a cool butterfly mechanism.  If I remember correctly, you pushed a little button on the side and the top gently popped open for you to change the blade.  The Jagger requires you to basically disassemble it.  You have to unscrew the handle and take the head unit apart.  The first time my wife saw me standing there with the shaver in 3 pieces her comment was &amp;#34;You broke it already?!&amp;#34;  I explained to her that that&#x27;s the way you&#x27;re supposed to change the blade, but I have to admit it really does feel like you&#x27;re breaking it.  I know that giving it a fancy opening mechanism would mean moving parts, and moving parts would mean potential failure, but still... it feels like there&#x27;s got to be a more elegant way than dis-assembly to change the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) There is no way to tell which side of the blade you already used.  It really should have a little mark of some kind on it - Side A and Side B or red dot/blue dot or something like that.  That way you would know &amp;#34;I already used Side A yesterday, so I&#x27;ll use Side B today.&amp;#34;  Unfortunately there is no such marking, and thus no way to tell how much each side of the blade has been used.  This is actually my biggest nit and I&#x27;m frankly shocked that the designers have not addressed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operationally though, it works great and produces a very close shave.  Nits aside, it is still a pleasure to use.f I remember correctly, you pushed a little button on the side and the top gently popped open for you to change the blade.

            <li> I have been DE Safety and wet shaving for a couple years now. I have been using a &#x27;79 Gillette Speed Safe for those couple of years with the Dorco Platinum razors and have been very happy with DE shaving, I basically have zero razor burn, no ingrown hairs anymore that I got all the time from the Mach series of disposable razors 3 and 4 blade versions for the 15 years prior that I had been shaving.  I had been eye balling this Edwin Jagger for some time now, but had put it off because I was pretty happy with my razor, but decided to splurge on myself and on something I use every day.  I have shaved with it about 3 times now and  it blows my mind how amazing this razor is. It is like going from driving a Honda Accord for 2 years, then going and jumping in a Ferrari.  This razor is smooth, feels like you cannot put it on a bad angle and feels safer than the Mach razors.  This cuts smooth and effortlessly as it has a nice heft to it and the top is rounded perfectly to give you a consistent razor angle against your skin.  I feel like I would have to literally try very hard to nick myself with this razor.  This might even get me to try a sharper feather style razor blade.  If you are looking to get into DE shaving, buy this first as it is not that expensive for the quality you get (Handmade in England) and the performance you will get out of it. If you are looking for a new razor just because, this one will not disappoint you.  FYI: My wet shaving tools are the Semogue Boar Brush, Colonel Conk Santa fe Shave bowl, and currently using colonel conk almond soap, plus the colonel conk razor and brush stand.</li>
            <li> If you are tired of buying razors at the store that they don&#x60;t supply blades for after a year or so. You can&#x60;t go wrong with a razor like this, it WORKS. You will always be able to get blades to fit it period. I was going to buy the  razor on TV from the pawn shop guy, but I didn&#x60;t appreciate the way they did business. It may have been  great razor? But they said my debit card didn&#x60;t go through. Aha the next day I went on line, not only did it not go through, they charged my card for extra blades I didn&#x60;t order. So I sent the merchandise back. I will only do business with companies that conduct business above board. Amazon to this point has represented themselves well, and produced exactly what they said they would. I can live with that, if Amazon ever disappoints me, trust they will know it!</li>
            <li> This razor is awesome.. Ready to use, easy to use and has a nice chrome finish. This razor out performs allot of the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> did you received product.</li>
            <li> I love love love this razor. It is my fourth double edge safety razor, and by far the easiest to shave with. the chrome is super smooth, and it will shave as close as you need. Personally, I use Astra platinums after trying dozens. They&#x27;re cheap and leave a very comfortable shave.  I&#x27;ll buy another Edwin Jagger when this one&#x27;s gone, but if you keep it clean and polish it every so often, it should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> First off, this is my first DE Safety Razor! I have been shaving with this razor for a few weeks now, and have finally learned the technique. As other posts have said this razor does have some heft to, similar to the Merkur 34C, but much lighter than the Merkur Future. In my opinion, for the price, it&#x27;s a wonderful beginner safety razor. I plan on buying the Future soon, but I&#x27;m glad I started with this one.</li>
            <li> Product came new in box wrapped in tissue paper, and it has been great. Boyfriend loves his new razor, much better than using disposable ones.</li>
            <li> If your too used to Gilette, this may take a while to get a hand of. It will also take longer to shave, so keep that in mind. It used to take me 12 minutes to shave with the mach 3, now it takes me 20-25 minutes to shave.The build quality is great though.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about this other than it is fantastic. The weight is perfectly balanced so that you can let the blade do the work. There is no added pressure needed when letting this glide across your skin which leads to an amazingly smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This had been my razor of choice until I dropped it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A three foot fall onto a fiberglass tub and it broke.&lt;br /&gt;Now if the handle had broke, I wouldn&#x27;t have been terribly surprised - I mean I did drop it.&lt;br /&gt;But the bolt which attaches the handle to the head sheared.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t guess how much experience any of you have had with metal and bolts - but if this razor was made with any kind of quality metal whatsoever, this nearly 1/4\\&quot; bolt should have been able to take being thrown at a brick wall as hard as you can throw it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;m not saying that the razor should survive such abuse - just that a metal bolt breaking under the force of a 3 ft drop indicates TERRIBLE choice of materials and manufacturing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use this kind of construction on a razor of this price and &#x27;pedigree&#x27; is shameful.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap children&#x27;s toys have a higher quality of construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor, and read the other negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;This COULD have been a great razor - were it not for the poor construction.</li>
            <li> Great razor. This is the first razor I ever bought. Although wary of the &amp;#34;starting costs&amp;#34; of wet shaving, I was afraid to buy a cheap Chinese razor and decide against wet shaving, which would leave me wondering if a better razor would have made the difference for me. So, I bypassed the cheap stuff and went straight to this bad boy. It was a great decision. This razor isn&#x27;t too aggressive, which is great for starting out. This is a very popular razor and I can see why. It is beautiful and has a good weight to it, so it can easily slide across your skin, leaving you baby butt smooth. The head and comb are 2 pieces, which unscrew from the handle, which allows for easy loading/unloading of your razor, as well as easy cleaning. I can&#x27;t find a single issue with this gorgeous razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Great for starters and those experienced in wet shaving. Attractive, good weight, not too aggressive, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> pretty awesome razor until you drop it. head/screw is made of pot metal and will snap if you arent careful. for the price it is a good entry level safety razor.</li>
            <li> A very good feeling razor. It works very well and gives an aggressive shave with an Astra blade. I have just gone back to double edge shaving after giving them up many years ago to shave with multiple blade shavers that caused some ingrown hairs.This was against my father advice who tried multiple blades for 1 month then went back to his Gillette Super Speed and an old English razor. I have gone back to my dad&#x27;s era and as the old saying goes Father knows Best. The Edwin Jagger also works well with the Derby blades that are more forgiving when you start off, or go back to DE shaving. Don&amp;#34;t worry about the nicks when you start, the rewards and pleasure of shaving will be worth it. A good value reliable razor.</li>
            <li> No complaints, takes some time to get the hang of wet shaving with a safety razor. Give it some time, way less irritation and way closer shave than electric or cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> Everybody says so, and it is SUCH an industrially artistic piece...I&#x27;ve read that their chrome plating is done by the same folks who plate the parts for Rolls Royce! It isn&#x27;t much more expense than the competition, so if you positively love nice things, buy EJ!</li>
            <li> I did TONS of research on which razor to buy! I looked at Parker, I looked at Jagger, and I looked at about 4 others who&#x27;s names escape me right now! one thing I will say is that I wish the handle was a little longer for my big hands! but the durability of this razor is still nice. I never shaved with a DE razor before! but I gave it a go and only nicked myself twice. nothing to be proud of? think again for someone who has never used this I did a fine job of not gashing my face! this says a lot for the razor! and the blades ! I recommend the titanium coated Stainless Steel Blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is keep a nice angle, and go slow! take your time to shave your face! this is an Art form not a race! you want a race you need to buy a 10 dollar cartridge for your Gillett Blade. I can tell you this much! for 10 dollars I got 100 blades. if I used each blade ones per side and threw it away thats still 200 shaves! Beat that for 10 bucks!</li>
            <li> It takes a bit to get used to this type of shaving but now even my wife uses this! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have a medium-heavy beard.  Not a blue face guy, or have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at Noon, but I&#x27;ve got some heavy beard on the chin area.  The whole face is at least medium, my neck needs shaving as well.  This shaver cannot do the job.  The problem is that the gap between the blade and the blade holder is too narrow to get the thick whiskers and it also clogs up too fast.  If I ran over the same area 3-4 times, rinsing the blade it works.  That&#x27;s not good enough for me to switch.  The razor looks nice!  I wanted to like it.  I used different angles of approach and nothing got me past the design of it.  It&#x27;s done for safety - smaller gap, harder to slice up your face.  I get that.  There are other brands and models that have bigger gaps.  You have to be more careful with those I believe.  If you&#x27;re a guy with a lighter beard this is probably fine.  Also, when I was younger and my beard not as tough, it would have worked better.  Otherwise, don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m knew to this type of razor as I&#x27;ve used either electric clippers or disposable ones up until this point.  I really like the weight of the razor, however I will say that you have to be careful using it because of this.  Little to no &amp;#34;force&amp;#34; is needed when shaving or you&#x27;ll have nicks all over the place.  I&#x27;m glad I invested in this. I&#x27;ll get infinitely more mileage out of it and it&#x27;s a great value over the store bought disposable razors.</li>
            <li> This is a precision tool. It&#x27;s worth the extra money to have nice things.  If you are a discriminating gentleman you would appreciate this razor.****update.***years later the threads binded up. It&#x27;s soft brass. But the company replaced it. So cool.</li>
            <li> this razor is the best right out of the box I have every had. I have the razor now about 6 months and no nicks, and balanced just right for me.</li>
            <li> Works great. Good price. Best razor. Will never but anything else. Leaves such a smooth surface it&#x27;s amazing. And shave less often</li>
            <li> Brought this hoping that it would play the NFL song. Does mot work but for the price silly to return. Thx Jim</li>
            <li> I have not been a fan of the Derby Blades, but the razor itself.. So smooth, a good heft to it. Extremely well crafted.</li>
            <li> My everyday razor is the Merkur 34c and I needed a second razor to keep in my travel kit so I thought I&#x27;d try the Edwin Jagger.  I&#x27;ve used it over and over and just can&#x27;t get the same good shave I get with my Merkur.  My biggest complaint is the sharp corners.  The head&#x27;s corners are very sharp and jab me repeatedly while shaving.  I just ordered another 34c to replace this.</li>
            <li> This is the first safety razor I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s great. It was a little shorter than I expected but that&#x27;s not a bad thing. I find the shorter handle works better when shaving anyway. It&#x27;s pretty light but still has enough weight that you can just position the razor on your face and let the weight of the razor do the cutting.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to assemble/disassemble and clean and holds the razor blade very well (so that there is no jiggling).&lt;br /&gt;The handle get&#x27;s a little slippery when wet but that&#x27;s not been a problem so far.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this razor. Excellent quality razor!</li>
            <li> Greatest shaving razor ever made, period. Long stubble short stuble, no mater what, perfect shave every time. Not to mention the fact that the piece it self is pure craftsmanship. Top notch!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase,sidenote: make sure you rinse off the wax on the razors before inserting into the razor holder.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Razor as a gift for a very &amp;#34;High End Uncle&amp;#34; of mine...He absolutely loved it!  He defintely knows quality and was more than happy with this!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor on the recommendation of Reddit&#x27;s &amp;#34;Wicked Edge&amp;#34; subreddit, and boy does it deliver some sick results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor was small enough to fit in your hand, and the blade was very sharp. I&#x27;m not ashamed to admit I gave myself a few knicks as I went against the grain of my whiskers (a daring but ill-advised move).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great purchase, and a very classy-looking razor.</li>
            <li> First off this razor is beautiful. The mixture of chrome and ebony is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different safety razors including the merkur 34c and I enjoy the weight and design of this over all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I was unsure of when ordering this specific Edwin Jagger was the fact that it&#x27;s handle is smooth, rather than textured like some of the other EJ. I have not had any gripping issues while my hands have been wet or with some shaving soap on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are doing yourself a disservice by shaving with a multi-blade cartridge razor. I use to get razor bumps and pretty bad irritation on my face and neck, but since switching to the DE safety razor I have had no more issues. There is a bit of a learning curve, but be patient and you will start having better quality shaves with no irritation. Heck, I enjoy shaving with this razor and look forward to it.</li>
            <li> I loved this razor enough that when I dropped it on the tile floor and it broke, that I immediately ordered another one. Yup, two weeks later, I dropped it again, and broke the replacement. I have two other safety razors (one at work, and one at home), neither of which is as nice as this one. If I didn&#x27;t have the dropsies, I would give this razor 5 stars, but the handle is just a little too brittle for someone as clumsy as me.</li>
            <li> Great razor, great price, very durable.</li>
            <li> Hailing from Sheffield, England long known for its steel manufacture and reputation for excellence comes the Edwin Jagger line of safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;Shorter, stubby and with a heft suggesting the solid feel of a quality fountain pen or the solid stock feel of the grip of a Morgan gear shift the Edwin Jagger razor is an excellent addition to the morning ritual most men wake up to.&lt;br /&gt;The Edwin Jagger compares favorably to the Merkur long handle safety razor, though slightly more &#x27;agressive&#x27; in nature.&lt;br /&gt;The the shorter, more stubby handle is relatively easy to grip and as others have noted is not slippery in wet hands as you might expect. All together a great value!&lt;br /&gt;The black and chrome is an elegant little addition to any man&#x27;s shaving kit, suggesting the black tie and art deco clubs of the 20s and 30s. If they had been around during the 40s, one imagines a  jowl-cheeked Winston Churchill demanding his secretary replace his straight-razor after trying to shave during the blitz: &#x27;do call those Edwin Jagger fellows and have a safety razor sent, I damn near cut my throat during that last raid!&#x27;.</li>
            <li> O.K. so i bought this in the hopes that it would be better for my razor bumps and im so glad that I did.Ive used this three times this week already and no nicks no cuts no blood on my collars,I wish i had learned to shave like this to begin with.Its important to watch some youtube videos on proper wet shaving techniques before you jump in full force and destroy your face.Even though i have to shave 2 times in a row and its not supersmooth shave im more than alright with this plus it feels nice taking a little longer and using a good shave soap and some decent aftershave.I would call it a damn fine shave.</li>
            <li> After using this razor I will never go back to the overpriced multi blade razors.  Perfectly weighted, feels good in my hand and on my face.  It looks great too.</li>
            <li> Paired with a sharp blade (my choice is the Giillette Silver Blue or 7 O&#x27;clock Black) and you&#x27;ll wonder why you waited so long to switch! My only reservation might be if you have large hands. The handle is short. I also have a Feather razor (the $ 20 by Jatai) and that handle is a good deal longer. I easily switch between the two. You can&#x27;t go wrong with either the Jagger or the Feather. Both shave well with sharp blades.</li>
            <li> Got this for the boyfriend, he loved it and it looks very nice and classy on our bathroom sink with the SimplyBeautiful deluxe razor and brush stand and the Omega boar brush with the white handle. They match up really nicely.</li>
            <li> Incredibly impressed with this little razor. It&#x27;s diminutive size takes nothing away from the crisp lines and beautiful chrome finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s completely turned a chore into a pleasurable hobby and without taking even the smallest step backward in the fineness of my shave, my shave quality has actually improved since moving on from the &amp;#34;five razor marketing hypester.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes shaving gentlemanly again. With only small modifications in how you hold your razor and the amount of pressure that you apply, you will be receiving the closest, most comfortable shaves of your life.  And let&#x27;s not forget price...never spend $20 for a set of four cartridges again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend pennies, not dollars for the best shaves that money can buy!</li>
            <li> Quality is top notch, very well made. This is my first DE, so I can&#x27;t speak too much as far as comparing it to others. I have always used cartridges, but even my first time with this was probably the best shave of my life. I thought it would be harder or more painful, it isn&#x27;t. Frankly, my face feels better than ever. Haven&#x27;t even nicked myself yet (of course now that I said something, I&#x27;m sure I will). I&#x27;m never going back to cartridges, and with the quality and comfort of this razor I can&#x27;t see why I won&#x27;t be using it the rest of my life. Some mentioned that the razor was slippery when wet. It looks like it would be, but I haven&#x27;t had this problem yet.</li>
            <li> Nice razor, but it slipped out of my hand in the shower and broke.</li>
            <li> a lot easier to use than you would think. good close shave. save money on blades. 4 more words required.</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving about a year ago. I didn&#x27;t know that I was getting into an obsession, but I have loved every part about it. I started with a 1959 Gillette FatBoy adjustable, retired that for a Parker 96r Long Handle and have used that ever since I purchased it. Then I decided I would upgrade my Mug, so I purchased the Edwin Jagger black porcelain apothecary style mug. Then I wanted to get away from the stiff Boars hair brush and went with the black handle Edwin Jagger Badger hair brush. Feeling like I should complete the set I finally purchased this razor. I was excited to use it when it got here so I didn&#x27;t shave for about 2 or 3 days to really test it and the Derby blades (I used Feather blades previously) and to my luck, it was a better more efficient shave than I had with the Parker 96r. I am now selling my Parker and will be using my Edwin Jagger De86bl as my regular razor! If you are deciding on whether or not to get this razor, just do it. It is cheap and will last forever, and you will not regret the quality craftsmanship nor the quality shave!</li>
            <li> The Edwin Jagger DE86, DE87 and DE89 all have the same heads (the only difference being the handle) so all three of these models will virtually shave the same.  I chose the DE86 purely for aesthetics.  These models are all very forgiving which makes any of them perfect for beginners who are trying to learn the proper technique without cutting their face to ribbons in the process.  If that’s you, I’d absolutely recommend getting this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I’ve been wet shaving for many years and I find this razor to be a little too forgiving.  I just can’t quite seem to get a BBS shave using this model.  I have to add a little pressure and go over the same spot many times, which still doesn’t always yield the results I’m looking for.  It seems to be almost foolproof which I suppose is what makes it so great for beginners. It’s a gorgeous razor and I don’t have any complaints about construction. I just find that it doesn’t expose enough of the blade to really get the kind of quality, close shave that a DE razor is supposed to offer.</li>
            <li> Great razor. Just be sure you get a proper case to keep the pieces from jostling together during travel. Last thing you want are indentations on the shaving surfaces of your safety razor.</li>
            <li> And if I had, it would have been a five star rating for a first-class shave. That one star got subtracted tonight, when my wife accidentally knocked it off of the bathroom counter. It snapped at the neck where it screws in. Not exactly good build quality for such a popular razor.</li>
            <li> I used to hate to shave, but now it&#x27;s one of my favorite parts of the day!</li>
            <li> Purchased two of these for family members and they&#x27;re fantastic shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the beautiful plating, they fit the hand well, have a good weight, and are a forgiving razor.&lt;br /&gt;Teens just starting out, women, and experienced wet shavers can all enjoy a smooth, close, shave with this EJ product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas after doing lots of research. He absolutely adores it (along with all of the other products to go with the razor).</li>
            <li> I really enjoy my razor.  I use it daily.  Had to learn how to shave all over again at 39.</li>
            <li> I went from a Merkur 180 to this Edwin Jagger. This product blew me away. It&#x27;s quality is better than veery good and paired with the Shark Super Chrome (after going through a sampler pack) I have been able to get the closest and best shave of my life.</li>
            <li> This product produced a superior shave to anything I have ever used whether it be blade or electric.  Going old school was a great choice as I have a very thick and quick growing beard.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because it seemed like a lot of people recommend this razor as first razor for person beginning to learn safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;It is very sturdy, nicely built and gives great shaves.&lt;br /&gt;It is fairly mild, not so irritating afterall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason for 4 stars is that the razor doesn&#x27;t give you the closest shave, but you really shouldn&#x27;t shoot for the closest shave when you first start wetshaving.  You should shoot for comfortable/irritation-free shave, and when your skill set is ready, you should move on to more aggressive razors like open-comb razors or slants, which are known to cut hairs more efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still a DE noob, and have only been wetshaving for 2 months, but I can tell you that this razor will give you good shave no matter what blade you put in.  I have tried derby&#x27;s, astra sp, feather, polsilver, gillette silver blue, red personna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of all, feathers and gillette silver blues gave me the closest and most effortless shaves.  Polsilver was close 2nd/3rd, but wasn&#x27;t as close, but in terms of comfort, polsilver beats feather/GSB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derby&#x27;s, too dull&lt;br /&gt;Red personna  &#x3D; middle ground&lt;br /&gt;astra SP &#x3D; too irritating to my neck</li>
            <li> This is my first safety blade razor, and after two weeks, so far so good. I think the claims of being a closer shave are a bit exaggerated, but it should definitely save money now that Gillette isn&#x27;t giving away free razors anymore. I was worried about cuts, but the design is great, no cuts and it is actually easier to shave under my nose with this razor than the Mach 3, Fusion, et al.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend a try if you&#x27;re tired of spending so much on the plastic vibrating razors or the expensive shave &#x27;clubs.&#x27; The only downside is that it adds about five minutes to the morning routine (maybe more if you&#x27;re used to an electric razor, but a much better shave than an electric). Also, most gel shaving creams will work fine with the razor - there&#x27;s no reason to buy a brush and shave soap to go with it unless you just really want to be fancy for your own enjoyment.</li>
            <li> Dunno why I thought I needed 16 blades with which to shave - seriously. I mean, yeah, you might need 16 blades to take down one of the giants from Game of Thrones, but you only need one to eradicate the stubble of one&#x27;s face (or legs, m&#x27;lady).</li>
            <li> A good, nice looking safety razor. I&#x27;ve been using this EJ razor a couple years now with no problem. If you do have extra large hands this razor might not be suitable for you as it is a little on the  smaller side. Also, be sure to assemble it correctly or your not going to get a good clean cut from it.</li>
            <li> I just opened the box, and what a beautiful razor !!!!  The quality is something hard to find in this day and age, I just am starting to go back to shaving like I did back in High School, am going to go shave right now and will write another review once done ! If this shaves as well at it looks it will be a sure winner !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well ! first shave and it came back like riding a bike, I guess once you shaved like this previously it just comes back, great shave, three passes, a nice thick proraso sandalwood shave cream followed by a nice shave balm, have forgotten what a nice feeling it is to have a shave like this, so glad I made this choice, and it will only get better as I collect more shave creams, lotions, and balms ! Treat yourself to one of the few nice things left in life ! A good relaxing shave with some great products !  So Disapointed, a beautiful razor to look at , but did not last, enjoyed it while it held together though, now will look for another brand and type of safety razor, if you are looking for a beautiful work of art for your Razor stand this is it, but as far as lasting a lifetime like I had hoped, well, it just did not !!!! After cleaning this morning and reassembling, the screw snapped off !!!!!!!! I have been very careful cleaning and maintaining this razor, had my old Gillette since High school and threw it away when this once came, sick to my stomach now !!!!! What a mistake,,,,,,, do not buy this razor if you are looking for something to last many years, because this one will not !!!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor and it worked great, for a while that is.  It has a well weighted handle that gave me a smooth and clean shave.  I used it for about 3 months but then accidentally dropped it in the shower once.  When it hit the floor the Faux Ebony portion of the handle cracked and snapped off of the handle, revealing an ugly brass interior.  I thought that for the $30 I shelled out for an item as simple as this, it would be the last razor I would ever need to buy.  It still works, but the absence of a grip feels awkward and this thing is going to impress nobody- try not to drop it.  A $6 full metal razor that I had previously bought holds up better than this.</li>
            <li> All the reviews saying how great this razor looks are spot on. Those saying it is too slippery to hold make no sense to me after using it for the past four weeks. No problems at all. Have used Derby Extra razors, Shark blades, Gillete 7 o&#x27;clock and Feather high stainless. All great except the Feathers which were like shaving with a plasma welder (too damn aggressive).&lt;br /&gt;If you are hesitating to buy one of these- don&#x27;t. It is an excellent razor.</li>
            <li> After a few friends switched to this product for shaving and recommended it, I decided to try it for myself. I have always had problems with ingrown hairs and rashes when shaving which really sucks being in the army. Since I&#x27;ve switched to this razor I get about 75% less ingrown hairs and a closer shave. Would recommend to everyone. (who needs to shave...)</li>
