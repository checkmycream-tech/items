            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to try \\&quot;one more product\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I was really pleased with the result</li>
            <li>I ordered 3 more to have on hand for gifts.</li>
            <li>I should of bought more.</li>
            <li>The dispenser top came separately, and when I put it on the bottle, it did not work.  </li>
            <li>I have to take the top off and pour out the lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been enjoying using this amplifying lotion on my hair and have noticed a difference in the shine and thickness.  </li>
            <li>okay..</li>
            <li>The product creates more volume &amp; body in my hair.</li>
            <li>For the price, it works as well as most.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li>yes my amazing side effect is still working strong and my toe nails are amazing, white, and healthy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a more natural-looking effect, so if you are looking for huge hair then this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>Although it isn&#x27;t what I expected, I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Is easy to use and style my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rate it higher if it had a nice smell.</li>
            <li>It gives me the control I need for my fine hair, and my hair feels fuller.  </li>
            <li>ever helped my fine hair look thicker</li>
            <li>on this journey (I have always had fine hair even before I started dying my hair)</li>
            <li>My hair is so fine, I think it is beyond help, but this did make a difference.  </li>
            <li>In addition to doing what it claims it also smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>this product is fabulous, my hair looks fuller..</li>
            <li>For the price I was pleasantly surprised how good this product worked.</li>
            <li>I might give this lotion another chance just to make sure I am doing it right....</li>
            <li>My hair is highly volume with a nice bounce with shine.  </li>
            <li>Amplifying lotion really does make my hair feel thicker and more manageable without leaving residue.  </li>
            <li>I really do recommend this product  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good to use it while using their Biotin shampoo which I will try next.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful product for thickening the individual strands of hair to present a thicker and fuller look.</li>
            <li>and I love this particular one.  </li>
            <li>Its great for adding a little body</li>
            <li>Does an amazing job of giving my fine, straight hair LOTS of extra volume and texture.</li>
            <li>As for my other review, yes my amazing side effect is still working strong and my toe nails are amazing, white, and healthy!ew,</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it as I&#x27;ve used this product before but can not find it in a local store.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about this but discovered it doesn&#x27;t do much at all.  </li>
            <li>Noticed the results right away.</li>
            <li>Also it seems to help my hair dry faster on its own.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted to like this lotion since I&#x27;ve had good experience with one of their shampoo/conditioner sets, but my hair feels dehydrated and looks less shiny when I use the amplifying lotion.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products and nothing</li>
            <li>I really like these products a lot and will continue using them!</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>And you only need a small amount to get excellent results.  </li>
            <li>My OGX Amplifying Thick &amp; Full Biotin Lotion arrived on time in good condition.</li>
            <li>Works great on hair that was very dry and over processed - brought back the shine and wellness to my hair!!</li>
            <li>then hopefully will be writing a positive review *crosses fingers</li>
            <li>the first time I used this product, it definitely  made my fine hair look and even feel thicker.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair super soft and shiny fixes my split ends like they were not even there would buy again.</li>
            <li>but I read about this in Shop Smart magazine and then read the reviews</li>
            <li>The smell of this is fine with me, but I wish this came in a larger bottle</li>
            <li>Definitely makes a difference in blow drying &amp; styling my fine air.</li>
            <li>I have short and baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>but I honestly had little hope.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It gives my hair body, thickness and a gentle wave it doesn&#x27;t have without it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use a dime sized amount when I&#x27;m ready to blowdry my hair.</li>
            <li>Really, I think it has just improved the health of my hair, so it looks fuller.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t give me the thickness I am looking  for...and the whole lift at the root thing...</li>
            <li>But I could see if you where to wash your hair with a shampoo and conditioner to give moisture to your hair, this could be too much softness.</li>
            <li>This product (when used with the shampoo and conditioner) gives so much volume.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products including the expensive salon products, this by far is the best I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Might be better for those with thick, full hair with a lot of body.</li>
            <li>So about 12 maybe closer to 14 years ago I started dying my hair brown, to dark brown, and it gave me the feeling of looking more</li>
            <li>Only needs a little bit to do a good job.</li>
            <li>I only wash my hair twice a week, and both the volume and the lovely scent last every day between washes.</li>
            <li>Now a little bit about my background to help more people understand my results...</li>
            <li>This lotion is good depending on what you want it for, cause it can make your hard go hard, but it does make it smell nice and go thick, and it also help to lay down my closure, so I don&#x27;t have to runaway&#x27;s sticking up, also delivery came like 2 days after buying, really great.</li>
            <li>I have been using mousse prior to this product, and even though it does have a tendency to dry out my hair, I get better results.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair with some slight wave to it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product - ordered on line because usually can&#x27;t find it on the shelf in stores -</li>
            <li>Now my hair already is long, but now I have grown an extra 2 inches in my hair and need to get a hair cut (well trim the ends), I also notice the crown (top of my hair) is actually thicker.</li>
            <li>it not only gives volume, but it smooths the hair without weighing it down for a natural, healthy look.</li>
            <li>It really adds volume especially if I use a blow dryer afterwards.  </li>
            <li>So now since I bought all the products (fast track to now); I have to say it doesn&#x27;t just give me the appearance of fuller hair, my hair is actually thicker.</li>
            <li>Volume, shine and soft and silky feel.</li>
            <li>I am using the first bottle of Organix Thick and Full Biotin and Collagen Amplifying Lotion.  </li>
            <li>This product really does make my hair feel full and thick.  </li>
            <li>Just started using this product so its too early to see any results right now… will give a few weeks</li>
            <li>Not only is it making my hair strands stronger and fuller, I am also growing new hair strains (which actually make your hair thicker not just the hair strains you have)</li>
            <li>I just use a small amount on my freshly washed hair.  </li>
            <li>Not that bad and not that good either</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Now my hair already is long, but now I have grown an extra 2 inches in my hair and need to get a hair cut (well trim the ends), I also notice the crown (top of my hair) is actually thicker.</li>
            <li> it not only gives volume, but it smooths the hair without weighing it down for a natural, healthy look.</li>
            <li> It really adds volume especially if I use a blow dryer afterwards.  </li>
            <li> So now since I bought all the products (fast track to now); I have to say it doesn&#x27;t just give me the appearance of fuller hair, my hair is actually thicker.</li>
            <li> Volume, shine and soft and silky feel.</li>
            <li> I am using the first bottle of Organix Thick and Full Biotin and Collagen Amplifying Lotion.  </li>
            <li> This product really does make my hair feel full and thick.  </li>
            <li> Just started using this product so its too early to see any results right now… will give a few weeks</li>
            <li> Not only is it making my hair strands stronger and fuller, I am also growing new hair strains (which actually make your hair thicker not just the hair strains you have)</li>
            <li> I just use a small amount on my freshly washed hair.  </li>
            <li> Not that bad and not that good either</li>
            <li> For me use a round brush when drying and touch up in places I want a little more body with my curling iron , a little spray</li>
            <li> Maybe it has a long term effect, but short term</li>
            <li> Just imagine on natural black hair.</li>
            <li> I started using this to help my damaged, long overdue for a haircut, hair.  </li>
            <li> Just 3 pumps of this (I have long layered hair)</li>
            <li> Makes my thin, pin-straight hair act right.</li>
            <li> And I have baby hairs (now about 3 inches-4 inches long, like my daughter at three has!)</li>
            <li> I have very dark skin, dark brown eyes, and natural (I TRULY MEAN NATURAL), blonde blonde hair!</li>
            <li> I use a dime size amount on damp hair and let it dry...</li>
            <li> Was hard to get it to hold the style long enough to spray with freeze hairspray.  </li>
            <li> My hair holds all day long with just a little spray.</li>
            <li> Works well with other OGX thickening products.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months...</li>
            <li> maybe I am missing something...??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used products but now my hair is starting to thin.  </li>
            <li> I take the tablets every morning, and when I wash my hair (usually every two days), I use the shampoo, conditioner, and the lotion</li>
            <li> A small amount is</li>
            <li> it make my  thin  &amp; sometimes frizzy hair&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> I use this every day on my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Sort of expensive for something which doesn&#x27;t do anything that it is promoted to do.  </li>
            <li> Stinks!  </li>
            <li> But, the packaging is terrible.  </li>

            <li> I really like this product.  It gives me the control I need for my fine hair, and my hair feels fuller.  I also get a nice shine.  I&#x27;m quite pleased with&lt;br /&gt;This product.  The reason I ordered it on line was I couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the stores.</li>
            <li> This is amazing serum.  It does what it says and it smells wonderful doing it.  It gives my hair body, thickness and a gentle wave it doesn&#x27;t have without it.  I use this everyday.  Would not style my hair without it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Makes my thin, pin-straight hair act right. I&#x27;d rate it higher if it had a nice smell. No use using a nice smelling shampoo, this product goes on after and it smells just meh.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! And the price was great! Thanks</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this but discovered it doesn&#x27;t do much at all.  Sort of expensive for something which doesn&#x27;t do anything that it is promoted to do.  Don&#x27;t bother!</li>
            <li> Stinks!  It smells like a street walker.  I threw it away.</li>
            <li> This product really does make my hair feel full and thick.  Is easy to use and style my hair. I found out about this product in Prevention Magazine and ordered it on Amazon.  Love how it works and smells nice too!</li>
            <li> arrived as promised...</li>
            <li> My OGX Amplifying Thick &amp; Full Biotin Lotion arrived on time in good condition. I was thrilled to find it as I&#x27;ve used this product before but can not find it in a local store. It is a wonderful product for thickening the individual strands of hair to present a thicker and fuller look. It works better than it says it will! I never want to be without it.</li>
            <li> Just OK.  Didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I saw it on the KLG &amp; Hoda Today show. I like that it make my  thin  &amp; sometimes frizzy hair&lt;br /&gt;Look and feels fuller &amp; healthier.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product so its too early to see any results right now… will give a few weeks then hopefully will be writing a positive review *crosses fingers*</li>
            <li> I use this lotion overnight as an addition to a moisturizing mask. I&#x27;ll use a dime sized amount when I&#x27;m ready to blowdry my hair. Great product. Works well with other OGX thickening products.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, but it is very fine.  This product made my hair even more silky.  Was hard to get it to hold the style long enough to spray with freeze hairspray.  Not for me.  Might be better for those with thick, full hair with a lot of body.</li>
            <li> I started using this to help my damaged, long overdue for a haircut, hair.  I love it.  It really adds volume especially if I use a blow dryer afterwards.  Also it seems to help my hair dry faster on its own.  Its great for adding a little body and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on some of the reviews but I honestly had little hope. I have tried many different products and nothing ever helped my fine hair look thicker but I read about this in Shop Smart magazine and then read the reviews so I decided to try \\&quot;one more product\\&quot;. I was really pleased with the result the first time I used this product, it definitely  made my fine hair look and even feel thicker. I have tried many other products including the expensive salon products, this by far is the best I&#x27;ve tried.  I have short hair and I use 4 pumps, it seems to be the perfect amount. In addition to doing what it claims it also smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of the product, however when I apply it on, it doesn&#x27;t seem to amplify nor bodify my hair as promised - it just lays there.... I have been using mousse prior to this product, and even though it does have a tendency to dry out my hair, I get better results. I might give this lotion another chance just to make sure I am doing it right....we&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li> Amplifying lotion really does make my hair feel thicker and more manageable without leaving residue.  I ordered 3 more to have on hand for gifts.</li>
            <li> The smell of this is fine with me, but I wish this came in a larger bottle so I wouldn&#x27;t have to order multiple ones.</li>
            <li> My hair is highly volume with a nice bounce with shine.  I do like the smell too.  I should of bought more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a more natural-looking effect, so if you are looking for huge hair then this isn&#x27;t for you. Really, I think it has just improved the health of my hair, so it looks fuller. Although it isn&#x27;t what I expected, I am very happy with this product. It smells amazing and my hair is smoother and feels thicker.</li>
            <li> This is a good product,  Organix is a good brand in the world. I really do recommend this product  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> When I wrote my review on the biotin tablets, I had a great side effect occur, (look up my review for details)... So, like I said I would after writing that review, was to update with my progress from using both the tablets, cream, and shampoo/conditioner. I take the tablets every morning, and when I wash my hair (usually every two days), I use the shampoo, conditioner, and the lotion (all three of these products are cheaper at Wal-Mart (by the way). But the 10,000 mcg tablets are cheaper here on Amazon. It has been just about a month, since my last review about taking the tablets on a daily bases.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am taking the tablets, lotion, and shampoo/conditioner as part of my hair care routine. Now a little bit about my background to help more people understand my results... I have very dark skin, dark brown eyes, and natural (I TRULY MEAN NATURAL), blonde blonde hair! It use to look like I dyed my hair to try and be a blonde! So about 12 maybe closer to 14 years ago I started dying my hair brown, to dark brown, and it gave me the feeling of looking more natural!&lt;br /&gt;So on this journey (I have always had fine hair even before I started dying my hair), I decided I couldn&#x27;t and wouldn&#x27;t give up dying my hair. An if by chance that is why the products wouldn&#x27;t work, then it would be on me. So now since I bought all the products (fast track to now); I have to say it doesn&#x27;t just give me the appearance of fuller hair, my hair is actually thicker. Now my hair already is long, but now I have grown an extra 2 inches in my hair and need to get a hair cut (well trim the ends), I also notice the crown (top of my hair) is actually thicker. And I have baby hairs (now about 3 inches-4 inches long, like my daughter at three has!) Not only is it making my hair strands stronger and fuller, I am also growing new hair strains (which actually make your hair thicker not just the hair strains you have) I really like these products a lot and will continue using them! As for my other review, yes my amazing side effect is still working strong and my toe nails are amazing, white, and healthy!ew, yes my amazing side effect is still working strong and my toe nails are amazing, white, and healthy!</li>
            <li> I am using the first bottle of Organix Thick and Full Biotin and Collagen Amplifying Lotion.  I also use the shampoo of the same brand and ingredients.  Using together has made my hair seem thicker.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether this works or not.  I have not noticed any difference yet.  But, the packaging is terrible.  The dispenser top came separately, and when I put it on the bottle, it did not work.  I have to take the top off and pour out the lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying using this amplifying lotion on my hair and have noticed a difference in the shine and thickness.  I just use a small amount on my freshly washed hair.  I really like this product!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.  My hair is so fine, I think it is beyond help, but this did make a difference.  It would be great for most hair textures.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Can&#x27;t find it locally anymore</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months...I use a dime size amount on damp hair and let it dry...its okay..nothing I would write home about..fresh scent....I am changing up my hair care regimen, I will not use this after I have used the entire bottle...it doesn&#x27;t give me the thickness I am looking  for...and the whole lift at the root thing...maybe I am missing something...??</li>
            <li> Yes this was very good product! It gave me volume without having to use a ton of product ! A small amount is sufficient!!i would definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> For the price I was pleasantly surprised how good this product worked. I will buy it again. Really liked it.</li>
            <li> I use this product before blow drying my hair and it seems to help control the &amp;#34;flyaways&amp;#34;.  OGX has some of the best scents around and I love this particular one.  I read somewhere it&#x27;s good to use it while using their Biotin shampoo which I will try next.</li>
            <li> Does an amazing job of giving my fine, straight hair LOTS of extra volume and texture. I only wash my hair twice a week, and both the volume and the lovely scent last every day between washes. I hope they never discontinue this product!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Definitely makes a difference in blow drying &amp; styling my fine air. The product creates more volume &amp; body in my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!! it not only gives volume, but it smooths the hair without weighing it down for a natural, healthy look. Great stuff, does what it says it&#x27;ll do. Don&#x27;t need my mousse anymore. Just 3 pumps of this (I have long layered hair) and I&#x27;m good to go. I have fine hair with some slight wave to it.  But I could see if you where to wash your hair with a shampoo and conditioner to give moisture to your hair, this could be too much softness. So if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, try a volumizing shampoo &amp; conditioner and then use this after.      UPDATE:  I just found out they are going to discontinue this, so if you see it in the stores now, grab it!</li>
            <li> Not that bad and not that good either</li>
            <li> Hair feels very healthy</li>
            <li> Smells great, like the beach !! Volume, shine and soft and silky feel. For me use a round brush when drying and touch up in places I want a little more body with my curling iron , a little spray and I&#x27;m good to go !!! I have short and baby fine hair. I&#x27;ve always had to use volume products, shampoo, styling and hair spray. I wish I tried this line before!! Great product, shampoo is also very nice. I told my stylist and now she uses it in her salon.  ❤️</li>
            <li> Works great on hair that was very dry and over processed - brought back the shine and wellness to my hair!!</li>
            <li> This is the best volumizing product I&#x27;ve used.  It is not oily, goes on easy and makes hair nice and shiny.  And you only need a small amount to get excellent results.  I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> this product is fabulous, my hair looks fuller.. I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments.. thank you Organix !&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> Maybe it has a long term effect, but short term I don&#x27;t see any big difference in my hair.  For the price, it works as well as most.</li>
            <li> Only needs a little bit to do a good job.</li>
            <li> This lotion is good depending on what you want it for, cause it can make your hard go hard, but it does make it smell nice and go thick, and it also help to lay down my closure, so I don&#x27;t have to runaway&#x27;s sticking up, also delivery came like 2 days after buying, really great.</li>
            <li> Noticed the results right away. Yes, it works.  Just imagine on natural black hair. Ibelieve this is a good product.</li>
            <li> This product (when used with the shampoo and conditioner) gives so much volume. and it also makes my hair feel thicker!</li>
            <li> Smells really good and I wanted to like this lotion since I&#x27;ve had good experience with one of their shampoo/conditioner sets, but my hair feels dehydrated and looks less shiny when I use the amplifying lotion. I also thought it would make my hair look thicker, but it didn&#x27;t. I didn&#x27;t even finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> What a great product!  You only need the tiniest drop and it makes all the difference!  Will be purchasing this again for sure!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair super soft and shiny fixes my split ends like they were not even there would buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this every day on my thin hair.  This lotion gives my hair body and shine.  My hair holds all day long with just a little spray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used products but now my hair is starting to thin.  It adds just enough without feeling anything.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Made my hair thicker and made it smell great!</li>
            <li> This hair product smells heavenly</li>
            <li> Love this product - ordered on line because usually can&#x27;t find it on the shelf in stores -</li>
