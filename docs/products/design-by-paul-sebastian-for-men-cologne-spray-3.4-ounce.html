    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> fast delivery. thank you. my husband loves this cologne .</li>
            <li> Met all expectations. Product was delivered quicker than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> My man will get what ever he wants if he wears this lol</li>
            <li> well worth the price, scent stays with you for long. Fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> The smell is sweet and mild. Perfect for someone who wants a mild but noticeable smell. Its not too strong or too light. My boyfriend has never wore anything before but he loved that it wasn&#x27;t strong and it last a fair amount of time.</li>
            <li> it is a great cologne at a super price light clean scent that lasts a long time would definitely buy it again</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, but did not know where to find a replacement. But, Amazon came through. I&#x27;m 79 years old, but this product, Paul Sebastian colohne spray, is also great for old folks---even my Bride of 60 years enjoys the &#x27;smell!&#x27; A great product for any guy.</li>
            <li> Great price on hard to find item.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping smells good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a great cologne for a man! It&#x27;s scent it&#x27;s just awesome! However the only thing I dislike is the size of it! They should make a bigger bottle</li>
            <li> this is the signature perfume for my husband. I love the smell on him. i&#x27;ll always buy it here for him.</li>
            <li> I have used this same cologne since 95. My grand daughters love this scent as does my wife and others. Will keep buying it as long as I can find it.</li>
            <li> I love it sign george</li>
            <li> My wife and daughters love the scent. It smells good but not feminine. Even had a lady I don&#x27;t know tell me she liked the scent.</li>
            <li> This is medium bodied mens fragrance with mixed notes of wood, citrus, and a hint of floral. Not for men who wear BRUT or Aqua Velva. This is best used as an evening or winter fragrance. This is an upscale fragrance that lasts, yet not overpowering by any means.</li>
            <li> On time. I have worn this for a few days and received many complements on the fragrance. Real happy</li>
            <li> Very weak scent with little lingering aroma.  Also, the cap appeared damaged and did not close properly.  I like the regular P.S. cologne&lt;br /&gt;for men because it&#x27;s long lasting and generally elicits positive comments.  I&#x27;m thinking &amp;#34;Design&amp;#34; was a lemon and this is an attempt to unload it using their good name to promote it.</li>
            <li> I always try to  keep this item instock for my husband and after 3 tries at the Marshall&#x27;s store where I can usually find it gave up and ordered it through amazon. It came right away and was just about the same as the store price. Glad you were able to have it available.</li>
            <li> I avoid spending lots of money for cologne, because at my age I am not interested in trying to find something that people find &amp;#34;attracting&amp;#34;.  I mostly look for value with a scent that will last throughout the day.  This cologne does that and smells quite nice in the process.</li>
            <li> Actually haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but based on the other reviews I expect I&#x27;ll like it.  I&#x27;m still searching for the cologne that &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; with my body chemistry.  But along the way, I&#x27;m finding different colognes that smell really good, whether perfect for my body chemistry or not.</li>
            <li> I gave it as a present to a family member in his twenties. He said he liked the fragrance a lot.</li>
            <li> I really like this PS Design, it smells like an upgraded Cool Water mixed with Calvin Klein Eternity in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is one of my ALLTIME FAVORITES. So you know that it hits the mark on all cylinders. Like I said the women LOVE it so you know it&#x27;s a hit with me .</li>
            <li> Smells great came quick</li>
            <li> Love this Colonge...I give as gifts and use for myself as well..Stays long time..Mixed notes of wood, citrus, and a hint of floral..Love it..</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance that lasts awhile. I&#x27;ve had a few compliments so that made me happy. Better than spending more for some that smell no better.</li>
            <li> it fine - never smelt it before but i tried - dont think id reorder</li>
            <li> I discovered this cologne in a clearance bin at Marshall’s Department store. Was truly surprised and amazed with the fragrance. Since then I tend to purchase two to three spray bottles at a time. Really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Has a  very nice clean and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells great on him</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great price. And got it in time.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy a fragrance that I had never tried before so I was pleasantly surprised with this. The fragrance is long-lasting and I get a lot of people asking me what I&#x27;m wearing and saying they want to purchase it for their loves ones. At this price point you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Warning, warning,  the fragrance is so pleasant and  so sexy.  I am not a jealous woman, but&lt;br /&gt;my husband was attracting too unwanted attention.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne!</li>
            <li> And expensive classic that my husband wears to work</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected in quality!</li>
            <li> Like this alot, not as good as PS itself but still good. Excellent delivery</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband and he seems to like it.  It has a nice clean&lt;br /&gt;fragrance with citrus undertones.</li>
            <li> I wear either this or Casual everyday.  I always get compliments.  I run a lot with groups and there are some women who just love it.  I&#x27;ve told them what I&#x27;m wearing and now their husbands have the same cologne.</li>

            <li> This is a great fragrance at a great price.  I bought it for my nephew for Christmas and he said he liked Paul Sebastian, but hadn&#x27;t tried this fragrance.  I assured him that he would love it...and he does!</li>
            <li> I had broken his bottle of Design by accident and this was a replacement.  It is one of his favorites.</li>
            <li> excellent!Subtle aroma but captivating.Female co workers liked it very much.Not overpowering.</li>
            <li> love it great price Amazon is great for finding the brands you like and at the greatest price when you live out in the middle of nowhere you dont have to wait</li>
            <li> great item, very hard to find in store.  I looked for this all over.&lt;br /&gt;The place I got it originally does not carry it any longer.&lt;br /&gt;shipped very fast. very happy I will order again.</li>
            <li> Great smell great deal. And my wife likes it which is most important.</li>
            <li> Good service at a reasonable price. Moderate strength,pleasant aroma. Not recommended if you like stronger evening cologne which I do.</li>
            <li> Excellent service, very compliments</li>
            <li> I have been having a hard time finding this product. The cologne smells great and the ease of ordering was simplistic. The low price made it that much more better.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance.  Excellent value&lt;br /&gt; Ordered this product twice due to price point and overall satisfaction.</li>
            <li> A great long lasting fragrance at a great price!</li>
            <li> I really like this fresh smelling cologne</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance but does not have any staying power. Probably would buy another fragrance from this company but would choose a different product......you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> We used to pay a lot more for this cologne in the department store.  This was a great buy!  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love the scent it&#x27;s my go to for when I&#x27;m getting ready to go out.</li>
            <li> Awesome fragrance and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Good, but doesn&#x27;t have the lasting power I would like. If I put this on before school, I want people to be able to smell it during the second half of school...</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite Cologne, and I must say he does smell yummy in it! He&#x27;s been wearing it for years now, and it&#x27;s getting really hard to find. I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it, I&#x27;ll have to find the recipe and make it for him myself! lol!!!</li>
