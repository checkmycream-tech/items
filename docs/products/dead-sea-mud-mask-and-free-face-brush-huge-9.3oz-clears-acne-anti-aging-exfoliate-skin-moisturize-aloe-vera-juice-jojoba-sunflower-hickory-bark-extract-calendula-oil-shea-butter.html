            <li>All opinions are my own</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own</li>

            <li>; stuff was like plaster and not as nice to put on.</li>

            <li>But it is fun and smells great.</li>
            <li>My face felt all tingly and healthy after I put this mask on my face - I couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing my skin felt while I was wearing it.  </li>
            <li>favorite part about this mud mask is that it’s not just for your face.</li>
            <li>I put this mask on for 20 minutes and my face has never felt tighter and more exfoliated.</li>
            <li>just okay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works for some people, but not for me.  </li>
            <li>so you can use more.  </li>
            <li>otherwise it will just lay on top of the skin.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I love the feeling my skin has</li>
            <li>The coverage thinner than I thought it would be, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Being a Makeup Artist and Beauty Enthusiast, I am always looking for the next best thing.</li>
            <li>Like most masks claim to do but DO NOT.</li>
            <li>a side note, I have washed dishes twice today since doing the test on one of my hands and the treated hand still feels softer and more supple than the untreated.  </li>
            <li>a side note, I have washed dishes twice today since doing the test on one of my hands and the treated hand still feels softer and more supple than the untreated.  </li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>, after using this twice a week for over a month, I still love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working at first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You get more for the money with this product than the Body Shop product.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I am more inclined to purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>This product feels better on my face.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mud mask.  </li>
            <li>And the best part was that it lasted until time for my next weekly mud mask.  </li>

            <li>Hands down best mud mask.  </li>
            <li>This mud mask is nice, I didn&#x27;t find anything super extraordinary about it</li>
            <li>and it felt fine.  </li>
            <li>stuff from the pharmacy (with a huge list of ingredients).</li>
            <li>When I take it off, I can feel the smoother texture of my face, and it helps keep my skin shine free.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly &amp; have been using it day &amp; night since I received it</li>
            <li>I am always looking for great facial products that won&#x27;t make my skin break out.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll tell you what after you wash it off your skin feels silky smooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has no smell [to me anyways], Its a light to medium texture.</li>
            <li>My skin never felt so smooth in my life.</li>
            <li>When I opened the jar the mud was so velvety smooth and had no odor whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I had a makeup free day ahead of me</li>
            <li>I applied it lightly, but can be applied thicker if you prefer.</li>
            <li>I enjoy my &amp;#34;Me&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I got it for free to review and tried it yesterday.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel smooth as a baby</li>
            <li>Now we&#x27;ve added this mask and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>works good, really soft skin after using.</li>
            <li>and it really is working!!!  </li>
            <li>I washed it off &amp; my pores were pretty close to being non visible!!</li>
            <li>Using the product was super easy.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this as soon as I got it, that I posted after using it</li>
            <li>This mud mask feels cool, creamy, and refreshing when first applied to the skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;its got some great ingredients like Aloe Vera, Jojoba Oil, Sunflower, Hickory Bark, Calendula and Shea Butter creates, an all-natural, familiar combination that can help with a wide variety of skin problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The special oils</li>
            <li>Highly recommended without hesitation to anyone who wants to look good and feel good.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>When I rinsed it off, my skin felt soft and amazing.  </li>
            <li>A good deal if you exfoliate regularly with a mud mask</li>
            <li>The texture is perfect not too watery &amp; not to thick</li>
            <li>I liked the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>The mask was cool and reminded me of the consistency of pudding.  </li>
            <li>I have never been a big mud mask girl, but I have tried a few and this is honestly one of the best!</li>
            <li>keeping my face cool.</li>
            <li>I would recommend only using it once or twice a week, because it has some really good tightening qualities.</li>
            <li>There was no bad odor like some mud products.</li>
            <li>The first thing I have to say is I love that right on the label it lists the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I like to let it dry completely for the best exfoliation results.  </li>
            <li>I left it on for 20 minutes and it easily rinsed off with warm water.  </li>
            <li>However, I did not expect to get BURNED by this product as other women have experienced.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my mild eczema, I read the ingrediants,Shea butter, Aloe vera juice, Sunflower oil, Jojoba oil, Hickory bark extract,Calendula oil.</li>
            <li>Applying the mask is quick and I like the fact there&#x27;s no overpowering odor.</li>
            <li>I decided to test it on my daughter with the Q tip on one pimple on her forehead and it didn&#x27;t sting or cause pain or irritation and it went away quickly.  </li>
            <li>It burned and I quickly returned the product.</li>
            <li>It arrived a day early, which I love, and it was packed securely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i was lucky to receive this under promotion for my unbiased opinion</li>
            <li>(I did sort of do a quick stir in my impatience to try it).</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a great dead sea mud mask to keep your skin looking fresh, young and healthy, make sure to purchase this.</li>
            <li>and I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed a major difference in my skin</li>
            <li>I like to follow it with 100% aloe applied with a cotton ball after wards because I&#x27;m fair and leaves my face a bit pink after I rinse the mask off, but definitely leaves a nice, smooth finish.</li>
            <li>If your feet are resembling Fred Flintstone&#x27;s or you simply want to give your feet a treat then coat them in this mask, put your feet up, and let it do its magical thing!</li>
            <li>So I have had great experience with products from the Dead Sea, so when I was offered this Dead Sea Mud Mask from Spa&#x27;s Premium for a great deal to share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a jar.  </li>
            <li>U can see how much it creeps into your pores and makes my skin feel so smooth afterwards</li>
            <li>matter how healthy and clear your skin is today</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave me tingling, but I still feel fresh when I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>and so far it has done a great job at deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>I was advised that I should probably not use this on her as she is a bit young, but after some research on the ingredients they are definitely safe.</li>
            <li>I thought the tingling feeling of the Body Shop product was necessary to work effectively</li>
            <li>I love trying new beauty products and was interested in the skincare benefits of this product.</li>
            <li>I think I used too much the first time!!</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s skin on your feet right?</li>
            <li>My complexion appears more even and generally brighter.</li>
            <li>long story short, I definitely recommend this product for face, feet, and probably anywhere in between (although I haven&#x27;t tried it anywhere in between).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product for free in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the product was filled to the very top so it does get a little messy when mixing it in the can.</li>
            <li>purchased this product as a promotional sample, in order to test it and write an honest and objective opinion (if I don&#x27;t like a product I will certainly say so).</li>
            <li>I was thrilled that it is more like a gel instead of a thick clay substance.  </li>
            <li>Makes a great back facial......</li>
            <li>This has to be the best Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li>That’s why it’s very important for you to treat your skin and cleanse it daily.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I moisturized VERY lightly afterwards with a tiny bit of organic coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had professional facials, I&#x27;ve been to the mud baths at Indian Springs in Colorado, and this ranks among the finest of the fine.  </li>
            <li>like the way it leaves my skin feeling, clean, fresh and soft.  </li>
            <li>There are so many products out there that have chemical ingredients just to help you achieve tighter, healthier skin but this dead sea mud mask only has ingredients that are good for your skin.</li>
            <li>Make sure that your skin is damp before applying facial lotions.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt soft and smooth after using this mask.</li>
            <li>; are ingredients I have used on my skin at one time or another, but since I&#x27;ve never used them in this combination, I thought I would do a test spot first.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It also helped to clear up an eczema patch my daughter had with just one light coat after about five minutes.</li>
            <li>The next thing I have to say is unlike a lot of mud masks I have tried this has no awful smell!</li>
            <li>my normal toner with this for a true comparison.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I was surprised it went on smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>After rinsing it off, my face felt extremely soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>After rinsing the mask off, my face felt clean, soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>dies quickly and completely with no flaking!</li>
            <li>I then tried it with a cotton ball on all my other pimples and red marks and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>It really does show you results after my first use &amp; every use after that</li>
            <li>I love how it doesnt dry out your skin as it dries, either.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected</li>
            <li>P. Acnes bacteria is very stubborn and can become immune to acne products.  </li>
            <li>It gently exfoliates and seems to pull impurities.  </li>
            <li>I looked like a swamp creature, but felt very relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then it makes places on my face really itchy.</li>
            <li>I stirred it as it said on the label, but the consistency didn&#x27;t really change that much.</li>
            <li>The minerals in this mask really help draw out all the impurities in the skin.</li>
            <li>Who wants to put junk on their face anyway...</li>
            <li>I wanted to let it really settle into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The treated hand was smoother/softer and a much cleaner feeling than the untreated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gently wash away with water.</li>
            <li>There eliminate acne, blackhead, shrink pores effect, which is my real experience.</li>
            <li>What I did experience was that it made my face really itchy as it was drying.</li>
            <li>so I hope that doesn&#x27;t really make a difference.</li>
            <li>I really like this mask and can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
            <li>I know that much.</li>
            <li>My husband noticed something different about my face just after using one time.my skin is so smooth and healthier than ever before.i</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of this before I run out because I am completely hooked on this product.</li>
            <li>I received this premium dead sea mud mask at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea mask does a nice job exfoliating the skin</li>
            <li>I came back here to update my original review</li>
            <li>It left my face clean &amp; refreshed looking.</li>
            <li>When I opened it, I was surprised at first it doesn&#x27;t have any scent.</li>
            <li>We agreed that there is hardly any odor to this product, which is a good thing for those sensitive to fragrances.  </li>
            <li>and it quickly went away without a red mark!!  </li>
            <li>Once I felt the burning sensation I quickly washed it off but it looked like I was outside for 8+ hours with no sunscreen on.</li>
            <li>This mud mask did a beautiful job at combating my horribly dull and dry winter skin leaving it totally refreshed, smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended to those looking for something to help with their acne.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li>It was, however, a little jelly-like, so I felt I needed to compensate by packing more on.</li>
            <li>If you are familiar with clay masks - I would say that this clay mask dries somewhere in the middle of extremely dry (as in cracking dry on your face) and gentle supple dry (as in no cracking dryness at all), making it probably a good clay mask for all skin types.</li>
            <li>Really like it and so far I am noticing a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>After drying and rinsing, it leaves the skin moist, supple, clean, and firmed, and neither oily nor dry.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this dead see mud mask.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mask has a beautiful deep grey color from the mineral-rich Dead Sea mud, which is blended with a few botanic and mostly organic ingredients to condition and protect the skin:  shea butter, jojoba oil, aloe vera juice, calendula oil, and hickory bark extract.  </li>
            <li>However, this mask does a great job at taking any dead skin off, and I have noticed I have had to use a moisturizer a lot less since using the mask.</li>
            <li>&amp; it also made my skin itch right above &amp; below my lips.</li>
            <li>I have been getting compliments left and right...</li>
            <li>It feels cool and soothing until it starts to dry.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that you have to stir the ingredients together before use, it draws my attention to how pure the contents are and how they are susceptible to natural separation and that the clay is naturally lumpy.</li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY oily skin &amp; huge pores.</li>
            <li>When I washed the mud off my skin felt extremely hydrated and so silky smooth, I didn&#x27;t even need to put a moisturizer on.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m new to mud</li>
            <li>Turned my skin severely red, a combination between sunburn, very warm to the touch and windburn, extremely dry and uncomfortably tight.</li>
            <li>Mind you, it isn&#x27;t a miracle cream, and can only do so much, but what it does is very helpful.</li>
            <li>can give yourself a facial with the Spa’s Premium Dead Sea Mud Mask in the comfort of your own</li>
            <li>I love how all of the ingredients are natural, and no Parabens or harsh chemicals are used in this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d highly suggest staying away from this product.</li>
            <li>It was easily washed off and did not leave a mess in my sink.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel soo soft!</li>
            <li>For my first try, I left it on for about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It definitely acts more like a moisturizer than other muds I have used.</li>
            <li>but my skin gets really dry in the winter and most mud/clay masks dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>This Dead Sea Mud Mask applies easily and dries well.</li>
            <li>It takes off the dry skin and leaves a fresh dewy looking skin afterward.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product, I noticed my pours getting smaller, and my dark circles fading as well.</li>
            <li>Feel free to apply it to your back for acne or even to your dry, cracked elbows during the winter!</li>
            <li>This mask is clearly an exfoliator too without irritation.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few weeks now and my face has never felt so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>When I washed the mask off after it dried, I noticed how smooth and soft my skin felt.  </li>
            <li>My face is soft and my fines lines are softening.</li>
            <li>We had a blast and our hands were so soft for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used it several times and it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin.  </li>
            <li>The texture of my skin was so soft.  </li>
            <li>We then covered her whole face especially on her cheeks where her acne rosacea is so severe.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to test it on my face with a Q- tip and put it directly onto the acne pimple</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not harsh, if you have sensitive skin, maybe this would be a mask for you.</li>
            <li>I made my skin soft and helped some acne redness heal.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t get that soft skin feeling</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I definitely feel as if it really is drawing out the toxins from my skin.</li>
            <li>This product does make your skin fell really soft...</li>
            <li>i would recommend once a week or twice a week use for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The ingredients were all natural.  </li>
            <li>It offers anti-aging benefits and a natural moisturizer to reinvigorate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having FOUR blemishes on my face in one day</li>
            <li>deducted one star from my review as having sensitive sin</li>
            <li>I do have blackheads and so far they are still there.</li>
            <li>Once I wash it off, my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a great dead sea mud mask that gives you that little something extra at the same time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;Spa&#x27;s Premium Dead Sea Mud Mask&amp;#34; seems to be just as good as any of the other facial mask products I&#x27;ve used, so I will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>Adding water first will dry out your skin!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of different types of Mud masks in the past, but none quite as potent and of quality as this one.</li>
            <li>, the amount you use is TINY to cover a normal sized lady&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and they actually looked smaller.  </li>
            <li>but you can buy cheap lotion for a few bucks that will give you the same effect.</li>
            <li>The second time I mixed it really well</li>
            <li>Dead sea mud mask is known for its extraordinary benefits for the skin.</li>
            <li>This product is Organic which is a major plus for me.</li>
            <li>but also I don&#x27;t have any major skin problems.</li>
            <li>My daughter also uses Rosacara Wild Irish Seaweed lotion (gel) and Just Natural Skin Care&#x27;s Anti-Aging Natural facial lotion.  </li>
            <li>because the mud itself is so fine, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>When you finally get to wash it off, it&#x27;s a little bit hard to take off but leaves your face feeling so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Over the next few days I noticed how clean my pores looked.  </li>
            <li>The fact that nearly all the ingredients are organic shows the conscientiousness of the manufacturer in providing the finest product possible.  </li>
            <li>I also have really sensitive skin, and turn red almost after any mask.</li>
            <li>That just added extra time to dry in certain spots.</li>
            <li>so I opened the jar and stirred it up, put on my elbows and face in an upward motion a thin layer, let dry for 20 minutes and rinse off with warm water.</li>
            <li>I cannot attest to how it does regarding acne or blemishes because I don&#x27;t have any of those problems; however, I am getting old, I live in NYC where it is currently FREEZING which does a serious number drying out skin, and I have a nearly four year old daughter who gets eczema patches around the lower part of her face (mainly her chin) from time to time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not 20 long words no one really understands, but simple words such as sunflower oil and shea butter.</li>
            <li>I appreciated that it is made with all natural ingredients including Shea Butter, Aloe Vera Juice, and Sunflower Oil, to name a few.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed this did not dry out my skin</li>
            <li>My skin was not dry when I used this.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this Dead Sea Mud Mask from Spa&#x27;s Premium for anyone who wants a very soft face.</li>
            <li>My problem area is around my nose (open/ larger pores) and this clay drew out the pore build up there, making my pores considering smaller and less noticeable, after the first use.</li>
            <li>My skin has been relatively clear for months, and I didn&#x27;t even use the stuff for very long.</li>
            <li>, I already have dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Its not super thick like most.</li>
            <li>It was wet and slimy, but dried quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ingredients: Pure Dead Sea mud, organic shea butter, organic sunflower oil, organic aloe vera juice, organic vegetable glycerin, organic jojoba oil, hickory bark extract, organic calendula oil, filtered water, xanthan</li>
            <li>Applying the mask to the face was as easy as it had been to the hands and again, neither of us encountered any discomfort though there was a very, very slight sense of tightening as it dried.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t advise giving a full facial to a toddler/preschooler/little kid, but if there are small patches where their skin is very dry, itchy, or breaking out from something that doesn&#x27;t require medical attention</li>
    </ol>

            <li> But it is fun and smells great.</li>
            <li> My face felt all tingly and healthy after I put this mask on my face - I couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing my skin felt while I was wearing it.  </li>

            <li> I put this mask on for 20 minutes and my face has never felt tighter and more exfoliated.</li>
            <li> just okay.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works for some people, but not for me.  </li>
            <li> so you can use more.  </li>
            <li> otherwise it will just lay on top of the skin.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I love the feeling my skin has</li>
            <li> The coverage thinner than I thought it would be, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Being a Makeup Artist and Beauty Enthusiast, I am always looking for the next best thing.</li>
            <li> Like most masks claim to do but DO NOT.</li>
            <li> a side note, I have washed dishes twice today since doing the test on one of my hands and the treated hand still feels softer and more supple than the untreated.  </li>

            <li> but I&#x27;ll tell you what after you wash it off your skin feels silky smooth</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has no smell [to me anyways], Its a light to medium texture.</li>
            <li> My skin never felt so smooth in my life.</li>
            <li> When I opened the jar the mud was so velvety smooth and had no odor whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I had a makeup free day ahead of me</li>
            <li> I applied it lightly, but can be applied thicker if you prefer.</li>
            <li> I enjoy my &amp;#34;Me&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I got it for free to review and tried it yesterday.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel smooth as a baby</li>
            <li> Now we&#x27;ve added this mask and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> works good, really soft skin after using.</li>
            <li> and it really is working!!!  </li>
            <li> I washed it off &amp; my pores were pretty close to being non visible!!</li>
            <li> Using the product was super easy.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this as soon as I got it, that I posted after using it</li>
            <li> This mud mask feels cool, creamy, and refreshing when first applied to the skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;its got some great ingredients like Aloe Vera, Jojoba Oil, Sunflower, Hickory Bark, Calendula and Shea Butter creates, an all-natural, familiar combination that can help with a wide variety of skin problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The special oils</li>
            <li> Highly recommended without hesitation to anyone who wants to look good and feel good.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> When I rinsed it off, my skin felt soft and amazing.  </li>
            <li> A good deal if you exfoliate regularly with a mud mask</li>
            <li> The texture is perfect not too watery &amp; not to thick</li>
            <li> I liked the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> The mask was cool and reminded me of the consistency of pudding.  </li>
            <li> I have never been a big mud mask girl, but I have tried a few and this is honestly one of the best!</li>
            <li> keeping my face cool.</li>
            <li> I would recommend only using it once or twice a week, because it has some really good tightening qualities.</li>
            <li> There was no bad odor like some mud products.</li>
            <li> The first thing I have to say is I love that right on the label it lists the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I like to let it dry completely for the best exfoliation results.  </li>
            <li> I left it on for 20 minutes and it easily rinsed off with warm water.  </li>
            <li> However, I did not expect to get BURNED by this product as other women have experienced.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mild eczema, I read the ingrediants,Shea butter, Aloe vera juice, Sunflower oil, Jojoba oil, Hickory bark extract,Calendula oil.</li>
            <li> Applying the mask is quick and I like the fact there&#x27;s no overpowering odor.</li>
            <li> I decided to test it on my daughter with the Q tip on one pimple on her forehead and it didn&#x27;t sting or cause pain or irritation and it went away quickly.  </li>
            <li> It burned and I quickly returned the product.</li>
            <li> It arrived a day early, which I love, and it was packed securely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i was lucky to receive this under promotion for my unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> (I did sort of do a quick stir in my impatience to try it).</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a great dead sea mud mask to keep your skin looking fresh, young and healthy, make sure to purchase this.</li>
            <li> and I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed a major difference in my skin</li>
            <li> I like to follow it with 100% aloe applied with a cotton ball after wards because I&#x27;m fair and leaves my face a bit pink after I rinse the mask off, but definitely leaves a nice, smooth finish.</li>
            <li> If your feet are resembling Fred Flintstone&#x27;s or you simply want to give your feet a treat then coat them in this mask, put your feet up, and let it do its magical thing!</li>
            <li> So I have had great experience with products from the Dead Sea, so when I was offered this Dead Sea Mud Mask from Spa&#x27;s Premium for a great deal to share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a jar.  </li>
            <li> U can see how much it creeps into your pores and makes my skin feel so smooth afterwards</li>
            <li> matter how healthy and clear your skin is today</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave me tingling, but I still feel fresh when I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> and so far it has done a great job at deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> I was advised that I should probably not use this on her as she is a bit young, but after some research on the ingredients they are definitely safe.</li>
            <li> I thought the tingling feeling of the Body Shop product was necessary to work effectively</li>
            <li> I love trying new beauty products and was interested in the skincare benefits of this product.</li>
            <li> I think I used too much the first time!!</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s skin on your feet right?</li>
            <li> My complexion appears more even and generally brighter.</li>
            <li> long story short, I definitely recommend this product for face, feet, and probably anywhere in between (although I haven&#x27;t tried it anywhere in between).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product for free in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, the product was filled to the very top so it does get a little messy when mixing it in the can.</li>
            <li> purchased this product as a promotional sample, in order to test it and write an honest and objective opinion (if I don&#x27;t like a product I will certainly say so).</li>
            <li> I was thrilled that it is more like a gel instead of a thick clay substance.  </li>
            <li> Makes a great back facial......</li>
            <li> This has to be the best Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li> That’s why it’s very important for you to treat your skin and cleanse it daily.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I moisturized VERY lightly afterwards with a tiny bit of organic coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional facials, I&#x27;ve been to the mud baths at Indian Springs in Colorado, and this ranks among the finest of the fine.  </li>
            <li> like the way it leaves my skin feeling, clean, fresh and soft.  </li>
            <li> There are so many products out there that have chemical ingredients just to help you achieve tighter, healthier skin but this dead sea mud mask only has ingredients that are good for your skin.</li>
            <li> Make sure that your skin is damp before applying facial lotions.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and smooth after using this mask.</li>
            <li> ; are ingredients I have used on my skin at one time or another, but since I&#x27;ve never used them in this combination, I thought I would do a test spot first.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It also helped to clear up an eczema patch my daughter had with just one light coat after about five minutes.</li>
            <li> The next thing I have to say is unlike a lot of mud masks I have tried this has no awful smell!</li>
            <li> my normal toner with this for a true comparison.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I was surprised it went on smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> After rinsing it off, my face felt extremely soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> After rinsing the mask off, my face felt clean, soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> dies quickly and completely with no flaking!</li>
            <li> I then tried it with a cotton ball on all my other pimples and red marks and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> It really does show you results after my first use &amp; every use after that</li>
            <li> I love how it doesnt dry out your skin as it dries, either.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected</li>
            <li> P. Acnes bacteria is very stubborn and can become immune to acne products.  </li>
            <li> It gently exfoliates and seems to pull impurities.  </li>
            <li> I looked like a swamp creature, but felt very relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then it makes places on my face really itchy.</li>
            <li> I stirred it as it said on the label, but the consistency didn&#x27;t really change that much.</li>
            <li> The minerals in this mask really help draw out all the impurities in the skin.</li>
            <li> Who wants to put junk on their face anyway...</li>
            <li> I wanted to let it really settle into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The treated hand was smoother/softer and a much cleaner feeling than the untreated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gently wash away with water.</li>
            <li> There eliminate acne, blackhead, shrink pores effect, which is my real experience.</li>
            <li> What I did experience was that it made my face really itchy as it was drying.</li>
            <li> so I hope that doesn&#x27;t really make a difference.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask and can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
            <li> I know that much.</li>
            <li> My husband noticed something different about my face just after using one time.my skin is so smooth and healthier than ever before.i</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more of this before I run out because I am completely hooked on this product.</li>
            <li> I received this premium dead sea mud mask at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea mask does a nice job exfoliating the skin</li>
            <li> I came back here to update my original review</li>
            <li> It left my face clean &amp; refreshed looking.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, I was surprised at first it doesn&#x27;t have any scent.</li>
            <li> We agreed that there is hardly any odor to this product, which is a good thing for those sensitive to fragrances.  </li>
            <li> and it quickly went away without a red mark!!  </li>
            <li> Once I felt the burning sensation I quickly washed it off but it looked like I was outside for 8+ hours with no sunscreen on.</li>
            <li> This mud mask did a beautiful job at combating my horribly dull and dry winter skin leaving it totally refreshed, smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended to those looking for something to help with their acne.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> It was, however, a little jelly-like, so I felt I needed to compensate by packing more on.</li>
            <li> If you are familiar with clay masks - I would say that this clay mask dries somewhere in the middle of extremely dry (as in cracking dry on your face) and gentle supple dry (as in no cracking dryness at all), making it probably a good clay mask for all skin types.</li>
            <li> Really like it and so far I am noticing a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> After drying and rinsing, it leaves the skin moist, supple, clean, and firmed, and neither oily nor dry.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this dead see mud mask.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The mask has a beautiful deep grey color from the mineral-rich Dead Sea mud, which is blended with a few botanic and mostly organic ingredients to condition and protect the skin:  shea butter, jojoba oil, aloe vera juice, calendula oil, and hickory bark extract.  </li>
            <li> However, this mask does a great job at taking any dead skin off, and I have noticed I have had to use a moisturizer a lot less since using the mask.</li>
            <li> &amp; it also made my skin itch right above &amp; below my lips.</li>
            <li> I have been getting compliments left and right...</li>
            <li> It feels cool and soothing until it starts to dry.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you have to stir the ingredients together before use, it draws my attention to how pure the contents are and how they are susceptible to natural separation and that the clay is naturally lumpy.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY oily skin &amp; huge pores.</li>
            <li> When I washed the mud off my skin felt extremely hydrated and so silky smooth, I didn&#x27;t even need to put a moisturizer on.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m new to mud</li>
            <li> Turned my skin severely red, a combination between sunburn, very warm to the touch and windburn, extremely dry and uncomfortably tight.</li>
            <li> Mind you, it isn&#x27;t a miracle cream, and can only do so much, but what it does is very helpful.</li>
            <li> can give yourself a facial with the Spa’s Premium Dead Sea Mud Mask in the comfort of your own</li>
            <li> I love how all of the ingredients are natural, and no Parabens or harsh chemicals are used in this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d highly suggest staying away from this product.</li>
            <li> It was easily washed off and did not leave a mess in my sink.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel soo soft!</li>
            <li> For my first try, I left it on for about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It definitely acts more like a moisturizer than other muds I have used.</li>
            <li> but my skin gets really dry in the winter and most mud/clay masks dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea Mud Mask applies easily and dries well.</li>
            <li> It takes off the dry skin and leaves a fresh dewy looking skin afterward.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product, I noticed my pours getting smaller, and my dark circles fading as well.</li>
            <li> Feel free to apply it to your back for acne or even to your dry, cracked elbows during the winter!</li>
            <li> This mask is clearly an exfoliator too without irritation.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and my face has never felt so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> When I washed the mask off after it dried, I noticed how smooth and soft my skin felt.  </li>
            <li> My face is soft and my fines lines are softening.</li>
            <li> We had a blast and our hands were so soft for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used it several times and it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin.  </li>
            <li> The texture of my skin was so soft.  </li>
            <li> We then covered her whole face especially on her cheeks where her acne rosacea is so severe.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to test it on my face with a Q- tip and put it directly onto the acne pimple</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not harsh, if you have sensitive skin, maybe this would be a mask for you.</li>
            <li> I made my skin soft and helped some acne redness heal.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t get that soft skin feeling</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I definitely feel as if it really is drawing out the toxins from my skin.</li>
            <li> This product does make your skin fell really soft...</li>
            <li> i would recommend once a week or twice a week use for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The ingredients were all natural.  </li>
            <li> It offers anti-aging benefits and a natural moisturizer to reinvigorate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having FOUR blemishes on my face in one day</li>
            <li> deducted one star from my review as having sensitive sin</li>
            <li> I do have blackheads and so far they are still there.</li>
            <li> Once I wash it off, my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a great dead sea mud mask that gives you that little something extra at the same time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;Spa&#x27;s Premium Dead Sea Mud Mask&amp;#34; seems to be just as good as any of the other facial mask products I&#x27;ve used, so I will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> Adding water first will dry out your skin!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different types of Mud masks in the past, but none quite as potent and of quality as this one.</li>
            <li> , the amount you use is TINY to cover a normal sized lady&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and they actually looked smaller.  </li>
            <li> but you can buy cheap lotion for a few bucks that will give you the same effect.</li>
            <li> The second time I mixed it really well</li>
            <li> Dead sea mud mask is known for its extraordinary benefits for the skin.</li>
            <li> This product is Organic which is a major plus for me.</li>
            <li> but also I don&#x27;t have any major skin problems.</li>
            <li> My daughter also uses Rosacara Wild Irish Seaweed lotion (gel) and Just Natural Skin Care&#x27;s Anti-Aging Natural facial lotion.  </li>
            <li> because the mud itself is so fine, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> When you finally get to wash it off, it&#x27;s a little bit hard to take off but leaves your face feeling so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Over the next few days I noticed how clean my pores looked.  </li>
            <li> The fact that nearly all the ingredients are organic shows the conscientiousness of the manufacturer in providing the finest product possible.  </li>
            <li> I also have really sensitive skin, and turn red almost after any mask.</li>
            <li> That just added extra time to dry in certain spots.</li>
            <li> so I opened the jar and stirred it up, put on my elbows and face in an upward motion a thin layer, let dry for 20 minutes and rinse off with warm water.</li>
            <li> I cannot attest to how it does regarding acne or blemishes because I don&#x27;t have any of those problems; however, I am getting old, I live in NYC where it is currently FREEZING which does a serious number drying out skin, and I have a nearly four year old daughter who gets eczema patches around the lower part of her face (mainly her chin) from time to time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not 20 long words no one really understands, but simple words such as sunflower oil and shea butter.</li>
            <li> I appreciated that it is made with all natural ingredients including Shea Butter, Aloe Vera Juice, and Sunflower Oil, to name a few.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed this did not dry out my skin</li>
            <li> My skin was not dry when I used this.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this Dead Sea Mud Mask from Spa&#x27;s Premium for anyone who wants a very soft face.</li>
            <li> My problem area is around my nose (open/ larger pores) and this clay drew out the pore build up there, making my pores considering smaller and less noticeable, after the first use.</li>
            <li> My skin has been relatively clear for months, and I didn&#x27;t even use the stuff for very long.</li>
            <li> , I already have dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Its not super thick like most.</li>
            <li> It was wet and slimy, but dried quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients: Pure Dead Sea mud, organic shea butter, organic sunflower oil, organic aloe vera juice, organic vegetable glycerin, organic jojoba oil, hickory bark extract, organic calendula oil, filtered water, xanthan</li>
            <li> Applying the mask to the face was as easy as it had been to the hands and again, neither of us encountered any discomfort though there was a very, very slight sense of tightening as it dried.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t advise giving a full facial to a toddler/preschooler/little kid, but if there are small patches where their skin is very dry, itchy, or breaking out from something that doesn&#x27;t require medical attention</li>
            <li> My skin is so unbelievably dry, so I was a little worried to use it at first.</li>
            <li> , we all know that we are are only just a day away from a blemish or some other skin irritant to pop-up unexpectedly.</li>
            <li> You will get several uses out of this one jar, although you should use it within one to two months due to the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and although it does seem a little pricey, you only use a little tiny amount at a time as apposed to the other commercial brands that are thick paste.</li>
            <li> It has only a slight earthy fragrance and can be used even by people with sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this mask is really amazing because I currently have some cystic acne that is painful and red.</li>
            <li> This is going to last me A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really hard to put into words the exact feeling; however after rinsing our hands and patting them dry, there was a definite difference when comparing the hand we had treated to the untreated hand.</li>
            <li> You can also use it on your face, back acne, dry ankles and elbows.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and it even feels a little tighter.  </li>
            <li> We then tried the cotton ball and gently pat (do not rub hard)</li>
            <li> I am 53 and have been using clay masks for years but gave up on them a long time ago because they irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> When the skin is wet, the pores open and the skin absorbs the lotion</li>
            <li> This dead sea mud mask is created with completely natural ingredients, and feels so soothing when you apply it to your face.  </li>
            <li> It must be because this mud contains 6 all natural organic extracts like Shea butter, Sunflower &amp; Jojoba oils and Aloe Vera juice just to name a few.</li>
            <li> I spoke with a representative and asked how frequently this &amp;#34;Spa&#x27;s Premium Dead Sea Mud Mask&amp;#34; can be used and was told 1-2 times a week</li>
            <li> This is really helping them to slowly diminish.  </li>
            <li> Now that may not be feasible for everyone due to scheduling and finances, but what if I told you that you can treat yourself at home with a traditional spa treatment?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Our ladies group treated each other to hand treatments last week.</li>
            <li> I found other masks that have the same ingredients as this mask</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different facial mask products in the past</li>
            <li> Based on the fact that it takes such a small amount for each application, cost per facial should be far less than $1.00</li>
            <li> Based on the fact that it takes such a small amount for each application, cost per facial should be far less than $1.00</li>
            <li> My daughter has severe dry skin and acne rosacea.  </li>
            <li> Never put lotion or gels on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> You feel it working as soon as you let it dry on your face.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft my pores small and pimples immediately start healing after just one use.</li>
            <li> But I think that is because it was getting deep down into my pores.</li>
            <li> My skin is in a crisis &#x3D; dry winter and menopausal!</li>
            <li> applying then waiting 15 minutes, we both had a few spots that were still not dry, so went another 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I left on about 15-20 minutes each time, about the time my face started feeling really tight.</li>
            <li> It was a little red, but I think that is because I used a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> You could also use this on dry elbows, cracked heels, or other problem areas.</li>
            <li> I had to wash it off my face before it was fully dry but other than the itchiness there was no reaction.</li>
            <li> jar holds 8 oz. ounces and should provide at least ten or twelve facial treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I has dried up my eczema and cleared my back acne after about a month.</li>
            <li> Always on damp or wet skin.  </li>
            <li> I left it on for 15 min &amp; did a few chores around the house.</li>
            <li> , the smell made the time I waited for the mask to day very pleasurable, and you only need a very thin coat for the mask to work.  </li>
            <li> These organic products are not strong enough to kill the stubborn P. Acnes bacteria.  </li>
            <li> After leaving for 15+ minutes, the mask was dry half way.</li>
            <li> This product has a lighter feel than other muds I have used.  </li>
            <li> After I wiped the mask off with a damp washcloth, my skin was a little dry, so I rubbed moisturizer on.  </li>
            <li> and it did dry out my skin a little bit</li>
            <li> the mud dries, it leaves a slightly tight feel and has a tingling sensation, almost like your skin is being stretched a little.</li>
            <li> It also felt as if it was pulling the sides of lips down</li>
            <li> I also went down part of my neck.  </li>
            <li> I usually use egg yolks to help tighten my skin and dry up acne</li>
            <li> Those that suffer from eczema and other skin issues will appreciate the soothing effects that a Dead Sea Mud Mask can offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I typically have oily skin</li>
            <li> Received the product today &amp; just washed it off after about half an hour.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for that tight feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> I felt slight redness and tingling in my skin after washing for a few minutes</li>
            <li> but nothing that a little moisturizer after doesn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Not sure it did anything for me as other reviewers have noted.</li>
            <li> After putting on the mask, my nose felt a little itchy.</li>
            <li> it did affect me a little.</li>
            <li> I did not feel the tingling sensation I usually feel with other muds</li>
            <li> My forehead had a lot of raised bumps after I rinsed the mask off, and the reason it was like that was because there was probably a lot of something bad that was absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Mask was created with six organic, all-natural extracts: Shea Butter, Aloe Vera Juice, Sunflower Oil, Jojoba Oil, Hickory Bark Extract, and Calendula Oil.</li>
            <li> You definitely don&#x27;t need a lot, a thin layer will get the job done.</li>
            <li> i used it just a few times because i don&#x27;t have time</li>
            <li> I wanted to try it a few times before reviewing.</li>
            <li> My skin looked refreshed, poor were smaller too.</li>
            <li> uneven skin tones etc.</li>
            <li> Including Dead Sea Mud Masks.</li>
            <li> I was offered the opportunity to try Spa&#x27;s Premium Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> of the ingredients in the &amp;#34;Spa&#x27;s Premium Dead Sea Mud Mask&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times</li>
            <li> I have been to the Dead Sea and lathered myself with the mud.</li>
            <li> So I do know the impact of the Dead Sea on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I recommend the dead sea mud mask to everyone.</li>
            <li> Awhile ago I had a large painful cystic acne on my back and decided to try putting hydrogen peroxide on it with a cotton ball and it went away in just a few days without irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> After it dried, it turned into a hard mask that made your face feel extremely tight.</li>
            <li> They are watering down the product and telling you to put it on thick</li>
            <li> Also, if you have a habit of picking your face, I recommend getting raw coca butter.</li>
            <li> I have tried many dead sea masks and they work, but they either have no smell or an awful smell, and I find that my skin needs a mask again before the recommended weekly mask.  </li>
            <li> but it is a little pricey!</li>
            <li> The Spa&#x27;s Premium Dead Sea Mud Mask is now a part of my weekly self care!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if this is supposed to be the case or not.</li>
            <li> then applied my usual moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> usually stick with The Body Shop Seaweed Line of Skin Care Products.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually deviate from that line, but I tried this product twice so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am out of the toner I usually use.</li>
            <li> I usually go for the &amp;#34;St. Whatever&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It gets a little hard in 15-20 minutes, but not so hard that you can&#x27;t move your face.</li>
            <li> but I found that hard to do and just ended up spreading it around in all directions</li>
            <li> She has been using this mask at least three times a week with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> The redness is slowly going away and</li>
            <li> years I have been trying to find a product that killed the P. Acnes bacteria without irritating or damaging the skin.  </li>
            <li> After about ten minutes of the application, I could feel my skin tingling &amp; tightening (not in a bad way).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive, hyped-up products.</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> She also has extreme sensitive skin on her face which was brought on by the YAZ type birth control pills and the horrible over the counter acne products which made it worse.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be killing the P. Acnes bacteria without irritating or damaging the skin.  </li>
            <li> Directions say to spread thinly in an upward motion.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and was worried it would make it worse .well</li>
            <li> Acne products are a billion dollar corrupt</li>
            <li> Other masks out there smell terrible.</li>
            <li> would recommend this mask to anyone who suffers from acne, whether hormonal or stress, stressed out skin,</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mild eczema, I read the ingrediants,Shea butter, Aloe vera juice, Sunflower oil, Jojoba oil, Hickory bark extract,Calendula oil. You can also use it on your face, back acne, dry ankles and elbows. I have eczema on my elbows so I opened the jar and stirred it up, put on my elbows and face in an upward motion a thin layer, let dry for 20 minutes and rinse off with warm water. I has dried up my eczema and cleared my back acne after about a month. My face is soft and my fines lines are softening.When I give myself a pedicure I use it on my feet. I feel like i&#x27;m at a spa everytime i use it! I received this gift for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel soo soft! And it lasts a while. When I take it off, I can feel the smoother texture of my face, and it helps keep my skin shine free. I highly recommended to those looking for something to help with their acne. Mind you, it isn&#x27;t a miracle cream, and can only do so much, but what it does is very helpful.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product, I noticed my pours getting smaller, and my dark circles fading as well. I recommend this to a friend who also struggled with acne and she loved it!</li>
            <li> Really like it and so far I am noticing a difference in my skin. It is good for oily skin and acne. So far so good!</li>
            <li> It does what it says. After leaving for 15+ minutes, the mask was dry half way. After finish using it, my skin felt so good.</li>
            <li> *****I WAS GIVEN A COMPLEMENTARY SAMPLE OF PRODUCT FOR AN HONEST REVIEW**** Love this mask! My skin is in a crisis &#x3D; dry winter and menopausal! Applying the mask is quick and I like the fact there&#x27;s no overpowering odor. dies quickly and completely with no flaking! Washes off easily and my oily problematic skin feels great! Strongly recommend this product. I am an African American and this product works for my skin. The Spa&#x27;s Premium Dead Sea Mud Mask is now a part of my weekly self care!</li>
            <li> Need I say more?! JUNK!</li>
            <li> Every now and then women need to pamper themselves with a day at the spa. Now that may not be feasible for everyone due to scheduling and finances, but what if I told you that you can treat yourself at home with a traditional spa treatment?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can give yourself a facial with the Spa’s Premium Dead Sea Mud Mask in the comfort of your own home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how healthy and clear your skin is today, we all know that we are are only just a day away from a blemish or some other skin irritant to pop-up unexpectedly. That’s why it’s very important for you to treat your skin and cleanse it daily. Dead Sea Mud Mask was created with six organic, all-natural extracts: Shea Butter, Aloe Vera Juice, Sunflower Oil, Jojoba Oil, Hickory Bark Extract, and Calendula Oil. All six ingredients are perfect for reducing the signs of aging and healing your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part about this mud mask is that it’s not just for your face. Feel free to apply it to your back for acne or even to your dry, cracked elbows during the winter! Those that suffer from eczema and other skin issues will appreciate the soothing effects that a Dead Sea Mud Mask can offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The added convenience of the container size makes it perfect to take with you on that weekend trip or over to a girlfriend’s house for a night of facials! Our ladies group treated each other to hand treatments last week. We had a blast and our hands were so soft for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this dead see mud mask. I usually use egg yolks to help tighten my skin and dry up acne but that won&#x27;t be happening anymore. I put this mask on for 20 minutes and my face has never felt tighter and more exfoliated. It was so easy to wash off too. There weren&#x27;t any chunks in it and it was definitely not too watery. There are so many products out there that have chemical ingredients just to help you achieve tighter, healthier skin but this dead sea mud mask only has ingredients that are good for your skin. Other masks out there smell terrible. This mask has no smell whatsoever. I will definitely be purchasing more of this before I run out because I am completely hooked on this product. I even got my husband hooked on it! I received this premium dead sea mud mask at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I do like it because it felt good and seemed effective in pulling out impurities. It was, however, a little jelly-like, so I felt I needed to compensate by packing more on. NOT NECESSARY. That just added extra time to dry in certain spots. Also, my neck was very red for about 20 minutes afterwards. All in all though, I like this product. I sought a mud mask to draw impurities out and I feel this was effective. Also, I liked the price, comparatively speaking. Also, if it&#x27;s a title &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; so as to maintain its organic ingredient list, I&#x27;m all for it.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected</li>
            <li> Ehh...just okay.  I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with this mask.  I have used it several times and it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin.  I&#x27;m sure it works for some people, but not for me.  Won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Please bring this Mud Mask.  Hands down best mud mask.  I found other masks that have the same ingredients as this mask BUT they are putting the water first!!!  This mask puts the water last!!  They are watering down the product and telling you to put it on thick so you can use more.  Adding water first will dry out your skin!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been searching for the perfect clay/mud mask for years.  I am 53 and have been using clay masks for years but gave up on them a long time ago because they irritated my skin. Although I typically have oily skin but my skin gets really dry in the winter and most mud/clay masks dry my skin out. My daughter has severe dry skin and acne rosacea.  She also has extreme sensitive skin on her face which was brought on by the YAZ type birth control pills and the horrible over the counter acne products which made it worse.  Doctors were no help at all.  She got off the pill and I switched to organic products for our skin, food, cleaning products and only buy in the US.  I saw this brand and decided to give it a try.  When I put it on my skin I was thrilled that it is more like a gel instead of a thick clay substance.  It went on very smoothly and nice and cool.  I left it on for 20 minutes and it easily rinsed off with warm water.  My face felt wonderful and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and no dryness!  I have large pores and they actually looked smaller.  The texture of my skin was so soft.  I decided to try it on my daughter&#x27;s skin and tested it out on her forehead and it felt fine.  We then covered her whole face especially on her cheeks where her acne rosacea is so severe.  We decided to leave on her face for 10 minutes and her skin also looked great and it didn&#x27;t irritate her skin at all and NO DRYNESS!  This mask is clearly an exfoliator too without irritation.  She also liked how easy it spread and that it was cool to the skin.  Some masks heat up on the skin and irritate people with acne rosacea.  My daughter&#x27;s skin is looking amazing after two weeks and still no irritation.  She has been using this mask at least three times a week with no irritation.  The redness is slowly going away and still no dryness.  I have been dealing with hormonal acne and have been dealing with those stubborn red marks.  This is really helping them to slowly diminish.  I use this twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also use Teva Skin Care products.  Teva&#x27;s acne rosacea cleanser is the only cleanser that my daughter can use on her face.  We also use Kiss My Face botanical acne gel and Teva&#x27;s topical acne spot treatment.  My daughter also uses Rosacara Wild Irish Seaweed lotion (gel) and Just Natural Skin Care&#x27;s Anti-Aging Natural facial lotion.  Now we&#x27;ve added this mask and so far so good.  Make sure that your skin is damp before applying facial lotions.  Never put lotion or gels on dry skin.  Always on damp or wet skin.  When the skin is wet, the pores open and the skin absorbs the lotion otherwise it will just lay on top of the skin.  I also change my daughter&#x27;s pillow case every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I have been trying to find a product that killed the P. Acnes bacteria without irritating or damaging the skin.  These organic products are not strong enough to kill the stubborn P. Acnes bacteria.  Awhile ago I had a large painful cystic acne on my back and decided to try putting hydrogen peroxide on it with a cotton ball and it went away in just a few days without irritating my skin.  So I decided to test it on my face with a Q- tip and put it directly onto the acne pimple and it quickly went away without a red mark!!  I then tried it with a cotton ball on all my other pimples and red marks and it worked great.  I decided to test it on my daughter with the Q tip on one pimple on her forehead and it didn&#x27;t sting or cause pain or irritation and it went away quickly.  We then tried the cotton ball and gently pat (do not rub hard) it on all the infected areas and it really is working!!!  It seems to be killing the P. Acnes bacteria without irritating or damaging the skin.  P. Acnes bacteria is very stubborn and can become immune to acne products.  It&#x27;s always fighting to come back.  I find it interesting that the doctors NEVER mentioned hydrogen peroxide!!  Acne products are a billion dollar corrupt industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this product 10 stars and I hope they never change it or discontinue it.  Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Turned my skin severely red, a combination between sunburn, very warm to the touch and windburn, extremely dry and uncomfortably tight.</li>
            <li> Makes a great back facial......</li>
            <li> It feels good on face but I did not notice any improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and smooth after using this mask. Love it, great product!</li>
            <li> A good deal if you exfoliate regularly with a mud mask, I try to only once a week so this will last me! I like to follow it with 100% aloe applied with a cotton ball after wards because I&#x27;m fair and leaves my face a bit pink after I rinse the mask off, but definitely leaves a nice, smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I like this mask. It doesn&#x27;t leave me tingling, but I still feel fresh when I&#x27;ve used it. I can tell when I need to use it again. It makes a difference in my skin literally in an hour after use. I&#x27;m 21, but my skin looks almost too youthful afterwords. I love it and it&#x27;s not harsh, if you have sensitive skin, maybe this would be a mask for you.</li>
            <li> Helping my skin to tighten up.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  It gently exfoliates and seems to pull impurities.  I like to let it dry completely for the best exfoliation results.  Leaves my skin hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea mask does a nice job exfoliating the skin but it is a little pricey!</li>
            <li> This is a great mask. I made my skin soft and helped some acne redness heal. Did not sting and I will order again.</li>
            <li> Received the product today &amp; just washed it off after about half an hour. I was pretty excited seeing all of the good reviews. I have EXTREMELY oily skin &amp; huge pores. You definitely don&#x27;t need a lot, a thin layer will get the job done. After about ten minutes of the application, I could feel my skin tingling &amp; tightening (not in a bad way). It also felt as if it was pulling the sides of lips down lol. I washed it off &amp; my pores were pretty close to being non visible!! However, I didn&#x27;t get that soft skin feeling like everybody else seems to be getting &amp; it also made my skin itch right above &amp; below my lips. Let&#x27;s hope I wake up tomorrow morning with the almost non visible pores (I don&#x27;t have time to apply this in the AM).</li>
            <li> Please read ALL reviews before purchasing this item. Disclaimer: I do have sensitive skin. However, I did not expect to get BURNED by this product as other women have experienced. Once I felt the burning sensation I quickly washed it off but it looked like I was outside for 8+ hours with no sunscreen on. It hurt. It burned and I quickly returned the product. If you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d highly suggest staying away from this product.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this out for an honest review &amp; was excited to try it. I really like this Dead Sea Mud Mask it is really easy to use &amp; apply. The texture is perfect not too watery &amp; not to thick it is the perfect consistency. It goes on smoothly &amp; have been using it day &amp; night since I received it and so far it has done a great job at deep cleaning. I definitely feel as if it really is drawing out the toxins from my skin. It left my face clean &amp; refreshed looking. I also noticed this did not dry out my skin, I already have dry sensitive skin &amp; I did not have to apply moisturizer afterwards. I believe this is from the shea butter and Jojoba oils that are in this product. Does great for deep cleaning your face that even my Husband wanted to try it out &amp; enjoyed it as well.It really does show you results after my first use &amp; every use after that my face seemed refreshed each time.</li>
            <li> This product does make your skin fell really soft...but you can buy cheap lotion for a few bucks that will give you the same effect. Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive, hyped-up products. If you have acne, I recommend getting Stridex facial wipes. My skin has been relatively clear for months, and I didn&#x27;t even use the stuff for very long. Also, if you have a habit of picking your face, I recommend getting raw coca butter. It helps heal the pimples and also reduces the swelling in a matter of hours.</li>
            <li> i used it just a few times because i don&#x27;t have time but it does work.. i would recommend once a week or twice a week use for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you have to stir the ingredients together before use, it draws my attention to how pure the contents are and how they are susceptible to natural separation and that the clay is naturally lumpy. This Dead Sea Mud Mask applies easily and dries well. If you are familiar with clay masks - I would say that this clay mask dries somewhere in the middle of extremely dry (as in cracking dry on your face) and gentle supple dry (as in no cracking dryness at all), making it probably a good clay mask for all skin types. My problem area is around my nose (open/ larger pores) and this clay drew out the pore build up there, making my pores considering smaller and less noticeable, after the first use. My skin feels buffed and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product as a promotional sample, in order to test it and write an honest and objective opinion (if I don&#x27;t like a product I will certainly say so).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional facials, I&#x27;ve been to the mud baths at Indian Springs in Colorado, and this ranks among the finest of the fine.  The fact that nearly all the ingredients are organic shows the conscientiousness of the manufacturer in providing the finest product possible.  The jar is beautiful,&lt;br /&gt;there is a plentiful amount included...because the mud itself is so fine, a little goes a long way.  The astringency is excellent.  The special oils&lt;br /&gt;that are included:  Sunflower, Jojoba, calendula, I know from my studies of herbs to be excellent for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;  When I rinsed it off, my skin felt soft and amazing.  It looks radiant too.&lt;br /&gt;  Highly recommended without hesitation to anyone who wants to look good and feel good.&lt;br /&gt;  The finest spas in the world would use this, and any person in the privacy of home, would get a quality facial too.</li>
            <li> works good, really soft skin after using.</li>
            <li> This dead sea mud mask is created with completely natural ingredients, and feels so soothing when you apply it to your face.  After mixing the gooey brown liquid, I dug my fingers into the muck and camouflaged my face with it.  For my first try, I left it on for about 15 minutes.  I looked like a swamp creature, but felt very relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the mud dries, it leaves a slightly tight feel and has a tingling sensation, almost like your skin is being stretched a little. After I wiped the mask off with a damp washcloth, my skin was a little dry, so I rubbed moisturizer on.  Over the next few days I noticed how clean my pores looked.  The mud mask helped to pull out a lot of toxins that were hiding in my face.  I love how all of the ingredients are natural, and no Parabens or harsh chemicals are used in this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*sample received for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for great facial products that won&#x27;t make my skin break out.  My face is acting like a teenagers face and I am in my mid thirties...what the heck!!! So I have had great experience with products from the Dead Sea, so when I was offered this Dead Sea Mud Mask from Spa&#x27;s Premium for a great deal to share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a jar.  I have  used it a couple times over the last week and I love the feeling my skin has after I take it off. It is so soft and it even feels a little tighter.  I love this mud mask and the best is my face hasn&#x27;t reacted to it.  I definitely recommend this Dead Sea Mud Mask from Spa&#x27;s Premium for anyone who wants a very soft face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this kind of thing before but I&#x27;ll tell you what after you wash it off your skin feels silky smooth</li>
            <li> This mud mask is nice, I didn&#x27;t find anything super extraordinary about it and it did dry out my skin a little bit but nothing that a little moisturizer after doesn&#x27;t fix. It smells nice and does a great job at removing excess oils that clog up my pores. And I know pores, mine are HUGE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*sample provided for review purpose*</li>
            <li> Not sure it did anything for me as other reviewers have noted. It feels cool and soothing until it starts to dry. Then it makes places on my face really itchy. Sometimes it gets so unbearably itchy before the 15 minutes are up that I have to start rinsing it off. No one has commented on this so I&#x27;m not sure if this is supposed to be the case or not.</li>
            <li> This was a HUGE container, good value! There was no bad odor like some mud products. I wanted to try it a few times before reviewing. I stirred it as it said on the label, but the consistency didn&#x27;t really change that much. The coverage thinner than I thought it would be, but that&#x27;s ok. It will last longer. I left on about 15-20 minutes each time, about the time my face started feeling really tight. It was easily washed off and did not leave a mess in my sink. My skin felt good after, but nothing earth-shattering. I will continue using it once a week or so to see if I notice any difference. I liked the natural ingredients. This product was sent to me to review. My review is unbiased.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve never had a mud mask before and I loved the outcome. My skin looked refreshed, poor were smaller too.</li>
            <li> This mask has been my savior and I&#x27;ll tell you why. I never notice any differences in my skin whenever I wear masks except for the hydrating properties but this mask is really amazing because I currently have some cystic acne that is painful and red. After putting this mask on my face for 20 mins, I felt my skin tightening up from the mud. After rinsing it off, I noticed a lot of the blemishes on my face came to head, which meant I could pop those pimples out. The cystic acne also rose higher to the surface of the skin and I could feel that it&#x27;ll come to head shortly as well. The minerals in this mask really help draw out all the impurities in the skin. My forehead had a lot of raised bumps after I rinsed the mask off, and the reason it was like that was because there was probably a lot of something bad that was absorbed into my skin. After rinsing the mask off, my face felt clean, soft and hydrated. Not one second did I have to worry about dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this mask to anyone who suffers from acne, whether hormonal or stress, stressed out skin, uneven skin tones etc. it&#x27;s worked amazingly for me!</li>
            <li> I did not see good results</li>
            <li> Great stuff!!! It makes my skin soft my pores small and pimples immediately start healing after just one use. I love it. Was nervous when I got it.. seemed real generic. But I love it!</li>
            <li> Watery. Not a good product.</li>
            <li> Being a Makeup Artist and Beauty Enthusiast, I am always looking for the next best thing. I have tried numerous different facial masks of all sorts. Including Dead Sea Mud Masks. This product is Organic which is a major plus for me. Who wants to put junk on their face anyway... This product is amazing. Its not super thick like most. So it lets your skin breathe. Using the product was super easy. Just follow the directions on the jar.&lt;br /&gt;It has no smell [to me anyways], Its a light to medium texture. NOT gritty. After putting on the mask, my nose felt a little itchy. But I think that is because it was getting deep down into my pores. Like most masks claim to do but DO NOT. This mask was something different.&lt;br /&gt;The recommended time is 15-20 minutes. I left mine on for about 25-30. I wanted to let it really settle into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;To remove it I used a washed cloth. My skin never felt so smooth in my life. It was a little red, but I think that is because I used a wash cloth. But I didn&#x27;t care. After using a moisturizer [it says you can if you choose to] My skin was GLOWING! Its been over a day since applying it and my skin is still feeling AND looking radiant. I have been getting compliments left and right...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So kudos to Spa&#x27;s Premium for making this amazing mask. Making it Organic with no junk involved, and for sticking by your words that it WILL work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This has to be the best Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask I have ever used. I was selected to receive a complementary sample of it to try and give my honest opinion on how I liked it. Well, I loved it! It arrived a day early, which I love, and it was packed securely. When I opened the jar the mud was so velvety smooth and had no odor whatsoever. It was easy to apply a think layer; and it felt wonderful on my face because I used an upward motion as I massaged it into my skin. I left it on for 15 min &amp; did a few chores around the house. When I washed the mud off my skin felt extremely hydrated and so silky smooth, I didn&#x27;t even need to put a moisturizer on. I also noticed that my red cheeks were not red anymore. It must be because this mud contains 6 all natural organic extracts like Shea butter, Sunflower &amp; Jojoba oils and Aloe Vera juice just to name a few. This mud works great at healing my red cheeks and it works great on my sensitive skin. This mud has now become part of my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> This stay at home Mom needed a way to relax.  This face max did the trick for an at home spa night. The ingredients were all natural.  I can&#x27;t wait to use this mask a second time.</li>
            <li> I used this mask for a week, and honestly it didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin. However it felt nice on the skin and smells really great.</li>
            <li> I was offered the opportunity to try Spa&#x27;s Premium Dead Sea Mud Mask. I love trying new beauty products and was interested in the skincare benefits of this product. I appreciated that it is made with all natural ingredients including Shea Butter, Aloe Vera Juice, and Sunflower Oil, to name a few.  It offers anti-aging benefits and a natural moisturizer to reinvigorate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having FOUR blemishes on my face in one day, I decided it was a good time to try out this mask.  I haven&#x27;t had four zits since my teen years. Plus, I had an entire day at home, which meant I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry to get make-up on and get out the door. I had a makeup free day ahead of me so felt it was the perfect time to try out the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the mask evenly across my face with my fingers. The mask was cool and reminded me of the consistency of pudding.  I applied it lightly, but can be applied thicker if you prefer. It was wet and slimy, but dried quickly. After it dried, it turned into a hard mask that made your face feel extremely tight. You are to leave it on for 15-20 minutes. I took it off at 15 minutes by removing with a warm wash cloth. It wiped off easily.&lt;br /&gt;I then applied my usual moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face feels smoother and had a glow when I removed the mask. But, I will say, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get the mask off. I didn&#x27;t care for that tight feeling on my face. But, for 15 minutes, it is manageable. You could also use this on dry elbows, cracked heels, or other problem areas. You will get several uses out of this one jar, although you should use it within one to two months due to the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different facial mask products in the past but I&#x27;m new to mud masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the ingredients in the &amp;#34;Spa&#x27;s Premium Dead Sea Mud Mask&amp;#34; are ingredients I have used on my skin at one time or another, but since I&#x27;ve never used them in this combination, I thought I would do a test spot first. Since one of my sisters was here, we both decided to each do one of our hands as a trial before applying to our faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying then waiting 15 minutes, we both had a few spots that were still not dry, so went another 5 minutes.  Neither of us experienced any redness, itching or discomfort as we waited for the mask to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really hard to put into words the exact feeling; however after rinsing our hands and patting them dry, there was a definite difference when comparing the hand we had treated to the untreated hand. The treated hand was smoother/softer and a much cleaner feeling than the untreated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the preliminary hand test, it was time to apply to our faces. We agreed that there is hardly any odor to this product, which is a good thing for those sensitive to fragrances.  Applying the mask to the face was as easy as it had been to the hands and again, neither of us encountered any discomfort though there was a very, very slight sense of tightening as it dried.  Removing it after 15 minutes was just as easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it leaves my skin feeling, clean, fresh and soft.  When I applied it to my face I also went down part of my neck.  I can definitely feel the difference and can tell where the mud mask stopped.  I spoke with a representative and asked how frequently this &amp;#34;Spa&#x27;s Premium Dead Sea Mud Mask&amp;#34; can be used and was told 1-2 times a week is the average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Spa&#x27;s Premium Dead Sea Mud Mask&amp;#34; seems to be just as good as any of the other facial mask products I&#x27;ve used, so I will continue to use it.  I was sent a free sample to try and will buy more when this runs out.  I would have no problems in recommending it to any one looking for a facial mud mask type product.  Based on the fact that it takes such a small amount for each application, cost per facial should be far less than $1.00 and that&#x27;s a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I have washed dishes twice today since doing the test on one of my hands and the treated hand still feels softer and more supple than the untreated.  I look forward to doing another mud mask facial in a couple of days.uns out.  I would have no problems in recommending it to any one looking for a facial mud mask type product.

            <li> Great product! I have been using it for a few weeks now and my face has never felt so soft and smooth. My complexion appears more even and generally brighter. I enjoy my &amp;#34;Me&amp;#34; time and the relaxation it brings. (the statements made in this review are in my honest opinion and I was provided a sample to try and review) that it brings. Thank you a</li>
            <li> Dead sea mud mask is known for its extraordinary benefits for the skin. its got healing properties which helps in tightening of the skin, bringing back the radiance, preventing wrinkles and has anti aging properties.&lt;br /&gt;Its a great product and has really helped me in making my skin look younger.&lt;br /&gt;I deducted one star from my review as having sensitive sin it did affect me a little. I felt slight redness and tingling in my skin after washing for a few minutes but then it went off.&lt;br /&gt;its got some great ingredients like Aloe Vera, Jojoba Oil, Sunflower, Hickory Bark, Calendula and Shea Butter creates, an all-natural, familiar combination that can help with a wide variety of skin problems.&lt;br /&gt;i was lucky to receive this under promotion for my unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> This mask is very good. Wipe evenly on the skin, stay 15-20 minutes. Gently wash away with water. The effect is very good. There eliminate acne, blackhead, shrink pores effect, which is my real experience. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times and I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed a major difference in my skin but also I don&#x27;t have any major skin problems. I do have blackheads and so far they are still there. My face has been known to react to cleansing products before where it heats up and looks all red and blotchy, that was not the case with this product (thank goodness). What I did experience was that it made my face really itchy as it was drying. I had to wash it off my face before it was fully dry but other than the itchiness there was no reaction. I chalked it up to not mixing it enough (I did sort of do a quick stir in my impatience to try it). The second time I mixed it really well and I didn&#x27;t experience the itchy feeling. However, both times it left my skin feeling parched. I wound up following the mask with a coconut oil moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that in the end after it&#x27;s all said and done and I have moisturized my face, my skin does feel nice and smooth like after exfoliating. Which makes sense since as your are applying the mask you can feel some graininess to it from the mud. This is a good product and although it does seem a little pricey, you only use a little tiny amount at a time as apposed to the other commercial brands that are thick paste. So where as a $10 mud mask from the grocery only gives you 10-15 applications, I have a feeling that this tub is going to last me a year.</li>
            <li> I really liked this mask. I got it for free to review and tried it yesterday. Surprisingly, the product was filled to the very top so it does get a little messy when mixing it in the can. Once you feel the mud you can tell it&#x27;s so soft and smooth. The instructions say to apply it to your face in a top sweeping motion but I found that hard to do and just ended up spreading it around in all directions so I hope that doesn&#x27;t really make a difference. It gets a little hard in 15-20 minutes, but not so hard that you can&#x27;t move your face. When you finally get to wash it off, it&#x27;s a little bit hard to take off but leaves your face feeling so smooth and clean. I really like this mask and can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I love it.</li>
            <li> feels good, does not smell highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I mix it with grapeseed oil instead of water. my face feels wonderful when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel smooth as a baby</li>
            <li> This product is amazing...my skin feels and looks so great. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this mask! I came back here to update my original review but I cannot seem to find it. I was so excited to try this as soon as I got it, that I posted after using it once.&lt;br /&gt;Well, after using this twice a week for over a month, I still love how it makes my skin feel. It takes off the dry skin and leaves a fresh dewy looking skin afterward. I&#x27;m hooked!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have no idea if this stuff does anything great for my skin.  But it is fun and smells great.</li>
            <li> This mud mask feels cool, creamy, and refreshing when first applied to the skin.  After drying and rinsing, it leaves the skin moist, supple, clean, and firmed, and neither oily nor dry.  I use it before bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask has a beautiful deep grey color from the mineral-rich Dead Sea mud, which is blended with a few botanic and mostly organic ingredients to condition and protect the skin:  shea butter, jojoba oil, aloe vera juice, calendula oil, and hickory bark extract.  It has only a slight earthy fragrance and can be used even by people with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar holds 8 oz. ounces and should provide at least ten or twelve facial treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Pure Dead Sea mud, organic shea butter, organic sunflower oil, organic aloe vera juice, organic vegetable glycerin, organic jojoba oil, hickory bark extract, organic calendula oil, filtered water, xanthan gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handcrafted Goods provided a jar for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing. Opened all my pours</li>
            <li> I have never been a big mud mask girl, but I have tried a few and this is honestly one of the best! I cannot attest to how it does regarding acne or blemishes because I don&#x27;t have any of those problems; however, I am getting old, I live in NYC where it is currently FREEZING which does a serious number drying out skin, and I have a nearly four year old daughter who gets eczema patches around the lower part of her face (mainly her chin) from time to time. This mud mask did a beautiful job at combating my horribly dull and dry winter skin leaving it totally refreshed, smooth, and soft. It also helped to clear up an eczema patch my daughter had with just one light coat after about five minutes. I was advised that I should probably not use this on her as she is a bit young, but after some research on the ingredients they are definitely safe. I wouldn&#x27;t advise giving a full facial to a toddler/preschooler/little kid, but if there are small patches where their skin is very dry, itchy, or breaking out from something that doesn&#x27;t require medical attention then this works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend this for usage on your feet! Yes, your feet! If your feet are resembling Fred Flintstone&#x27;s or you simply want to give your feet a treat then coat them in this mask, put your feet up, and let it do its magical thing! I haven&#x27;t had a pedicure since...I can&#x27;t even remember to be honest. I am nearing the Fred Flintstone phase I know that much. You know, where they look like you&#x27;ve been starting your car with your feet and kicking rocks all day, and you can hear them scratching the sheets at night? Yeah, that. Well I used this and wooo what a difference! I know the description didn&#x27;t say use it on your feet, but it did say skin and there&#x27;s skin on your feet right? Ok!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So long story short, I definitely recommend this product for face, feet, and probably anywhere in between (although I haven&#x27;t tried it anywhere in between).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product for free in exchange for a fair and honest review.

            <li> I have used a lot of different types of Mud masks in the past, but none quite as potent and of quality as this one. The first thing I have to say is I love that right on the label it lists the ingredients. It&#x27;s not 20 long words no one really understands, but simple words such as sunflower oil and shea butter. The next thing I have to say is unlike a lot of mud masks I have tried this has no awful smell! In fact, to me it has no smell at all....just results. My skin is so unbelievably dry, so I was a little worried to use it at first. However, this mask does a great job at taking any dead skin off, and I have noticed I have had to use a moisturizer a lot less since using the mask. I also have really sensitive skin, and turn red almost after any mask. This doesn&#x27;t turn my face red at all though, and I like that it has Aloe Vera Juice in it keeping my face cool. I would highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a great dead sea mud mask that gives you that little something extra at the same time.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually stick with The Body Shop Seaweed Line of Skin Care Products.  I don&#x27;t usually deviate from that line, but I tried this product twice so far.&lt;br /&gt;- I have been to the Dead Sea and lathered myself with the mud. So I do know the impact of the Dead Sea on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;- This product has a lighter feel than other muds I have used.  I guess the Aloe Vera Juice and Shea Butter contribute to that feel.&lt;br /&gt;- I did not feel the tingling sensation I usually feel with other muds so I wasn&#x27;t sure it was working at first.&lt;br /&gt;- I used a SeaWeed cleanser from The Body Shop. I am out of the toner I usually use. After 15 minutes I washed it off and my skin. My skin did feel cleaner. It definitely acts more like a moisturizer than other muds I have used. However, I do think it will be necessary for me to us my normal toner with this for a true comparison.&lt;br /&gt;- My skin was not dry when I used this. I did use an additional moisturizer on my skin but it wasn&#x27;t entirely necessary for me.&lt;br /&gt;- My husband used the product and he really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Body Shop Seaweed Mask&lt;br /&gt;- You get more for the money with this product than the Body Shop product. Therefore, I am more inclined to purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;- This product feels better on my face. I thought the tingling feeling of the Body Shop product was necessary to work effectively but maybe that is not the case.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly!  You feel it working as soon as you let it dry on your face.</li>
            <li> U can see how much it creeps into your pores and makes my skin feel so smooth afterwards</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mud mask.  As I opened the jar, I noticed the wonderful spearmint smell, which I love.  I have tried many dead sea masks and they work, but they either have no smell or an awful smell, and I find that my skin needs a mask again before the recommended weekly mask.  So I decided to give this a try, the smell made the time I waited for the mask to day very pleasurable, and you only need a very thin coat for the mask to work.  Immediately I could feel the mask pulling the toxins from my skin.  When I washed the mask off after it dried, I noticed how smooth and soft my skin felt.  And the best part was that it lasted until time for my next weekly mud mask.  So if you are looking for a great dead sea mud mask to keep your skin looking fresh, young and healthy, make sure to purchase this.

            <li> I was asked to try this mud mask. I usually go for the &amp;#34;St. Whatever&amp;#34; stuff from the pharmacy (with a huge list of ingredients). When I opened it, I was surprised at first it doesn&#x27;t have any scent. Not even mud scent. I am used to everything perfumed up, but I like it unscented! It was a refreshing change that I knew every ingredient on the list. I was surprised it went on smooth and creamy. My &amp;#34;St. Whatever&amp;#34; stuff was like plaster and not as nice to put on.It dries thinner too, so you don&#x27;t have to scrub several layers of skin to remove it once dry.&lt;br /&gt;It did a very nice job making my face feel refreshed and clean. I moisturized VERY lightly afterwards with a tiny bit of organic coconut oil. Great quality product with high grade ingredients (that you can understand!).&lt;br /&gt;BTW, the amount you use is TINY to cover a normal sized lady&#x27;s face. Directions say to spread thinly in an upward motion. I think I used too much the first time!! This is going to last me A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin GLOW! :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once so far and my skin felt and looked great after :)</li>
            <li> I have always been worried about trying a mud mask on my face.I have oily skin and was worried it would make it worse .well to my supreme this product has been great.My first time applying it was great.went on real smooth and washes off easily with warm water.My husband noticed something different about my face just after using one time.my skin is so smooth and healthier than ever before.i don&#x27;t have oily skin anymore and it makes me look so much younger.I recommend the dead sea mud mask to everyone.Im so glad I had the opportunity to review this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent mud mask. You can feel it working on your skin as it dries. I love how it doesnt dry out your skin as it dries, either. Once I wash it off, my skin feels so soft. I would recommend only using it once or twice a week, because it has some really good tightening qualities. Definitely more for grown ups, I wont share this one with the kids :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> My face felt all tingly and healthy after I put this mask on my face - I couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing my skin felt while I was wearing it.  After rinsing it off, my face felt extremely soft and smooth.  Great product!</li>
