            <li> I love this product!  It&#x27;s my favorite and I&#x27;ve tried ALL like products !!!</li>
            <li> It is effective but I didn&#x27;t love it.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.  my hairdresser uses this product on me, so I bought it.  i found it to be a bit &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; or heavy for my hair to use on a regular basis.  i prefer the kerastase oil instead.  My 14-year old with very long hair will use it on occassion when starightening her hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much of anything, no matter how much I use.</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any different in my hair</li>
            <li> Great I have long beach hair now</li>
            <li> love!  just use sparingly so you don&#x27;t leave your hair greasy.  a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product. I&#x27;ve used several of Kerastase heat protectors but this is the best in my experience. Hair is soft, manageable, easy to style, shiny and without frizz. I&#x27;ve also purchased the shampoo from this line and I feel both together leave hair looking free flowing and luxurious!</li>
            <li> I like this product and will order it again.</li>
            <li> NOT NOT A CHEAP PRODUCT WHAT i RECEIVED.  MILK PRODUCT BASED WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN DISAPPOINTED IN AMAZON.  BAIT AND SWITCH.  VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> Love it, keeps my hair from frizzing</li>
            <li> I had been having severe problems with breakage. Now my hair looks healthy and it&#x27;s growing again.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Kerastase Nectar Thermique. It&#x27;s okay but I find that the Discipline shampoo and conditioner work well enough without it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Makes my hair sleek and shiny. But the spray bottle quit working after a week :(&lt;br /&gt;So I transferred it to another bottle. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of this from my stylist a while ago to add to my blow dry finish.  It is good for that.  I have a bob cut and normally have it blown dried smooth.  Last night I decided to let my bob dry naturally and see how it looks...I have very curly hair but fine in the front and uneven in waves.  Well, this morning it looked wavy and dry lack luster, which is why I blow dry smooth.  Not today, I spritzed this around my whole head did a bit of scrunching and voila!  I am amazed!  My hair looks fashionably unkempt.  The ends are smooth and my hair looks full.  I will continue to add this to my routine for natural days.</li>
            <li> Great for dry curly hair!!!</li>
