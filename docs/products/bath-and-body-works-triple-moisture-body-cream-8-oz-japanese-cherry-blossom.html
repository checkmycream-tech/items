            <li> I love all the Bath and Body Creams.. only wish they didn&#x27;t change them so often! I no sooner find one I love and it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li> This body cream is great! My skin is really sensative and very dry. With this cream, it stays moisturized and soft! Light pleasant scent and not greasy!</li>
            <li> bought this for a friend that really liked it but didn&#x27;t know how to find it,  after a small amount of research i found it.  thank you.</li>
            <li> love it combine with the shower gel and body spray</li>
            <li> Hello I&#x27;d just like to say that this lotion is exception. It is highly lubricatory and raises the viscosity of my skin very much. Shipping time was very fast from Young Jacob. He is a loyal merchant whom I hold in high regard. Also the smell is not overwhelming like many lubricants I have encountered.</li>
            <li> this was ordered for a birthday gift and was well received , my daughter just loved it and was so excited it got here on time</li>
            <li> My wife loves this lotion.  She got some as a Christmas gift a couple years ago from a relative who worked for Bath And Body Works.  I needed to make another purchase recently to qualify my order for something else for free shipping, so she asked me to get her some more of this as an add-on item.  I have to admit, it smells really nice, and she loves it.  She says that it is thicker in this tube, than the one that comes in another container, so it goes further.</li>
            <li> We bought this scent a few years ago for our daughter and she loved it. Soo very perfect for her. I loved it so much I purchased the entire assortment for her.</li>
            <li> Very good cream that smells good. Plus a good price on bath and body works supplies. The product was received was got it pretty quick.</li>
            <li> got this for my friend for christmas, smells great and not over powering, has a subtle quality to it with the added benefit of being a lotion</li>
            <li> This is a nice, thick lotion for dry skin with a terrific scent. It lasts all day and I notice it on my sweater when I wear them again, so you&#x27;d better love the original Bath and Bodyworks Japanese Cherry Blossom perfume.</li>
            <li> I loved Bath and Body works until I read that is was ranked 8 out of 10 for toxicity. It contains parabens which has been found in breast cancer patients. For a multibillion company, you, the consumer should demand for a safer product. Write them, complain, don&#x27;t put this stuff on you. I challenge you to find out for your self, there is enough information on the internet about this. Until then, I try something non toxic like Modere&#x27;s body cream which works way better on my skin than Bath and Body works anyway. Try it, compare it, and feel good about putting something non toxic on your skin![...]. Use this link with the referral code and can receive up to $25.00 off your first order.</li>
