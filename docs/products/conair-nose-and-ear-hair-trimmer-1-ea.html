            <li>This is one of those trimmers best suited to trimming eyebrows or wayward neck hair.</li>

            <li>This is a great product- face it, we all have nasal hair sometimes and this solves the problem!</li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>Works great still after months of use.  </li>
            <li>It was also a great price.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m a happy camper from now on .</li>
            <li>Arrived timely...works great...</li>
            <li>I just remove the side teeth and it works great.</li>
            <li>I had one like this and lost it - this one is practically identical and very handy to keep in my medicine cabinet</li>
            <li>Works great, good value.</li>
            <li>Good power and non abrasive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not seen it.&lt;br /&gt;Coair makes a good product and thats why I purchased another.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good ear and nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li>Good quality and battery life.</li>
            <li>then it would be a sure win.</li>
            <li>Fast and great price!</li>
            <li>It is OK for the money</li>
            <li>guess what,&lt;br /&gt;Amazon not only had what I was looking for but they had the best price.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>if there is a better deal out there than this</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>it because it is so much better than those that have&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the price.  </li>
            <li>I love this clipper.</li>
            <li>husband likes this style better too.</li>
            <li>This is my second one and still the best trimmer I have found.</li>
            <li>Well to be truthful</li>
            <li>Worth the price and easy to handle!!</li>
            <li>This newer version works even better than the original.</li>
            <li>Those pesky nose hairs are easily removed now.  </li>
            <li>Did not work &amp; needed to return , cheap product.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for and this is just a cheap clipper probably made in China.</li>
            <li>appears cheap works well.</li>
            <li>If you have bamboo stalks growing like me, you&#x27;ll need one of the available rotary trimmers or blunt nose scissors.</li>
            <li>it is cheap plastic and did not come with a battery</li>
            <li>So far, so good for trimming ear hairs.</li>
            <li>This thing cuts clean and fast.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li>Does not trim clean.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite trimmer.</li>
            <li>The reason I selected this product is because I have the same clipper and it has worked fine for me for many years.</li>
            <li>Cap is clear, not like one in photo (ordered 4), I probably should have bought more of the NE163RCS 9piece kits instead.</li>
            <li>My old conair finaly bit the dust after many years of trusty service.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheap,not worth the price</li>
            <li>A month later I am glad I did as it has done a wonderful job and outperforms my old one hands down with no irritation or pulling.  </li>
            <li>Not expensive but works well and worth it.</li>
            <li>My kids got me one like this years ago (more than 10, probably) and it finally crapped out.</li>
            <li>The clipper does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to: Cut unsightly hair where it&#x27;s not wanted.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be funny</li>
            <li>This one cuts more easily and much closer, but is more difficult to maneuver.</li>
            <li>If it does hold up well, as others have said, then it certainly does rate five stars.</li>
            <li>it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Seasons</li>
            <li>i really like these -- a++++.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than the rotary style clippers.  </li>
            <li>Gentle and safe..glad I got it.</li>
            <li>It was an older model and worked very well until it broke in my luggage.  </li>
            <li>Having this one be half the cost makes it even better.  </li>
            <li>My dad is older and always seems to complain after purchases about products</li>
            <li>very cheap, waste of money...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>the rotary style has one little slot the hair must go into to be clipped, these are more like barber clippers.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding performance , the batteries last long , not too costly .  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this on Amazon, especially after trying a few more expensive options.</li>
            <li>This one works the best for me compared to other poorly designed personal trimmers I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Even the more hard to get areas are no longer a problem.  </li>
            <li>It is small and easy to use.</li>
            <li>is a not the same style as my old model but the Blades are the same,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>We have always found these little trimmers to work very well and always keep a spare for travel or in case something happens to one.</li>

            <li> Happy-Happy-Happy &#x3D;-) Excelent..!</li>
            <li> It is OK for the money</li>
            <li> Did not work &amp; needed to return , cheap product.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Good power and non abrasive.</li>
            <li> They should include a battery!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on what others had rated it.  I have had it almost a month and used it two or three times.  It seems to get the job done in short time.  I rated it four stars only because I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up in the long run.  If it does hold up well, as others have said, then it certainly does rate five stars.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my dad as a requested birthday gift. The reason I selected this product is because I have the same clipper and it has worked fine for me for many years. My dad is older and always seems to complain after purchases about products so I figured if I got one that was closest to the one I have (which has worked well for a long time) then it would be a sure win. It has been. Not expensive but works well and worth it.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li> Works well and keeps the boogers from hanging out of your nose.</li>
            <li> very cheap, waste of money...</li>
            <li> Cap is clear, not like one in photo (ordered 4), I probably should have bought more of the NE163RCS 9piece kits instead. This one works the best for me compared to other poorly designed personal trimmers I&#x27;ve tried.  I also like that it takes a AA battery and not an AAA</li>
            <li> My old conair finaly bit the dust after many years of trusty service.&lt;br /&gt;So shopping I went,after looking at several stores I went online.&lt;br /&gt;Well guess what,&lt;br /&gt;Amazon not only had what I was looking for but they had the best price.&lt;br /&gt;Now if there is a better deal out there than this I&#x27;ve not seen it.&lt;br /&gt;Coair makes a good product and thats why I purchased another.&lt;br /&gt;This is a not the same style as my old model but the Blades are the same,&lt;br /&gt;and it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Seasons Greetings&lt;br /&gt;M.A.FLICK</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone. You get what you pay for and this is just a cheap clipper probably made in China.</li>
            <li> appears cheap works well. don&#x27;t think its gonna last long</li>
            <li> This is one of those trimmers best suited to trimming eyebrows or wayward neck hair. It does a sketchy job on nasal hair only trimming externally. If you have bamboo stalks growing like me, you&#x27;ll need one of the available rotary trimmers or blunt nose scissors. The Conair is a lightweight.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this item.  My husband couldn&#x27;t even get this to cut anything.  The shape of the top makes it impossible to use.  You can&#x27;t cut anything with it.</li>
            <li> it is cheap plastic and did not come with a battery</li>
            <li> I had one like this and lost it - this one is practically identical and very handy to keep in my medicine cabinet</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite trimmer. My kids got me one like this years ago (more than 10, probably) and it finally crapped out. I was so happy to find this on Amazon, especially after trying a few more expensive options. This thing just works, no fuss, no muss. Stick it up your nose and whack those hairs off in seconds. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> The clipper does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to: Cut unsightly hair where it&#x27;s not wanted. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t pull or rip hair like rotary blades do, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt or cause bleeding.</li>
            <li> Works great! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> It works great.  Just what I wanted. Those pesky nose hairs are easily removed now.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good ear and nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li> Cheap,not worth the price</li>
            <li> Fast and great price!</li>
            <li> Have had one of these for years.  Had a hard finding these.&lt;br /&gt;Love it because it is so much better than those that have&lt;br /&gt;a round head.  This thing cuts clean and fast.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> works as expected....</li>
            <li> love the price.  i really like these -- a++++.</li>
            <li> Works great still after months of use.  It was also a great price.  Yes, it&#x27;s plastic, but does the job!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Not the best nose trimmer there is.</li>
            <li> Works well for trimming ear hairs. It is small and easy to use.</li>
            <li> We have always found these little trimmers to work very well and always keep a spare for travel or in case something happens to one.</li>
            <li> Ugh, I hate the need for this thing, but it does its job.  however, I prefer the efficiency of the rounded-tip clippers as opposed to this flat one.  This one cuts more easily and much closer, but is more difficult to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than the rotary style clippers.  the rotary style has one little slot the hair must go into to be clipped, these are more like barber clippers.  They work well, but won&#x27;t knick you either.</li>
            <li> I love this clipper. I use it every week when my nose hair starts to get a little longer than I like.</li>
            <li> So far, so good for trimming ear hairs. It does help to set up two mirrors so you can see what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> this never pulls your hair. Never hurts. You can be completely careless with this and it will never hurt.&lt;br /&gt;My husband likes this style better too. The one that hurts is a circle style cutter on the end. Dont buy that kind.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this style instead.</li>
            <li> Perfect for nose hair. Gentle and safe..glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband&#x27;s stocking. I thought it would be funny but he has actually used it several times. He loves it.  The joke&#x27;s on me!</li>
            <li> Hideous!  This thing is NOT suitable for trimming nose hair. I will be requesting a return authorization.</li>
            <li> This worked great for me! I recommend this to everyone!! Worth the price and easy to handle!! I will buy this if needed again!</li>
            <li> Outstanding performance , the batteries last long , not too costly .  So I&#x27;m a happy camper from now on .</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected. Does not trim clean. Leaves a lot untrimmed hair.</li>
            <li> Works great, good value.</li>
            <li> Not very good at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Problem is with the cutting head system.  Might as well use scissors. I had a Norelco that was twice as expensive but it actually worked.</li>
            <li> I had bought one of these 10 years ago.  It was an older model and worked very well until it broke in my luggage.  This newer version works even better than the original.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely...works great...</li>
            <li> Good quality and battery life.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do the job&lt;br /&gt;hard to use&lt;br /&gt;would not reccommend&lt;br /&gt;flimsy and not well made&lt;br /&gt;i would not reccommend this</li>
            <li> This is a great product- face it, we all have nasal hair sometimes and this solves the problem!</li>
            <li> This is my second one and still the best trimmer I have found.</li>
            <li> Rod,s second one in over 10 years</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. I just remove the side teeth and it works great.</li>
            <li> After having my previous nose trimmer die while out of town for the holidays I bought the ConAir NE150RB from a local store.  I had gone through 2 Norelco&#x27;s within a 3 month stretch so decided to give this one a try.  Well to be truthful my old one died half way through the job so I had to get one ASAP to finish up and this one was the only other one they had in stock so I gave it a chance.  A month later I am glad I did as it has done a wonderful job and outperforms my old one hands down with no irritation or pulling.  Even the more hard to get areas are no longer a problem.  Having this one be half the cost makes it even better.  They made a believer out of me and if you are considering it I hope you give it a chance to convince you as well.</li>
