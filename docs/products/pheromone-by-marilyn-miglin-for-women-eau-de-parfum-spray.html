            <li>To me, it just smells like \\&quot;sexy woman\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I love Alliage, not Pheromone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is such an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I am a smell freak and have many, many choices and this is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>I intend to stick with this one.  :-)</li>
            <li>I have been wearing Pheromone for many years.  </li>
            <li>Spirited Self applauses and relishes each spray...</li>
            <li>So glad I can get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments when I wear this perfume.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s OK because it makes it mine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, she also enjoyed the smell of formaldehyde and moth balls.</li>
            <li>My sincere gratitude goes out to Marilyn Miglin for creating such a perfect fragrance!</li>
            <li>as we all know there isn&#x27;t much more to say.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>A lovely fragrance, lots of compliments.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve had so many inquiries as to \\&quot;what</li>
            <li>You will smell like you just stepped out of the shower using an exquisite French soap.</li>
            <li>have been using it for over 30 years and get more compliments&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>i really love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE THE FRAGEANCE</li>
            <li>Absolutely love Pheromone Parfum.</li>
            <li>I always wore that, but in the three years I&#x27;ve worn MM Pheromone, I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments than ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is my FAVORITE perfume.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>absolutely love this fragrance and cannot find it in the stores.  </li>
            <li>This is a scent that I feel in love with yrs ago.  </li>
            <li>I have had this fragrance for many years.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It is cheerful and lovely.</li>
            <li>I guess the propellants interjected made this too strong even with one spray at midrift area.  </li>
            <li>I have asked if it&#x27;s too strong and everyone tells me NO</li>
            <li>aware &amp;#34;NO RETURNS OF FLAMMABLE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS&amp;#34; when requested.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pheromone is a classic that can hold its own up against any number of famous scents.</li>
            <li>This product has a nice signature scent not commonly found with more pedestrian perfumes.  </li>
            <li>Unlike another reviewer, I find it fine for daytime, though I suppose it may depend on your personality.  </li>
            <li>not for ladies who use fine quality parfume.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>It smelt fantastic and now I wear it every day.  </li>
            <li>this is the only perfume that a stranger told me i had a great smell and even though i was 20 feet away from him, he smelled me already...</li>
            <li>After reading dozens and dozens of reviews on it, I knew that it had to \\&quot;warm up\\&quot; to my body chemistry before I would know what it really did for me.  </li>
            <li>If you like a light, yet enchanting scent, this is it.</li>
            <li>Cheap stuff</li>
            <li>I must assume that many guys love Pheromone as much as I do.</li>
            <li>makes me feel a bit unique.</li>
            <li>Lots of compliments as it clean and attracting.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance and always get positive compliments.</li>
            <li>It is special on everyone...enjoyed by men and women alike ..</li>
            <li>the first time i used this i told myself,\\&quot;what a strong smell\\&quot;..</li>
            <li>so, I&#x27;m delighted I was able to save a few dollars.  </li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t wear it the first time someplace important.</li>
            <li>Thanks Marilyn keep making it!!</li>
            <li>It was so much cheaper than the one at the mall!!</li>
            <li>I have been wearing the same perfume for years,so this was a nice change.  </li>
            <li>it smells like my grandma&#x27;s eau de cologne, and I think it&#x27;s more for adult women, after 45, but</li>
            <li>One of my favorite smells...smells like old Hollywood circa 1950.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>She spent most of her days working in the family mortuary, so I doubt she received many compliments regarding her choice of perfume.</li>
            <li>My daughter says it smells like a fresh pillow.</li>
            <li>but I love the green top notes just as well.  </li>
            <li>I first started wearing this fragrence in 1996 .. when I was sprayed with it in Vegas in a restroom.  </li>
            <li>Pheromone by Marilyn Miglin is the only scent I wear, because I love it.</li>
            <li>Both items arrived intact and were exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li>So, I went ahead and ordered it here without trying another sample first.</li>
            <li>I love how it is different on everybody.</li>
            <li>i love that it takes on a slightly different smell to whomever is wearing it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product was delivered exactly as promised and when.  </li>
            <li>i thought about buying it after a lot of good reviews but the smell reminds me of a public bathroom in a clean restaurant which is not exactly what i was looking for in my purchase.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was too strong, but the scent lingered with me until I showered the next morning.  </li>
            <li>NOT MY FAVORITE BY A LONG SHOT EITHER.</li>
            <li>It is true that it will blend to your natural scent...</li>
            <li>If you have tried it once and though it was too strong or smelled like an old lady perfume, you should try it a few more times.  </li>
            <li>Really.  </li>
            <li>but I tried it again and it really grows on you.  </li>
            <li>I tried it the day before a date with a guy who I really wanted to impress.  </li>
            <li>Will not buy agian smells too much like olddddddddddd.   </li>
            <li>I use the words \\&quot;warm\\&quot; or \\&quot;heady\\&quot; as it is almost as much a visceral presence as a fragrance.</li>
            <li>well, this perfume shouLd use by a LADY-or any woman who wants seduction, passion...</li>
            <li>But Im still using it, just because Im courieuse if its really works</li>
            <li>I am very displeased that my perfume was never delivered</li>
            <li>Its really a winner.</li>
            <li>thanks Marilyn</li>
            <li>Have worn this fragrance for 25 years and have never found anything I like as much as Pheromone.</li>
            <li>The person I gave it to really likes the product.  </li>
            <li>It is packaged to be reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s considered light, floral and romantic, though.  </li>
            <li>SO MUCH FADES INTO THE ABYSS.  </li>
            <li>VERY UPSET .</li>
            <li>And can&#x27;t be returned as is Hazardous Waste.  </li>
            <li>at first i was hesitant to buy this because mNY says it fits for an old people...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if I would like this, as I normally prefer very \\&quot;clean\\&quot; or single-flower scents.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like it in the winter</li>
            <li>Therefore, I would highly recommend the product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to you, Amazon, and your professional vendors...</li>
            <li>Apparently my body chemistry has changed, because it now smells like a first aid kit on me.</li>
            <li>I also tried many pheromones perfume , i wasted lots of money but at last I found the right perfume FOR me...</li>
            <li>A few hours later, I can tell you that I absolutely LOVE this!  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a new scent to try out.</li>
            <li>The fragrance arrived in brand new condition with intact and pristine packaging, as promised.  </li>
            <li>the scent has a heavy scent that is more masculine to me.</li>
            <li>I thought the same thing when I first tried it on</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought this product here, but I&#x27;ll make all future purchases of this perfume through this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very adult, old school fragrance.</li>
            <li>Aren&#x27;t pheromones what attracts males and females naturally?    </li>
            <li>This was reminescent of what old women used to wear from Estee Lauder when I was a kid.  </li>
            <li>If you like old smells, then get it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very wearable for someone (like me) who enjoys this category but not the big beast, oakmossy Chypres with a capital &#x27;C&#x27;.</li>
            <li>but it just smells to old for me.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li>However, when I got this earlier today, I did NOT sniff it straight from the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Thank you live it , this is the only thing I wear, drives men crazy, even women tell me I smell great</li>
            <li>It is a mysterious and sexy scent hard to describe.  </li>
            <li>So far, i will forever use this perfume as long as i live...(:</li>
            <li>I normally like light, airy scents like from Bath and Body Works, Victoria&#x27;s Secret, etc.  </li>
            <li>Price is reasonable for this long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>I imagine a female in a 40s peplum dress, complete with a hat and fur stole.</li>
            <li>My wife spritzes twice into the air and then walks through the little cloud as the first thing she does after drying off from her shower.</li>
            <li>I have a little perfume left in a bottle from years ago and the fragrance lasts much longer than the perfume I just received.</li>

            <li> i really love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> AND I LOVE THE FRAGEANCE</li>
            <li> Absolutely love Pheromone Parfum.</li>
            <li> I always wore that, but in the three years I&#x27;ve worn MM Pheromone, I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments than ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is my FAVORITE perfume.</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> absolutely love this fragrance and cannot find it in the stores.  </li>
            <li> This is a scent that I feel in love with yrs ago.  </li>
            <li> I have had this fragrance for many years.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> It is cheerful and lovely.</li>
            <li> I guess the propellants interjected made this too strong even with one spray at midrift area.  </li>
            <li> I have asked if it&#x27;s too strong and everyone tells me NO</li>
            <li> aware &amp;#34;NO RETURNS OF FLAMMABLE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS&amp;#34; when requested.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pheromone is a classic that can hold its own up against any number of famous scents.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice signature scent not commonly found with more pedestrian perfumes.  </li>
            <li> Unlike another reviewer, I find it fine for daytime, though I suppose it may depend on your personality.  </li>
            <li> not for ladies who use fine quality parfume.</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> It smelt fantastic and now I wear it every day.  </li>
            <li> this is the only perfume that a stranger told me i had a great smell and even though i was 20 feet away from him, he smelled me already...</li>
            <li> After reading dozens and dozens of reviews on it, I knew that it had to \\&quot;warm up\\&quot; to my body chemistry before I would know what it really did for me.  </li>
            <li> If you like a light, yet enchanting scent, this is it.</li>
            <li> Cheap stuff</li>
            <li> I must assume that many guys love Pheromone as much as I do.</li>
            <li> makes me feel a bit unique.</li>
            <li> Lots of compliments as it clean and attracting.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and always get positive compliments.</li>
            <li> It is special on everyone...enjoyed by men and women alike ..</li>
            <li> the first time i used this i told myself,\\&quot;what a strong smell\\&quot;..</li>
            <li> so, I&#x27;m delighted I was able to save a few dollars.  </li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t wear it the first time someplace important.</li>
            <li> Thanks Marilyn keep making it!!</li>
            <li> It was so much cheaper than the one at the mall!!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing the same perfume for years,so this was a nice change.  </li>
            <li> it smells like my grandma&#x27;s eau de cologne, and I think it&#x27;s more for adult women, after 45, but</li>
            <li> One of my favorite smells...smells like old Hollywood circa 1950.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> She spent most of her days working in the family mortuary, so I doubt she received many compliments regarding her choice of perfume.</li>
            <li> My daughter says it smells like a fresh pillow.</li>
            <li> but I love the green top notes just as well.  </li>
            <li> I first started wearing this fragrence in 1996 .. when I was sprayed with it in Vegas in a restroom.  </li>
            <li> Pheromone by Marilyn Miglin is the only scent I wear, because I love it.</li>
            <li> Both items arrived intact and were exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> So, I went ahead and ordered it here without trying another sample first.</li>
            <li> I love how it is different on everybody.</li>
            <li> i love that it takes on a slightly different smell to whomever is wearing it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product was delivered exactly as promised and when.  </li>
            <li> i thought about buying it after a lot of good reviews but the smell reminds me of a public bathroom in a clean restaurant which is not exactly what i was looking for in my purchase.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was too strong, but the scent lingered with me until I showered the next morning.  </li>
            <li> NOT MY FAVORITE BY A LONG SHOT EITHER.</li>
            <li> It is true that it will blend to your natural scent...</li>
            <li> If you have tried it once and though it was too strong or smelled like an old lady perfume, you should try it a few more times.  </li>
            <li> Really.  </li>
            <li> but I tried it again and it really grows on you.  </li>
            <li> I tried it the day before a date with a guy who I really wanted to impress.  </li>
            <li> Will not buy agian smells too much like olddddddddddd.   </li>
            <li> I use the words \\&quot;warm\\&quot; or \\&quot;heady\\&quot; as it is almost as much a visceral presence as a fragrance.</li>
            <li> well, this perfume shouLd use by a LADY-or any woman who wants seduction, passion...</li>
            <li> But Im still using it, just because Im courieuse if its really works</li>
            <li> I am very displeased that my perfume was never delivered</li>
            <li> Its really a winner.</li>
            <li> thanks Marilyn</li>
            <li> Have worn this fragrance for 25 years and have never found anything I like as much as Pheromone.</li>
            <li> The person I gave it to really likes the product.  </li>
            <li> It is packaged to be reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s considered light, floral and romantic, though.  </li>
            <li> SO MUCH FADES INTO THE ABYSS.  </li>
            <li> VERY UPSET .</li>
            <li> And can&#x27;t be returned as is Hazardous Waste.  </li>
            <li> at first i was hesitant to buy this because mNY says it fits for an old people...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if I would like this, as I normally prefer very \\&quot;clean\\&quot; or single-flower scents.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like it in the winter</li>
            <li> Therefore, I would highly recommend the product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to you, Amazon, and your professional vendors...</li>
            <li> Apparently my body chemistry has changed, because it now smells like a first aid kit on me.</li>
            <li> I also tried many pheromones perfume , i wasted lots of money but at last I found the right perfume FOR me...</li>
            <li> A few hours later, I can tell you that I absolutely LOVE this!  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new scent to try out.</li>
            <li> The fragrance arrived in brand new condition with intact and pristine packaging, as promised.  </li>
            <li> the scent has a heavy scent that is more masculine to me.</li>
            <li> I thought the same thing when I first tried it on</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought this product here, but I&#x27;ll make all future purchases of this perfume through this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very adult, old school fragrance.</li>
            <li> Aren&#x27;t pheromones what attracts males and females naturally?    </li>
            <li> This was reminescent of what old women used to wear from Estee Lauder when I was a kid.  </li>
            <li> If you like old smells, then get it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very wearable for someone (like me) who enjoys this category but not the big beast, oakmossy Chypres with a capital &#x27;C&#x27;.</li>
            <li> but it just smells to old for me.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> However, when I got this earlier today, I did NOT sniff it straight from the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Thank you live it , this is the only thing I wear, drives men crazy, even women tell me I smell great</li>
            <li> It is a mysterious and sexy scent hard to describe.  </li>
            <li> So far, i will forever use this perfume as long as i live...(:</li>
            <li> I normally like light, airy scents like from Bath and Body Works, Victoria&#x27;s Secret, etc.  </li>
            <li> Price is reasonable for this long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> I imagine a female in a 40s peplum dress, complete with a hat and fur stole.</li>
            <li> My wife spritzes twice into the air and then walks through the little cloud as the first thing she does after drying off from her shower.</li>
            <li> I have a little perfume left in a bottle from years ago and the fragrance lasts much longer than the perfume I just received.</li>
            <li> While the sent is not light, neither is it heavy like many other scents that try to achieve this effect.</li>
            <li> It has a very medicinal smell with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It does last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a young woman</li>
            <li> for young girl (25-35) the scent is too heavy.</li>
            <li> long after i&#x27;ve stopped smelling the aroma, others around me still do.</li>
            <li> As long as Marilyn keeps making it, I&#x27;ll keep buying it!     </li>
            <li> I lifted my hair and sprayed a little on the back of my neck.  </li>
            <li> White florals thankfully don&#x27;t dominant the composition, like in some green florals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent was not what I expected and rather musky.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a strong scent, it&#x27;s just enough.  </li>
            <li> I like the powdery dry down</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> and I have used other body sprays like BBW Brown Sugar and Fig or Twilight Woods on my clothes with the perfume on my wrists and neck.  </li>
            <li> it than any other cologne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered several bottles in the past and will keep ordering it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other.</li>
            <li> so def all you need is a little</li>
            <li> Pheromone is a green chypre with a little &#x27;c&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> but as time goes by, i am starting to like it and gets addicted with the smell...</li>
            <li> To me, Pheromone is a stronger, dirtier YSL Y, which often is considered a reference green chypre, albeit a prim one.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to heavy floral perfumes.</li>
            <li> Its a heavy scent</li>
            <li> She put it on and the scent lasted a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> This is the most disgusting smell.  </li>
            <li> For the past twelve years I have averaged three legitimate inquiries a week from guys wishing to buy it for their wives or girl friends.</li>
            <li> i bought the small one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A VERY GREEN DRYDOWN ON IT.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find</li>
            <li> but that doesnt mean that u will not like it..</li>
            <li> And leaves an enchanting fragrance behind as you move around.</li>
            <li> and I ever get tired of nuzzling her and just inhaling her with this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is the worse smelling fragrance I ever smelled.  </li>
            <li> ITS NOT THE WORSE THING IVE EVER</li>
            <li> This is some serious grandma smelling stuff!</li>
            <li> I am now stuck with a nearly $50 present that is worthless!!!!</li>
            <li> It is nearly impossible to purchase it in department stores.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked it smelled so vile with all the reviews.</li>
            <li> Soooooo disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I had to throw it out because it was so disgusting.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even use it as an air freshener because it was so nasty.  </li>
            <li> Nasty.</li>
            <li> Just terrible!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you have tried it once and though it was too strong or smelled like an old lady perfume, you should try it a few more times.  Really.  I thought the same thing when I first tried it on but I tried it again and it really grows on you.  It must work with your own body chemistry.  It has become my favorite scent and I have been approached by both men and women who just have to know what I am wearing!  It is a mysterious and sexy scent hard to describe.  People will remember you just because they like the way you smell! A little goes a long way and I have used other body sprays like BBW Brown Sugar and Fig or Twilight Woods on my clothes with the perfume on my wrists and neck.  Men will follow you around!  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I first started wearing this fragrence in 1996 .. when I was sprayed with it in Vegas in a restroom.  At first I thought it was too strong, but the scent lingered with me until I showered the next morning.  It smelt fantastic and now I wear it every day.  I have tried to find a replacement and I can&#x27;t .. this scent lures me back every time.  People know I am around when I wear it ... although they don&#x27;t find it over powering.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new scent to try out. I seen this on sale and thought what the heck. I don&#x27;t like this scent and I wish I could return it. This is a heavy scent. If you like Opium, Patchouli types of scents then this is for you. It would be a great value for you. It does last a long time. It is just not for me.</li>
            <li> I bought some samples of this based on the name thinking it would be attractive to men.  I tried it the day before a date with a guy who I really wanted to impress.  I&#x27;m sooooo glad I tried it before the date and not the day of the date.  The smell of it is so overpowering that it hurts my throat.  There&#x27;s no way that I would ever wear this anywhere.  My samples went in the trash.  I&#x27;m not a young woman but I&#x27;m not a grandmother, either.  Always try colonge before you buy it.  And don&#x27;t wear it the first time someplace important.</li>
            <li> My husband walked by the perfume counter and actually had a physical reaction to Pheromone.  Aren&#x27;t pheromones what attracts males and females naturally?    I buy the bath oil.  It lasts all day, I like the scent better and it&#x27;s $20 cheaper than the eau de perfume.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent. I have been wearing the same perfume for years,so this was a nice change.  The price was the best I found and I did a lot of shopping.</li>
            <li> i thought about buying it after a lot of good reviews but the smell reminds me of a public bathroom in a clean restaurant which is not exactly what i was looking for in my purchase. Will not buy agian smells too much like olddddddddddd.   You can judge for yourself but if your in your mid 20&#x27;s i can guarentee this is not what you want to smell like!!!</li>
            <li> I have always liked the scent of Pheromone by Marilyn Miglin.  It is cheerful and lovely. And leaves an enchanting fragrance behind as you move around.</li>
            <li> Thirty-eight years with the same woman and I ever get tired of nuzzling her and just inhaling her with this fragrance. My wife spritzes twice into the air and then walks through the little cloud as the first thing she does after drying off from her shower. I enjoy the fragrance and the performance! While the sent is not light, neither is it heavy like many other scents that try to achieve this effect. I use the words \\&quot;warm\\&quot; or \\&quot;heady\\&quot; as it is almost as much a visceral presence as a fragrance. To me it doesn&#x27;t smell like \\&quot;floral\\&quot; or \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; although both elements are probably there.  To me, it just smells like \\&quot;sexy woman\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> at first i was hesitant to buy this because mNY says it fits for an old people...well, this perfume shouLd use by a LADY-or any woman who wants seduction, passion...the first time i used this i told myself,\\&quot;what a strong smell\\&quot;..but as time goes by, i am starting to like it and gets addicted with the smell... It is true that it will blend to your natural scent... Of all the perfume i used- this is the only perfume that a stranger told me i had a great smell and even though i was 20 feet away from him, he smelled me already... I also tried many pheromones perfume , i wasted lots of money but at last I found the right perfume FOR me... I also ordered destiny and it smelled awesome too... So far, i will forever use this perfume as long as i live...(:</li>
            <li> This is the most disgusting smell.  I was shocked it smelled so vile with all the reviews. I normally like light, airy scents like from Bath and Body Works, Victoria&#x27;s Secret, etc.  This was reminescent of what old women used to wear from Estee Lauder when I was a kid.  I had to throw it out because it was so disgusting. I couldn&#x27;t even use it as an air freshener because it was so nasty.  If you like old smells, then get it. Otherwise, the pheremone thing is a lie. You can pee on yourself and have &#x27;pheremones&#x27; if that&#x27;s what you want. Nasty.</li>
            <li> Im kinda dissapointed....it smells like my grandma&#x27;s eau de cologne, and I think it&#x27;s more for adult women, after 45, but for young girl (25-35) the scent is too heavy. But Im still using it, just because Im courieuse if its really works and I didn&#x27;t noticed that it attracts men... It is just regular, a bit stinky parfume....</li>
            <li> I buy this for myself and my daughter.  Excellent price and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Pheromone is a green chypre with a little &#x27;c&#x27;. It&#x27;s very wearable for someone (like me) who enjoys this category but not the big beast, oakmossy Chypres with a capital &#x27;C&#x27;. White florals thankfully don&#x27;t dominant the composition, like in some green florals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pheromone is a classic that can hold its own up against any number of famous scents. To me, Pheromone is a stronger, dirtier YSL Y, which often is considered a reference green chypre, albeit a prim one. If you could turn Estee Lauder Alliage into a chypre, this is what you would get. Only difference is ... I love Alliage, not Pheromone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very adult, old school fragrance. I imagine a female in a 40s peplum dress, complete with a hat and fur stole.</li>
            <li> I am very displeased that my perfume was never delivered but they took the money out of my account. I will dispute the charge with my bank.</li>
            <li> Pheromone by Marilyn Miglin is the only scent I wear, because I love it. I am allergic to heavy floral perfumes. For the past twelve years I have averaged three legitimate inquiries a week from guys wishing to buy it for their wives or girl friends. I must assume that many guys love Pheromone as much as I do.</li>
            <li> This is such an excellent product. I recommend it.  I always purchase this item; As always, speedy service received from vendor.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite smells...smells like old Hollywood circa 1950. I am the only one who wears it in my neck of the woods and I get compliments</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume along with the Fluid Gold as they are both favorites of my wife. Both items arrived intact and were exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews on this product, I ordered a small sample first for about $3.00...boy am I glad I did!!! This is some serious grandma smelling stuff! I&#x27;m only 25 and boy did it immediately age me! White Diamond perfume is a 10 on the stink-o-meter and this stuff comes in at about an 8. Its a heavy scent so def all you need is a little but it just smells to old for me. YUCK! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> I just ordered this again and I am so happy to renew my love for this fragrance.  I have worn it since 1982.  I particularly like it in the winter but I am wearing it now in August and it is also wonderful.  It has great longevity and the perfect silage.  I like the powdery dry down but I love the green top notes just as well.  I am a smell freak and have many, many choices and this is one of my favorites.  Can you tell...I love it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if I would like this, as I normally prefer very \\&quot;clean\\&quot; or single-flower scents.  I don&#x27;t like Opium-type spicy perfumes. However, when I got this earlier today, I did NOT sniff it straight from the bottle.  After reading dozens and dozens of reviews on it, I knew that it had to \\&quot;warm up\\&quot; to my body chemistry before I would know what it really did for me.  I lifted my hair and sprayed a little on the back of my neck.  A few hours later, I can tell you that I absolutely LOVE this!  It smells great and has a bit of a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; tone to it.  I intend to stick with this one.  :-)</li>
            <li> The scent was not what I expected and rather musky. Lesson Learned: Next time I will try to find the perfume in a store and test it before I buy it online.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Pheromone for many years.  This was a great purchase for the price.  The Parfum arrived in good order and promptly.  Therefore, I would highly recommend the product.  DAME HILDA</li>
            <li> Am thrilled to have found &amp;#34;Pheromone&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;My Spirited Self applauses and relishes each spray...&lt;br /&gt;Wickedly Tempting Smiles are received with each compliment ...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this in stores but always get compliments on this fragrance.So glad I can get it on Amazon. Its really a winner.</li>
            <li> I have used Pheromone for 40 years! People stop me all the time (both men and women) asking what my fragrance is and where it can be purchased!</li>
            <li> If you like a light, yet enchanting scent, this is it. It is hard to find but well worth it.[[ASIN:B000C2164A Pheromone By Marilyn Miglin For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 Ounces]]</li>
            <li> Very nice scent...not a day time scent.  For night only.   I get many compliments when I wear this perfume.</li>
            <li> i honestly didnt like the smell....i gave it to my maid...but that doesnt mean that u will not like it..its just that i didnt ...but great customer service and no complaints on anything! great bottle!</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for years...love it !! It is special on everyone...enjoyed by men and women alike ..thanks Marilyn</li>
            <li> So many compliments wearing this fragrance!  I&#x27;ve used for years and would use nothing else</li>
            <li> Thank you live it , this is the only thing I wear, drives men crazy, even women tell me I smell great</li>
            <li> Smells nothing like her sample sizes.  Soooooo disappointed.  And can&#x27;t be returned as is Hazardous Waste.  I guess the propellants interjected made this too strong even with one spray at midrift area.  I&#x27;ll stick with sample sizes that  you can tap on at ear, wrist, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware &amp;#34;NO RETURNS OF FLAMMABLE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS&amp;#34; when requested.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. Have been wearing it for years. Get compliments all the time. Mostly from men!! Have given it to others but it doesn&#x27;t smell the same so they give it back to me. That&#x27;s OK because it makes it mine.</li>
            <li> Well, I tried a sample of this a few years ago, and it was reasonable then. My husband said he liked the scent on me. So, I went ahead and ordered it here without trying another sample first. Apparently my body chemistry has changed, because it now smells like a first aid kit on me. It has a very medicinal smell with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and always get positive compliments. Have worn this fragrance for 25 years and have never found anything I like as much as Pheromone.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume for my mom and she loved it!</li>
            <li> so happy to know it has become available on amazon....wearing the scent for over 20yrs. when I lived in Chicago, where I discovered</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years.</li>
            <li> This is the worse smelling fragrance I ever smelled.  Smells like moth balls.  Uggg..  Just terrible!!  You have to experience this yourself.</li>
            <li> I am so very happy with my purchase!  The fragrance is my personal treasure, as my signature scent...so, I&#x27;m delighted I was able to save a few dollars.  The fragrance arrived in brand new condition with intact and pristine packaging, as promised.  Thanks to you, Amazon, and your professional vendors...</li>
            <li> My great-great-great-great grandmother would have loved the smell of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, she also enjoyed the smell of formaldehyde and moth balls. She spent most of her days working in the family mortuary, so I doubt she received many compliments regarding her choice of perfume.</li>
            <li> This perfume is exceptional. It is the only scent that I wear.My sincere gratitude goes out to Marilyn Miglin for creating such a perfect fragrance!</li>
            <li> I have a little perfume left in a bottle from years ago and the fragrance lasts much longer than the perfume I just received.</li>
            <li> Not a lot to tell you guys except my wife loved it and as we all know there isn&#x27;t much more to say.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I have used since the mid 80&#x27;s. I love how it is different on everybody.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  A lovely fragrance, lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> everytime i wear this, i get compliments throughout the day.  long after i&#x27;ve stopped smelling the aroma, others around me still do. it&#x27;s not a strong scent, it&#x27;s just enough.  i&#x27;ve had so many inquiries as to \\&quot;what are you wearing?\\&quot;.  i love that it takes on a slightly different smell to whomever is wearing it. makes me feel a bit unique.</li>
            <li> Great Perfume! Haves used it for years!</li>
            <li> some items I have not evaluated yet</li>
            <li> like at all,love it..</li>
            <li> Not at all what I remembered and since I threw out the packaging I&#x27;m stuck.  It is very strong and more than that the scent has a heavy scent that is more masculine to me.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful scent - use sparingly and you will have skin that smells clean, lovely, inviting. You will smell like you just stepped out of the shower using an exquisite French soap. Every time I wear this scent someone says, \\&quot;You smell wonderful. What is that?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I had used this years ago and found it just as delightful now. It takes on your own body scents and&lt;br /&gt;really is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> bought this for my mom for christmas. she loves it. it smells really nice. doesn&#x27;t need to spray it a lot.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten how delightful that sent was.  Now that I wear it again I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a Christmas gift.  The person I gave it to really likes the product.  They have complimented on how nice it smells and how thankful they are to have received it.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and cannot buy it anywhere but online! I get compliments everytime I wear it! It is packaged to be reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Been wearing it exclusively for 40+ years.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This product has a nice signature scent not commonly found with more pedestrian perfumes.  It is nearly impossible to purchase it in department stores.  Price is reasonable for this long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> Both men and women constantly ask me what I am wearing and those who know me say they can tell I am in a room without seeing me. I have asked if it&#x27;s too strong and everyone tells me NO, it&#x27;s lovely!</li>
            <li> Pheromone is my all time favorite, it is an amazing scent.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for over 30 years and get more compliments&lt;br /&gt;on it than any other cologne</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my Mom, who has been wearing this perfume for 30 years.  She put it on and the scent lasted a few seconds.  I contacted the seller and they wouldn&#x27;t do anything about it because it was outside of the return policy.  I am now stuck with a nearly $50 present that is worthless!!!!</li>
            <li> i really love the fragrance. It is not overpowering and I can wear it to work. I also have the body lotion, which I use for layering. If it wasn&#x27;t for Amazon,I never would of seen this perfume. Thank-you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Pheromone on and off since its introduction and consider it my signature scent.  Unlike another reviewer, I find it fine for daytime, though I suppose it may depend on your personality.  I had a lot of attention from coworkers (men) when I was younger and wearing this.  As long as Marilyn keeps making it, I&#x27;ll keep buying it!     I don&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s considered light, floral and romantic, though.  I always think it smells like mystery and gold.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and always get asked what scent I&#x27;m wearing both by men and women. Thanks Marilyn keep making it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for 30 years and I still get compliments.  My daughter says it smells like a fresh pillow.</li>
            <li> MY WIFE LIKES IT AND I LOVE THE FRAGEANCE ON HER.&lt;br /&gt;VERY UNIQUE WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love Pheromone Parfum. Have been wearing it for several years and wouldn&#x27;t think of wearing anything else. Get lots of compliments almost every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> This has become my signature fragrance, one that ALWAYS gets raves from my friends and colleagues.  I enjoy being told every day how great I smell.  I replaced that perfume that has the number between 4 an 6.  I always wore that, but in the three years I&#x27;ve worn MM Pheromone, I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was delivered exactly as promised and when.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought this product here, but I&#x27;ll make all future purchases of this perfume through this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m completely happy with the purchase experience.</li>
            <li> This is the second time that I buy this perfume for my mom. It was so much cheaper than the one at the mall!!</li>
            <li> this is my FAVORITE perfume. When I wear it I always get a response of &amp;#34;Wow, what perfume are you wearing?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it exclusively since 1990.  Lots of compliments as it clean and attracting.</li>
            <li> not for ladies who use fine quality parfume. Cheap stuff</li>
            <li> THIS COULD BE A SISTER OF NORELL BY FIVE STAR FRAGRANCE.  A VERY GREEN DRYDOWN ON IT.  THE POWDER THAT I LOVE SO MUCH FADES INTO THE ABYSS.  I WANT POWDER NOT NORELL. I AM NOT A BIG FAN OF NORELL.  ITS NOT THE WORSE THING IVE EVER WORN BUT NOT MY FAVORITE BY A LONG SHOT EITHER.</li>
            <li> terrible!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank god.. i bought the small one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;really, i think the review is fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t buy it.  you will regret.</li>
            <li> One of the fragrances I choose to not be without.  My husband agrees.</li>
            <li> One of my b&#x27;day gifts from my fiancee....absolutely love this fragrance and cannot find it in the stores.  I&#x27;ve ordered several bottles in the past and will keep ordering it.</li>
            <li> This is a scent that I feel in love with yrs ago.  Was very happy to find it again. The seller was honest about the product. I am very happy with what I received</li>
            <li> STATES I RECEIVED PRODUCT BUT I DID NOT!! RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT, BUT THEY WERE VERY GOOD TO TAKE MONEY OUT OF MY ACCOUNT! VERY UPSET . HOW CAN I FIX THIS CAN ANYONE HELP ME!!!</li>
            <li> I have had this fragrance for many years. It has become my scent. I wouldn&#x27;t use any other. It is me. Love it</li>
