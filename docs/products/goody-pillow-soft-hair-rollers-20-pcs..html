    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very happy for the price!!!</li>
            <li>These create the absolutely best holding curls ever!</li>
            <li>I could sleep and wake up to beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>These are great.</li>
            <li>A good value for the cost.  </li>
            <li>But if you are like me, who is the occassional user, they have held up just fine and make very nice spiral curls!</li>
            <li>They are real comfortable to sleep in.  </li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>I love what they do for my hair.  </li>
            <li>and then you have to buy more.  </li>
            <li>If they manufacturer would just do a better sewing jobs on the ends it would have a 5 plus.</li>
            <li>We love the curl that comes from them.</li>
            <li>My hair looked better than ever.</li>
            <li>The metal sides are covered nicely and the middle has a great thickness.  </li>
            <li>But it was an easy fix.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to sleep on.</li>
            <li>Use on my own hair too because it dries fast with these</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get full refund.</li>
            <li>Initially, the curls these produced were amazing.</li>
            <li>I actually carry one of the curlers with me so that I can show people what I use since I&#x27;m asked so much.&lt;br /&gt;Great product that needs to be slightly modified in order to be perfect!</li>
            <li>I wear these to bes and they are super comfortable unlike so many other curling methods I have tried.</li>
            <li>These are easy to use and are soft to sleep in.  </li>
            <li>They fell apart as I was putting them in for the first time.</li>
            <li>They could be cushier &amp; the foam could be better quality, but they look like they&#x27;ll last a while.</li>
            <li>The wires poked through the fabric the first time I used them.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what you would expect.</li>
            <li>I will get plenty of more wear out of the package, even if they do eventually fall apart because I only use about 8 rollers per time and the package is quite large.</li>
            <li>They also have kind of a yellow stain, like maybe they are old and have been in the sun at some point.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only reason it gets a 4 is because the wires break through the end to easily</li>
            <li>The fabric is very flimsy though...</li>
            <li>They are not sewn very well and they start coming apart on the ends and the wires poke through.</li>
            <li>Very flexible</li>
            <li>I think these curlers are designed very well and don&#x27;t mind that the wire shows after some use.</li>
            <li>It may be a problem with my particular hair type - long, fine, very straight hair.</li>
            <li>These are very good for creating well-shaped curls, with less kinks in them compared to the foam rollers I used previously.</li>
            <li>Yes, like the other reviewers say, these do come unsewn on the ends very easily, but they continue to work even though they don&#x27;t look brand new.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll wake up to super soft bouncy curls that look natural!</li>
            <li>The wires are too short so anyone with thick hair won&#x27;t be able to easily twist the ends together.</li>
            <li>Once these curlers have no more life left in them, I WILL buy more!</li>
            <li>I only use four at a time because if I was to use more and do small strands of my hair, I end up with an 80s poofy-do.</li>
            <li>Also I should have listened to the other reviews, they tore the first time I wore them.</li>
            <li>I am constantly asked how I get my hair to be so softly curled and wavy the way I do.</li>
            <li>These are much easier to sleep on than curl formers and other plastic or foam curlers.</li>
            <li>The picture shows you how they look after this much use so you get an idea of what the other reviewers are talking about.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, anyway,  if I do eventually wear one out I can just pull out a new one and they should last me a long time.</li>
            <li>If you are a professional or using them every single day than they probably won&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li>You can roll tight for really curly hair or loose  for soft beachy waves.</li>

            <li> I love what they do for my hair.  They are real comfortable to sleep in.  The only reason it gets a 4 is because the wires break through the end to easily and then you have to buy more.  If they manufacturer would just do a better sewing jobs on the ends it would have a 5 plus.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to sleep on.I only wish there were larger rollers for a fuller set.</li>
            <li> The only thing is they tear open on the ends. But it was an easy fix. We love the curl that comes from them. Very happy for the price!!!</li>
            <li> Love what they do for your hair, hate the over abundance of wire in them!  You could triple the amount of curlers withe the amount of wire in them. I actually have to cut some of it off eventually when it breaks through the cotton.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot ask for them to do anymore for my hair though.  I am constantly asked how I get my hair to be so softly curled and wavy the way I do. I actually carry one of the curlers with me so that I can show people what I use since I&#x27;m asked so much.&lt;br /&gt;Great product that needs to be slightly modified in order to be perfect!</li>
            <li> My hair looked better than ever. I could sleep and wake up to beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Sent back. Didn&#x27;t get full refund. Not happy.</li>
            <li> These cheap rollers are not worth buying ,so sorry I didn&#x27;t return  the two orders. They have wires sticking out as soon as you go to use them, out of the 20 pack almost all of them are no good .Will not order these ever again. Co should be ashamed to put them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> These are very good for creating well-shaped curls, with less kinks in them compared to the foam rollers I used previously. The fabric is very flimsy though...the wires stared poking out of the rollers after about 2 weeks of usage every other day.</li>
            <li> These are great. A good value for the cost.  I would buy this again in the future.</li>
            <li> They fell apart as I was putting them in for the first time. The cover material ripped</li>
            <li> I have used these rollers 3 times and 7 out of the 20 are already falling apart. They are not sewn very well and they start coming apart on the ends and the wires poke through. Save your money and find something else!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that they don&#x27;t hurt my my head, but they come out because I toss and turn in my sleep.  Also I should have listened to the other reviews, they tore the first time I wore them.</li>
            <li> I use these for my extensions so I don&#x27;t have to use heat.  Use on my own hair too because it dries fast with these but they are comfy Enough to sleep in.  The metal sides are covered nicely and the middle has a great thickness.  You can roll tight for really curly hair or loose  for soft beachy waves.</li>
            <li> These little guys are so convenient. Very flexible and it literally feels like nothing is in your hair. I prefer these over bulky tradition rollers.</li>
            <li> These are not as well made as they used to be. The wires are too short so anyone with thick hair won&#x27;t be able to easily twist the ends together. They also have kind of a yellow stain, like maybe they are old and have been in the sun at some point.&lt;br /&gt;They work well for me though. My long hair is stick-straight. I put my hair up in 4 loose sections at night, and wake up with curls and body that lasts all day. I only use four at a time because if I was to use more and do small strands of my hair, I end up with an 80s poofy-do. That&#x27;s how well these kinds of rollers work!&lt;br /&gt;So, anyway,  if I do eventually wear one out I can just pull out a new one and they should last me a long time.</li>
            <li> These create the absolutely best holding curls ever! I have really hard to curl hair and even if I get it to curl it doesn&#x27;t stay long. I wear these to bes and they are super comfortable unlike so many other curling methods I have tried. You&#x27;ll wake up to super soft bouncy curls that look natural!</li>
            <li> I got these for use while traveling abroad since my curling iron doesn&#x27;t work with outlets there. Initially, the curls these produced were amazing. However, the curls fell after just a few hours - much worse than when I used a curling iron. It may be a problem with my particular hair type - long, fine, very straight hair.</li>
            <li> complete waste of money- buy conair or diane brand instead.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years would always get at Target but they stopped selling them. They do seem to not have the same quality that they used to have the wires come thru alot faster than they used to years ago but I roll my hair up every night and they are the only ones I can use .traditional rollers would be ver uncomfortable now to go beack to .</li>
            <li> These are easy to use and are soft to sleep in.  After a few uses the wires do start to stick out.  I wish they lasted longer.  My hair is quite thin and down to the middle of my back.  They produce curls that lasted a couple days.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Goody&amp;#34;--good enough. They could be cushier &amp; the foam could be better quality, but they look like they&#x27;ll last a while.</li>
            <li> Nice. I like them. Making curls easier and faster</li>
            <li> The wires poked through the fabric the first time I used them.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what you would expect. If you are a professional or using them every single day than they probably won&#x27;t hold up. But if you are like me, who is the occassional user, they have held up just fine and make very nice spiral curls!</li>
            <li> Yes, like the other reviewers say, these do come unsewn on the ends very easily, but they continue to work even though they don&#x27;t look brand new. I think these curlers are designed very well and don&#x27;t mind that the wire shows after some use. Because there is foam padding surrounding the wire, the curls don&#x27;t come out tight like a frizzy perm in the morning. These are much easier to sleep on than curl formers and other plastic or foam curlers. As of writing this review, I have used these curlers probably close to ten times. The picture shows you how they look after this much use so you get an idea of what the other reviewers are talking about. I will get plenty of more wear out of the package, even if they do eventually fall apart because I only use about 8 rollers per time and the package is quite large. Once these curlers have no more life left in them, I WILL buy more!</li>
