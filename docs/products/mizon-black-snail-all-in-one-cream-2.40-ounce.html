            <li>Feels wonderful on your skin, and the kids think it&#x27;s so cool that it comes from snail secretions!  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see any work on my skin concerns like pore, whitening, or bright as its said.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s good for your skin</li>
            <li>Good cream</li>
            <li>however the  cream consistency is good, and has no smell.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>but there is a good amount anyway.</li>
            <li>Good product good price</li>
            <li>Wife, kids, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Way better than a lot of drugstore brands that I use, and cheaper!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Good creme :-)</li>
            <li>Product came on time, package looked nice but the box for the jar look like is been opened and torn a bit.</li>
            <li>I use this cream every day and the results are truly spectacular.</li>
            <li>I like this product and have had some nice compliments on my skin</li>
            <li>It has made my face whiter which is nice</li>
            <li>But for the action of the cream itself for my face its excellent.</li>
            <li>Good thing absorb quickly</li>
            <li>love this cream, i will buy another one after I using this one out</li>
            <li>This might be better suited for people with combination or oily type of skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love with Korean skin products :)</li>
            <li>After application, my skin has this healthy, dewy glow that I love!&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price I think the cream is ok.</li>
            <li>but I love the texture of my skin after I use this product.</li>
            <li>It is an authentic beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>conclusion: Buy it, you will love it.</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t feel satisfied w/ this.</li>
            <li>I love to use snail creams in my face</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m in love with this product</li>
            <li>my face is more like baby face:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just about time to order more.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, but others might like it better.</li>
            <li>I really am enjoying the cream</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant fragrance, and the jar is quite large.</li>
            <li>well, I heard a lot about Snail slime and its the great benefits for the skin, but I don&#x27;t see any difference using this product so far</li>
            <li>All good, just doesn&#x27;t do much...</li>
            <li>I love her texture and Black Snail is very good for all skin</li>
            <li>But I really didn&#x27;t find it as good as Nature Republic&#x27;s Super Multi Perfection all in one product.</li>
            <li>, right?  :-)</li>
            <li>It absorts super fast and texture is nice.</li>
            <li>my package arrived much before the date expected, in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>Okay, regular version works better.</li>
            <li>The price seemed pretty darn cheap for a 75ml container.</li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t by again because I can find good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t take so long to get.</li>
            <li>I used to buy the mexican kind</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no real scent, which is good.</li>
            <li>It has like a mucus sticky, honey like texture that doesn&#x27;t sink right on your skin when you first apply it.</li>
            <li>I like this texture more than the regular all-in-one.</li>
            <li>I will say, though, that I had higher expectations given everything I had read about the supposed benefits of snail mucus.</li>
            <li>the item arrived fast and i like the product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>So I think the packaging really depends on who you buy the cream from --</li>
            <li>This feels very velvety going on and moisturizes my skin very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I realize it takes a while for skin to fully adapt to treatments, but I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and can&#x27;t really see any discernible difference on my face.</li>
            <li>It soothes the skin and it really does make my skin feel like it&#x27;s being soaked with nutrition.</li>
            <li>This one goes on so smooth (and a bit slimy because it&#x27;s snail smile after-all) and it seemed too heavy at first, but then after a minute it just absorbs into the skin for a semi-matte and non-sticky/oily finish.</li>
            <li>( I mean more of a clean glow).</li>
            <li>May be my expectations were high.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this product contains both snail mucus - in a high concentration - and moisturizers (versus just snail mucus).</li>
            <li>smooth and not oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Snail cream and just switched to this one, so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>Nice texture, absorbs well, subtle smell.</li>
            <li>And the price is reasonable, especially compared to Dr. Jart&#x27;s similar &amp;#34;Time Returning&amp;#34; cream.</li>
            <li>My face has brightened, not as red anymore, and feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is very moisturizing and somehow had help lightening my dark spots.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this black snail cream.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t finish the whole bottle yet, and I think its a little bit pricey.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> skin feels dry and taunt next morning :</li>
            <li> As far as how it absorbs it feels slightly tacky until it seeps in</li>
            <li> it was smaller then expected</li>
            <li> This was rather too dry for my skin.</li>
            <li> sometimes my skin is dry and itch， this cream didn&#x27;t fix that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I must have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> In the mornings, my skin looks less red and it seems fade some of my acne scars.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> After about a few minutes, my skin still felt too dry.</li>
            <li> The texture is creamier and leaves a less sticky feeling afterward.</li>
            <li> works wonderfully, a little worried about the packaging &amp; germs and what not.</li>
            <li> and a little provides a lot of coverage.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too heavy but give my skin the moisture it needs.</li>
            <li> When I use oil based moisturizers, they either clog my pores or make my face feel too heavy.</li>
            <li> The nights when I&#x27;m lazy to apply it....</li>
            <li> No it is sucks.</li>
            <li> and i am seeing an improvement slowly on my skin.</li>
            <li> I received this item with seal broken.  </li>
            <li> The seal was broken.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>

            <li> Wife, kids, and I love it!  Feels wonderful on your skin, and the kids think it&#x27;s so cool that it comes from snail secretions!  I guess that&#x27;s good for your skin, right?  :-)</li>
            <li> love this cream, i will buy another one after I using this one out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past couple weeks and haven&#x27;t really seen any difference, positive nor negative. I probably will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this black snail cream. The price seemed pretty darn cheap for a 75ml container. This was rather too dry for my skin. It has like a mucus sticky, honey like texture that doesn&#x27;t sink right on your skin when you first apply it. After about a few minutes, my skin still felt too dry. This might be better suited for people with combination or oily type of skin.</li>
            <li> Sorry but I don&#x27;t see any work on my skin concerns like pore, whitening, or bright as its said. I don&#x27;t repurchase it again.</li>
            <li> It absorts super fast and texture is nice. It doesn&#x27;t have fragrance and paraben, feels very nice!</li>
            <li> I apply it before bed time and definitely feel the difference in my skin tone every morning. The nights when I&#x27;m lazy to apply it.... skin feels dry and taunt next morning :(&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. Very effective and I&#x27;m in love with Korean skin products :)</li>
            <li> I like this texture more than the regular all-in-one. The texture is creamier and leaves a less sticky feeling afterward.</li>
            <li> the item arrived fast and i like the product.  i&#x27;ve been using it for ahout a couple of weeks and i am seeing an improvement slowly on my skin.</li>
            <li> Good creme :-) I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the reviews.  I received this item with seal broken.  Looks like someone had opened and used it.</li>
            <li> my package arrived much before the date expected, in perfect condition.  I was impressed by the presentation and the quality of this product. I intend to stay with this company. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Just started using it today so I don&#x27;t know about the efficacy of the product, however the seal came open. I have no patience to return it but it drastically reduces my faith in the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for about a week now and I can already see a difference in my skin tone and texture.  My face has brightened, not as red anymore, and feels so soft.  After application, my skin has this healthy, dewy glow that I love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my product from the seller, &amp;#34;Hi!Sister&amp;#34; and the product was packed perfectly.  This jar is sealed and my seal was still intact with no spillage whatsoever.  So I think the packaging really depends on who you buy the cream from -- I think the reviewers who are receiving a jar with a seal open should probably contact the seller and/or leave feedback regarding the packaging there.</li>
            <li> This feels very velvety going on and moisturizes my skin very well.</li>
            <li> The seal was broken. I kept it because I didn&#x27;t have the time to return it. For the price I think the cream is ok.</li>
            <li> It works well but I won&#x27;t by again because I can find good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t take so long to get.</li>
            <li> Product came on time, package looked nice but the box for the jar look like is been opened and torn a bit. Wish there&#x27;s a bit of fragrance in the cream.</li>
            <li> works wonderfully, a little worried about the packaging &amp; germs and what not.</li>
            <li> Good cream i like it it keep my skin real nice and moisture just great</li>
            <li> I tried this one out of curiosity. But I really didn&#x27;t find it as good as Nature Republic&#x27;s Super Multi Perfection all in one product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Way better than a lot of drugstore brands that I use, and cheaper!</li>
            <li> well, I heard a lot about Snail slime and its the great benefits for the skin, but I don&#x27;t see any difference using this product so far, I didn&#x27;t finish the whole bottle yet, and I think its a little bit pricey.  however the  cream consistency is good, and has no smell.</li>
            <li> May be my expectations were high. Didn&#x27;t see any difference. Nice texture, absorbs well, subtle smell. All good, just doesn&#x27;t do much...</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s not that my skin has improved a lot since I started using it but I love the texture of my skin after I use this product. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this cream every day and the results are truly spectacular. I love her texture and Black Snail is very good for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is regenerated and without lines. It is an authentic beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion: Buy it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> Okay, regular version works better.</li>
            <li> smooth and not oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not very moisturizing. sometimes my skin is dry and itch， this cream didn&#x27;t fix that.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> I must have really dry skin. My skin didn&#x27;t feel satisfied w/ this.</li>
            <li> So happy with my purchase I got two just in case that they get sold out.I love to use snail creams in my face thii is excellente.I used to buy the mexican kind but now I&#x27;m in love with this product my face is more like baby face:)</li>
            <li> This snail cream is wonderful!! Il give a four star to any beauty product i have purchased that did not broke me out. This stuff is very moisturizing and somehow had help lightening my dark spots. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> No it is sucks. Want to give zero star</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Snail cream and just switched to this one, so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> it moisturize but it doesn&#x27;t get rid of wrinkle, not even the finest one. Good thing absorb quickly</li>
            <li> Very nice product! Good quality. Fast shipping. Will order again from this supplier</li>
            <li> I like this product and have had some nice compliments on my skin</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars only coz it looks like somebody opened the cream when I received it. But for the action of the cream itself for my face its excellent. But hopefully for my next order, it will not be opened.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just about time to order more.  I love it.  It isn&#x27;t too heavy but give my skin the moisture it needs.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes, tightens skin, and evens out skin tone as well. It has a pleasant fragrance, and the jar is quite large.</li>
            <li> I like this product well enough. It&#x27;s lightweight - the consistency is between a cream and a gel - and a little provides a lot of coverage. I like the fact that this product contains both snail mucus - in a high concentration - and moisturizers (versus just snail mucus). There&#x27;s no real scent, which is good. And the price is reasonable, especially compared to Dr. Jart&#x27;s similar &amp;#34;Time Returning&amp;#34; cream. I will say, though, that I had higher expectations given everything I had read about the supposed benefits of snail mucus. I realize it takes a while for skin to fully adapt to treatments, but I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and can&#x27;t really see any discernible difference on my face. Still, your skin may react differently. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, but others might like it better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok&lt;br /&gt;Not the end all be all&lt;br /&gt;Equivalent to a cerave moisturizer but Korean</li>
            <li> I really am enjoying the cream it was smaller then expected but there is a good amount anyway. As far as how it absorbs it feels slightly tacky until it seeps in but you just have to properly rub it in. It has made my face whiter which is nice ( I mean more of a clean glow).</li>
            <li> Good product good price</li>
            <li> This is my favourite night time moisturiser. I have combination to oily skin and when I use oil-free moisturizers at night, they don&#x27;t feel like they are moisturising enough. When I use oil based moisturizers, they either clog my pores or make my face feel too heavy. This one goes on so smooth (and a bit slimy because it&#x27;s snail smile after-all) and it seemed too heavy at first, but then after a minute it just absorbs into the skin for a semi-matte and non-sticky/oily finish. It soothes the skin and it really does make my skin feel like it&#x27;s being soaked with nutrition. In the mornings, my skin looks less red and it seems fade some of my acne scars. It also seems to balance out my oil production.</li>
            <li> work greats! totally recommend it</li>
