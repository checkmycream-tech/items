            <li>I love these magnaPod organizers.</li>
            <li>You will love this product.</li>
            <li>better if you could order each piece/style separately too.  </li>
            <li>life will be complete:)&lt;br /&gt;thanks:)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this MagnaPods cosmetic.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I also love that you can adjust the slats to become wider if needed.</li>
            <li>These work better than anything else I have tried to store my cosmetic brushes and cosmetics as well.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love anything for organization and easy access.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much as a gift, that I ordered another set to organize even more.</li>
            <li>Now makeup and brushes are out of sight, organized, and easy to retrieve...</li>
            <li>The strong magnets adhere the organizer to the metal inside the door.  </li>
            <li>and i put all my brushes and little make up on, and its perfect.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of these and would buy more if I shift homes and the new place has metal cabinet doors.</li>
            <li>Love these - they do exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>screw trying to find shelves, this is a much better solution well made and exactly as the picture shows it</li>
            <li>Everything is out of sight and clean of dust inside my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>It helps keep eye brushes clean as the brush surface doesn&#x27;t touch anything when kept upright in these.</li>
            <li>But I would really love them to be deeper so that they can fit a little more in them.  </li>
            <li>Just remember when you are thinking how much you can fit in your medicine cabinet, you account for the height of what you are going to put in these holders.</li>
            <li>Extremely useful for keeping lipsticks and eye liners so that they do not occupy valuable space in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>They are sturdy and you can see right through them.  </li>
            <li>its right there.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I used a toothbrush holder for a while for makeup, which worked fine except that it had to be moved aside constantly to get things out of the cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They freeded up so much space in my cabinet.</li>
            <li>I can fit only one eyeliner in these.</li>
            <li>so convenient...saves me a whole 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>They obviously have their design limitations, but they are pretty flexible.</li>
            <li>I have them in my medicine cabinet, and they really clear up shelf space.</li>
            <li>Our bathroom offers a ledge for some toiletries, but height is limited by the medicine cabinet which allows just 6\\&quot; of space between the vamity and the swinging cabinet doors.  </li>

            <li> The only flaw I&#x27;ve found is that I&#x27;m now flipping back and forth to use the mirror but that can be easily fixed with a small magnetic mirror inside the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I prefer this and no the other not Magna because with metallic tape double side you can hold without problem.</li>
            <li> I basically have tweezers in one and an eyeliner in the other and no use for the third.</li>
            <li> I like that they are magnetic, but I might slap a 3M tab on the back to use them on other surfaces like my dressing table/jewelry organizer which isn&#x27;t magnetic.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>

            <li> Waste of space and useless.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an organizer for my daily used makeup (mascara, brushes, concealer, and base) and found it in my MagnaPods!</li>

            <li> This is the greatest idea ever!  But I would really love them to be deeper so that they can fit a little more in them.  I love them and want more.  And because they&#x27;re magnetic, you can move them anywhere inside your medicine chest.</li>
            <li> I love these magnaPod organizers. I had to line my cabinet with sheetmetal in order for them to work properly.  They freeded up so much space in my cabinet. They work perfect for lipstick, lip and eye liners and mascara.  Also great for makeup brushes. The best part is you can also remove the dividers in the one set to make the sections wider.  You will love this product.</li>
            <li> Love these - they do exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> great idea.  better if you could order each piece/style separately too.  adds space to medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> It only works on metal cabinets not the newer models. Had to return item back, they need to state that this product only works on metal back cabinets .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very handy, perfect for makeup brushes etc.. Just remember when you are thinking how much you can fit in your medicine cabinet, you account for the height of what you are going to put in these holders.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t recieved the magnapods yet:( so i am still waiting. im still excided&lt;br /&gt;though. waiting for the magnapods. so when i get them i will be so happy. and&lt;br /&gt;my life will be complete:)&lt;br /&gt;thanks:)</li>
            <li> I loved it so much as a gift, that I ordered another set to organize even more. No counter clutter!</li>
            <li> I had purchased this item at a Women&#x27;s Expo in Phoenix several years ago.  I just love it!!  It is perfect to hold my lipsticks and lipstick pencils.  My friend wanted me to get one for her when I went back the next year, but the booth was not there.  I recently started using Amazon and I decided to do a search for this item and low and behold, I found it.  Purchased it for my friend and she was thrilled with it.  I am thinking of purchasing another of these organizers to put in my other bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> Love anything for organization and easy access.</li>
            <li> When I received the magnapods I knew I couldn&#x27;t use the magnets so i put them up using command strips!! It works perfectly and keeps my makeup off my counter.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use these with my vanity like pictured- but put them on a 3X3 Seattle square dot magnetic bulletin board. works perfect! I love how they are adjustable!</li>
            <li> screw trying to find shelves, this is a much better solution well made and exactly as the picture shows it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this MagnaPods cosmetic. I prefer this and no the other not Magna because with metallic tape double side you can hold without problem. I have six in all my cabinets and i put all my brushes and little make up on, and its perfect. There are not too big you can hold eye brushes, eye cream, eyeshadow, some lipsticks, brow brushes, eyeliner, Q tips, and things like this, but you save a lot of space and everything its in place when you finish your makeup in a rush.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an organizer for my daily used makeup (mascara, brushes, concealer, and base) and found it in my MagnaPods! The convenience of accessing them at eye level is wonderful. No more bending over under my bathroom sink! I also love that you can adjust the slats to become wider if needed. Thanks!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for organizing your makeup and storing in inside of a metal medicine cabinet. The only flaw I&#x27;ve found is that I&#x27;m now flipping back and forth to use the mirror but that can be easily fixed with a small magnetic mirror inside the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> What a terrific use of space I didn&#x27;t even know existed!  These holders work as promised and hold lots of beauty accessories such as tweezers, brushes, and liners. They stay put even after their loaded up.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy yourself a set.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> These work better than anything else I have tried to store my cosmetic brushes and cosmetics as well. It is a great idea.  Everything is out of sight and clean of dust inside my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday. Great for an organizing nut!</li>
            <li> As the previous reviewers have stated. I can fit only one eyeliner in these. Not a big brush as shown. I basically have tweezers in one and an eyeliner in the other and no use for the third. Waste of space and useless. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE SOOOO TINY THEY HOLD NOTHING</li>
            <li> Work great, but overpriced for what they are</li>
            <li> These are AWESOME!!!!!  I love being organized and these are perfect!!!  I use them for eye pencils and mascara.  They are great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It is great for organizing cosmetics if you don&#x27;t have a lot of counter space.  I purchased 3 sets of them and lined them up in 3 rows across the inside of my vanity mirror.  They are sturdy and you can see right through them.  They are great for make up brushes, lip sticks, concealer.  The spaces are adjustable so you can make them larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need organization in my life and believe that everything should have a place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love love love it!!</li>
            <li> I like these. I have them in my medicine cabinet, and they really clear up shelf space. They obviously have their design limitations, but they are pretty flexible. I like that they are magnetic, but I might slap a 3M tab on the back to use them on other surfaces like my dressing table/jewelry organizer which isn&#x27;t magnetic.</li>
            <li> This is such a space save and in the morning rush I dont have to go thru my makeup bags and drawers to find my makeup stuff. open the medicine cabinet and tada its right there. so convenient...saves me a whole 5-10 minutes. You can also pick this up at the container store</li>
            <li> Living in Manhattan has it&#x27;s benefits and drawbacks, one of the drawbacks being lack of space.  Our bathroom offers a ledge for some toiletries, but height is limited by the medicine cabinet which allows just 6\\&quot; of space between the vamity and the swinging cabinet doors.  I used a toothbrush holder for a while for makeup, which worked fine except that it had to be moved aside constantly to get things out of the cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These organizers are awesome!  The strong magnets adhere the organizer to the metal inside the door.  Now makeup and brushes are out of sight, organized, and easy to retrieve...no more shuffling around on the vanity or mess to clean from toothbrushes left after wrinsing.</li>
            <li> Extremely useful for keeping lipsticks and eye liners so that they do not occupy valuable space in the bathroom. However, there were issues. I did not realize that my bathroom mirror cabinets did not have metal, since these are magnetized, they had to be glued up with tape. Despite that the heavier one keeps falling of due to its weight. I have to now figure out how to keep the bigger one in place. It helps keep eye brushes clean as the brush surface doesn&#x27;t touch anything when kept upright in these. I love the idea of these and would buy more if I shift homes and the new place has metal cabinet doors.</li>
            <li> Solid product, wish it came with a 2nd row of the lipstick holders, preferable over the skinny makeup brush skinny holders.</li>
