            <li>I was happy to find a pomade for kids.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find it on amazon.com</li>
            <li>This product smells great</li>
            <li>Smells great not like alcohol.</li>
            <li>Good to control fly aways on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair.  </li>
            <li>smells good  used for 4 years on my son.  </li>
            <li>The holding power isn&#x27;t what I would like to be, not any better than using my son&#x27;s body lotion (TruKid Happy Face).  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This helps when her hair is put up in ponytails or braids to eliminate the fly away hairs and get it to stay smooth and put together.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and it doesn&#x27;t look greasy</li>
            <li>The grape scent smells really good, but is REALLY strong.</li>
            <li>I love the way that it makes my pixie cut look and the smell is nice and fruity.</li>
            <li>We bought this product to use on my daughter who has very fine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve turned many people on to it.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I love the grape scent, but my husband hates the scent.</li>
            <li>The hold really isn&#x27;t that great either.</li>
            <li>The product works okay; it provides some hold without being shiny or greasy.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair jam.</li>
            <li>I do not think that the grape fragrance is overwhelming at all</li>
            <li>but most people do not bring it up.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot to make a kid&#x27;s hair look stylish</li>
            <li>A hair dresser had this product as she worked magic on her client&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>but im a 25 y/o guy and love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but this is cheaper and way better.</li>
            <li>Grape scent is okay too.</li>
            <li>I love this hair product for my son.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>hold fine hair in place and adds body</li>
            <li>I like this product over gel because it leaves my toddler son&#x27;s hair smooth rather than crunchy.</li>
            <li>It smells terrific and works great.</li>
            <li>The grape-smell is good for kids, &amp; unlike some similar products, I have no problem washing this out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for this as I ran out recently and was thrilled to see that I could order it on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>Not only can I now do all kinds of braids in my daughter&#x27;s hair without worry about them slipping out in the process, but I can do them before bedtime, &amp; they&#x27;re still perfectly intact when she wakes up most mornings, &amp; can even last a couple of days.</li>
            <li>very good just a little expensive since it is a small size, but the smell is great, sweet ans stays all day, I love the smell more than the product.</li>
            <li>Might work better for short spikey cuts.</li>
            <li>We order from amazon now when running low because the price is better than at the salon.</li>
            <li>Great for my sons thick hair.</li>
            <li>as in a lot of hair, but, at the same time, fine.</li>
            <li>This just makes his hair look really greasy.</li>
            <li>Sometimes if someone gets really close to my hair they will comment on the smell of grape</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t do much for my sons hair.</li>
            <li>he wants to use this.</li>
            <li>I asked a stylist at a children&#x27;s salon what she would recommend because when I tried braiding my (then 1.5 year old) daughter&#x27;s hair, the braids would just slip right out.</li>
            <li>I think it works really well, but I wish it held the style a little better.</li>
            <li>Even when I only use a tiny dab of the product the scent is practically overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t fade until I wash my son&#x27;s hair again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t keep his hair held in place more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>Exactly the same as the one my kids&#x27; salon sells, but way cheaper through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I use it to style my 1 year old son&#x27;s hair, or put it in a \\&quot;faux-hawk.\\</li>
            <li>My 8 yr old son loves this hair product.  </li>
            <li>old son is a toe-head-blonde with flyaway hair and colics everywhere</li>
            <li>And both have sensitive skin yet</li>
            <li>I love the scent and just a little goes a long way for all-day hold.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it after her hair has been washed and is still wet.  </li>
            <li>old baby boy since I am trying to grow his hair kinda long.</li>

            <li> Their hair grows fast so in between haircuts this product works well to help swoop back the bangs without leaving a stiff feeling.</li>
            <li> And long lasting.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I expected this stuff to keep my son&#x27;s hair a bit stiffer.</li>

            <li> The grape smell is a little overpowering as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> (He is a very active boy so the sweat from his head probably has something to do with that!)</li>
            <li> This makes my hair piecey, flexible, and gives me the ability to run my hands through it without a hard or crunchy feeling like some other products that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find products that work without weighting down this hair-type.</li>
            <li> I wanted to avoid cutting his hair and wanted something to keep it out of his eyes.</li>
            <li> We ended up cutting his hair.</li>
            <li> I will be very sad if this product is ever discontinued.</li>

            <li> One of my daughter&#x27;s has curly/frizzy hair.  This stuff works great and also smells great!  I mainly use it after her hair has been washed and is still wet.  I put it on the front of her hair before I braid it or style it for the next day.  It&#x27;s sticky, but not too sticky.  I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for this as I ran out recently and was thrilled to see that I could order it on Amazon.com.  I will be very sad if this product is ever discontinued. I&#x27;ve turned many people on to it.  Great, great product for children.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find a pomade for kids. I use it to style my 1 year old son&#x27;s hair, or put it in a \\&quot;faux-hawk.\\&quot; I love the grape scent, but my husband hates the scent. I think it works really well, but I wish it held the style a little better.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my 20 mo. old baby boy since I am trying to grow his hair kinda long. I needed something to give it some control. This just makes his hair look really greasy. The hold really isn&#x27;t that great either. It does smell yummy though. Might work better for short spikey cuts.</li>
            <li> My 8 yr old son loves this hair product.  I bought it once at the salon but they stopped carrying it.  I was so happy to find it on amazon.com</li>
            <li> How could a product with parabens be for kids? I&#x27;ve been looking for gel to keep my daughter&#x27;s hair out of her face... I almost bought this but then looked at the ingredients.</li>
            <li> The product works okay; it provides some hold without being shiny or greasy. The grape scent smells really good, but is REALLY strong. Even when I only use a tiny dab of the product the scent is practically overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t fade until I wash my son&#x27;s hair again.</li>
            <li> very good just a little expensive since it is a small size, but the smell is great, sweet ans stays all day, I love the smell more than the product.</li>
            <li> Good to control fly aways on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair.  Smells yummy too.</li>
            <li> My 22 mo. old son is a toe-head-blonde with flyaway hair and colics everywhere and this stuff tamed his hair.  And it&#x27;s not greasy like some products.  We like it and paid the same amount at our local kids salon ($10).  I would recomend this product!</li>
            <li> Excellent for curly hair. Kids and adults.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair jam. I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and have used this for about 8 years now. I love the way that it makes my pixie cut look and the smell is nice and fruity. I do not think that the grape fragrance is overwhelming at all but maybe I have become immune to it. Sometimes if someone gets really close to my hair they will comment on the smell of grape but most people do not bring it up. This makes my hair piecey, flexible, and gives me the ability to run my hands through it without a hard or crunchy feeling like some other products that I have tried in the past. Once I found this product, it has been the only one for me. Please do not ever stop offering this as I would be devastated!</li>
            <li> I like this product over gel because it leaves my toddler son&#x27;s hair smooth rather than crunchy. However, it doesn&#x27;t keep his hair held in place more than a few hours. (He is a very active boy so the sweat from his head probably has something to do with that!) The grape smell is a little overpowering as well. Probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I expected this stuff to keep my son&#x27;s hair a bit stiffer. It smells nice and it doesn&#x27;t look greasy but he just runs his hands through it and the style is gone.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It smells terrific and works great. You don&#x27;t need a lot to make a kid&#x27;s hair look stylish so it lasts a long time. It&#x27;s a little pricey but it doesn&#x27;t leave white flakes in my kids&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> A hair dresser had this product as she worked magic on her client&#x27;s hair.  I use it now for my kids.</li>
            <li> This product smells great but it doesn&#x27;t even have the \\&quot;flexible hold\\&quot; that is listed in the product description.  It only lasts a few minutes in my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> My babies constantly are having issues with bangs in their eyes. Their hair grows fast so in between haircuts this product works well to help swoop back the bangs without leaving a stiff feeling. Smells yummy too.  And both have sensitive skin yet have had no issue with this product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful, if you like grape, which I do.  The holding power isn&#x27;t what I would like to be, not any better than using my son&#x27;s body lotion (TruKid Happy Face).  I do like that it didn&#x27;t leave his hair crusty.</li>
            <li> My daughter has hair similar to mine; we refer to it as &#x27;thine&#x27;--thick as in a lot of hair, but, at the same time, fine. It is hard to find products that work without weighting down this hair-type. I asked a stylist at a children&#x27;s salon what she would recommend because when I tried braiding my (then 1.5 year old) daughter&#x27;s hair, the braids would just slip right out. She recommended this product so we bought it. Not only can I now do all kinds of braids in my daughter&#x27;s hair without worry about them slipping out in the process, but I can do them before bedtime, &amp; they&#x27;re still perfectly intact when she wakes up most mornings, &amp; can even last a couple of days. The grape-smell is good for kids, &amp; unlike some similar products, I have no problem washing this out. We order from amazon now when running low because the price is better than at the salon.</li>
            <li> The product looks like it is for kids but im a 25 y/o guy and love this stuff. it smells like grape and gives me the best hair control. My stalist got me hooked on this stuff and it contains no chemicals.     I used to use CREW for men but this is cheaper and way better. Did i mention it smells like grape?</li>
            <li> We bought this product to use on my daughter who has very fine hair. This helps when her hair is put up in ponytails or braids to eliminate the fly away hairs and get it to stay smooth and put together. Grape scent is okay too.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do much for my sons hair. It might stay in place 30 minutes before it falls in his face and looks greasy. I wanted to avoid cutting his hair and wanted something to keep it out of his eyes. This didn&#x27;t work. We ended up cutting his hair.</li>
            <li> smells good  used for 4 years on my son.  hold fine hair in place and adds body</li>
            <li> Exactly the same as the one my kids&#x27; salon sells, but way cheaper through Amazon.  I love the scent and just a little goes a long way for all-day hold.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product for my son. Everytime we go somewhere he wants to use this. The smell is wonderful for kids.</li>
            <li> I love it. Smells great not like alcohol. Great for my sons thick hair. Leaves no residue. And long lasting. Best product ever tried!</li>
