    <ol>
            <li>However it has helped me reverse damage so awesome!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great!</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with my choice.</li>
            <li>Great experience  with everything</li>
            <li>However, I had heard great reviews of this product in the youtube world as well as the internet haircare world</li>
            <li>I had watched a number of hair videos on youtube talking about how great co-washing your hair was</li>
            <li>And it did a great job of detangling my hair.</li>
            <li>great lather btw) let it sit in my hair for five minutes and rinsed.</li>
            <li>It has a baby powder scent which was very nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall good value.</li>
            <li>I used the garlic shampoo by itself for a couple weeks then added a good conditioner when my scalp started to itch.</li>
            <li>Enjoy and get some great conditioner!</li>
            <li>My hair felt so good.</li>
            <li>Smells SO GOOD  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the fact that it&#x27;s not tested on animals and has NO animal ingredients!</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy so far.</li>
            <li>think the using odorless garlic and carrier oil is more effective than this shampoo and and alter ego garlic treatment for shedding.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is AWESOME and runs out quickly in local stores.</li>
            <li>Just LOVE</li>
            <li>It works perfectly for me because I have oily hair, associated with male type hair</li>
            <li>I rate this a 4 because i love it</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>so maybe if I follow that it will work better.</li>
            <li>so I will give it more time.  </li>
            <li>Use with lots of great conditioner, this product will really work:~))</li>
            <li>how pleased that I am with this product.</li>
            <li>This is so healthy for your hair</li>
            <li>Much,  much,  much more noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>poured some more of this shampoo on my hands and reapplied,  put a plastic bag on,  tied it with a head scarf</li>
            <li>Keep my hair from breaking off so easily.</li>
            <li>and it has helped tremendously!</li>
            <li>Oh, well, it&#x27;s a great product by itself, just don&#x27;t expect it to suddenly make your hair grow))</li>
            <li>It smells nice &amp; REALLY thickens hair</li>
            <li>Worth a try!</li>
            <li>Again, I have DRY hair and do not have an oily scalp, so this might be great for those with hairloss and an oily scalp.  </li>
            <li>I like the shampoo it does make my hair feel clean,  </li>
            <li>As you use this product you can feel your hair getting clean.</li>
            <li>It works but you have to pair it with a good conditioner (one n only argan oil products, Cantu shea butter moisturizer).</li>
            <li>When shampooing, I used to end up with full hand of hair all over my body, shower walls and floor.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t getting a hand full of it any longer.</li>
            <li>reduce just alittle bit of shedding and not bad for the price.  </li>
            <li>Before purchasing, I read reviews and the were pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>I started to wash my hair with is and was impressed with the lather, but nauseated by the odor.</li>
            <li>listed right there in the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Product has a nice scent but it leaves my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li>After I rinsed it out this time I deep conditioned again,  making sure to use a good moisturizing conditioner because like I said,  this shampoo is a little stripping.</li>
            <li>It was time to shampoo to soften my new growth so that the breackage would stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a clearifying shampoo to clean all the conditioner build up that had to have been on my hair.</li>
            <li>Get rid of your chemical shampoos and give this one a try :) I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li>For the first month or so I used it once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>And I want to inform people how I used this product and the reason that led me to buy it in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried everything (haircare products) not realizing at first that it was the co-washing that was the reason for my hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All was well in my world until the night I was forced to give myself a touch up with a relaxer I had never used before but had heard great things about.</li>
            <li>I have been using shampoo for 3 weeks and have not seen positive results.</li>
            <li>it really just smells like baby powder.</li>
            <li>feel it adds volume to my hair and cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I am using it as instructed but haven&#x27;t seen any real results yet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really really did help with my breakage and shedding.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really thought I would be bald by morning,  </li>
            <li>It was way too much than the normal 100 to 150 hairs a day.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have as much frizzies as I would normally have</li>
            <li>This is a new staple of mines.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and my new growth was softer which was what I needed this product to</li>
            <li>I say \\&quot;forced\\&quot; because the \\&quot;roots and berries\\&quot; of my new growth was beginning to cause me a lot of pain</li>
            <li>I have only been using Queen Helene Garlic Shampoo for a few weeks but the results have been AMAZING from the start.</li>
            <li>My hair is oily and this is the only shampoo so far besides another that will not leave it even more oily or dry.</li>
            <li>I have spent countless dollars on top of the line shampoos and this did wonders for me in just one wash.</li>
            <li>It does not smell bad and has a very pleasant odor to it.</li>
            <li>but a few rinses of water &amp; you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Shampoo is clear and jelled.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone experiencing unusual hair loss but especially to those with oily hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a month with frequent use</li>
            <li>leaves my hair shiny, soft, and not oily.</li>
            <li>A young lady on you tube spoke on co-washing for people whit permed hair and what she stated in her video was close to the issues that I was having.</li>
            <li>And the moister that you get from this product was an unexpected bonus for me.</li>
            <li>Normally I would loose so much hair during this period</li>
            <li>but they apparently can&#x27;t smell that well.</li>
            <li>but nope nowhere near my recent hair lost after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>After the first wash, I noticed less hair falling out.</li>
            <li>Since the very first time I used this shampoo, only a few hairs do fall.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> was a sensitive one as I am extremely tendered-headed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well the co-washing did wonders on my permed hair but it made my new growth hard and extemely dry to the point where my new growth was breaking off my permed hair.</li>
            <li> Blew dried my hair on high heat,  flat ironed it at 410 degrees,  wrapped it,  tied it up and went to bed.</li>
            <li> no shedding of long hairs at all,  little shedding of smaller hairs - but just a few),  tended to my chemical burns,  gave thanks to the One I believe heard my humble cry,  and sat down to right</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair you may want to use it less frequently.</li>
            <li> I can say is that if I would have known about this product I would have bought it and used it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> hope that this long review helps my Amazon Family.</li>
            <li> Still shedding long hairs,  </li>
            <li> Used it a few times and thought it was a decent shampoo,  but a little too stripping for regular use.</li>
            <li> but I usually only wash my hair every other day</li>
            <li> But it will definitely dry your hair tips and can cause your scalp to itch.  </li>
            <li> my hair gets dry, i stop using it.</li>
            <li> only downside is that it leaves my hair dry &amp; hard if I don&#x27;t follow up with a moisturizing deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After losing half my permed hair which broke off to the new growth in some areas of my head again I went to youtube and google for assistance with my hair problem (excessive hair loss).</li>
            <li> it)))&lt;br /&gt;But... alas, it doesn&#x27;t really stop my hair from falling out.</li>
            <li> Now I am not sure if it is helping my male pattern hair loss because it is too soon to tell for this type of hair loss.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> It is recommended to be used every other day</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like garlic but other than that.</li>
            <li> Not worth buying in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My wife however is telling me that it has helped slow down her hair loss second week into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so the water wouldn&#x27;t run down my face and watched TV for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> A lot less shedding, will buy again.</li>
            <li> The hassle of sending it back is minimal, but I am offended by the false advertising.</li>
            <li> I have use it for a month and notice my hair a little fuller.</li>
            <li> However I still experience a little flaking after using it.</li>
            <li> I even noticed that my hair also had a little shine to it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get a few hairs to grow...</li>
            <li> leave this product on for a few mins to get effect.</li>
            <li> After using it, I usually just smell like whatever conditioner I&#x27;ve used (which is usually one of Queen Helene&#x27;s other products).</li>
            <li> My hair is growing back very slowly, probably because my stress level has decreased.</li>
            <li> I mean it feels like a moiserizing shampoo.</li>
            <li> It was so weak.</li>
            <li> But this shampoo definitely decreased the amount of hair I was losing each day.</li>
            <li> but alas, they did not.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t spell it wrong)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of the word GARLIC on this shampoo ..</li>
            <li> And as crazy as that sounds (because no sane person would apply heat to hair falling out as a response to a just applied relaxer)  </li>
            <li> So yes,  as crazy as it sounds,  I woke up this morning took off my scarf,  </li>
            <li> It does burn the eyes really bad</li>
            <li> I have tried everything  :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this product specifically because I required a shampoo with no fragrance. The product is titled &amp;#34;Unscented&amp;#34; and says unscented on the front label. I started to wash my hair with is and was impressed with the lather, but nauseated by the odor. When I took the lid off and smelled it, it had a definite smell, and upon checking the ingredient list, I found &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; listed right there in the ingredients. I had to re-wash my hair with unscented body soap, just to get the fragrance out of my hair. I don&#x27;t know how a product can be unscented and fragranced both at the same time... I sent it back. This product is not unscented, and therefor of no use whatsoever to me. The hassle of sending it back is minimal, but I am offended by the false advertising.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of the word GARLIC on this shampoo .. it really just smells like baby powder. After using it, I usually just smell like whatever conditioner I&#x27;ve used (which is usually one of Queen Helene&#x27;s other products). This shampoo is AWESOME and runs out quickly in local stores. It truly stopped my + my boyfriend&#x27;s hair from thinning, and both of our barbers have noticed growth! Get rid of your chemical shampoos and give this one a try :) I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li> I was noticing some uncontrollable shedding and I didn&#x27;t know what to do. I did some research and learned about the benefits of garlic. I went back and forth between this brand and another brand and ultimately decided on this one. I am extremely happy with my choice. I have been using this for about four months and it has helped tremendously! For the first month or so I used it once or twice a week. Now I use it about once or twice every two weeks. I will continue to buy and use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have course, curly hair with frizz.  This shampoo reduced my hairloss in the shower by 40% just on appearance. But it will definitely dry your hair tips and can cause your scalp to itch.  Again, I have DRY hair and do not have an oily scalp, so this might be great for those with hairloss and an oily scalp.  It works but you have to pair it with a good conditioner (one n only argan oil products, Cantu shea butter moisturizer).</li>
            <li> I have been used this Shampoo before, I believe it does help my hair lost. my hair dresser says i have to use it at lest for 3 months&lt;br /&gt;to get benefit of it..</li>
            <li> Came recommended by a friend who had surgery, as a product to benefit my hair four years ago, and have been buying it ever since!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the fact that it&#x27;s not tested on animals and has NO animal ingredients! Just LOVE it)))&lt;br /&gt;But... alas, it doesn&#x27;t really stop my hair from falling out. Oh, well, it&#x27;s a great product by itself, just don&#x27;t expect it to suddenly make your hair grow))</li>
            <li> Now I am not sure if it is helping my male pattern hair loss because it is too soon to tell for this type of hair loss. My wife however is telling me that it has helped slow down her hair loss second week into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel it adds volume to my hair and cleans very well. It does not smell garlic at all so no worries there. I use it every other day. If you have dry hair you may want to use it less frequently. It works perfectly for me because I have oily hair, associated with male type hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good value.</li>
            <li> I rate this a 4 because i love it but it is kinda stripping. However it has helped me reverse damage so awesome! Worth a try!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hair was falling out in clumps. A friend told me about this shampoo. She said it worked for her when her hair started falling out. Before purchasing, I read reviews and the were pretty accurate. After the first wash, I noticed less hair falling out. It is drying but I usually only wash my hair every other day and I have oily hair so it works for me. I&#x27;ll probably only use it once a week soon because the winter weather dries my scalp. My hair is growing back very slowly, probably because my stress level has decreased. But this shampoo definitely decreased the amount of hair I was losing each day. I used the garlic shampoo by itself for a couple weeks then added a good conditioner when my scalp started to itch. It has a baby powder scent which was very nice. I would recommend this product to anyone experiencing unusual hair loss but especially to those with oily hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. No smell. It does sting the eyes. I have use it for a month and notice my hair a little fuller. The bottle will last a while. Shampoo is clear and jelled. You need to use it as the instruction read.</li>
            <li> Great experience  with everything</li>
            <li> I have been using shampoo for 3 weeks and have not seen positive results. Will keep using it to see what happens.</li>
            <li> It smells nice &amp; REALLY thickens hair and it might have even grew my hair. It strengthened my hair a lot! It does burn the eyes really bad but a few rinses of water &amp; you&#x27;ll be fine. This is a new staple of mines.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it leaves my hair dry &amp; hard if I don&#x27;t follow up with a moisturizing deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I saw this on youtube and I went ordered it. I still don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s the hype about because garlic shampoo does nothing.</li>
            <li> my hair gets dry, i stop using it.</li>
            <li> I do not use this too often but when I do I feel as if it does in fact work. However I still experience a little flaking after using it. It is recommended to be used every other day so maybe if I follow that it will work better. It does not smell bad and has a very pleasant odor to it. You have to try it to see how well it works on you.</li>
            <li> I have only been using Queen Helene Garlic Shampoo for a few weeks but the results have been AMAZING from the start. When shampooing, I used to end up with full hand of hair all over my body, shower walls and floor. It was way too much than the normal 100 to 150 hairs a day.  Since the very first time I used this shampoo, only a few hairs do fall.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo it does make my hair feel clean,  I still have not seen a change on loosing hair...its been about 3 weeks so I will give it more time.  It has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> it did not work! I waited a couple of weeks to see results and ....nothing! I have tried everything  :(</li>
            <li> Use with lots of great conditioner, this product will really work:~)) Enjoy and get some great conditioner! No smell no buildup</li>
            <li> Product has a nice scent but it leaves my hair feeling dry. I am using it as instructed but haven&#x27;t seen any real results yet. I will update.</li>
            <li> My hair is oily and this is the only shampoo so far besides another that will not leave it even more oily or dry. I have been using it for about a month with frequent use and I&#x27;m very happy so far. I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner with it .It leaves my hair shiny, soft, and not oily. It also doesn&#x27;t contain any animal product or testing. So I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Keep my hair from breaking off so easily. I use a lot of oils to keep my hair from drying out, but this helps my hair from getting too brittle.</li>
            <li> and it says unscented but they apparently can&#x27;t smell that well. Not worth buying in my opinion. I was hoping to get a few hairs to grow... but alas, they did not.</li>
            <li> I bought this product yesterday. Everyone that I spoke to on my job had never even heard of this shampoo. However, I had heard great reviews of this product in the youtube world as well as the internet haircare world and I thought why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I do want to inform people that I only used this product one time since I have only had it not even 24hours yet. And I want to inform people how I used this product and the reason that led me to buy it in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I had stopped using shampoo. I had watched a number of hair videos on youtube talking about how great co-washing your hair was so I stopped washing my hair with shampoo and started co-washing my hair twice a week. Well the co-washing did wonders on my permed hair but it made my new growth hard and extemely dry to the point where my new growth was breaking off my permed hair. I tried everything (haircare products) not realizing at first that it was the co-washing that was the reason for my hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you that do not know what a co-wash is it is when you use conditioner to wash you hair instead of a shampoo. Well after trying many different and expensive conditioners and oils (castor oil, coconut oil, shea oil, argan oil, and olive oil) again nothing worked. Hair still coming out like crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing half my permed hair which broke off to the new growth in some areas of my head again I went to youtube and google for assistance with my hair problem (excessive hair loss). A young lady on you tube spoke on co-washing for people whit permed hair and what she stated in her video was close to the issues that I was having. I then realized what was my problem. It was time to shampoo to soften my new growth so that the breackage would stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a clearifying shampoo to clean all the conditioner build up that had to have been on my hair. I then followed that up with a protein treatment to put back in what the clearifying shampoo took out.after that I used the Queen Helen Garlic shampoo and here is where my review of this product comes in:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  The shampoo has a nice scent to it so please do not be afraid of the title of this product. You cannot smell the garlic at all. As you use this product you can feel your hair getting clean. And the moister that you get from this product was an unexpected bonus for me. I mean it feels like a moiserizing shampoo. My hair felt so good. And it did a great job of detangling my hair. Normally I would loose so much hair during this period but nope nowhere near my recent hair lost after using this shampoo. I even noticed that my hair also had a little shine to it. In addition, my hair felt stronger. I didn&#x27;t have as much frizzies as I would normally have and my new growth was softer which was what I needed this product to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  this product does contain sulfate. Once I get my hair breakage under control I will reduce how often I use this product but I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is that if I would have known about this product I would have bought it and used it a long time ago. Remember people that we all have different types of hair. What works for some will not work for all. All that I can say is that I plan on making this product a staple in my haircare world. I have spent countless dollars on top of the line shampoos and this did wonders for me in just one wash. I paid under $7.00 dollars for this product at a Beauty Shop in my Downtown area of Chicago and I cannot express to my Amazon family how pleased that I am with this product. It worked for me and it just might and I did say might work for you but the only way to find out is to try it out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that this long review helps my Amazon Family.</li>
            <li> reduce just alittle bit of shedding and not bad for the price.  think the using odorless garlic and carrier oil is more effective than this shampoo and and alter ego garlic treatment for shedding. leave this product on for a few mins to get effect.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;Great Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like garlic but other than that. Just a regular shampoo</li>
            <li> Smells SO GOOD  you can&#x27;t even smell the garlic at all&lt;br /&gt;Really really did help with my breakage and shedding.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great! A lot less shedding, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> My Hairdresser recommended this shampoo and now I recomment it to you! This is so healthy for your hair and I will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Amazon in January. Used it a few times and thought it was a decent shampoo,  but a little too stripping for regular use. I went out and purchased a different moisturizing shampoo for regular use,  and put this one in the back of the cabinet thinking I would use it once a month as a clarifying shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All was well in my world until the night I was forced to give myself a touch up with a relaxer I had never used before but had heard great things about. I say \\&quot;forced\\&quot; because the \\&quot;roots and berries\\&quot; of my new growth was beginning to cause me a lot of pain and I felt like I was on the verge of getting sores in my head. The rhelaxer (no,  I didn&#x27;t spell it wrong) was a sensitive one as I am extremely tendered-headed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make the story short, as I washed the relaxer out I was also washing my hair out. It was so weak. I used a protein conditioner I had purchased from Amazon &#x27;Salerm Wheat Germ Mask&#x27; and the &#x27;Salerm Leave In&#x27; and those helped a lot but my hair was still coming out in clumps in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I Googled my situation and on the third hit read that using a garlic shampoo would stop the shedding. I really thought I would be bald by morning,  but I had this garlic shampoo so gave it a try. I kid you not,  I lathered this stuff in my hair (great lather btw) let it sit in my hair for five minutes and rinsed. Much,  much,  much more noticeable difference. Still shedding long hairs,  but I wasn&#x27;t getting a hand full of it any longer. So I probably don&#x27;t have to tell you what I did next!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I poured some more of this shampoo on my hands and reapplied,  put a plastic bag on,  tied it with a head scarf so the water wouldn&#x27;t run down my face and watched TV for 30 minutes. After I rinsed it out this time I deep conditioned again,  making sure to use a good moisturizing conditioner because like I said,  this shampoo is a little stripping. I sat under the heat cap for thirty minutes,  rinsed,  applied my leave-in Salerm conditioner,  put a heat protector on and...... Blew dried my hair on high heat,  flat ironed it at 410 degrees,  wrapped it,  tied it up and went to bed. And as crazy as that sounds (because no sane person would apply heat to hair falling out as a response to a just applied relaxer)  So yes,  as crazy as it sounds,  I woke up this morning took off my scarf,  thankful that there was no hair attached to it,  combed my hair out of the wrap (no shedding of long hairs at all,  little shedding of smaller hairs - but just a few),  tended to my chemical burns,  gave thanks to the One I believe heard my humble cry,  and sat down to right this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to buy this garlic shampoo whether it&#x27;s something you plan on using regularly or not. Because you never know when you might just all for a sudden need its benefits in your situation.</li>
