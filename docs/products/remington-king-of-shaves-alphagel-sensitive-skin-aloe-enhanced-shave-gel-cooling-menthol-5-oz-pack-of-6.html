            <li>My face burns if I don&#x27;t have a good gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all about the aloe and menthol for soothing and cooling, while the alpha gel provides exceptional lubrication.</li>
            <li>Love the Alphagel!</li>
            <li>I love this shave gel!</li>

            <li>Liked the results and have been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li>Cool menthol and great lubrication for shaving.  </li>
            <li>Ordered it, got it quick and happy with all.</li>
            <li>Outside of a good blade, this is the best shaving gel (or modality)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderfully for a sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Secondly, thanks for the incredible pricing.</li>
            <li>Smell good and feel so smooth</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shave gel I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Awful!!!That said it i worth killing myself to use this stuff, easily the best, most comfortable and effective shave gel (or cream)</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, comes off easy with a good blade.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>does a much better job of lubricating than anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Will be getting more when the time comes.</li>
            <li>Best shave gel I have ever tried, especially for the cost.  </li>
            <li>My all time favorite shaving gel</li>
            <li>I love this shave gel for shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Started using it in England many years ago as &amp;#34;Kings&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I like to be able to see throught the gel</li>
            <li>I love the shaves I get with this Gel.</li>
            <li>and I love the refreshing feel of this shave gel.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li>For some reason, it took longer for delivery than informed, but I made sure to buy plenty this time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a better shaving gel/lotion/</li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite of all the shaving balms, gels and creams.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found anything better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;m getting up there in years having used many.  </li>
            <li>Nothing better</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this gel, order this product once every 3-4 months.</li>
            <li>I love all of King of shaves products  </li>
            <li>Glad to find here.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It is now my favorite.  </li>
            <li>will purchase more (my 2 sons abuse this stuff)</li>
            <li>When I couldn&#x27;t find that item in stock anywhere, I figured that the menthol gel would be the next best thing,</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to lather your face and start in on a great shave.</li>
            <li>Alpha menthol is relatively strong - smells great and is really cooling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much of it and it helps the razor glide very smoothly across the skin for a good, close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Super amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>It smells good too and lets you completely avoid razor burn, so it&#x27;s very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So I started buying on Amazon, and now thats becoming a problem as well.  </li>
            <li>If you are shaving your entire face, it probably would not make a difference to you, but if you are shaping your beard, this is great because you can more easily see the edges.</li>
            <li>Easy on, easy off..</li>
            <li>Not to mention, I love the cool sensation this product provides...</li>
            <li>feels great and not a single product compares to it.</li>
            <li>and it is by far the best stuff for sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>Fantastic shave gel.  </li>
            <li>Cheap at twice the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then, 2 day shipping for free with PRIME.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, this product is available through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The gel is smooth ...</li>
            <li>Great shave gel and facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Great product for solid price.</li>
            <li>It was so good, I went back and bought all they had (2 more tubes).</li>
            <li>It makes your skin super smooth.</li>
            <li>The lubricating properties are minimal, with a great deal of a diluted feel.</li>
            <li>bought a second 6 pack and am now good to go for some time to come.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>This product has a bit of a menthol smell, but it disappears quickly.</li>
            <li>It is great to travel with...since you don&#x27;t need much you can put some in a smaller squeeze tube.</li>
            <li>By mixing it in the palm of my hand about 50/50 with the original, I find it is about right.  </li>
            <li>I love the menthol and the high amount of aloe.</li>
            <li>Leaves a cool and fresh feel to your skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for having it available.</li>
            <li>Goes on clear which is what I like most.</li>
            <li>I frequently use lather on top.</li>
            <li>rarely give anything a 5 Star rating.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it helps get the best shaves I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>ordered a six pack of the original alphagel (which I have used for a number of years) and thought I would try a six pack of this new product...too much menthol in this product!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff and such a great price here vs. The drugstore or Target.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes hard to find too.</li>
            <li>It simply does not get better than this.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product in San Diego, where I purchased it @</li>
            <li>This is my first time using it.  </li>
            <li>, the cool menthol leaves the PRIVATE AREAS cool and tingly, when used after heating those areas in a hot shower.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think my face hurt after using the blue sensitive formula, but the cooling menthol in this formula is amazing.  </li>
            <li>So first, thanks for availablity.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product in the past, and all bottles were completely full.  !!!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say much more than had been said in these other positive reviews.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much</li>
            <li>I was in the military for many years and to shave every day and once started using king of shaves to bumps and burns</li>
            <li>I really like this product as it lubricates better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Will just stay with the original formula next time.</li>
            <li>Originally discovered it in England on a trip there several years ago and tried it.  </li>
            <li>It shaves so much closer than a normal shave cream.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>You get so much more for your money using the gel versus the foam since it requires so little product to cover your face..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s advertized as low foam, which would be nice, but I add a tiny amount of edge or gillette gel to get enough foam that I can see it.</li>
            <li>I normally paid close to 5 dollars at the store.  </li>
            <li>A U.K. Company that needs a new distributer in the U.S. for 2014.</li>
            <li>I have to shave daily for work, so to have a product that I can use daily with no issues is fantastic.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used better and don&#x27;t anticipate changing!</li>
            <li>It makes the razors last longer and is much more convenient to use than other creams or pressurized gels.</li>
            <li>More times than not, by the time I&#x27;ve finished shaving, I usually end up seeing through blurry eyes</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on clear, so you can see and avoid any skin blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>Goes on clear</li>
            <li>Shaving cream marked as Sensitive skin has been ineffective for me</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t foam much, leaving human inegunity to come to the rescue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It last along time as you do not need to use much.</li>
            <li>I shave in one direction, then the opposite direction, and then a third time with a different razor to get a smooth shave that doesn&#x27;t leave a 5:00 O&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li>I really like using the regular (unscented) Remington Alphagel for shaving.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand why this product is not more widely available at retailers everywhere.</li>
            <li>My skin is never irritated and it makes even an old, dull razor glide smoothly along.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the regular as well and would recommend either if you are looking to try something new.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear, you only need a small amount, and your beard slides right off!</li>
            <li>When US stores apparently stopped carrying it</li>
            <li>I was so much happier with this than any other product I had ever used.</li>
            <li>Low foam, not greasy, not soapy like Gillette products, rinses clean, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue that you have to wash off, takes only a small amount.</li>

            <li> Easy on, easy off..</li>
            <li> Not to mention, I love the cool sensation this product provides...</li>
            <li> feels great and not a single product compares to it.</li>
            <li> and it is by far the best stuff for sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> Fantastic shave gel.  </li>
            <li> Cheap at twice the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then, 2 day shipping for free with PRIME.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, this product is available through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The gel is smooth ...</li>
            <li> Great shave gel and facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Great product for solid price.</li>
            <li> It was so good, I went back and bought all they had (2 more tubes).</li>
            <li> It makes your skin super smooth.</li>
            <li> The lubricating properties are minimal, with a great deal of a diluted feel.</li>
            <li> bought a second 6 pack and am now good to go for some time to come.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This product has a bit of a menthol smell, but it disappears quickly.</li>
            <li> It is great to travel with...since you don&#x27;t need much you can put some in a smaller squeeze tube.</li>
            <li> By mixing it in the palm of my hand about 50/50 with the original, I find it is about right.  </li>
            <li> I love the menthol and the high amount of aloe.</li>
            <li> Leaves a cool and fresh feel to your skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon for having it available.</li>
            <li> Goes on clear which is what I like most.</li>
            <li> I frequently use lather on top.</li>
            <li> rarely give anything a 5 Star rating.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it helps get the best shaves I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> ordered a six pack of the original alphagel (which I have used for a number of years) and thought I would try a six pack of this new product...too much menthol in this product!  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff and such a great price here vs. The drugstore or Target.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes hard to find too.</li>
            <li> It simply does not get better than this.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product in San Diego, where I purchased it @</li>
            <li> This is my first time using it.  </li>
            <li> , the cool menthol leaves the PRIVATE AREAS cool and tingly, when used after heating those areas in a hot shower.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think my face hurt after using the blue sensitive formula, but the cooling menthol in this formula is amazing.  </li>
            <li> So first, thanks for availablity.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product in the past, and all bottles were completely full.  !!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say much more than had been said in these other positive reviews.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much</li>
            <li> I was in the military for many years and to shave every day and once started using king of shaves to bumps and burns</li>
            <li> I really like this product as it lubricates better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Will just stay with the original formula next time.</li>
            <li> Originally discovered it in England on a trip there several years ago and tried it.  </li>
            <li> It shaves so much closer than a normal shave cream.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> You get so much more for your money using the gel versus the foam since it requires so little product to cover your face..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s advertized as low foam, which would be nice, but I add a tiny amount of edge or gillette gel to get enough foam that I can see it.</li>
            <li> I normally paid close to 5 dollars at the store.  </li>
            <li> A U.K. Company that needs a new distributer in the U.S. for 2014.</li>
            <li> I have to shave daily for work, so to have a product that I can use daily with no issues is fantastic.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used better and don&#x27;t anticipate changing!</li>
            <li> It makes the razors last longer and is much more convenient to use than other creams or pressurized gels.</li>
            <li> More times than not, by the time I&#x27;ve finished shaving, I usually end up seeing through blurry eyes</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on clear, so you can see and avoid any skin blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> Goes on clear</li>
            <li> Shaving cream marked as Sensitive skin has been ineffective for me</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t foam much, leaving human inegunity to come to the rescue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It last along time as you do not need to use much.</li>
            <li> I shave in one direction, then the opposite direction, and then a third time with a different razor to get a smooth shave that doesn&#x27;t leave a 5:00 O&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> I really like using the regular (unscented) Remington Alphagel for shaving.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why this product is not more widely available at retailers everywhere.</li>
            <li> My skin is never irritated and it makes even an old, dull razor glide smoothly along.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the regular as well and would recommend either if you are looking to try something new.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear, you only need a small amount, and your beard slides right off!</li>
            <li> When US stores apparently stopped carrying it</li>
            <li> I was so much happier with this than any other product I had ever used.</li>
            <li> Low foam, not greasy, not soapy like Gillette products, rinses clean, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue that you have to wash off, takes only a small amount.</li>
            <li> Despite the slow mail, it&#x27;s still worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> My husband used to get razor burn or nicks even with other brand sensitive shaving creams.</li>
            <li> and I would see empty shelves again each visit until finally it was removed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of KoS for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry the face out.</li>
            <li> I mix this with a tiny bit of edge or other conventional gel as it seems to be no foam rather than low foam.</li>
            <li> I would try if you are not satisfied with present shave cream or are just starting to shave.</li>
            <li> All the bottles were not filled, only 3oz of a 5oz bottle each.  </li>
            <li> Little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> No more coming back just staying put.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find sometimes in stores especially the menthol</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in any store so when I saw how inexpensive it was in packs I bought several packs of this Gel.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in traditional stores.</li>
            <li> As we say down south, &amp;#34;You can&#x27;t beat that with a stick&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s not a lot of crud going down the drain.</li>
            <li> My husband cant use any other brand besides this one!</li>
            <li> I paid half at Amazon</li>
            <li> I prefer shave gel to the canned stuff - takes up less space</li>
            <li> Here I am paying less than 2 dollars per tube and having it delivered to the house.  </li>
            <li> It just takes a small dab on a wet face and the blade just glides across.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If forced to come up with a negative aspect, I&#x27;d say that when mixed with the shaved stubble, it can be hard to rinse out from between the blades of the razor, but nothing that a bit of extra effort can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> This should be illegal, it clearly states 5oz on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about the fancy 5 blade and beyond.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores on the west coast however.  </li>
            <li> I would hate to have to go back to the other gels.</li>
            <li> Too watery and thin.</li>
            <li> Give it a try of shaving cream has failed.</li>
            <li> Although it does do the job on my skin that I&#x27;ve come to expect from the brand, I unfortunately found the menthol smell to be way too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I use a gilette sensor (the two bladed ones, very difficult to find) but this works well with the three bladed version too.</li>
            <li> Too bad Remington dropped it.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and will keep looking.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Switched to this product after trying both Shaving Cream with a brusha and Gilette Gels. The menthol is soothing and the gel makes my blade glide like butter. Only downside is that it doesnt foam up which helps in knowing what spots I have gone through.</li>
            <li> Feels different on skin.Too watery and thin. Not the same product as I used to purchase at local department store a year ago. Can&#x27;t put my finger on it but tube markings and colors on packaging seems different from what I can recall.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shave gel.  It simply does not get better than this.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, comes off easy with a good blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for quite a while. When US stores apparently stopped carrying it I was in severe withdrawals. Thanks to Amazon for having it available. My skin is never irritated and it makes even an old, dull razor glide smoothly along.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Good price for a 5 pack. Can&#x27;t find it in any store around here.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t shave with anything else.</li>
            <li> Shaving cream marked as Sensitive skin has been ineffective for me and I have used the King of Shaves collection and it has been very effective in minimizing/eliminating irritation.  Give it a try of shaving cream has failed.</li>
            <li> I mix this with a tiny bit of edge or other conventional gel as it seems to be no foam rather than low foam. does a much better job of lubricating than anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I use this on my legs twice a week, and it works perfectly! No white foam to obscure things, and with a bit of care you don&#x27;t need to worry about slicing things open. Cheap at twice the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, most shaving creams are white opaque,  which makes shaving with them difficult. These don&#x27;t foam much, leaving human inegunity to come to the rescue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the picture? I trust you&#x27;ll give some of the others a test drive as well...</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best shave gel/cream I&#x27;ve used in 20+ years.  A little goes a long way and it helps get the best shaves I have ever had.  I hope this stuff is around longer then me.  :)  I would hate to have to go back to the other gels.</li>
            <li> I Always try different stuff, but not anymore...this is the best gel around.  No more coming back just staying put.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Love the Alphagel! Low foam, not greasy, not soapy like Gillette products, rinses clean, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue that you have to wash off, takes only a small amount. Blade glides like baby oil on Teflon. Super amazing stuff. Doesn&#x27;t dry the face out. Feels fresh and clean. I have to shave daily for work, so to have a product that I can use daily with no issues is fantastic. Excellent price for a 6 pack. Will be getting more when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Best shave gel I have ever tried, especially for the cost.  It&#x27;s all about the aloe and menthol for soothing and cooling, while the alpha gel provides exceptional lubrication.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find sometimes in stores especially the menthol so I bought a 6 pack.  It last along time as you do not need to use much. Great product.  I would never go back to foam and I haven&#x27;t found any gel that compares.</li>
            <li> ordered a six pack of the original alphagel (which I have used for a number of years) and thought I would try a six pack of this new product...too much menthol in this product!  By mixing it in the palm of my hand about 50/50 with the original, I find it is about right.  Will just stay with the original formula next time.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaving cream!  He says it&#x27;s the best shaving cream he&#x27;s ever used.  He shaves in the shower and says it works perfectly and makes his face feel great.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite shaving gel</li>
            <li> My husband used to get razor burn or nicks even with other brand sensitive shaving creams. He even bought some to give away to family members.  That says a lot for my stickler of a husband.</li>
            <li> I love this shave gel for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on clear, so you can see and avoid any skin blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the cool menthol leaves the PRIVATE AREAS cool and tingly, when used after heating those areas in a hot shower.</li>
            <li> This product extends your razor blade&#x27;s life and gives you a great close shave without any pulling or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s mentholated and cools your skin as you shave.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product in San Diego, where I purchased it @ a discount store. It was so good, I went back and bought all they had (2 more tubes). I freaked out after it was all gone since it was imported from England and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I finally got it on Amazon, and ordered 6 tubes. This is the best shaving product I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried lots of them! It goes on clear, you only need a small amount, and your beard slides right off! You can even get a mentholated one and save $ on not needing after shave. IMHO it&#x27;s the best product for blade shaving ever......</li>
            <li> Started using it in England many years ago as &amp;#34;Kings&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s wonderfully for a sensitive skin so when Remington purchased the product, I stayed with it.  There is truly nothing like it  manufactured by anybody.</li>
            <li> I always order King of Shaves. Best gel ever. Goes on clear which is what I like most.I like to be able to see throught the gel so I can see where I&#x27;m shaving. Little bit goes a long way. Walt</li>
            <li> I love the shaves I get with this Gel. Shaving is one of my daily pleasures and I love the refreshing feel of this shave gel. This is hard to find in any store so when I saw how inexpensive it was in packs I bought several packs of this Gel. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! My husband cant use any other brand besides this one!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It shaves so much closer than a normal shave cream.  It is hard to find in traditional stores. So first, thanks for availablity. Secondly, thanks for the incredible pricing. I paid half at Amazon what  I pay when I can find it in stores. Then, 2 day shipping for free with PRIME. As we say down south, &amp;#34;You can&#x27;t beat that with a stick&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I have been using it for 8 years now!</li>
            <li> Anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried this product should try it. It makes the razors last longer and is much more convenient to use than other creams or pressurized gels. And it smells great.</li>
            <li> I started using this product before my husband. I was looking for a gel or lotion to replace a women&#x27;s product that was discontinued. I was so much happier with this than any other product I had ever used. This product has a bit of a menthol smell, but it disappears quickly. You don&#x27;t have to use much so there&#x27;s not a lot of crud going down the drain. It makes your skin super smooth.It is great to travel with...since you don&#x27;t need much you can put some in a smaller squeeze tube.</li>
            <li> I really like this product as it lubricates better than any other product I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s advertized as low foam, which would be nice, but I add a tiny amount of edge or gillette gel to get enough foam that I can see it.</li>
            <li> All the bottles were not filled, only 3oz of a 5oz bottle each.  This should be illegal, it clearly states 5oz on the bottle.  I have ordered this product in the past, and all bottles were completely full.  !!! What a RIP OFF....</li>
            <li> You haven&#x27;t shaved until you tried this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I have been using king of shaves for 15 years and it is by far the best stuff for sensitive skin and their is no burning or burn marks left the razor.  I was in the military for many years and to shave every day and once started using king of shaves to bumps and burns went away. I would try if you are not satisfied with present shave cream or are just starting to shave.</li>
            <li> Found Remington through a groupon offer, loved the product, so I was close to being out and found it here on Amazon. Ordered it, got it quick and happy with all. Try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> Despite the slow mail, it&#x27;s still worth the wait.  For some reason, it took longer for delivery than informed, but I made sure to buy plenty this time.</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome for legs</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks. Can&#x27;t really say much more than had been said in these other positive reviews. I&#x27;ve never used a better shaving gel/lotion/foam.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a second 6 pack and am now good to go for some time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If forced to come up with a negative aspect, I&#x27;d say that when mixed with the shaved stubble, it can be hard to rinse out from between the blades of the razor, but nothing that a bit of extra effort can&#x27;t fix. This problem went away for me when I switched to safety razor.</li>
            <li> I love this shave gel!</li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite of all the shaving balms, gels and creams. You don&#x27;t need very much of it and it helps the razor glide very smoothly across the skin for a good, close, comfortable shave. It smells good too and lets you completely avoid razor burn, so it&#x27;s very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Smell good and feel so smooth</li>
            <li> I do prefer this to shaving cream or gel that lathers. If you are shaving your entire face, it probably would not make a difference to you, but if you are shaping your beard, this is great because you can more easily see the edges. It also has a nice cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> Best shave product out there.</li>
            <li> Great to use for shower shaving.  Allows you to see your face rather than a layer of shaving foam or gel.  The scent also helps to wake me up.</li>
            <li> This is the best shave gel/cream I&#x27;ve ever used. Been buying it for 3 years now.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb! Haven&#x27;t found anything better.  Too bad Remington dropped it.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, this product is available through Amazon.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and retailers just bailed on putting it on the shelves.  Outside of a good blade, this is the best shaving gel (or modality) I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;m getting up there in years having used many.  Not to mention, I love the cool sensation this product provides... Plus I shave my head as well.  Great product and smooth results.</li>
            <li> I read an news article once calling out consumer products that contained bad-for-you ingredients. Kin f Shaves topped their list! Awful!!!That said it i worth killing myself to use this stuff, easily the best, most comfortable and effective shave gel (or cream) I have found in my 26 years of shaving.</li>
            <li> Used this product for years to shave my head.  Nothing better and I have tried several. Easy on, easy off..</li>
            <li> I prefer shave gel to the canned stuff - takes up less space and I can get it all out of the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Alpha menthol is relatively strong - smells great and is really cooling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The gel is smooth ... a little goes a long way. Leaves a cool and fresh feel to your skin. I&#x27;ve used the regular as well and would recommend either if you are looking to try something new.</li>
            <li> Love this gel, order this product once every 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> Best shaving gel on the market!  Originally discovered it in England on a trip there several years ago and tried it.  Liked the results and have been using it ever since.  Hard to find in stores on the west coast however.  So Amazon is my source.</li>
            <li> The local stores stopped carrying this product and I have been using it for years.  You get so much more for your money using the gel versus the foam since it requires so little product to cover your face.. Plus the shave is smoother.  I normally paid close to 5 dollars at the store.  Here I am paying less than 2 dollars per tube and having it delivered to the house.  How do you beat that?</li>
            <li> I tried this and it is a very good product. I like the combination of aloe and menthol. I shave prox. three times at one session. I shave in one direction, then the opposite direction, and then a third time with a different razor to get a smooth shave that doesn&#x27;t leave a 5:00 O&#x27;clock shadow. My face burns if I don&#x27;t have a good gel. I frequently use lather on top. In any event this product works well.&lt;br /&gt;I rarely give anything a 5 Star rating.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what has to be done to get this product in stores and shevles again, but whatever that is figure it out because its awesome. This was constantly sold out at Target every visit, and when I did find it I bought all of them and I would see empty shelves again each visit until finally it was removed. So I started buying on Amazon, and now thats becoming a problem as well.  I just don&#x27;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is easily the best shave gel on the market, it works great feels great and not a single product compares to it. Try it and you won&#x27;t try anything else. But then starts the struggle of trying to buy it...</li>
            <li> I love all of King of shaves products  Happy that they returned to the US  I missed them</li>
            <li> Gives me a close, comfortable shave with my face feeling great afterwards. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used better and don&#x27;t anticipate changing!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why this product is not more widely available at retailers everywhere. My skin LOVES this product and I recommend it for everyone who shaves. If the menthol is not to your liking, the regular formula works just as well. I have been using this product for several years, and when I found out that my local retailer was discontinuing it for some reason, I bought the remaining stock. I am pleased that Amazon is now offering it for sale, and at a great price, too!</li>
            <li> This gel is awesome!  I have used this for several years, having some problems with supply, stores dropping it etc.  If you can find a supplier for it grab it! It just takes a small dab on a wet face and the blade just glides across.  The menthol version is a nice wake up on a sleepy Monday morning!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Headslick replacement and will keep looking. The lubricating properties are minimal, with a great deal of a diluted feel. I was very disappointed and will keep looking.</li>
            <li> The best shave gel.  Cool menthol and great lubrication for shaving.  Goes on clear so you can see where you are shaving. Can&#x27;t find in stores.  Glad to find here.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shave gel so I order a dozen at a time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of KoS for a long time.  This is my first time using it.  I love it.  It is now my favorite.  I didn&#x27;t think my face hurt after using the blue sensitive formula, but the cooling menthol in this formula is amazing.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and such a great price here vs. The drugstore or Target.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes hard to find too. Gives a great shave. Gave a tube to all the men in the family at Christmas.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shave gel I have ever used. I use a gilette sensor (the two bladed ones, very difficult to find) but this works well with the three bladed version too. Not sure about the fancy 5 blade and beyond.</li>
            <li> I use this gel along with KOS shaving oil. I love the menthol and the high amount of aloe. got a great deal on 6 pack. will purchase more (my 2 sons abuse this stuff)</li>
            <li> I really like using the regular (unscented) Remington Alphagel for shaving. When I couldn&#x27;t find that item in stock anywhere, I figured that the menthol gel would be the next best thing, right? Although it does do the job on my skin that I&#x27;ve come to expect from the brand, I unfortunately found the menthol smell to be way too overpowering. More times than not, by the time I&#x27;ve finished shaving, I usually end up seeing through blurry eyes like I&#x27;ve been in the kitchen chopping up a bushel of onions, and so I had to drop off one star on an otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> Best Shaving Cream on the market.  Period.</li>
            <li> Great shave gel and facial cleanser. Similar to Gillette Face Wash and shave gel which was also discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;Stock up now, folks.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to lather your face and start in on a great shave. Been using this for years. A U.K. Company that needs a new distributer in the U.S. for 2014. Great product for solid price. Stock up while you can.</li>
