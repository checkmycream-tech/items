            <li>I still think the viatim e as pictured is way better then the mocarrain oil I received.</li>
            <li>I use to love this product</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>Love this hair serum.</li>
            <li>love this stuff it makes my hair soft, shiny, manageable and smell good too!</li>

            <li>I highly recommend everyone to try it, this does not leave any greasy residue on your hair and this smells so good</li>
            <li>The price was amazing compared to other sites, so I am extremely happy my purchase.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stand getting my hair done, within an hour of getting it done, it looked as if I was in the hot tub for an hour, it looked as if the style would have been nice if.....    </li>
            <li>Makes your hair smooth &amp; shinny</li>
            <li>and I smooth it through my damp hair.  </li>
            <li>This stuf is fantastic , works well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Im very dissappointed!!!</li>
            <li>works great with the flat Iron too!</li>
            <li>This one does not detangle my daughter&#x27;s hair like the original one.  </li>
            <li>But it smells the same (Mmmmm) like a good vitimin ointment.</li>
            <li>The original formula Is much better than new Argan oil formula.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product but have only been able to find it in my hometown shopping mall.</li>
            <li>,  makes my hair smell good, look shiny and healthy, takes out the frizzies making it look sleek and soft, which enables me to go a week or more without washing my hair now, which has made it less split ended and healthier than ever before...  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not oily nor does it weigh their hair down, it just leaves it beautiful, healthy and natural looking.</li>
            <li>After the first shipment was lost by my postman (no fault of the seller&#x27;s!), they immediately sent me another order.</li>
            <li>Not only is the product amazing</li>
            <li>I was amazed to find this product at such an amazing price.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny though.</li>
            <li>I put my hair in a soft poly tail to sleep in, on top of my head to keep from laying on it as I sleep and to give it body.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many products over the years and spent a lot of money on stuff that was just okay.  </li>
            <li>Well, after finally trying it, I was amazed at how nice it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>and I got  a different kind.  </li>
            <li>Overall the shipping was fast, it smells good, and works very well.</li>
            <li>I would though think that it would be good for black hair as well</li>
            <li>the deal very soft silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Very highly recommend this!,</li>
            <li>I received exactly what the picture showed.</li>
            <li>For white hair - two pumps and rub hands together and distribute through the hair without wiping the hair from top to bottom.  </li>
            <li>I tried many different serum in drug stores, but none of them was like HerStyler&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair serum, not only does it smell nice, but it also really helps my hair stay</li>
            <li>Love it, especially in this hot and humid air.</li>
            <li>and i apply before my hot iron.</li>
            <li>my wife has enjoyed using this product  for several years now and has highly recommend it to any of her friends</li>
            <li>I use to use the straight iron every time I did my hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>saved me so much money.</li>
            <li>It is the real</li>
            <li>My mom loves this product as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Not too greasy, helps tame frizzies and smells really nice.</li>
            <li>Bring the original product back, please!  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair silky soft treating dry damaged hair:)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live with out this product!  </li>
            <li>silky abs shine very light and not heavy on your like the other customer states.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Love it been using it for a couple of years now have really curly and very long hair and its the only product that works for me!!</li>
            <li>wow!!</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s just not a thick paste type texture oil.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very silky soft , shiny and manageable and does not feel like there is any product on it.</li>
            <li>so I had to purchase a few more.</li>
            <li>I love this product, especially after my hair is dry</li>
            <li>I have a lot of new hair</li>
            <li>Hair serum was the vitamin E formulation (not the new argon oil mix).</li>
            <li>It seals the ends and makes the hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Well, upon walking in the mall I sprayed their sample in my hair, light feeling, automatically took out the frizz, gave it an instant shine, Mind you the hair was flat ironed and still looked frizzy, I applied this to the tips of my hair and</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and a small amount really does go a long way with this.</li>
            <li>this stuff gives it shine, makes it soft and looks healthier.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair shiny and soft and it keeps it&#x27;s shape for days.</li>
            <li>I foolishly paid large amounts of money on the Herstyler flat iron at the mall, which I regret, but that purchase lead me to this hair serum.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will definitely buy again</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take much so one bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and then I blow dry, and sometimes use a straight iron, but not that often anymore.  </li>
            <li>I have really long hair and all it takes is a little Dab and my hair is super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Because of this, it was always frizzy and dull looking even when it was clean, unless I put lots of product in it</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and is therefore inherently dry because of the follicle shape.  </li>

            <li> Well, upon walking in the mall I sprayed their sample in my hair, light feeling, automatically took out the frizz, gave it an instant shine, Mind you the hair was flat ironed and still looked frizzy, I applied this to the tips of my hair and</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and a small amount really does go a long way with this.</li>
            <li> this stuff gives it shine, makes it soft and looks healthier.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair shiny and soft and it keeps it&#x27;s shape for days.</li>
            <li> I foolishly paid large amounts of money on the Herstyler flat iron at the mall, which I regret, but that purchase lead me to this hair serum.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take much so one bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and then I blow dry, and sometimes use a straight iron, but not that often anymore.  </li>
            <li> I have really long hair and all it takes is a little Dab and my hair is super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Because of this, it was always frizzy and dull looking even when it was clean, unless I put lots of product in it</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and is therefore inherently dry because of the follicle shape.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product along with the HerStyler flat iron since last August.  </li>
            <li> The smell is somewhat the same but the quality is pretty poor compared to their old products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thin, baby-fine hair and most hair products like this weigh it down and make it look greasy, but not this stuff.</li>
            <li> I recommend this serum even if you don&#x27;t use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> , they use it before flat ironing their hair</li>
            <li> I also purchase the flat iron from the mall for like 200 here</li>
            <li> This was the recommended hair products to use with the flat irons.  </li>
            <li> It is a must to have when using the flat irons or curlers.</li>
            <li> and then I&#x27;d have to wash it every day which made it dry...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just so dry</li>
            <li> and I know that my black sisters have different hair than mine</li>
            <li> everyone that tries it also sticks to it.</li>
            <li> Somewhere, I think walking through our mall, I was given a little sample package of HerStyler Hair Serum and who knows how long it was in my purse.  </li>
            <li> The small bottle lasts forever, smells like heaven and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue which is often very obvious after flat-ironing my hair.  </li>
            <li> This oil doesn&#x27;t attract dirt like other oils or weigh my hair down at all.  </li>
            <li> Helps eliminate the dryness when you straighten with an iron and helps keep the friz down .  </li>
            <li> My hair just seems to drink it in, it doesn&#x27;t gum up or build up on my hair, just wicks it down the hair shaft.  </li>
            <li> It DOES NOT weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li> I have medium-thick hair, goes down mid-back</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair at all</li>
            <li> It seemed that the product its self is a little thinner than the one I purchased in the store (could be my imagination, I was out of the other</li>
            <li> then I went out for a half hour did vigor activity</li>
            <li> I was expecting Vitamin E with the black packaging.</li>
            <li> 1 bottle will last at least 6 months to a year!</li>
            <li> HerStyler Hair Serum is the consistancy of like motor oil - just a little thicker than cooking oil.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops on my finger tips and run my fingers through the ends of my hair caught in the pony tail before I go to sleep, brush my hair out in the mornings and add a curl around my face if I need to.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for a few years and don&#x27;t want to be without it.  </li>
            <li> My hair frizzy, thin, frizzy, dry, frizzy, and did I mention Frizzy.</li>
            <li> I need very little, just two pumps in my hand</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff and the shampoo and conditioner because I bought the (expensive) flat irons.  </li>
            <li> I kept the product because it was confusing how to return and get want I had ordered.</li>
            <li> Plus it takes a very small amount!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t let the secret stay bottled up!</li>
            <li> The company did tell me the picture was wrong and they discontinued what is in the pic and told me I can return it.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this product.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the change, and have moved on to other products.</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t get as dirty with this stuff in it.</li>

            <li> I received exactly what the picture showed. I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase!!! Definitely deserves a 5-star rating!</li>
            <li> Just good stuff. Helps eliminate the dryness when you straighten with an iron and helps keep the friz down .  I use it to make my hair more manageable when I don&#x27;t straighten</li>
            <li> This is amazing in a bottle. My hair frizzy, thin, frizzy, dry, frizzy, and did I mention Frizzy. I couldn&#x27;t stand getting my hair done, within an hour of getting it done, it looked as if I was in the hot tub for an hour, it looked as if the style would have been nice if.....    Well, upon walking in the mall I sprayed their sample in my hair, light feeling, automatically took out the frizz, gave it an instant shine, Mind you the hair was flat ironed and still looked frizzy, I applied this to the tips of my hair and wow!! then I went out for a half hour did vigor activity and you know what, my hair was still perfect! The shine is beautiful, doesn&#x27;t seem like it sits on your hair like some do. It also seems to just draw into the hair and make it silky, BETTER THAN BIOSILK, BETTER THAN CHI, BETTER WAY BETTER THAN JOHN FRIEDA, this is awesome. It is worth every penny though. If frizz is your problem and you have tried everything else, try this, buy this. Use before or after your heat service ( I do it after, and works every time).    Please leave a review for this product don&#x27;t let the secret stay bottled up!</li>
            <li> I foolishly paid large amounts of money on the Herstyler flat iron at the mall, which I regret, but that purchase lead me to this hair serum. I have thin, baby-fine hair and most hair products like this weigh it down and make it look greasy, but not this stuff. My hair is so healthy and shiny looking now, plus it smells great. I recommend this serum even if you don&#x27;t use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Have been using for about 1 1/2 years now and it is perfect for my hair (going gray and gives me my shine back)!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair smooth &amp; shinny</li>
            <li> Awful! Doesn&#x27;t do a thing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> i did not recieve the item pictured, the one i recieved has argan oil in itand it makes your hair to oily.</li>
            <li> my daughters started using this brand of hair serum about 9 months ago and they love it, they use it before flat ironing their hair and it doesn&#x27;t take much so one bottle goes a long way. it&#x27;s not oily nor does it weigh their hair down, it just leaves it beautiful, healthy and natural looking.</li>
            <li> I was expecting Vitamin E with the black packaging. What I received was the Argan oil vitamin e. I kept the product because it was confusing how to return and get want I had ordered.</li>
            <li> This oil doesn&#x27;t attract dirt like other oils or weigh my hair down at all.  I put my hair in a soft poly tail to sleep in, on top of my head to keep from laying on it as I sleep and to give it body.  I put a few drops on my finger tips and run my fingers through the ends of my hair caught in the pony tail before I go to sleep, brush my hair out in the mornings and add a curl around my face if I need to.  My hair just seems to drink it in, it doesn&#x27;t gum up or build up on my hair, just wicks it down the hair shaft.  My hair is naturally curly and is therefore inherently dry because of the follicle shape.  Because of this, it was always frizzy and dull looking even when it was clean, unless I put lots of product in it and then I&#x27;d have to wash it every day which made it dry...a never ending cycle...  This Argan with Vitamin E,  makes my hair smell good, look shiny and healthy, takes out the frizzies making it look sleek and soft, which enables me to go a week or more without washing my hair now, which has made it less split ended and healthier than ever before...  a much better cycle!  I receive compliments on my hair at age 54, which I have never received before.  Wish I would have had it 30 years ago!  So grateful for this product!</li>
            <li> I love the price, everyone complements my hair.  I can&#x27;t live with out this product!  I can manage my hair anyway I want.</li>
            <li> great -- it smells awesome! :)</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells amazing and a small amount really does go a long way with this. 1 bottle will last at least 6 months to a year!</li>
            <li> I have frizzy and I color it to boot.  This is the only serum I have found that helps my hair.  Plus it takes a very small amount!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products over the years and spent a lot of money on stuff that was just okay.  Somewhere, I think walking through our mall, I was given a little sample package of HerStyler Hair Serum and who knows how long it was in my purse.  Well, after finally trying it, I was amazed at how nice it made my hair feel. So I looked for it on Amazon and was so pleased to find it and at a good price too. I need very little, just two pumps in my hand and I smooth it through my damp hair.  My hair combs through easily and then I blow dry, and sometimes use a straight iron, but not that often anymore.  I use to use the straight iron every time I did my hair.  That&#x27;s just no longer necessary.  I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is shiny and looks as it did when I was younger.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Thank You</li>
            <li> My Daughters and I are hooked on this stuff. I have bought it about 4 times this year already, my girls keep stealing it from me!</li>
            <li> This stuf is fantastic , works well and it smells great.  I have really long hair and all it takes is a little Dab and my hair is super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> my wife has enjoyed using this product  for several years now and has highly recommend it to any of her friends</li>
            <li> Legit and its my holy grail. saved me so much money. IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT. highly recommend it. Smells like aloe which some people may not like but thats the price for organic products.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it arrived to me before the estimated time, thank you:)</li>
            <li> This is Great vitamin for your hair I have a lot of new hair and it&#x27;s amazing I highly recommend everyone to try it, this does not leave any greasy residue on your hair and this smells so good</li>
            <li> I wanted what was shown in the picture and I got  a different kind.  The company did tell me the picture was wrong and they discontinued what is in the pic and told me I can return it. But I kept it because I did not want to take the time and energy to return it  I still think the viatim e as pictured is way better then the mocarrain oil I received.</li>
            <li> I use to love this product also ☆☆☆☆☆&lt;br /&gt;Not anymore definitely it&#x27;s not the same&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients for the good serum was: CYCLOMETHICONE, DIMETHICOND, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, ALOE VERA EXTRACT!&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m very disappointed in the &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34; HerStyler products that contain Argan Oil . I had to give it a star or my review wouldn&#x27;t be posted.  Actually ignore the star though</li>
            <li> Ordered a pack of four of HerStyler Hair Serum, completely satisfied! The delivery was prompt and the product matched what I received, it was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff and it was a very good price..came on time as promised...</li>
            <li> Love everything I ordered!  Got here on time and no problems with the product!</li>
            <li> I love how this product makes my hair feel, and it smells great too.  Now I have my sister and nieces all using it.  Thats why I bought the 4 pack.  Great deal</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product but have only been able to find it in my hometown shopping mall. The small bottle lasts forever, smells like heaven and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue which is often very obvious after flat-ironing my hair.  After moving 1000 mi away I was so thrilled to find this on Amazon. Not only is the product amazing but the company I purchased from is phenomenal. After the first shipment was lost by my postman (no fault of the seller&#x27;s!), they immediately sent me another order. I am so thrilled with the product and the wonderful customer service.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes your hair silky and smell great.  The price was amazing compared to other sites, so I am extremely happy my purchase.</li>
            <li> this is the absolute best hair serum ever. I love it. everyone that tries it also sticks to it. must try</li>
            <li> I can not believe that I was trick at the mall like everyone else I read from the reviews.  I actually paid almost $50 per bottle.  I&#x27;m glad I browse at amazon.  It is the real the deal very soft silky smooth.  My hair is very fine.  Luv it that I can use it on my daughter hair.  I luv how it smell like your just stepping out of salon.  It leaves your hair silky abs shine very light and not heavy on your like the other customer states. I also purchase the flat iron from the mall for like 200 here I saw it only cost 25.  That was is such a ripped off.  I can&#x27;t believe they made a lot of profit  of me.  Won&#x27;t happen again!!!</li>
            <li> I used to love this hair serum the most and i&#x27;ve been using this for couple years already. However, just recently when i purchased 6 bottles of this serum and started using it and come to realized this product is not as quality as before anymore--they change the ingredient--it&#x27;s no longer using Vitamin E or aloe vera as it adverstised--they substituted it with something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The smell is somewhat the same but the quality is pretty poor compared to their old products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im very dissappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Love this hair serum &amp; leaves a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this product.  It is NOT greasy in your hair.  It DOES NOT weigh your hair down.  It DOES keep your hair from frizzing.  It DOES smell nice.  It has a scent of like salon hair - like you just left the salon.  I am white though and I know that my black sisters have different hair than mine so I cannot speak to that.  I would though think that it would be good for black hair as well - it&#x27;s just not a thick paste type texture oil.  HerStyler Hair Serum is the consistancy of like motor oil - just a little thicker than cooking oil.  For white hair - two pumps and rub hands together and distribute through the hair without wiping the hair from top to bottom.  Overall the shipping was fast, it smells good, and works very well.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this product as much as I do. She kept taking mine so I had to purchase a few more.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair serum ever.  I tried many different serum in drug stores, but none of them was like HerStyler&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair serum, not only does it smell nice, but it also really helps my hair stay fizz free and healthy.</li>
            <li> Bring the original product back, please!  This one does not detangle my daughter&#x27;s hair like the original one.  I am very disappointed in the change, and have moved on to other products.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff and the shampoo and conditioner because I bought the (expensive) flat irons.  This was the recommended hair products to use with the flat irons.  This serum does give your hair the silky feeling and look.  It is a must to have when using the flat irons or curlers.</li>
            <li> love this stuff it makes my hair soft, shiny, manageable and smell good too! works great with the flat Iron too! buy it here those carts are a rip off</li>
            <li> Good hair serum and smells great too!</li>
            <li> Hair serum was the vitamin E formulation (not the new argon oil mix). I love how it feels in my hair. Not too greasy, helps tame frizzies and smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Love it, especially in this hot and humid air.</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this from a boutique at the mall, ordered some online because it&#x27;s a lot cheaper. This is the best stuff i&#x27;ve ever put in my hair. I have medium-thick hair, goes down mid-back and it&#x27;s just so dry all the time and this stuff gives it shine, makes it soft and looks healthier. Also it smells great, and I find myself able to keep from washing my hair another day. Just doesn&#x27;t get as dirty with this stuff in it. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair at all, really amazing I love it</li>
            <li> Prices was unbitable , pack of 4 save you a money . Product smell  vonderfull, i recomended  everyone  it is some product what in retial store</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this product. It feels amazing and smells great!</li>
            <li> This product is ok. The original formula Is much better than new Argan oil formula.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to trim my hair that often...Best product I&#x27;ve used! Leaves your hair silky soft treating dry damaged hair:)</li>
            <li> I bought this product at 1/4 of the price for all four that I would pay for one at the mall. It seemed that the product its self is a little thinner than the one I purchased in the store (could be my imagination, I was out of the other so I couldn&#x27;t actually compare them). But it smells the same (Mmmmm) like a good vitimin ointment. And it seems to work just as well. My hair is very silky soft , shiny and manageable and does not feel like there is any product on it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, especially after my hair is dry and i apply before my hot iron. It seals the ends and makes the hair very soft. I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product along with the HerStyler flat iron since last August.  I love them both.  I have gotten so many compliments on how good and shiny my hair looks.  People have even asked if I had a keratin treatment.  I also really love how the serum keeps my hair from getting frizzy when it is damp out. Very highly recommend this!,</li>
            <li> I was amazed to find this product at such an amazing price.  I have used it for a few years and don&#x27;t want to be without it.  This is a wonderful deal!</li>
            <li> Love it been using it for a couple of years now have really curly and very long hair and its the only product that works for me!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, price is great- considering at the mall they were trying to charge like $50.00</li>
            <li> Love this hair serum. Works great...even my hairdresser noticed a big difference in my hair. Highly recommend and will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> This item is great! It leaves your hair shiny and soft and it keeps it&#x27;s shape for days. I highly recommend it.</li>
