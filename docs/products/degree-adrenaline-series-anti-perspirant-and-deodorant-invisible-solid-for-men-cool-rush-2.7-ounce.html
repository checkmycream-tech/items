            <li>Also the scent is great as well.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I keep it in my gym bag that has a bit of moisture in it, but the Adrenaline just goes on very, very nice each time.  </li>
            <li>And although I don&#x27;t smell at all, ever, if I did, this deodorant would make me even more perfect.</li>
            <li>Also love that this is an Anti-Perspirant AND Deodarant which is the best one to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>; works well and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>you are looking to change your scent and like antiperspirant, this is a good one to try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, we both loved that there was no streaking on any of his darker shirts.</li>
            <li>The first thing that impressed me about this deodorant was the scent.</li>
            <li>And instead of having a nice pleasant scent they smell like cheap man perfume and are overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Degree smells good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells a bit like a nice, manly</li>
            <li>I got it without any idea of whether I would like it or not; but, after opening it I knew I liked the scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also liked its fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~A_E~</li>
            <li>Opaque containers do a good job of making you think you&#x27;re getting more than you are (though the volume information, 2.7 oz.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This feels great on my skin, works even when I get sweaty and has a nice mild scent.</li>
            <li>It is a good sturdy container with an easy to use turn mechanism.</li>
            <li>This is great  for those very hot days when you do not want stains through your shirt.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastically effective antiperspirant, with which I am absolutely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of this one better.  </li>
            <li>I will gladly continue buying this brand for him.</li>
            <li>scent is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>, I like those better because they never streak on my clothing.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It’s got a nice clean scent without being perfume-like or overbearing when someone steps into the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I honestly did not notice anything special about the \\&quot;motion activated\\&quot; protection, it worked well for me, without any irritation.</li>
            <li>It has a totally, light refreshing smell that I love and is strong, but not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This solid does a very good job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most important aspect, of course, is protection against odor and wetness.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it is still strong and does clash with one&#x27;s fragrance (if one wears a fragrance).</li>
            <li>It is a strong anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong -</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels fine on my skin and  does not cause a skin reaction.</li>
            <li>It is masculine and generally pleasant, though opinions on fragrance vary.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommended for those that want a streak/stain free deodorant but don&#x27;t mind the strong scent.</li>
            <li>The odor in this one is very nice, with notes of old school cologne like Old Spice and a more trendy &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; scent.  </li>
            <li>The container is wider to fit a man’s hand.</li>
            <li>He likes that the caps stays on securely in his gym bag.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good, because the clear gel causes my husband to itch.  </li>
            <li>doesn’t rub off on clothes too much, doesn’t irritate skin, controls perspiration as you would expect of good quality anti-perspirant, and overall is a good choice of deodorants.</li>
            <li>so it goes on quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>Not overpowering, not cheap, just a nice pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>He remains sweat and odor free for a full work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This antiperspirant/deodorant by Degree has a strong, but clean and fresh, scent that my son and I both like.</li>
            <li>This has a very masculine strong smell that I love.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Cool Rush\\&quot; scent is liked by me and the 67 year old in the family.</li>

            <li>Cool Comfort]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>Degree Men AntiPerspirant Deodorant, Adrenaline Series, Cool Rush]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It does a good job at controlling daily sweat and odor.</li>
            <li>However when it arrived and I opened the box, the first thing I noticed was the strong perfume.  </li>
            <li>The nice thing about this it glides on smooth not gritty or greasy.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself goes on pretty smoothly for an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>At first my husband thought that the strong scent would not bother him, but it did become quite noticeable when our on a hot humid day.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a super sweaty man who wants some reassuring protection, you can likely rely on this (though body chemistries do vary), but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s more reliable than a somewhat cheaper deodorant as I&#x27;ve had good results with more economical products like Suave and Sure.</li>
            <li>They say that “This powerful antiperspirant deodorant responds to increases in adrenaline when you sweat.</li>
            <li>much prefer the Degree Cool Rush over the Degree Overtime because it does smell cool, as if someone just stepped out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>Old Spice is a favorite in this house, but *hint</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what I&#x27;d call a fresh marine scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good bit of product in the container, which is wide</li>
            <li>Degree has done it with this powerful ant-perspirant that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using a couple of different scents in this Adrenline Series and this one is his favorite because he feels the the clean fresh scent isn&#x27;t as overpowering as the others he has tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and clean, and really could be unisex.  </li>
            <li>With its active Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex GLY (19.2%), it may not be organic but it works nearly as well as my prescription anti-perspirant without all the irritation and with a pleasant clean smell.</li>
            <li>Anyway, compared to the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; I recently used before this, and the &amp;#34;stripe&amp;#34; version I also use, this is far superior.  </li>
            <li>The less good is that it&#x27;s supposed to be invisible, but it leaves a bit of a residue.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think so, but he&#x27;s from the generation that seems to like pretty intense &amp;#34;male&amp;#34; scents, and this is mild and nice---not flowery.  </li>
            <li>The Cool Rush version is a white stick, which applies with no residue, and an impressively fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li>He says that this antiperspirant keeps him feeling fresh and dry which is very important because he works outdoors in the hot desert climate.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this brand of deodorant, and he&#x27;s pretty picky.  </li>
            <li>;)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is the first thing I check to see if I like.</li>
            <li>If it is a hot day</li>
            <li>It also worked quite well for the first day in stopping wetness and odor.</li>
            <li>where it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li>Most men&#x27;s products have a distinctive and sometimes overbearing scent which is meant to be the male version of perfume.</li>
            <li>Also, I think that the volume could be higher for the price and the size of the container.</li>
            <li>is a clue, most people aren&#x27;t checking it and are only looking at package size).</li>
            <li>This is the first product he has tried which has reduced sweat stains on his uniform.</li>
            <li>My husband’s general feeling about deodorant is that they either work fine or they don’t.</li>
            <li>This does the job very well, even for a pretty sweaty man.</li>
            <li>It is strong enough to compete with any cologne one would wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It kept me dry for more than 24 hours, so it is certainly effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fragrance is crisp, blue, and very fresh.  </li>
            <li>I typically use Old Spice deodorant, but I&#x27;ve heard good things about Degree</li>
            <li>The deodorant works and has a fresh smell, but there again if I go out right after I put it on; the smell seems a bit too strong, especially since my friend had to open their car window.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s always picky about the fragrance, and really likes this one.  </li>
            <li>This one works really well, though.  </li>
            <li>That’s why you are going to be much drier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The antiperspirant works very well.  </li>
            <li>It works as well to me as the clinical ones, but I&#x27;m never sweat all that much anyway, but when I do, I need the deodorant about as much as anything - and this one has both.  </li>
            <li>Somehow it&#x27;s a bit much to have my deodorant engineered to respond to my body, but I guess I&#x27;ll have to go with modern science and accept this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue under his arms and it goes on acceptably smoothly.</li>
            <li>This has a much cleaner, fresher scent.</li>
            <li>This deodorant smells fine -- it’s not too strong (as long you use reasonable amounts), and definitely masks offensive</li>
            <li>It easily covers me through a long business</li>
            <li>My schedule didn&#x27;t allow me to&lt;br /&gt;go any further than three days; but I&#x27;m pretty sure it could go further than that.</li>
            <li>being said, the \\&quot;Adrenaline\\&quot; series ALSO has a \\&quot;Cool Rush\\&quot;, however the packaging is sky blue with a picture of a sky diver on it.</li>
            <li>You could still smell the Cool Rush scent, but it was mixed with BO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>His only comment that was less than positive was that &amp;#34;It didn&#x27;t have much of a scent, and what it did was kind of feminine&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps not quite as much as Old Spice scent-wise (and not quite as much as Degree&#x27;s &amp;#34;Overtime&amp;#34; scent), but the odor and antiperspirant protection are really, really long-lasting.</li>
            <li>I think it probably has a bit of eucalyptus in it, maybe a bit of rosemary, with a tiny bit of floral and spice mixed in, though I can&#x27;t be sure.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s masculine but a woman might enjoy it occasionally.  </li>
            <li>He highly recommends this series.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Dry Protection Body Heat Activated\\&quot; series provides 24 hour protection and is Degree&#x27;s original antiperspirant deodorant</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised how much I&#x27;m liking this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>really like the scent which is a clear, almost menthol-like fragrance.</li>
            <li>The scent is stronger than what he normally uses but no one in my house found it overpowering like some reviewers</li>
            <li>If you look at the picture packaging it&#x27;s not the \\&quot;Adreneline\\&quot; series, it&#x27;s the \\&quot;Dry Protection Body Heat Activated\\&quot; series in the \\&quot;Cool Rush\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>I asked for this product for my husband to try out since he has been looking for a new deodorant.  </li>
            <li>live in Texas</li>
            <li>Not having an obnoxious scent is the first test for any personal care product to pass for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>His experience is that they don’t really work any differently.&lt;br /&gt;The Degree fragrances are generally more subtle than the Axe products.</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry in the eighty-plus degree heat we&#x27;re encountering so far, and I suspect it will live up to its expectations in higher temps as well.</li>
            <li>This claims to last for 48 hours but haven&#x27;t really had to test this since I use deodorant everyday,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This does not, though his skin is rather sensitive to a lot of antiperspirants.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is potent stuff, or at least was in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband works in a prison which has minimal air exchange and is often hot.</li>
            <li>The smell has a base that is a bit herbal/medicinal when I really concentrate on the scent, with higher notes that are fresh and light.  </li>
            <li>On my son, it didn&#x27;t live up to that claim by the second day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not a bad product, but my son&#x27;s current brand works just as well at almost half the price.</li>
            <li>I even stay away from certain color shirts that would show my wet spots to the world.</li>
            <li>The antiperspirant is standard Aluminum Zirconium, so keep that in mind if you are sensitive.  </li>
            <li>This is a big deal for me as I tend to be particularly sensitive to roll on deodorants.</li>
            <li>Technology even responds directly to your body movement, releasing extra protection when you move, to last longer.”  </li>
            <li>The only drawback for some, which is a positive for others is that it is not a gel and is powder based so could cake up and get messy if over applied.</li>

            <li> It does a good job at controlling daily sweat and odor.</li>
            <li> However when it arrived and I opened the box, the first thing I noticed was the strong perfume.  </li>
            <li> The nice thing about this it glides on smooth not gritty or greasy.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself goes on pretty smoothly for an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> At first my husband thought that the strong scent would not bother him, but it did become quite noticeable when our on a hot humid day.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a super sweaty man who wants some reassuring protection, you can likely rely on this (though body chemistries do vary), but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s more reliable than a somewhat cheaper deodorant as I&#x27;ve had good results with more economical products like Suave and Sure.</li>
            <li> They say that “This powerful antiperspirant deodorant responds to increases in adrenaline when you sweat.</li>
            <li> much prefer the Degree Cool Rush over the Degree Overtime because it does smell cool, as if someone just stepped out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> Old Spice is a favorite in this house, but *hint</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I&#x27;d call a fresh marine scent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good bit of product in the container, which is wide</li>
            <li> Degree has done it with this powerful ant-perspirant that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using a couple of different scents in this Adrenline Series and this one is his favorite because he feels the the clean fresh scent isn&#x27;t as overpowering as the others he has tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh and clean, and really could be unisex.  </li>
            <li> With its active Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex GLY (19.2%), it may not be organic but it works nearly as well as my prescription anti-perspirant without all the irritation and with a pleasant clean smell.</li>
            <li> Anyway, compared to the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; I recently used before this, and the &amp;#34;stripe&amp;#34; version I also use, this is far superior.  </li>
            <li> The less good is that it&#x27;s supposed to be invisible, but it leaves a bit of a residue.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think so, but he&#x27;s from the generation that seems to like pretty intense &amp;#34;male&amp;#34; scents, and this is mild and nice---not flowery.  </li>
            <li> The Cool Rush version is a white stick, which applies with no residue, and an impressively fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li> He says that this antiperspirant keeps him feeling fresh and dry which is very important because he works outdoors in the hot desert climate.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this brand of deodorant, and he&#x27;s pretty picky.  </li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is the first thing I check to see if I like.</li>
            <li> If it is a hot day</li>
            <li> It also worked quite well for the first day in stopping wetness and odor.</li>
            <li> where it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li> Most men&#x27;s products have a distinctive and sometimes overbearing scent which is meant to be the male version of perfume.</li>
            <li> Also, I think that the volume could be higher for the price and the size of the container.</li>
            <li> is a clue, most people aren&#x27;t checking it and are only looking at package size).</li>
            <li> This is the first product he has tried which has reduced sweat stains on his uniform.</li>
            <li> My husband’s general feeling about deodorant is that they either work fine or they don’t.</li>
            <li> This does the job very well, even for a pretty sweaty man.</li>
            <li> It is strong enough to compete with any cologne one would wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It kept me dry for more than 24 hours, so it is certainly effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fragrance is crisp, blue, and very fresh.  </li>
            <li> I typically use Old Spice deodorant, but I&#x27;ve heard good things about Degree</li>
            <li> The deodorant works and has a fresh smell, but there again if I go out right after I put it on; the smell seems a bit too strong, especially since my friend had to open their car window.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s always picky about the fragrance, and really likes this one.  </li>
            <li> This one works really well, though.  </li>
            <li> That’s why you are going to be much drier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The antiperspirant works very well.  </li>
            <li> It works as well to me as the clinical ones, but I&#x27;m never sweat all that much anyway, but when I do, I need the deodorant about as much as anything - and this one has both.  </li>
            <li> Somehow it&#x27;s a bit much to have my deodorant engineered to respond to my body, but I guess I&#x27;ll have to go with modern science and accept this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue under his arms and it goes on acceptably smoothly.</li>
            <li> This has a much cleaner, fresher scent.</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells fine -- it’s not too strong (as long you use reasonable amounts), and definitely masks offensive</li>
            <li> It easily covers me through a long business</li>
            <li> My schedule didn&#x27;t allow me to&lt;br /&gt;go any further than three days; but I&#x27;m pretty sure it could go further than that.</li>
            <li> being said, the \\&quot;Adrenaline\\&quot; series ALSO has a \\&quot;Cool Rush\\&quot;, however the packaging is sky blue with a picture of a sky diver on it.</li>
            <li> You could still smell the Cool Rush scent, but it was mixed with BO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> His only comment that was less than positive was that &amp;#34;It didn&#x27;t have much of a scent, and what it did was kind of feminine&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps not quite as much as Old Spice scent-wise (and not quite as much as Degree&#x27;s &amp;#34;Overtime&amp;#34; scent), but the odor and antiperspirant protection are really, really long-lasting.</li>
            <li> I think it probably has a bit of eucalyptus in it, maybe a bit of rosemary, with a tiny bit of floral and spice mixed in, though I can&#x27;t be sure.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s masculine but a woman might enjoy it occasionally.  </li>
            <li> He highly recommends this series.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Dry Protection Body Heat Activated\\&quot; series provides 24 hour protection and is Degree&#x27;s original antiperspirant deodorant</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how much I&#x27;m liking this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> really like the scent which is a clear, almost menthol-like fragrance.</li>
            <li> The scent is stronger than what he normally uses but no one in my house found it overpowering like some reviewers</li>
            <li> If you look at the picture packaging it&#x27;s not the \\&quot;Adreneline\\&quot; series, it&#x27;s the \\&quot;Dry Protection Body Heat Activated\\&quot; series in the \\&quot;Cool Rush\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> I asked for this product for my husband to try out since he has been looking for a new deodorant.  </li>
            <li> live in Texas</li>
            <li> Not having an obnoxious scent is the first test for any personal care product to pass for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> His experience is that they don’t really work any differently.&lt;br /&gt;The Degree fragrances are generally more subtle than the Axe products.</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry in the eighty-plus degree heat we&#x27;re encountering so far, and I suspect it will live up to its expectations in higher temps as well.</li>
            <li> This claims to last for 48 hours but haven&#x27;t really had to test this since I use deodorant everyday,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This does not, though his skin is rather sensitive to a lot of antiperspirants.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is potent stuff, or at least was in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband works in a prison which has minimal air exchange and is often hot.</li>
            <li> The smell has a base that is a bit herbal/medicinal when I really concentrate on the scent, with higher notes that are fresh and light.  </li>
            <li> On my son, it didn&#x27;t live up to that claim by the second day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not a bad product, but my son&#x27;s current brand works just as well at almost half the price.</li>
            <li> I even stay away from certain color shirts that would show my wet spots to the world.</li>
            <li> The antiperspirant is standard Aluminum Zirconium, so keep that in mind if you are sensitive.  </li>
            <li> This is a big deal for me as I tend to be particularly sensitive to roll on deodorants.</li>
            <li> Technology even responds directly to your body movement, releasing extra protection when you move, to last longer.”  </li>
            <li> The only drawback for some, which is a positive for others is that it is not a gel and is powder based so could cake up and get messy if over applied.</li>
            <li> I found that used right after a shower I got at least three days protection.&lt;br /&gt;Under arm odor comes from bacteria; and three days after use there&#x27;s no sign of odor.</li>
            <li> It is not a clear gel solid.  </li>
            <li> He Cool Rush fragrance reminds me of the typical “man smell” that is common in deodorants.</li>
            <li> That is about how long it worked for me.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get the gloopy mess and waste with the gel, and you don&#x27;t get the intense friction you get with the stripe deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really sweat all over, but I have been know to change my shirts a few times a day which can be a little embarrassing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The men’s Degree Adrenaline series is a bit different critter than the average deodorant.  They say that “This powerful antiperspirant deodorant responds to increases in adrenaline when you sweat. Degree with MOTIONSENSE™ Technology even responds directly to your body movement, releasing extra protection when you move, to last longer.”  It has a totally, light refreshing smell that I love and is strong, but not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer the Degree Cool Rush over the Degree Overtime because it does smell cool, as if someone just stepped out of the shower.  Old Spice is a favorite in this house, but *hint* I like the smell of this one better.  It’s got a nice clean scent without being perfume-like or overbearing when someone steps into the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  Includes kinetic technology to respond to your body movements&lt;br /&gt;►  Stay ahead of sweat and odor&lt;br /&gt;►  For those in adrenaline-fueled moments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DEGREE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0061JPJ3M Degree Men, Adrenaline Series, Invisible Stick Deodorant, Everest]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001ECQ4US Degree Men Cool Rush Deodorant &amp; Antiperspirant]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001ECQ4M6 Degree Men Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, Cool Comfort]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001ET769Y Degree Men Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant, Extreme Blast]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001ECQ4QM Degree For Men Dry Protection Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, Invisible Stick, Sport]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000MANVWW Degree Men’s Body Responsive Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant, Invisible Stick]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002VUAM46 Degree Men Invisible AntiPerspirant &amp; Deodorant, Adventure]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0061JPJ5U Degree Men AntiPerspirant Deodorant, Adrenaline Series, Cool Rush]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0040PFBCI Degree Men, Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant Aerosol, Sport]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002VUAM4G Degree Men AntiPerspirant &amp; Deodorant, Sport Defense]]</li>
            <li> My husband’s general feeling about deodorant is that they either work fine or they don’t. He usually uses Axe, which is made by the same parent company as Degree. His experience is that they don’t really work any differently.&lt;br /&gt;The Degree fragrances are generally more subtle than the Axe products. He Cool Rush fragrance reminds me of the typical “man smell” that is common in deodorants.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;Degree Male Adrenaline Series Anti-Perspirant&amp;#34; works well and has a pleasant smell. It does a good job at controlling daily sweat and odor. This claims to last for 48 hours but haven&#x27;t really had to test this since I use deodorant everyday,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> It is that sweaty time of year again, which means it is time to odorize our armpits before they odorize us.  The odor in this one is very nice, with notes of old school cologne like Old Spice and a more trendy &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; scent.  It is masculine and generally pleasant, though opinions on fragrance vary.  The antiperspirant is standard Aluminum Zirconium, so keep that in mind if you are sensitive.  It kept me dry for more than 24 hours, so it is certainly effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to change your scent and like antiperspirant, this is a good one to try.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this brand of deodorant, and he&#x27;s pretty picky.  He&#x27;s always picky about the fragrance, and really likes this one.  (And I like it, too!)  Also, it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on his clothes, which I&#x27;m always keen to notice when I do laundry.  Some other brands have in the past, so that&#x27;s excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, even when he works out, I can STILL tell it&#x27;s working.  (With some other brands, he gets pretty rank after a workout).  This one works really well, though.  I will gladly continue buying this brand for him.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little less aggressive than some of the other Degree products. Nonetheless, it is still strong and does clash with one&#x27;s fragrance (if one wears a fragrance). Moreover, the product guards well against odor and perspiration. Nonetheless, I kinda loathe white deodorants ... they leave streaks on clothing, making me put my Spray N Wash into overtime. So, if you wear a lot of black t-shirts, this may not be the product for you. Otherwise, this is an excellent deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is targeted at men who are active playing sports or doing manual work. It has an after shave scent to it. It is a strong anti-perspirant. The active ingredient in Degree is 19.2%, Secret is 18-19%, standard Degree 17.8%, and Dove 15.2%. That’s why you are going to be much drier. The container is wider to fit a man’s hand. It is a solid which is what men prefer except for those who like an aerosol spray.</li>
            <li> I typically use Old Spice deodorant, but I&#x27;ve heard good things about Degree and I like to have an antiperspirant in my anti-stinky arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it. Perhaps not quite as much as Old Spice scent-wise (and not quite as much as Degree&#x27;s &amp;#34;Overtime&amp;#34; scent), but the odor and antiperspirant protection are really, really long-lasting. It easily covers me through a long business day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself goes on pretty smoothly for an antiperspirant. It has the typical chalky feel of an antiperspirant, but it&#x27;s not overly dry or clumpy.</li>
            <li> This is a WHITE solid.  It is not a clear gel solid.  That&#x27;s good, because the clear gel causes my husband to itch.  This does not, though his skin is rather sensitive to a lot of antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is crisp, blue, and very fresh.  I think it probably has a bit of eucalyptus in it, maybe a bit of rosemary, with a tiny bit of floral and spice mixed in, though I can&#x27;t be sure.  The smell has a base that is a bit herbal/medicinal when I really concentrate on the scent, with higher notes that are fresh and light.  It&#x27;s what I&#x27;d call a fresh marine scent.  It&#x27;s not too strong - it&#x27;s masculine but a woman might enjoy it occasionally.  It&#x27;s invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The antiperspirant works very well.  It has kept all 3 of my family members - teen boy working out, grown man that works hard outside in the heat, and myself (female) quite dry and smelling nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good bit of product in the container, which is wide so it goes on quickly and easily.  it says 48h on it.  That is about how long it worked for me.  It&#x27;s a good antiperspirant.  It works as well to me as the clinical ones, but I&#x27;m never sweat all that much anyway, but when I do, I need the deodorant about as much as anything - and this one has both.  It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> My husband is using this deodorant, and he likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He hasn&#x27;t tested out the 48 hour claim, but I haven&#x27;t noticed him smelling sweaty at any point. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is overwhelming. It&#x27;s smells a bit like a nice, manly soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, no complaints.</li>
            <li> I am a self-described sweaty person. I don&#x27;t really sweat all over, but I have been know to change my shirts a few times a day which can be a little embarrassing. I even stay away from certain color shirts that would show my wet spots to the world. Degree has done it with this powerful ant-perspirant that lasts all day. With its active Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex GLY (19.2%), it may not be organic but it works nearly as well as my prescription anti-perspirant without all the irritation and with a pleasant clean smell.</li>
            <li> I asked for this product for my husband to try out since he has been looking for a new deodorant.  However when it arrived and I opened the box, the first thing I noticed was the strong perfume.  At first my husband thought that the strong scent would not bother him, but it did become quite noticeable when our on a hot humid day.  He rides 2 hours 3x a week and on the bike because of the breeze, it is not so noticeable.  However, if out to dinner and down-wind from him, you can definitely smell it.  It is strong enough to compete with any cologne one would wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we both loved that there was no streaking on any of his darker shirts. It does perform well in moisture management but we hate how strong the perfume is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for those that want a streak/stain free deodorant but don&#x27;t mind the strong scent.</li>
            <li> Somehow it&#x27;s a bit much to have my deodorant engineered to respond to my body, but I guess I&#x27;ll have to go with modern science and accept this. The deodorant works and has a fresh smell, but there again if I go out right after I put it on; the smell seems a bit too strong, especially since my friend had to open their car window.&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit it kept me dry so the engineering must work. I just wish they could ratchet down their odor a bit.</li>
            <li> I use this in the morning and it does the job the entire day. This is supposed to work for 48 hours.  I have not tested the 48 hour protection and instead use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels fine on my skin and  does not cause a skin reaction. It keeps me dry and smelling nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried both the Degree overtime scent and this one. This scent is even milder then the overtime scent and I like it a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has  worked  well when I have gone out walking and when I have worked in my yard.  I don&#x27;t feel the need to put it on again even after I have gotten sweaty. I do put it on again after I shower.  It seems work for people who are active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feels great on my skin, works even when I get sweaty and has a nice mild scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman, but I tend to prefer the scents of mens products.  Lots of the products made for women just smell too &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; or heavy for me.  I love this scent.  It&#x27;s fresh and clean, and really could be unisex.  It works great!  I spend alot of time working outdoors and running errands, not to mention that day to day stress sweat.  It keeps me dry with no sweaty smell coming through.  I would have given it five stars if this formula was a gel, I like those better because they never streak on my clothing.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s an excellent product, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how much I&#x27;m liking this deodorant.  I seem to have a collection of deodorant that goes back some time - the wifey would pick it up whenever it was on sale and it accumulated.  How&#x27;s that for a subtle dig?  Did I mention she&#x27;s my ex?  Anyway, compared to the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; I recently used before this, and the &amp;#34;stripe&amp;#34; version I also use, this is far superior.  You don&#x27;t get the gloopy mess and waste with the gel, and you don&#x27;t get the intense friction you get with the stripe deodorant.  That variety is like rubbing a brick on our armpit compared to this one.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I keep it in my gym bag that has a bit of moisture in it, but the Adrenaline just goes on very, very nice each time.  And although I don&#x27;t smell at all, ever, if I did, this deodorant would make me even more perfect.</li>
            <li> If you look at the picture packaging it&#x27;s not the \\&quot;Adreneline\\&quot; series, it&#x27;s the \\&quot;Dry Protection Body Heat Activated\\&quot; series in the \\&quot;Cool Rush\\&quot; scent. The \\&quot;Dry Protection Body Heat Activated\\&quot; series provides 24 hour protection and is Degree&#x27;s original antiperspirant deodorant formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the \\&quot;Adrenaline\\&quot; series ALSO has a \\&quot;Cool Rush\\&quot;, however the packaging is sky blue with a picture of a sky diver on it. The \\&quot;Adrenaline\\&quot; series is marketed to respond to increases in adrenaline when you sweat using Degree&#x27;s \\&quot;MOTIONSENSE(tm) Technology\\&quot; to respond to your body movement, releasing extra protection when you move. And also is marketed to last 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Cool Rush\\&quot; scent is liked by me and the 67 year old in the family. win win. The only drawback for some, which is a positive for others is that it is not a gel and is powder based so could cake up and get messy if over applied.</li>
            <li> This solid does a very good job. This is great  for those very hot days when you do not want stains through your shirt. This lasts all day when you put it on. The nice thing about this it glides on smooth not gritty or greasy. Invisible is great no stains in clothing. Also the scent is great as well. If you need something for all day then this is for you. Great product.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the performance of Degree Adrenaline. The Cool Rush version is a white stick, which applies with no residue, and an impressively fresh, clean scent. It keeps me dry in the eighty-plus degree heat we&#x27;re encountering so far, and I suspect it will live up to its expectations in higher temps as well. This is a fantastically effective antiperspirant, with which I am absolutely satisfied.</li>
            <li> My guys sweat, and stink, and leave stains on the armpit circles of their clothes. It&#x27;s a fact of life. Another fact of life is some antiperspirants can&#x27;t handle the man-sweat of living in the swamp. And instead of having a nice pleasant scent they smell like cheap man perfume and are overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Degree smells good. Not overpowering, not cheap, just a nice pleasant scent. And it keeps the guys dry! No armpit staining, even after a run on the treadmill, mowing the law, or an hour of weeding and mulching.</li>
            <li> I got this deodorant for my son, and he&#x27;s happy with it!  It has the solid white type makeup he prefers to the &amp;#34;wet feeling&amp;#34; gel-like makeup some deodorants have, and he likes it that it&#x27;s also an antiperspirant, which all men&#x27;s deodorants aren&#x27;t, I&#x27;ve learned the hard way.  His only comment that was less than positive was that &amp;#34;It didn&#x27;t have much of a scent, and what it did was kind of feminine&amp;#34;.  I didn&#x27;t think so, but he&#x27;s from the generation that seems to like pretty intense &amp;#34;male&amp;#34; scents, and this is mild and nice---not flowery.  So keep that in mind while buying.  It&#x27;s good stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I got it without any idea of whether I would like it or not; but, after opening it I knew I liked the scent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve pushed this product to see how go it works. I found that used right after a shower I got at least three days protection.&lt;br /&gt;Under arm odor comes from bacteria; and three days after use there&#x27;s no sign of odor. My schedule didn&#x27;t allow me to&lt;br /&gt;go any further than three days; but I&#x27;m pretty sure it could go further than that. I&#x27;m not recommending that; but I think it&lt;br /&gt;shows a well made product that won&#x27;t let you down.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Degree products for years and have not ever had a bad experience with any of their products. This is no exception. The smell is the first thing I check to see if I like. If it is a hot day and I am sweating I don&#x27;t want to smell a scent I don&#x27;t like. This has a very masculine strong smell that I love. Also love that this is an Anti-Perspirant AND Deodarant which is the best one to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue buying in the future!</li>
            <li> This antiperspirant/deodorant by Degree has a strong, but clean and fresh, scent that my son and I both like. The scent is stronger than what he normally uses but no one in my house found it overpowering like some reviewers have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue under his arms and it goes on acceptably smoothly. It also worked quite well for the first day in stopping wetness and odor. However, by the second day, my son started to smell. You could still smell the Cool Rush scent, but it was mixed with BO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We live in Texas where it&#x27;s hot so antiperspirant/deodorants get a work out here. However, Degree claims this works for 48 hours and charges a premium price for that. On my son, it didn&#x27;t live up to that claim by the second day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the scent enough to pay extra for it and you plan on using it daily, it&#x27;s not a bad product, but my son&#x27;s current brand works just as well at almost half the price. 3 star.</li>
            <li> While I honestly did not notice anything special about the \\&quot;motion activated\\&quot; protection, it worked well for me, without any irritation. This is a big deal for me as I tend to be particularly sensitive to roll on deodorants. I also liked its fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~A_E~</li>
            <li> The first thing that impressed me about this deodorant was the scent. Most men&#x27;s products have a distinctive and sometimes overbearing scent which is meant to be the male version of perfume. This has a much cleaner, fresher scent. It&#x27;s still a bit sharp, but has a cooler feel to it. Not having an obnoxious scent is the first test for any personal care product to pass for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important aspect, of course, is protection against odor and wetness. This does the job very well, even for a pretty sweaty man. It does indeed seem to keep one odor-free and dry for 48 hours, though I&#x27;m not sure who needs to wear deodorant for that long without showering (especially if you&#x27;ve worked up a sweat). It is potent stuff, or at least was in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;. The less good is that it&#x27;s supposed to be invisible, but it leaves a bit of a residue. Also, I think that the volume could be higher for the price and the size of the container. Opaque containers do a good job of making you think you&#x27;re getting more than you are (though the volume information, 2.7 oz. is a clue, most people aren&#x27;t checking it and are only looking at package size). If this were $4-5 (current price is $7), I&#x27;d give it 5 stars. If you&#x27;re a super sweaty man who wants some reassuring protection, you can likely rely on this (though body chemistries do vary), but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s more reliable than a somewhat cheaper deodorant as I&#x27;ve had good results with more economical products like Suave and Sure.</li>
            <li> My husband works in a prison which has minimal air exchange and is often hot. This is the first product he has tried which has reduced sweat stains on his uniform. It goes on easily, no caking or white streaks on his clothes and goes the distance. He remains sweat and odor free for a full work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the scent which is a clear, almost menthol-like fragrance. I don&#x27;t find it intrusive. It is a good sturdy container with an easy to use turn mechanism. He likes that the caps stays on securely in his gym bag. All and all a very good product and one that is a pleasure to recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using a couple of different scents in this Adrenline Series and this one is his favorite because he feels the the clean fresh scent isn&#x27;t as overpowering as the others he has tried. He says that this antiperspirant keeps him feeling fresh and dry which is very important because he works outdoors in the hot desert climate. He highly recommends this series.</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells fine -- it’s not too strong (as long you use reasonable amounts), and definitely masks offensive odors--  doesn’t rub off on clothes too much, doesn’t irritate skin, controls perspiration as you would expect of good quality anti-perspirant, and overall is a good choice of deodorants.</li>
