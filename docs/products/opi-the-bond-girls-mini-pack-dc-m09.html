    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>They&#x27;re awesome.</li>
            <li>These are perfect size sample nail polish bottles if you want to try the O.P.I. line.</li>
            <li>However, these colors are great!</li>
            <li>Pussy Galore is probably the best liquid sand.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this set.</li>
            <li>Very happy for this</li>
            <li>It is perfect in every way, color, texture, application.</li>
            <li>so I thought this would be a perfect introduction to them, and a great oppurtunity to test them out.</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful.</li>
            <li>Happy</li>
            <li>These samples are great.  </li>
            <li>so I figured this would be a great introduction.</li>
            <li>The colors are all great.</li>
            <li>If you want to try liquid sand (or any of Opi&#x27;s lines, these mini-bottle sets are a great way without breaking the bank).  </li>
            <li>Great to wear for the spring.</li>
            <li>Not as great when I got my nails done in the salon.</li>
            <li>But when I Used the mini pack version it didn&#x27;t have as great of a texture.</li>
            <li>I am in love!!</li>
            <li>The Pussy Galore color is amazing in candlelight - so noticed even my hubby!</li>
            <li>Amazing collection!</li>
            <li>The colors are not as bright and shiny as the Maria Carey&#x27;s with one exemption:</li>
            <li>This is a great way to try the new(ish) liquid sand finish from Opi if you haven&#x27;t yet or aren&#x27;t sure about the finish.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased on the color selection.</li>
            <li>OPI are great and sand effect is very cool</li>
            <li>I love the texture of this polish and the colors!</li>
            <li>This color looked amazing with two coats applied and nothing else.</li>
            <li>Already ordered a full size of jinx because its so beautiful.</li>
            <li>My wife really liked these.</li>
            <li>Good sized bottles and a very cost-effecient way to give the brand a try or as a great gift idea.</li>
            <li>and it is the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good set to get for sampling before you purchase a full bottle.</li>
            <li>These go on easy and look amazing when applied.....</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;pussy galore&amp;#34; color looked great, from the large bottle.</li>
            <li>I love the color pallet of this collection.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite colors of all-time!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this set because I love James Bond</li>
            <li>and I love nail polish.</li>
            <li>However they were inferior in many aspects in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Jinx, which is an interesting coral matte and shinny polish.</li>
            <li>Bottles are mini but the colors are cute.</li>
            <li>and i am always touching them since they have the sand</li>
            <li>purple color was my favorite one.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite color in the set.</li>
            <li>It was more textured than Vesper....but not as textured as Jinx or Solitaire.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>Super cute colors!</li>
            <li>This was a nice little gift with a great theme!</li>
            <li>This is one cool set!</li>
            <li>but these are pretty with or without top coat!</li>
            <li>The size is just the right size to get different colors and figure out which one you might like the best before purchasing the full size bottle.</li>
            <li>They shimmer and shine in the light  </li>
            <li>; isn&#x27;t my favorite but a a whole I love the collection.</li>
            <li>that being said: the polish called Jinx is amazing and fantastic, especially under top coat.  </li>
            <li>They are supposed to be textured-I thought they would be similar to the OPI gold glitter texture polish from their Great and Powerful Oz collection.  </li>
            <li>Some of the colors look OK or at least interesting on their own, and some do really well under a top coat (though it EATS UP top coat, be warned, you will need a lot) to make them prettier.  </li>
            <li>I intend to buy a full bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They come out matte which is cool</li>
            <li>I may or may not purchase in full size....</li>
            <li>I will buy this in the full size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soooo pretty!</li>
            <li>But if you just want a pretty liquid sand color, do yourself a favor and purchase a full size bottle of Jinx.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that with this set you can try out several without committing to buy a full size bottle that will sit and rot if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift, however I have the whole collection in full size  bottles.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>Try them out, see if you like the colors and then go and purchase the larger size bottle or bottles of the ones you love.</li>
            <li>Under top coat it rivals some of Opi&#x27;s designer series for sheer gorgeousness.  </li>
            <li>These are all pretty colors</li>
            <li>The polish is really pretty.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, neatly packaged and exactly as described y the seller.</li>
            <li>This item is exactly what you would think it is.&lt;br</li>
            <li>--a stunning deep orange with gold micro glitter.</li>
            <li>I personally would have preferred more impact.</li>
            <li>This is my second favorite in this set.</li>
            <li>When fully applied the pink also appears very light.</li>
            <li>After trying the Stage shades of Mariah Carey collection I was really exited to try the bong girls liquid sands.</li>
            <li>You will be able to get a lot of polish out of each bottle before it is empty.</li>
            <li>The color is very runny, and there is almost no \\&quot;sand\\&quot; texture to it at all.</li>
            <li>They also seem to wear very well.</li>
            <li>The colors are real pretty, something for different tastes.</li>
            <li>I have had \\&quot;Jinx\\&quot; on for over two days now with absolutely no chips (which is rare for a glitter/textured polish)!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy a full size bottle of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The size of the bottles are itty bitty but more than enough to get several times painting your nails 2-3 coats.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend this seller and product.</li>
            <li>and I had high hopes for this polish.</li>
            <li>In once case an entire nail&#x27;s worth popped off while opening mail as if it was a press on nail (maybe 4 days of wear).  </li>
            <li>pretty much I think it is just personal preference on which colors jump out at you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed the liquid sand seems to peel off wholesale much more like a &#x27;glitter sandwich&#x27; rather than stick stubbornly to your nail the way plain glitter polishes do.  </li>
            <li>Vesper is a pretty nice color, but doesn&#x27;t have a thick enough consistency.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult, not a child.</li>
            <li>Too much glitter and not enough coverage.</li>
            <li>This was my LEAST favorite.</li>
            <li>Sand texture is not as rough as I thought it would be, so I do like it very much.</li>
            <li>and  Solitaire are mediocre: their colors are nice but they are metalic which does not go well with the textured formula.</li>

            <li> and  Solitaire are mediocre: their colors are nice but they are metalic which does not go well with the textured formula.</li>
            <li> I know I am getting the full size of at least 2 of the minis that I got!</li>
            <li> Keep in mind you are gettign little samples of each and NOT the normal sized bottles.</li>
            <li> from girly girl pink to dangerously deep purple.  </li>
            <li> Not a big fan of vesper (the dark purple).</li>
            <li> The colors are beyond amazing, they have a grainy finish to them, I applied a base coat and 2 coats of any of those four.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pussy Galore--a baby pink shimmer with flecks of darker pink glitter.</li>
            <li> It looks like crushed pearls on your nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vesper--a deep almost black purple with black flecks.</li>
            <li> I layer a lot of top coat on mine because I hate liquid sand texture</li>
            <li> The texture is completely different, and not good at all.</li>
            <li> It is very vibrant and it sparkles like crazy.</li>
            <li> Vesper is probably the least stand out polish of the bunch, it&#x27;s so dark that you can hardly tell its purple.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected and this pack was even worse.</li>
            <li> NO TOP COAT</li>
            <li> At least I couldn&#x27;t get any of the sand to apply to my nail.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with the color pink</li>
            <li> It is okay....just not great.</li>
            <li> I am a serious O.P.I. lover!</li>
            <li> with the sand texture it is virtually impossible to mess it up.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> The worst was Vesper, being dull and looking like smudged polish.</li>
            <li> so its nothing bad against the set itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the quality on these polishes is just terrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the color pallet of this collection. They shimmer and shine in the light  and I couldn&#x27;t stop myself from admiring the colors on my hand.&lt;br /&gt;I am a  self-manicurist. These are my favorite colors of all-time!&lt;br /&gt; I am a serious O.P.I. lover!</li>
            <li> Super cute colors! I know I am getting the full size of at least 2 of the minis that I got! Happy I tried it!</li>
            <li> a really different nail polish. just like the bond girls. its a non shine-y surface, a sandy feel to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift, however I have the whole collection in full size  bottles. They&#x27;re awesome. &amp;#34;Vesper&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t my favorite but a a whole I love the collection.</li>
            <li> I got this set because I love James Bond and I love nail polish. Win-win! But the quality on these polishes is just terrible.  They are supposed to be textured-I thought they would be similar to the OPI gold glitter texture polish from their Great and Powerful Oz collection.  The texture is completely different, and not good at all. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The Pussy Galore color is amazing in candlelight - so noticed even my hubby! Sand texture is not as rough as I thought it would be, so I do like it very much.</li>
            <li> These are perfect size sample nail polish bottles if you want to try the O.P.I. line. I Ordered the double 007 Bond girls line,  The colors are real pretty, something for different tastes. from girly girl pink to dangerously deep purple.  These samples are great.  Try them out, see if you like the colors and then go and purchase the larger size bottle or bottles of the ones you love.</li>
            <li> I will never purchase a mini set of OPI again. Not what I expected and this pack was even worse.</li>
            <li> These bottles are tiny. Seriously tiny. However, these colors are great! Pussy Galore is probably the best liquid sand. I intend to buy a full bottle. Vesper is a pretty nice color, but doesn&#x27;t have a thick enough consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult, not a child. Too much glitter and not enough coverage. Opi usually only needs a couple if coats but these colors would require a ton</li>
            <li> Good sized bottles and a very cost-effecient way to give the brand a try or as a great gift idea.</li>
            <li> Never tried the liquid sand polish so I figured this would be a great introduction. The colors are all great. Not a big fan of vesper (the dark purple). Jinx steals all the glory in this set. Already ordered a full size of jinx because its so beautiful. A must have! Very happy with this set. Shipping was super fast. Received my order in 2 days.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this polish and the colors! This is one cool set! Cannot beat this price for this mini set!</li>
            <li> After trying the Stage shades of Mariah Carey collection I was really exited to try the bong girls liquid sands. However they were inferior in many aspects in my opinion. The colors are not as bright and shiny as the Maria Carey&#x27;s with one exemption: Jinx, which is an interesting coral matte and shinny polish. The worst was Vesper, being dull and looking like smudged polish. Pussy galore and  Solitaire are mediocre: their colors are nice but they are metalic which does not go well with the textured formula.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to try the new(ish) liquid sand finish from Opi if you haven&#x27;t yet or aren&#x27;t sure about the finish.  The size of the bottles are itty bitty but more than enough to get several times painting your nails 2-3 coats.  That being said, I am not sold on liquid sand yet.  Some of the colors look OK or at least interesting on their own, and some do really well under a top coat (though it EATS UP top coat, be warned, you will need a lot) to make them prettier.  I&#x27;ve noticed the liquid sand seems to peel off wholesale much more like a &#x27;glitter sandwich&#x27; rather than stick stubbornly to your nail the way plain glitter polishes do.  In once case an entire nail&#x27;s worth popped off while opening mail as if it was a press on nail (maybe 4 days of wear).  Some of the liquid sand looked yucky under topcoat, despite some of the swatches I&#x27;ve seen online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said: the polish called Jinx is amazing and fantastic, especially under top coat.  Under top coat it rivals some of Opi&#x27;s designer series for sheer gorgeousness.  If you want to try liquid sand (or any of Opi&#x27;s lines, these mini-bottle sets are a great way without breaking the bank).  But if you just want a pretty liquid sand color, do yourself a favor and purchase a full size bottle of Jinx.</li>
            <li> These are all pretty colors but Jinx steals the show here! It&#x27;s soooo pretty! I layer a lot of top coat on mine because I hate liquid sand texture but these are pretty with or without top coat! Vesper is probably the least stand out polish of the bunch, it&#x27;s so dark that you can hardly tell its purple.</li>
            <li> Friend of mine loves the O.P.I polish. This was a nice little gift with a great theme! Bottles are mini but the colors are cute. Great to wear for the spring.</li>
            <li> The polish is really pretty. The size is just the right size to get different colors and figure out which one you might like the best before purchasing the full size bottle. You will be able to get a lot of polish out of each bottle before it is empty. Very pleased on the color selection.</li>
            <li> Super. Very happy for this purshase.&lt;br /&gt;Recomand provider and product.&lt;br /&gt;Mini OPI are great and sand effect is very cool</li>
            <li> Amazing collection! Arrived on time, neatly packaged and exactly as described y the seller. Keep in mind you are gettign little samples of each and NOT the normal sized bottles. The colors are beyond amazing, they have a grainy finish to them, I applied a base coat and 2 coats of any of those four. NO TOP COAT AT ALL. You don&#x27;t want the shiny glossy look, this is made to be a sandy matte look and it is the best I&#x27;ve used so far. Mix and match colors on each hand, all of these colors complement each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this seller and product.</li>
            <li> Not as great when I got my nails done in the salon. The &amp;#34;pussy galore&amp;#34; color looked great, from the large bottle. But when I Used the mini pack version it didn&#x27;t have as great of a texture. Definitely a good set to get for sampling before you purchase a full bottle.</li>
            <li> My wife really liked these.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly what you would think it is.&lt;br /&gt;They come out matte which is cool and i am always touching them since they have the sand texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the colors. I think i just didn&#x27;t pay enough attention to them when i ordered though so its nothing bad against the set itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purple color was my favorite one.</li>
            <li> I have never used the OPI liquid sand so I thought this would be a perfect introduction to them, and a great oppurtunity to test them out. This kit includes four Bond girl inspired shades. I will give a mini review below on each individual color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jinx--a stunning deep orange with gold micro glitter. This is my favorite color in the set. I am in love!! It is very vibrant and it sparkles like crazy. It had a medium \\&quot;sand\\&quot; or bumpy texture. This color looked amazing with two coats applied and nothing else. I will definitely buy a full size bottle of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vesper--a deep almost black purple with black flecks. This was my LEAST favorite. The color is very runny, and there is almost no \\&quot;sand\\&quot; texture to it at all. At least I couldn&#x27;t get any of the sand to apply to my nail. I simply didn&#x27;t like it...just my opinion. I would not buy this color again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pussy Galore--a baby pink shimmer with flecks of darker pink glitter. I am obsessed with the color pink and I had high hopes for this polish. I have to say I was a little disappointed. It is okay....just not great. There is medium sand texture in this color. It was more textured than Vesper....but not as textured as Jinx or Solitaire. When fully applied the pink also appears very light. I personally would have preferred more impact. So I like this one...but I don&#x27;t love it. I may or may not purchase in full size....I&#x27;m still on the fence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solitaire--Shimmering pearl white with silver glitter. TONS of \\&quot;sand\\&quot; texturing. This is my second favorite in this set. The color is beautiful. It looks like crushed pearls on your nails. It is perfect in every way, color, texture, application. I will buy this in the full size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So pretty much I think it is just personal preference on which colors jump out at you. I love the fact that with this set you can try out several without committing to buy a full size bottle that will sit and rot if you don&#x27;t like it. These go on easy and look amazing when applied.....with the sand texture it is virtually impossible to mess it up. They also seem to wear very well. I have had \\&quot;Jinx\\&quot; on for over two days now with absolutely no chips (which is rare for a glitter/textured polish)!! Pick this up and give them a try for yourself!!</li>
