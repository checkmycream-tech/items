            <li>This concealer is simply amazing!</li>
            <li>I thought it would be this most awesome product, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>Its a perfect conceler i love it</li>
            <li>I honestly dont know why i didnt discover this way before!</li>
            <li>For some reason the medium is the best for my skin, which is normally light.</li>
            <li>The light color is perfect as a highlighter for me.</li>
            <li>SMOOTH AND BEAUTIFUL!</li>
            <li>good stuff... covers everything...</li>
            <li>I have to set it with a good powder.</li>
            <li>So if some of you use that already then this might be a good product for you.</li>
            <li>Good color match.</li>
            <li>This feels so good on the skin because of the vitamins in it.</li>
            <li>It provides good coverage without being cakey.  </li>
            <li>Cosmetics Bye Bye Under Eye Full Coverage Waterproof Concealer is the best concealer I have found.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>some worked OK, but this one works great.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Once on, it&#x27;s great coverage and feels light!</li>
            <li>It gives great coverage, I wouldn&#x27;t say perfect or flawless, but much better than most concealers-- especially in this price</li>
            <li>many have said they had)!</li>
            <li>I will buy more probably in a darker color!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I love this concealer!  </li>
            <li>I cant tell you how amazing this product is because Im gonna throw it away.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I let it sit on my finger for a moment to warm up.</li>
            <li>Nice Job</li>
            <li>It also has an oily/dewy finish so brushing afterward with a translucent powder is a must for a nice finished look.</li>
            <li>It is a very forgiving product, and does a wonderful job at concealing circles...</li>
            <li>Cleu de pue costs more, but the color and coverage is good, you just have to reapply it if it gets inadvertently removed.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t sweat off in the heat and blends in so nicely on the skin</li>
            <li>Super coverage, great color match.</li>
            <li>Great Product &amp; quick delivery</li>
            <li>After a very busy day I still looked great that evening!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It spreads very easily.  </li>
            <li>Pretty darn good!  </li>
            <li>The neutral medium color is light and bright.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product and I enjoy it</li>
            <li>this stuff kind of dries and doesn&#x27;t stay greasy like most concealers.</li>
            <li>The best I have found so far was MAC.</li>
            <li>This is the most AMAZING product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product!</li>
            <li>OK, I have shopped around all over the place, tried millions of concealers and have found this one to be the best one (so far).  </li>
            <li>I am very fair completed, did my normal cleanse &amp; moisture routine, then applied this with a concealer brush for maximum control.</li>
            <li>I love this concealer because of the great coverage but you have to find the right product to set it with.</li>
            <li>I would purchase it again as it does a. better job than some of the others I tried.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>better than any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This evens out my skin and makes me glow:)</li>
            <li>and I love that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am only moderately impressed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, not the coverage I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>I love this product and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>I prefer this one over the newer under eye concealer (although that one matches my skin tone better)</li>
            <li>because I feel like it has better coverage.</li>
            <li>I ordered this after reading some reviews online and LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I squeezed some more and still nothing...</li>
            <li>The tan also is not brightening which is better as a face concealer.  </li>
            <li>Love the It under eye concealer...</li>
            <li>Seen this on QVC years ago and ordered it, love the product.</li>
            <li>i have purchased many concealers, and none have the tenacity of this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>perfect for only under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I went back and purchased the \\&quot;neutral medium\\&quot; shade, and it is absolutely amazingly perfect for covering both the hyper- and hypopigmented areas!  </li>
            <li>I have been so pleased</li>
            <li>I simply would not be without this marvelous product!</li>
            <li>Perhaps you&#x27;ll come up with a more concealing product, but Bye Bye does help and</li>
            <li>I love this concealer.</li>
            <li>In any case, this stuff is magic.</li>
            <li>It hides everything perfectly, doesn&#x27;t crease, and only takes the tiniest dot of it to cover both eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure any powder you like would do</li>
            <li>I have had this product for over a year and wasn&#x27;t sure how to get more.</li>
            <li>Amazon is the most convenient shopping place EVER.</li>
            <li>I simply LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>Love it........ been using it for years.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I watched infomercials and many reviews and all were raving about it.</li>
            <li>Favorite concealer of all time</li>
            <li>As always I am looking for something that is always better.  </li>
            <li>Only the coverage is still awesome!</li>
            <li>more than pays for itself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutley in love.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried many and none compare to this.</li>
            <li>I was instantly in love.  </li>
            <li>pleased with product.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot that is for sure.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite concealer, it stays on all day.</li>
            <li>It really does a great job in covering and hiding all the imperfections I have under the eyes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It covers any little(or big) flaw great!!</li>
            <li>Such an excellent product!</li>
            <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Do not over pat or play with the product, it does best if you let it &#x27;float.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>IT Cosmetics is a great company and I own several of their products.</li>
            <li>But overall, a very good product.</li>
            <li>I bought the concealer initially in the \\&quot;light\\&quot; shade, because I have a very fair complexion.  </li>
            <li>This makes it much more blendable and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s made by a cruelty free company.</li>
            <li>Covers great and looks natural</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t work any better than the cheap drug store brands.</li>
            <li>I loved the feeling of this concealer, it feels very creamy silky and it covers everything</li>
            <li>She loved it so much that I decided to buy some for myself.  </li>
            <li>I love how smoothly it goes on and how easy it is to blend.  </li>
            <li>The neutral medium turned gray on my blotches, but the tan - which is not dark worked great.  </li>
            <li>It covers under eye circles perfectly and can be used for any other flaws that need to be covered.</li>
            <li>It sets very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This had great reviews, but I found it way too greasy to even be able to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Waterproof and easily layered under foundation and powder.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and even, and doesn&#x27;t crease, flake or irritate.</li>
            <li>If you need a highly pigmented concealer this will be a good selection.</li>
            <li>Her face always looks flawless and she does not have any dark circles anymore.</li>
            <li>Best undereye treatment for dark circles I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Hands down the best full-coverage concealer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best concealer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>hands down THE best concealer on the market!</li>
            <li>but I stay away from those because of their tendency to settle in the fine lines.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s still easy to smooth away if that happens.  </li>
            <li>This was my first foray into the it cosmetics brand, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll try more of their products...</li>
            <li>this concealer would show my fine lines--but it does not at all.  </li>
            <li>Looks quite cakey and creases in fine wrinkles</li>
            <li>I learned over time that it is a must to set it with a fine powder or it will crease and move around a bit.</li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t find it to be drying as it doesn&#x27;t settle into the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, I love it!</li>
            <li>The best dark circle concealer I have ever used!</li>
            <li>- I wanted to add that this didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Too light for my light to medium skin and creased immediately.</li>
            <li>However, a tiny bit of this gives you great coverage.</li>
            <li>I find it works best when mixing a tiny amount (you don&#x27;t need much) with an eye cream and smoothly applying together, otherwise it does look cakey under your eyes.  </li>
            <li>if it does move, I can pat it out smooth again without losing coverage.</li>
            <li>I bought both light and medium.  </li>
            <li>It gives a nice finish and it really does not settle in the wrinkles like BE powders do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light skinned</li>
            <li>so I bought the medium light color.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think my tube was filled even though it came sealed.</li>
            <li>Received Light.</li>
            <li>have medium brown hair and light skin.</li>
            <li>You may have to tap the creases a couple more times throughout the day, but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>It covers beautifully and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I have fairly oily skin for a 46 year old but this is not too greasy</li>
            <li>Rub a bit between your fingertips first to warm it and then apply and it covers everything quickly.</li>
            <li>The medium shade was perfect, I normally use concealer that is yellow based, but this shade worked well.  </li>
            <li>i ended up getting a full tube because I liked it so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use too much</li>
            <li>It goes on very easy and conceals very well.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite concealer!</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this concealer, and at first I did.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product, or basically the entire &#x27;it&#x27; line collection.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth!</li>
            <li>The coverage is excellent which also surprises me since in the past, I&#x27;ve always used the crayon type</li>
            <li>Next time I was more conservative in my use and am now in love!</li>
            <li>This works no better than any drug store brand but the Cover Girl Eye Rehab is the best and for a way cheaper price!</li>
            <li>its a good price too since you barely need any to cover them up.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing product and it has inspired me to try the Pore Powder which is what i will be ordering next~</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s super important to buy the brush that goes with it.</li>
            <li>It is thick but easily blends, the shade is perfect surprisingly since they have only 2 shades.  </li>
            <li>I have nice skin to start with, but this just makes it look, WOW!</li>
            <li>the under eye circles more visible and is very cakey</li>
            <li>I have never in my life used a concealer that was full coverage like this one.</li>
            <li>I love the product so much</li>
            <li>With such good reviews on this product here on Amazon and You Tube, I decided to try this.  </li>
            <li>Bye Bye Under Eye Full Coverage also has Vitamins C and K which over time, hopefully will correct/protect as well as conceal.  </li>
            <li>I can use as a full face coverup..</li>
            <li>Would not recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a full coverage concealer.</li>
            <li>Hold up to full day in Texas coastal heat &amp; humidity.  </li>
            <li>I was really expecting more from this.</li>
            <li>I love how much coverage it has</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing the full size now.</li>
            <li>After reading other reviews and seeing most people were fairly pleased, but many noted the dryness of the product, I decided to order it.  </li>
            <li>I tried many many concealers by many diff brands from low-high end, spent thousands of dollars!</li>
            <li>It will do a good job under eyes but be aware it is very thick and  if you want something that is lightweight it might mot make you happy.</li>
            <li>otherwise I experienced creasing under the eyes after smiling a few times meaning fine lines</li>
            <li>I think you could do better elsewhere with a concealer that was more fluid.</li>
            <li>Let it warm up on your index finger before applying, or put it on a concealer brush and warm it up for a few seconds with a blowdryer before applying...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even need powder to set, i put this concealer on in my inner eye corner and because of the sheen without powder, it looks amazing because it catches the light and looks luminous.</li>
            <li>I have tried many a concealer--- both high end and drugstore brands.  </li>
            <li>I have really dark circles under my eyes and this concealer does a great job covering them.  </li>
            <li>This concealer does a great job of hiding my dark circles.</li>
            <li>i got the tan first because i heard they run light -</li>
            <li>works great for hiding dark circles</li>
            <li>This concealer is amazing for blemishes - it covers redness better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This is my second tube ordered and very pleased</li>
            <li>This is bye far the best concealer for covering dark under eye circles that I have found... and trust me I have tried EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li>This product is excellent at covering any facial discoloration and stays on all day long.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Amazingly, the \\&quot;light\\&quot; is slightly too light for me!  </li>
            <li>A little brightness is great for under the eye, but not the face.  </li>
            <li>I am a big fan of MAC and Estee Lauder, but I am finding this brand to have better coverage and it doesnt settle into fine lines like the heavier MAC and Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li>Excellent coverage, very thick product.</li>
            <li>It is amazing and tube last forever!!  </li>
            <li>Take a tiny (end of a pencil eraser size) dab and warm it between your fingers-- then apply.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different concealers before, even ones more expensive than this, and this one works the best.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Love this product so far.</li>
            <li>but how natural it looks :-)</li>
            <li>For me, the draw backs aren&#x27;t worth the price of this product.</li>
            <li>Okay so I don&#x27;t have super duper dark circles, but I was still having trouble finding the perfect concealer.</li>
            <li>I have gone through many, many concealers in the past and this has better coverage than some of the top designer brands like MAC, Dermablend, Urban Decay, etc.</li>
            <li>I am medium beige ((warm) skin tone with dark under-eye circles and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>You get the concealer right where you want it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the price, and was nervous about spending more than I usually would on a product I couldn&#x27;t even test.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using this concealer, since I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of that particular mascara, anyway.  </li>
            <li>First off the instructions say to warm it up by rubbing on back of hand.</li>
            <li>you need very little of this product to get great results.  </li>
            <li>I normally have smooth under eye skin because I use lots of oils, creams, etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full coverage, very moisturizing, and brightening.</li>
            <li>Bobby Brown (dud, returned it), massive range of drugstore brands (ok, but just cannot cover &amp; last), Laura Mercier (nice but $$), Benefit Erase Paste (up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a good concealer for my over 50 allergy/baggy, dark under eyes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy, which I like, and even acts as a good eyeshadow primer ( if I apply too much and need to stretch it out further).  </li>
            <li>and I got the lightest, but as I have fair complection it is too dark.</li>
            <li>It looks good when first applied but it has to be reapplied and when you reapply it, it REALLY makes your undereye area look and feel dry.</li>
            <li>I wish I could find something a little better, however, as at my age, I could sure use the help.  </li>
            <li>Well they certainly hold try to that!</li>
            <li>I thought I loved my previous eye concealer until I discovered this one.  </li>
            <li>and I can say that it is a nice product, but it is a bit dry.  </li>
            <li>If it is soft and easy to blend into the skin</li>
            <li>you only need a tiny amount each time and a tube lasts me about 4 months with great coverage.</li>
            <li>Also, I am pretty fair (Irish heritage) with cool undertones, and the \\&quot;natural medium\\&quot; shade seems to match really well.  </li>
            <li>This product is just amazing, it completely covers the circles and looks so natural.</li>
            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I can use this and a little powder with my tinted moisturizer and good for the day.</li>
            <li>Plus it stays on all day and makes your skin so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a lightweight concealer that would perform better than the stick concealers I&#x27;ve been using, so I tried this after reading several glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with this product and probably will buy it again, until  another miracle concealer comes out that I will be tempted to try.</li>
            <li>I stopped using for a week and then tried one more time, but same thing...itching where I had applied the concealer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My skin tone is light-medium but found the natural medium to light to use on face.  </li>
            <li>i first put on eye cream and let it absorb and then the bye bye under eye.  </li>
            <li>i definitely look more awake when i use this product</li>
            <li>more white based</li>
            <li>Bye bye under eye concealer from IT cosmetics is creamy and covers very well!</li>
            <li>I have light olive skin &amp; am 38 yrs young</li>
            <li>It almost seems to make them stand out more for me, even when patting the product instead of smearing and using extra layers.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well</li>
            <li>There are only 4 shades to choose from and this is the most neutral shade of the 4.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted about 7 months.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on reviews, and found it exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>That is the first word I would use to describe this product.  </li>
            <li>then you used too much!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning it and will probably not repurchase it unless I absolutely have to!</li>
            <li>I have allergy rings around my eyes, am a babyboomer and this product works pretty well with a brush.</li>
            <li>When I first squeezed the tube I thought it would come out</li>
            <li>This product really does a good jog for dark circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li>This has amazing, lasting coverage and your business is extremely professional and reliable.</li>
            <li>This combination stays in place flawlessly for the entire day, which for me begins at 5am and goes until at least 10pm.</li>
            <li>Very thick and creamy but spreads niceland conceals beautifully and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>Good things come in small packages!And</li>
            <li>good coverup, not sure its waterproof</li>
            <li>It is a little tube of magic!</li>
            <li>I love the product but Is it possible that it&#x27;s very old???  </li>
            <li>At first I was thought it would be too dark, as I am very light skinned.</li>
            <li>think this concealer would be adequate for people with normal skin or who live in temperate areas.  </li>
            <li>I have light skin not the pure white porcelain</li>
            <li>but it creases so much under my eyes</li>
            <li>I also use it with the concealer brush, but that doesn&#x27;t help much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of liquid concealers recently and they are too light and transparent.  </li>
            <li>My complexion is light, similar to (Renee Zellweger)</li>
            <li>The light shade is way too light, it&#x27;s white like printer paper white !  </li>
            <li>What I really like is that it stayed in place all day, NOT settling into lines.  </li>
            <li>I have olive toned skin and Neutral fits me very well.</li>
            <li>And yes I blended but with that much shine it really stands out under your eyes.</li>
            <li>very good...love it.</li>
            <li>That really is all it takes.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>very pasty.</li>
            <li>I do use it at the inner corners of my eyes to add some light and brighten things up.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to use it as a spot concealer for the problem areas I have along my lower cheek area and jawline.  </li>
            <li>After concealing, I set this with the It Cosmetics Powder Foundation, which I also absolutely adore.  </li>
            <li>I really like this under eye cream.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your attention to my wishes.  </li>
            <li>BUT BEWARE, there isn&#x27;t much in it.  </li>
            <li>After reading about Bye Bye Undereye, I decided it was worth a try since a plastic surgeon developed it.</li>
            <li>and maybe I am using to much</li>
            <li>It covers my under eye circles very well.</li>
            <li>This is very pigmented so alittle goes</li>
            <li>This is a very hydrating concealer and almost has a glow to it.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>This not only covers but the hint of highlighting helps light reflect and</li>
            <li>your whole eye area looks brighter.</li>
            <li>Although lighter than expected I love this product.</li>
            <li>The size of the tube is very deceiving as to how much product you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>The concealer does cover very well</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>I gentle sqeezed the tube, expecting the cream to funnel out .  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and I really like the way it covers up any shadow under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth, and does not form wrinkles under the eyes like most thick under eye concealers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let it warm a few seconds on your skin or between your fingers to make it easier to apply.  </li>
            <li>Great coverage for my relatively dark under eye circles, and it lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li>This concealer is also not drying at all, which was really surprising because it is SO thick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other products, but i still find myself coming back to this one as it looks the most natural, and</li>
            <li>I guess I don&#x27;t love it as much as the other reviewers is because I might have expecting the Holy Grail.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I read the reviews for this product that I paid an extra 20 dollars to have it shipped overnight.</li>
            <li>And to top it off, it doesn&#x27;t trigger additional breakouts like other brands have.</li>
            <li>a dab of this will cover your entire under eye in full coverage.</li>
            <li>The only reason i didn&#x27;t give it full stars is because of the shade, it says neutral medium</li>
            <li>I am a concealer junkie and this is my favorite to cover my dark circles.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it would last me a very long time, but now I wonder if there are more air pockets in it.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li>One part you gently dab it on under your eyes and the other side of the brush you gently brush it smooth where you want the coverage.</li>
            <li>I like this, but it is really not that easy to spread.  </li>
            <li>Less is more,  this product is buildable.  </li>
            <li>- Quickly creased in high-humidity conditions (e.g., FL in the middle of summer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent, but I have to say,</li>
            <li>Larger tubes (super size) can be found on QVC.</li>
            <li>I am an older woman who has wrinkles and not-so-flawless skin.</li>
            <li>I barely sleep having a teething toddler and this cream works nice to cover my bags and dark circles.</li>
            <li>It does crease even though I set it with a fine concealer powder, but not as much as some other concealers.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this concealer.  </li>
            <li>However I do highly, highly recommend this product and I will continue using it for years to come.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and even tho</li>
            <li>A high price for probably 1/2 teaspoon of product.</li>
            <li>We both highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Beware if you have sensitive skin!!  </li>
            <li>It does take a little more work in order to blend it out.</li>
            <li>Thought coverage would be a little better after viewing on QVC models.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a great coverage not a wonderful one.</li>
            <li>But by far, the biggest flaw in this product is that It&#x27;s *very* shiny.  </li>
            <li>Tubes last literally forever &amp; so so worth it.</li>
            <li>I am working at a hospital as a volunteer (22 years) and would like to keep going a few more years</li>
            <li>I watched YouTube tutorials and tried several different application techniques, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like this product is enough on its own - perhaps needs a color correcting layer under</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews, but I am on this one b/c</li>
            <li>Product is thick, however blended nicely.  </li>
            <li>A tube like this will last a long time and it is worth the money!!</li>
            <li>Thank you for offering this product brand new.  </li>
            <li>(He, He) for any new products that you might come up with.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without now.</li>
            <li>This is my one &amp;#34;can&#x27;t live without&amp;#34; makeup item.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to find the tube</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin either.</li>
            <li>At first I used it only for under my eyes.</li>
            <li>This is the first I&#x27;ve tried that actually covers all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands, at many price points, but I come back again and again to this product.</li>
            <li>It also has a shimmery undertone, which is what you want for dark circles because it reflects the light away and doesn&#x27;t absorb it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, especially for us older chicks !</li>
            <li>but, it settles down into the lines and you have to smooth it out from time to time...</li>
            <li>Not only does it cover anything and everything, it gives the skin a nice firm look from the collagen in it!</li>
            <li>I have always had dark circles and have used many different concealers,</li>
            <li>works as a highlighter for light coverage but not full coverage.</li>
            <li>I have very dark circles and fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, but glides on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>the concealer just bunches up in little flakes instead of smoothly covering.</li>
            <li>Of the two products standing alone I would gravitate toward the bye bye, but the partially filled tube has me a little irritated.  </li>
            <li>This is an effective concealer, but it&#x27;s not without some major (or at least major for me) draw backs.  </li>
            <li>It clearly states on the tube that it contains .28</li>
            <li>Trust me, I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>When compared with other more expensive brands worth buying it and also takes very much!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t disappear completely</li>
            <li>I also use the Bye Bye Pores HD silk micro powder puff to seal the concealer under eyes, than use a soft brush with the powder on the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like the old concealing look of the &#x27;70&#x27;s raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>So far this is my go to concealer</li>
            <li>and I use the Tan, while my mother is 58 yrs young with lighter complexion and uses Medium.</li>
            <li>I use under my mineral makeup and so far, it has been compatible.</li>
            <li>Coming from someone who has been self conscious about my under eye circles since about 12.</li>
            <li>It must have been old had like grain of dirt in it when I applied it</li>
            <li>You really just need one tiny dot.  </li>
            <li>It is a very dense, color-rich product; I sometimes use it as foundation on my entire face.  </li>
            <li>The neutral medium concealer looks natural and not like racoon eyes.</li>
            <li>Not only do I use this for eye coverage, I use it as a whole face concealer.</li>
            <li>natural coverage</li>
            <li>It is WORTH EVERY PENNY and will last about 4-6 months with regular use.  </li>
            <li>I honestly could see this one tube lasting at least a year.</li>
            <li>complementary with other products (like powder, foundation, etc) I&#x27;m a big believer in Quality over Quantity, so even though it does cost a little more, it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Comparing this tube to a .25 tube of highlighter that I have, the Bye Bye tube is maybe half full.</li>
            <li>I seriously could not believe how well this stuff worked - I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything from  high end to low drug store</li>
            <li>I had tried several items in the drugstores, but when someone recommended this product so highly I just had to find out for myself.</li>
            <li>I am 32 years old, and have started to notice fine lines forming around my eyes over the last few years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to mention that the color is lighter than expected, but in my case the next tome is too dark, so what I do is apply a drop of this on my hand and a tiny tiny drop of my foundation, mix it lightly with my finger and then apply - works like a charm.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also packaged correctly so that it is not clumsy or to big to carry in my purse.</li>
            <li>When using it to cover dark spots on my face it is ok, but not a preferred concealer due to the consistency.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product, the doctor i work for told me about it because we both have HORRIBLE dark circles.</li>
            <li>Full coverage concealer that zapped my deep dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li>Naturally, the older I get, the more difficult it&#x27;s been.  </li>
            <li>It is thick but spreads easily when you use as demonstrated on videos.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I am light to medium skin tone and this was very pale.</li>
            <li>It does not show in my fine eye lines (late 40&#x27;s) and stays on ALL DAY with no need to re-apply.</li>
            <li>If you have the same problem as I, make sure to use a very , very small amount and apply it to the shadows under your &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I actually resigned myself to the fact that I looked better with dark circles than I did after applying these other under-eye concealer products.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s worth noting, a little bit is all you need.</li>
            <li>A little goes a LONG WAY; light dab and then touch/dab to blend, then maybe feather in edges with a concealer or foundation brush.  </li>
            <li>It really does last me all day long.</li>
            <li>Be careful to not squeeze out too much at once.  </li>
            <li>You can barely see it when I squeeze it out</li>
            <li>I have red spot and adult acne.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic for dark circles, skin discolorations and a host of other skin &amp;#34;flaws&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It costs more, but it will last a long time, as you only need a small amount to do the job.  </li>
            <li>You dont use a lot like other products and it covers very well.  </li>
            <li>It went on more thickly than I&#x27;d expected and didn&#x27;t cover as well.</li>
            <li>You need to apply a little primer first.</li>
            <li>Bye Bye Under Eye really covers my dark circles and does not settle into my crows feet.</li>
            <li>I also use on my dark circles and it covers very well (i do use powder there).</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel it covers my dark circles very well.  </li>
            <li>I do have somewhat sensitive, but not extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Then I go back and tap the concealer out of the creases and apply Bare Minerals concealer powder in summer bisque.</li>
            <li>It is light reflective however, definitely difficult to blend, tends to seep into fine lines and after a few hours actually makes them look deeper than they are.  </li>
            <li>for the coverage: It is highly pigmented and definitely covers darkness under the eyes and when set with powder creases minimally.</li>
            <li>The product comes out super thick, like a paste.</li>
            <li>It is a super thick cream</li>
            <li>Because I use so little, it will last a long time,so it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>My dark circles are hereditary and super dark.  </li>
            <li>You have to squeeze the whole tube to get the little bit that is in it out, which is way at the bottom.  </li>

            <li> Just another great product by It Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I was so happy with Erase Paste</li>

            <li> Provides great coverage.</li>
            <li> Great color and coverage.  </li>

            <li> It is a great product.</li>
            <li> I found that using a Q-tip to apply concealer works great.</li>

            <li> LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did!!  </li>
            <li> Simply AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> It is amazing!</li>
            <li> This concealer is simply amazing!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be this most awesome product, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> Its a perfect conceler i love it</li>
            <li> I honestly dont know why i didnt discover this way before!</li>
            <li> For some reason the medium is the best for my skin, which is normally light.</li>
            <li> The light color is perfect as a highlighter for me.</li>
            <li> SMOOTH AND BEAUTIFUL!</li>
            <li> good stuff... covers everything...</li>
            <li> I have to set it with a good powder.</li>
            <li> So if some of you use that already then this might be a good product for you.</li>
            <li> Good color match.</li>
            <li> This feels so good on the skin because of the vitamins in it.</li>
            <li> It provides good coverage without being cakey.  </li>
            <li> Cosmetics Bye Bye Under Eye Full Coverage Waterproof Concealer is the best concealer I have found.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> some worked OK, but this one works great.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Once on, it&#x27;s great coverage and feels light!</li>
            <li> It gives great coverage, I wouldn&#x27;t say perfect or flawless, but much better than most concealers-- especially in this price</li>
            <li> many have said they had)!</li>
            <li> I will buy more probably in a darker color!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I love this concealer!  </li>
            <li> I cant tell you how amazing this product is because Im gonna throw it away.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I let it sit on my finger for a moment to warm up.</li>
            <li> Nice Job</li>
            <li> It also has an oily/dewy finish so brushing afterward with a translucent powder is a must for a nice finished look.</li>
            <li> It is a very forgiving product, and does a wonderful job at concealing circles...</li>
            <li> Cleu de pue costs more, but the color and coverage is good, you just have to reapply it if it gets inadvertently removed.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t sweat off in the heat and blends in so nicely on the skin</li>
            <li> Super coverage, great color match.</li>
            <li> Great Product &amp; quick delivery</li>
            <li> After a very busy day I still looked great that evening!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It spreads very easily.  </li>
            <li> Pretty darn good!  </li>
            <li> The neutral medium color is light and bright.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product and I enjoy it</li>
            <li> this stuff kind of dries and doesn&#x27;t stay greasy like most concealers.</li>
            <li> The best I have found so far was MAC.</li>
            <li> This is the most AMAZING product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!</li>
            <li> OK, I have shopped around all over the place, tried millions of concealers and have found this one to be the best one (so far).  </li>
            <li> I am very fair completed, did my normal cleanse &amp; moisture routine, then applied this with a concealer brush for maximum control.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer because of the great coverage but you have to find the right product to set it with.</li>
            <li> I would purchase it again as it does a. better job than some of the others I tried.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> better than any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This evens out my skin and makes me glow:)</li>
            <li> and I love that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am only moderately impressed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not the coverage I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I love this product and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I prefer this one over the newer under eye concealer (although that one matches my skin tone better)</li>
            <li> because I feel like it has better coverage.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading some reviews online and LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I squeezed some more and still nothing...</li>
            <li> The tan also is not brightening which is better as a face concealer.  </li>
            <li> Love the It under eye concealer...</li>
            <li> Seen this on QVC years ago and ordered it, love the product.</li>
            <li> i have purchased many concealers, and none have the tenacity of this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> perfect for only under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I went back and purchased the \\&quot;neutral medium\\&quot; shade, and it is absolutely amazingly perfect for covering both the hyper- and hypopigmented areas!  </li>
            <li> I have been so pleased</li>
            <li> I simply would not be without this marvelous product!</li>
            <li> Perhaps you&#x27;ll come up with a more concealing product, but Bye Bye does help and</li>
            <li> I love this concealer.</li>
            <li> In any case, this stuff is magic.</li>
            <li> It hides everything perfectly, doesn&#x27;t crease, and only takes the tiniest dot of it to cover both eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure any powder you like would do</li>
            <li> I have had this product for over a year and wasn&#x27;t sure how to get more.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the most convenient shopping place EVER.</li>
            <li> I simply LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> Love it........ been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I watched infomercials and many reviews and all were raving about it.</li>
            <li> Favorite concealer of all time</li>
            <li> As always I am looking for something that is always better.  </li>
            <li> Only the coverage is still awesome!</li>
            <li> more than pays for itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutley in love.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many and none compare to this.</li>
            <li> I was instantly in love.  </li>
            <li> pleased with product.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot that is for sure.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite concealer, it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> It really does a great job in covering and hiding all the imperfections I have under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It covers any little(or big) flaw great!!</li>
            <li> Such an excellent product!</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Do not over pat or play with the product, it does best if you let it &#x27;float.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> IT Cosmetics is a great company and I own several of their products.</li>
            <li> But overall, a very good product.</li>
            <li> I bought the concealer initially in the \\&quot;light\\&quot; shade, because I have a very fair complexion.  </li>
            <li> This makes it much more blendable and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s made by a cruelty free company.</li>
            <li> Covers great and looks natural</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work any better than the cheap drug store brands.</li>
            <li> I loved the feeling of this concealer, it feels very creamy silky and it covers everything</li>
            <li> She loved it so much that I decided to buy some for myself.  </li>
            <li> I love how smoothly it goes on and how easy it is to blend.  </li>
            <li> The neutral medium turned gray on my blotches, but the tan - which is not dark worked great.  </li>
            <li> It covers under eye circles perfectly and can be used for any other flaws that need to be covered.</li>
            <li> It sets very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This had great reviews, but I found it way too greasy to even be able to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Waterproof and easily layered under foundation and powder.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and even, and doesn&#x27;t crease, flake or irritate.</li>
            <li> If you need a highly pigmented concealer this will be a good selection.</li>
            <li> Her face always looks flawless and she does not have any dark circles anymore.</li>
            <li> Best undereye treatment for dark circles I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Hands down the best full-coverage concealer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best concealer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> hands down THE best concealer on the market!</li>
            <li> but I stay away from those because of their tendency to settle in the fine lines.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s still easy to smooth away if that happens.  </li>
            <li> This was my first foray into the it cosmetics brand, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll try more of their products...</li>
            <li> this concealer would show my fine lines--but it does not at all.  </li>
            <li> Looks quite cakey and creases in fine wrinkles</li>
            <li> I learned over time that it is a must to set it with a fine powder or it will crease and move around a bit.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t find it to be drying as it doesn&#x27;t settle into the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, I love it!</li>
            <li> The best dark circle concealer I have ever used!</li>
            <li> - I wanted to add that this didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Too light for my light to medium skin and creased immediately.</li>
            <li> However, a tiny bit of this gives you great coverage.</li>
            <li> I find it works best when mixing a tiny amount (you don&#x27;t need much) with an eye cream and smoothly applying together, otherwise it does look cakey under your eyes.  </li>
            <li> if it does move, I can pat it out smooth again without losing coverage.</li>
            <li> I bought both light and medium.  </li>
            <li> It gives a nice finish and it really does not settle in the wrinkles like BE powders do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m light skinned</li>
            <li> so I bought the medium light color.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think my tube was filled even though it came sealed.</li>
            <li> Received Light.</li>
            <li> have medium brown hair and light skin.</li>
            <li> You may have to tap the creases a couple more times throughout the day, but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> It covers beautifully and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily skin for a 46 year old but this is not too greasy</li>
            <li> Rub a bit between your fingertips first to warm it and then apply and it covers everything quickly.</li>
            <li> The medium shade was perfect, I normally use concealer that is yellow based, but this shade worked well.  </li>
            <li> i ended up getting a full tube because I liked it so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use too much</li>
            <li> It goes on very easy and conceals very well.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite concealer!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this concealer, and at first I did.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product, or basically the entire &#x27;it&#x27; line collection.</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth!</li>
            <li> The coverage is excellent which also surprises me since in the past, I&#x27;ve always used the crayon type</li>
            <li> Next time I was more conservative in my use and am now in love!</li>
            <li> This works no better than any drug store brand but the Cover Girl Eye Rehab is the best and for a way cheaper price!</li>
            <li> its a good price too since you barely need any to cover them up.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product and it has inspired me to try the Pore Powder which is what i will be ordering next~</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s super important to buy the brush that goes with it.</li>
            <li> It is thick but easily blends, the shade is perfect surprisingly since they have only 2 shades.  </li>
            <li> I have nice skin to start with, but this just makes it look, WOW!</li>
            <li> the under eye circles more visible and is very cakey</li>
            <li> I have never in my life used a concealer that was full coverage like this one.</li>
            <li> I love the product so much</li>
            <li> With such good reviews on this product here on Amazon and You Tube, I decided to try this.  </li>
            <li> Bye Bye Under Eye Full Coverage also has Vitamins C and K which over time, hopefully will correct/protect as well as conceal.  </li>
            <li> I can use as a full face coverup..</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a full coverage concealer.</li>
            <li> Hold up to full day in Texas coastal heat &amp; humidity.  </li>
            <li> I was really expecting more from this.</li>
            <li> I love how much coverage it has</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing the full size now.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews and seeing most people were fairly pleased, but many noted the dryness of the product, I decided to order it.  </li>
            <li> I tried many many concealers by many diff brands from low-high end, spent thousands of dollars!</li>
            <li> It will do a good job under eyes but be aware it is very thick and  if you want something that is lightweight it might mot make you happy.</li>
            <li> otherwise I experienced creasing under the eyes after smiling a few times meaning fine lines</li>
            <li> I think you could do better elsewhere with a concealer that was more fluid.</li>
            <li> Let it warm up on your index finger before applying, or put it on a concealer brush and warm it up for a few seconds with a blowdryer before applying...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even need powder to set, i put this concealer on in my inner eye corner and because of the sheen without powder, it looks amazing because it catches the light and looks luminous.</li>
            <li> I have tried many a concealer--- both high end and drugstore brands.  </li>
            <li> I have really dark circles under my eyes and this concealer does a great job covering them.  </li>
            <li> This concealer does a great job of hiding my dark circles.</li>
            <li> i got the tan first because i heard they run light -</li>
            <li> works great for hiding dark circles</li>
            <li> This concealer is amazing for blemishes - it covers redness better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is my second tube ordered and very pleased</li>
            <li> This is bye far the best concealer for covering dark under eye circles that I have found... and trust me I have tried EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent at covering any facial discoloration and stays on all day long.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Amazingly, the \\&quot;light\\&quot; is slightly too light for me!  </li>
            <li> A little brightness is great for under the eye, but not the face.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of MAC and Estee Lauder, but I am finding this brand to have better coverage and it doesnt settle into fine lines like the heavier MAC and Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage, very thick product.</li>
            <li> It is amazing and tube last forever!!  </li>
            <li> Take a tiny (end of a pencil eraser size) dab and warm it between your fingers-- then apply.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different concealers before, even ones more expensive than this, and this one works the best.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love this product so far.</li>
            <li> but how natural it looks :-)</li>
            <li> For me, the draw backs aren&#x27;t worth the price of this product.</li>
            <li> Okay so I don&#x27;t have super duper dark circles, but I was still having trouble finding the perfect concealer.</li>
            <li> I have gone through many, many concealers in the past and this has better coverage than some of the top designer brands like MAC, Dermablend, Urban Decay, etc.</li>
            <li> I am medium beige ((warm) skin tone with dark under-eye circles and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> You get the concealer right where you want it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the price, and was nervous about spending more than I usually would on a product I couldn&#x27;t even test.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using this concealer, since I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of that particular mascara, anyway.  </li>
            <li> First off the instructions say to warm it up by rubbing on back of hand.</li>
            <li> you need very little of this product to get great results.  </li>
            <li> I normally have smooth under eye skin because I use lots of oils, creams, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s full coverage, very moisturizing, and brightening.</li>
            <li> Bobby Brown (dud, returned it), massive range of drugstore brands (ok, but just cannot cover &amp; last), Laura Mercier (nice but $$), Benefit Erase Paste (up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a good concealer for my over 50 allergy/baggy, dark under eyes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy, which I like, and even acts as a good eyeshadow primer ( if I apply too much and need to stretch it out further).  </li>
            <li> and I got the lightest, but as I have fair complection it is too dark.</li>
            <li> It looks good when first applied but it has to be reapplied and when you reapply it, it REALLY makes your undereye area look and feel dry.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find something a little better, however, as at my age, I could sure use the help.  </li>
            <li> Well they certainly hold try to that!</li>
            <li> I thought I loved my previous eye concealer until I discovered this one.  </li>
            <li> and I can say that it is a nice product, but it is a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> If it is soft and easy to blend into the skin</li>
            <li> you only need a tiny amount each time and a tube lasts me about 4 months with great coverage.</li>
            <li> Also, I am pretty fair (Irish heritage) with cool undertones, and the \\&quot;natural medium\\&quot; shade seems to match really well.  </li>
            <li> This product is just amazing, it completely covers the circles and looks so natural.</li>
            <li> thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I can use this and a little powder with my tinted moisturizer and good for the day.</li>
            <li> Plus it stays on all day and makes your skin so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a lightweight concealer that would perform better than the stick concealers I&#x27;ve been using, so I tried this after reading several glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with this product and probably will buy it again, until  another miracle concealer comes out that I will be tempted to try.</li>
            <li> I stopped using for a week and then tried one more time, but same thing...itching where I had applied the concealer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My skin tone is light-medium but found the natural medium to light to use on face.  </li>
            <li> i first put on eye cream and let it absorb and then the bye bye under eye.  </li>
            <li> i definitely look more awake when i use this product</li>
            <li> more white based</li>
            <li> Bye bye under eye concealer from IT cosmetics is creamy and covers very well!</li>
            <li> I have light olive skin &amp; am 38 yrs young</li>
            <li> It almost seems to make them stand out more for me, even when patting the product instead of smearing and using extra layers.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well</li>
            <li> There are only 4 shades to choose from and this is the most neutral shade of the 4.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted about 7 months.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews, and found it exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> That is the first word I would use to describe this product.  </li>
            <li> then you used too much!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning it and will probably not repurchase it unless I absolutely have to!</li>
            <li> I have allergy rings around my eyes, am a babyboomer and this product works pretty well with a brush.</li>
            <li> When I first squeezed the tube I thought it would come out</li>
            <li> This product really does a good jog for dark circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li> This has amazing, lasting coverage and your business is extremely professional and reliable.</li>
            <li> This combination stays in place flawlessly for the entire day, which for me begins at 5am and goes until at least 10pm.</li>
            <li> Very thick and creamy but spreads niceland conceals beautifully and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Good things come in small packages!And</li>
            <li> good coverup, not sure its waterproof</li>
            <li> It is a little tube of magic!</li>
            <li> I love the product but Is it possible that it&#x27;s very old???  </li>
            <li> At first I was thought it would be too dark, as I am very light skinned.</li>
            <li> think this concealer would be adequate for people with normal skin or who live in temperate areas.  </li>
            <li> I have light skin not the pure white porcelain</li>
            <li> but it creases so much under my eyes</li>
            <li> I also use it with the concealer brush, but that doesn&#x27;t help much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of liquid concealers recently and they are too light and transparent.  </li>
            <li> My complexion is light, similar to (Renee Zellweger)</li>
            <li> The light shade is way too light, it&#x27;s white like printer paper white !  </li>
            <li> What I really like is that it stayed in place all day, NOT settling into lines.  </li>
            <li> I have olive toned skin and Neutral fits me very well.</li>
            <li> And yes I blended but with that much shine it really stands out under your eyes.</li>
            <li> very good...love it.</li>
            <li> That really is all it takes.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> very pasty.</li>
            <li> I do use it at the inner corners of my eyes to add some light and brighten things up.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to use it as a spot concealer for the problem areas I have along my lower cheek area and jawline.  </li>
            <li> After concealing, I set this with the It Cosmetics Powder Foundation, which I also absolutely adore.  </li>
            <li> I really like this under eye cream.</li>
            <li> Thanks for your attention to my wishes.  </li>
            <li> BUT BEWARE, there isn&#x27;t much in it.  </li>
            <li> After reading about Bye Bye Undereye, I decided it was worth a try since a plastic surgeon developed it.</li>
            <li> and maybe I am using to much</li>
            <li> It covers my under eye circles very well.</li>
            <li> This is very pigmented so alittle goes</li>
            <li> This is a very hydrating concealer and almost has a glow to it.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> This not only covers but the hint of highlighting helps light reflect and</li>
            <li> your whole eye area looks brighter.</li>
            <li> Although lighter than expected I love this product.</li>
            <li> The size of the tube is very deceiving as to how much product you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> The concealer does cover very well</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> I gentle sqeezed the tube, expecting the cream to funnel out .  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and I really like the way it covers up any shadow under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It is smooth, and does not form wrinkles under the eyes like most thick under eye concealers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let it warm a few seconds on your skin or between your fingers to make it easier to apply.  </li>
            <li> Great coverage for my relatively dark under eye circles, and it lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> This concealer is also not drying at all, which was really surprising because it is SO thick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other products, but i still find myself coming back to this one as it looks the most natural, and</li>
            <li> I guess I don&#x27;t love it as much as the other reviewers is because I might have expecting the Holy Grail.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I read the reviews for this product that I paid an extra 20 dollars to have it shipped overnight.</li>
            <li> And to top it off, it doesn&#x27;t trigger additional breakouts like other brands have.</li>
            <li> a dab of this will cover your entire under eye in full coverage.</li>
            <li> The only reason i didn&#x27;t give it full stars is because of the shade, it says neutral medium</li>
            <li> I am a concealer junkie and this is my favorite to cover my dark circles.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it would last me a very long time, but now I wonder if there are more air pockets in it.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> One part you gently dab it on under your eyes and the other side of the brush you gently brush it smooth where you want the coverage.</li>
            <li> I like this, but it is really not that easy to spread.  </li>
            <li> Less is more,  this product is buildable.  </li>
            <li> - Quickly creased in high-humidity conditions (e.g., FL in the middle of summer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent, but I have to say,</li>
            <li> Larger tubes (super size) can be found on QVC.</li>
            <li> I am an older woman who has wrinkles and not-so-flawless skin.</li>
            <li> I barely sleep having a teething toddler and this cream works nice to cover my bags and dark circles.</li>
            <li> It does crease even though I set it with a fine concealer powder, but not as much as some other concealers.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this concealer.  </li>
            <li> However I do highly, highly recommend this product and I will continue using it for years to come.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this and even tho</li>
            <li> A high price for probably 1/2 teaspoon of product.</li>
            <li> We both highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Beware if you have sensitive skin!!  </li>
            <li> It does take a little more work in order to blend it out.</li>
            <li> Thought coverage would be a little better after viewing on QVC models.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a great coverage not a wonderful one.</li>
            <li> But by far, the biggest flaw in this product is that It&#x27;s *very* shiny.  </li>
            <li> Tubes last literally forever &amp; so so worth it.</li>
            <li> I am working at a hospital as a volunteer (22 years) and would like to keep going a few more years</li>
            <li> I watched YouTube tutorials and tried several different application techniques, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like this product is enough on its own - perhaps needs a color correcting layer under</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews, but I am on this one b/c</li>
            <li> Product is thick, however blended nicely.  </li>
            <li> A tube like this will last a long time and it is worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Thank you for offering this product brand new.  </li>
            <li> (He, He) for any new products that you might come up with.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without now.</li>
            <li> This is my one &amp;#34;can&#x27;t live without&amp;#34; makeup item.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to find the tube</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin either.</li>
            <li> At first I used it only for under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is the first I&#x27;ve tried that actually covers all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, at many price points, but I come back again and again to this product.</li>
            <li> It also has a shimmery undertone, which is what you want for dark circles because it reflects the light away and doesn&#x27;t absorb it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, especially for us older chicks !</li>
            <li> but, it settles down into the lines and you have to smooth it out from time to time...</li>
            <li> Not only does it cover anything and everything, it gives the skin a nice firm look from the collagen in it!</li>
            <li> I have always had dark circles and have used many different concealers,</li>
            <li> works as a highlighter for light coverage but not full coverage.</li>
            <li> I have very dark circles and fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, but glides on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> the concealer just bunches up in little flakes instead of smoothly covering.</li>
            <li> Of the two products standing alone I would gravitate toward the bye bye, but the partially filled tube has me a little irritated.  </li>
            <li> This is an effective concealer, but it&#x27;s not without some major (or at least major for me) draw backs.  </li>
            <li> It clearly states on the tube that it contains .28</li>
            <li> Trust me, I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> When compared with other more expensive brands worth buying it and also takes very much!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t disappear completely</li>
            <li> I also use the Bye Bye Pores HD silk micro powder puff to seal the concealer under eyes, than use a soft brush with the powder on the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the old concealing look of the &#x27;70&#x27;s raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> So far this is my go to concealer</li>
            <li> and I use the Tan, while my mother is 58 yrs young with lighter complexion and uses Medium.</li>
            <li> I use under my mineral makeup and so far, it has been compatible.</li>
            <li> Coming from someone who has been self conscious about my under eye circles since about 12.</li>
            <li> It must have been old had like grain of dirt in it when I applied it</li>
            <li> You really just need one tiny dot.  </li>
            <li> It is a very dense, color-rich product; I sometimes use it as foundation on my entire face.  </li>
            <li> The neutral medium concealer looks natural and not like racoon eyes.</li>
            <li> Not only do I use this for eye coverage, I use it as a whole face concealer.</li>
            <li> natural coverage</li>
            <li> It is WORTH EVERY PENNY and will last about 4-6 months with regular use.  </li>
            <li> I honestly could see this one tube lasting at least a year.</li>
            <li> complementary with other products (like powder, foundation, etc) I&#x27;m a big believer in Quality over Quantity, so even though it does cost a little more, it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Comparing this tube to a .25 tube of highlighter that I have, the Bye Bye tube is maybe half full.</li>
            <li> I seriously could not believe how well this stuff worked - I love it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything from  high end to low drug store</li>
            <li> I had tried several items in the drugstores, but when someone recommended this product so highly I just had to find out for myself.</li>
            <li> I am 32 years old, and have started to notice fine lines forming around my eyes over the last few years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to mention that the color is lighter than expected, but in my case the next tome is too dark, so what I do is apply a drop of this on my hand and a tiny tiny drop of my foundation, mix it lightly with my finger and then apply - works like a charm.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also packaged correctly so that it is not clumsy or to big to carry in my purse.</li>
            <li> When using it to cover dark spots on my face it is ok, but not a preferred concealer due to the consistency.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product, the doctor i work for told me about it because we both have HORRIBLE dark circles.</li>
            <li> Full coverage concealer that zapped my deep dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> Naturally, the older I get, the more difficult it&#x27;s been.  </li>
            <li> It is thick but spreads easily when you use as demonstrated on videos.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I am light to medium skin tone and this was very pale.</li>
            <li> It does not show in my fine eye lines (late 40&#x27;s) and stays on ALL DAY with no need to re-apply.</li>
            <li> If you have the same problem as I, make sure to use a very , very small amount and apply it to the shadows under your &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I actually resigned myself to the fact that I looked better with dark circles than I did after applying these other under-eye concealer products.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s worth noting, a little bit is all you need.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG WAY; light dab and then touch/dab to blend, then maybe feather in edges with a concealer or foundation brush.  </li>
            <li> It really does last me all day long.</li>
            <li> Be careful to not squeeze out too much at once.  </li>
            <li> You can barely see it when I squeeze it out</li>
            <li> I have red spot and adult acne.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic for dark circles, skin discolorations and a host of other skin &amp;#34;flaws&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It costs more, but it will last a long time, as you only need a small amount to do the job.  </li>
            <li> You dont use a lot like other products and it covers very well.  </li>
            <li> It went on more thickly than I&#x27;d expected and didn&#x27;t cover as well.</li>
            <li> You need to apply a little primer first.</li>
            <li> Bye Bye Under Eye really covers my dark circles and does not settle into my crows feet.</li>
            <li> I also use on my dark circles and it covers very well (i do use powder there).</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel it covers my dark circles very well.  </li>
            <li> I do have somewhat sensitive, but not extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Then I go back and tap the concealer out of the creases and apply Bare Minerals concealer powder in summer bisque.</li>
            <li> It is light reflective however, definitely difficult to blend, tends to seep into fine lines and after a few hours actually makes them look deeper than they are.  </li>
            <li> for the coverage: It is highly pigmented and definitely covers darkness under the eyes and when set with powder creases minimally.</li>
            <li> The product comes out super thick, like a paste.</li>
            <li> It is a super thick cream</li>
            <li> Because I use so little, it will last a long time,so it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are hereditary and super dark.  </li>
            <li> You have to squeeze the whole tube to get the little bit that is in it out, which is way at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> You only need a tiny bit so the small tube last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> When I first received thought it was too dark, but it cancelled out the dark circles instantly.</li>
            <li> It is the only concealer I have found that works for me so far since I have dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long enough for the price.</li>
            <li> hard to squeeze out fluid, doesn&#x27;t seem full, not worth the $$</li>
            <li> is that is says it gets rid of the natural dark circles with vitamin E</li>
            <li> I use a concealing flat brush to apply, then blend the edges with my finger.  </li>
            <li> Last&#x27;s forever and stay&#x27;s on a long time.</li>
            <li> Tube is a generous amount, and will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> so this tube will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I was taken aback by how thick the coverage was.</li>
            <li> but it came out pretty thick.</li>
            <li> I can see myself using only this and a little mascara this summer for a natural and tested look.</li>
            <li> Certainly a little air is reasonable but this is definitely not ethical.  </li>
            <li> Plus, a tiny pea size truly goes a long way!</li>
            <li> A tiny amount goes a long way!</li>
            <li> this product will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> My mascara, sadly, does not agree with it, and easily gets smudged into the concealer, so I gave to be on the lookout for the battle under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> These other products also settled into the fine lines and made them look 100x worse.  </li>
            <li> Also under eye circles are covered but only as much as countless other brands I&#x27;ve tried, and the creases were so apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried every brand going, expensive and cheap.  </li>
            <li> and if I&#x27;m not careful I accentuate the puffiness while trying to hide the dark circles.</li>
            <li> a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> It immediately brightens my eyes and will stay all day as long as I use a setting powder.</li>
            <li> This was NOT developed by plastic surgeons, the website says that is used on the patients of \\&quot;some of the leading plastic surgeons in Brazil.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It goes a long way and the sample lasted for moths.</li>
            <li> Hope anyone else who tries this has the same experience I have!</li>
            <li> I just re-ordered product after a long time.</li>
            <li> Goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This eye concealer is too drying and it makes you look grey underneath the eyes.</li>
            <li> A little thick to apply quickly.</li>
            <li> and this brightens me right up and takes away that tired look.</li>
            <li> You just need to squeeze out a tiny little bit - I usually squeeze onto the back of my hand first - then dab a little on your ring finger, then under your eyes.  </li>
            <li> not go back to any other product</li>
            <li> My under eye area was red, dry and extremely itching.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gotten to the point where it&#x27;s so dry</li>
            <li> but now they seem too dry.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry and smears if you try to layer over it.</li>
            <li> Over-working the product causes it to dry out and</li>
            <li> Does not cake or dry up.</li>
            <li> Does not tug when applied or leave the under eye dry</li>
            <li> I only wear it at night when I go out to cover my dark circles</li>
            <li> It takes away the dark circles under your eyes instantly.</li>
            <li> IT goes on effortlessly with a concealer brush and takes just a tiny amount to cover my dark undereye circles.</li>
            <li> I have an extensive collection of concealers from trying to hide my hereditary dark under eye circles.  </li>
            <li> Definitely works for dark circle concealer.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I put it on a little too thick, and since it&#x27;s shiny, it made my face look very strange.  </li>
            <li> I can get the same coverage with a drugstore brand for half the price.</li>
            <li> last for a while-maybe half the day.  </li>
            <li> I tried using less and mixing it with my daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It can also be used to cover up red spots and other discoloration on the face or other parts of the body .</li>
            <li> The only con is that after one month when squeezing the tube, a lot of air came out which means it&#x27;t not a full tube.</li>
            <li> Covers dark circles under eyes, also red spots or other pigment problems.</li>
            <li> Like others noted in reviews, a little tiny bit is all you need.</li>
            <li> Also use on a little red dot I have on the bridge of my nose</li>
            <li> A little goes a long long way.</li>
            <li> I have been blessed with very dark circles under my eyes and have tried countless undereye concealers.</li>
            <li> It is a very thick cream so must use only a tiny, tiny amount</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way which means this lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> If in doubt, don&#x27;t be, money well spent.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who has dark circles, but not sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Color is lighter than I expected.  </li>
            <li> This is such a waste of money, I would not recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> about 2/3&#x27;s empty after 10 days of use --</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> If they made this concealer in a warm base as well, i would be over the moon with it.</li>
            <li> I have the misfortune of having both Melasma (dark spots of hyperpigmentation that never resolved after pregnancy) and Vitiligo (areas that are completely white spots, absent of any pigmentation at all, an odd autoimmune issue).  </li>
            <li> This product is expensive but you get your money&#x27;s worth and because it takes such a small amount</li>
            <li> The first time I squeezed it out of the tube I actually thought there was something wrong with it, because it was so think and heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have dark circles below and on my lids, and between the bridge of my nose, and broken capillaries on my face and this product absolutely covers it all.  </li>
            <li> only grievance with the product is that after a few hours my mascara always smudges down on my under eye.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> A little dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes A LONG WAY.  </li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way-</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I contiue using yet as any other brand.</li>
            <li> The tube looks empty even though I just purchased it!</li>
            <li> Pay attention to the other reviews-</li>
            <li> The product does settle into lines a little bit, but totally goes away if you blend a little when you see it.  </li>
            <li> I threw out my other concealers.  </li>
            <li> I will never buy another product other than this one.</li>
            <li> This concealer works just about as well as any other I&#x27;ve tried except</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> If you plan on purchasing this, I would say to be very careful with the color.</li>
            <li> She made a comment the other day about her dark circles not showing up in a photo when we had a picture taken with my family.  </li>
            <li> I saw multiple comments on how hard it is to spread due to</li>
            <li> It covers everything thing from dark circles to age spots to freckles.  </li>
            <li> Not what the description says that it helps to remove dark circles.</li>
            <li> My dark circles were no longer visible after I applied the concealer; HOWEVER, after using for 2 days, I started itching under my eyes where I had applied the concealer.  </li>
            <li> Two layers of this, you&#x27;re dark circles will be unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say my only complaint</li>
            <li> It does cover any dark circles however.</li>
            <li> not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I never use this on spots or blemishes, because the tan would be way too dark for my face-</li>
            <li> Dark circles...</li>
            <li> It truly hides all dark spots and shadows.</li>
            <li> Bye Bye Under Eye covers the dark circles and age spots.  </li>
            <li> I used this to hide my dark under-eye circles.</li>
            <li> If you have dark under eyes then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> but I do recommend this to anyone with dark circles.</li>
            <li> but i think it&#x27;s more of a cool base, and I am a yellow base.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish I read in the reviews before is how thick and paste like it is.</li>
            <li> This porduct gives me the coverage I need without being too thick nor does it look spotty or make my wrinkles look like big cracks on my face.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be a bit thick and challanging to apply, but it is not worth sendind back, because I can use it</li>
            <li> And I tried green concealer and other products to cover it up</li>
            <li> It gives jut enough shimmer to act as a subtle highlighter, too, so</li>
            <li> and I mean a little tiny bead of product used one time a day.</li>
            <li> I wanted a slightly lighter shade to mix with tan for the winter</li>
            <li> My eyes are extremely sensitive and it is difficult to find products that don&#x27;t cause irritation, no matter how carefully I apply.</li>
            <li> The product is very thick so a little bit goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> However, I found that my oily skin coupled with high humidity rendered it totally useless.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed for its high price.</li>
            <li> My secret is to put a LITTLE dab (a little goes a long way, especially using this method) on my finger and put it in front of the space heater for a few seconds while rubbing the concealer between my 2 index fingers.</li>
            <li> I just remember to give the mirror a check after a few hours and wipe away any dark areas.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied , the little bottle was half empty .</li>
            <li> It is thicker than I expected, so smoothing it out is a delicate process, but it does indeed seem to conceal and heal dark circles, puffiness, wrinkles, etc.</li>
            <li> - A little goes</li>
            <li> I think perhaps because the product is a little oily, the mascara settles.</li>
            <li> Little bit of a learning curve in using it.</li>
            <li> A little pricier than some</li>
            <li> but you use so little,  it lasts for months...</li>
            <li> A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started to get lines and a little puffiness under my eyes at 40</li>
            <li> My sister has very dark circles under her eyes</li>
            <li> I have very dark purple circles from allergies</li>
            <li> I have very dark circles under my eyes and it covers them so well.</li>
            <li> Very thick concealer, just a tiny bit covers alot.</li>
            <li> - Dried quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had it a few weeks now</li>
            <li> and then it looks too heavy.</li>
            <li> my eyes don&#x27;t look so dead.  </li>
            <li> takes some time to work into skin not smooth or creamy.</li>
            <li> Truly, these tubes are not filled like they should be.  </li>
            <li> I use my finger to blend it under my eyes and a fluffy brush to blend the edges out.</li>
            <li> After using it for multiple days I started breaking out even worse.</li>
            <li> (and it&#x27;s really not huge)</li>
            <li> It is very thick so a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I am pale and freckly.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about how small it was-- .28 fl oz.</li>
            <li> The color description not on this item is way off it does not go over dark circles at all which sucks because the name of the product itself</li>
            <li> have dark circles due to allergies, not great sleep etc.  </li>
            <li> Use small amount because it is heavy.  </li>
            <li> i.e. it is gritty, so needless to say it is not smooth</li>
            <li> but nothing worked... except that little miracle tube!</li>
            <li> Use very little and don&#x27;t play with it a lot.</li>
            <li> so I was a little weirded out, but I think the product&#x27;s THICK formula is to blame.</li>
            <li> it also lasts forever because very little product goes along way.</li>
            <li> Use a little water if it comes out too thick for you.  </li>
            <li> Very little is needed to help with undereye darkness.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive but a very little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> , Seems to heavy to wear in fluorescent lighting of an office &amp; too hard to apply correctly.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Not sure why everyone loves this.</li>
            <li> (I usually have a lot of creasing under my eyes by midday).</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t usually acne prone</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past before.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, and my red nose is very hard to cover, but this product hides my secret.  </li>
            <li> Very heavy and sticky to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed after all the positive reviews from others.</li>
            <li> I developed the worst under eye circles in what seemed like overnight - maybe it was the switch from 30 to 31 years old??</li>
            <li> , my fine lines looked way worst.</li>
            <li> I found it really hard to apply.</li>
            <li> The consistency turns from thick and hard to spread to creamy and spreadable just like your foundation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am in my late forties, and was concerned</li>
            <li> Some have complained about rub-off and creasing</li>
            <li> As thick as cement.</li>
            <li> A Must try- play with it &amp; give it a chance to get used to thick creamy texture.</li>
            <li> The coverage is really thick.</li>
            <li> but it goes on thick and spreads out evenly it when I tap it with my ring finger all under my eyes where I need it.  </li>
            <li> it being so thick.</li>
            <li> If you find its too thick etc.</li>
            <li> It works well but is really thick and didn&#x27;t brighten up my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> Use a very small amount, since it is thick-</li>
            <li> usually concealers slip off somewhere by noon but not this one!</li>
            <li> It takes a very small amount of this product.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles still show, and I find it difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, and because it&#x27;s waterproof it can be hard to wash off.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I&#x27;m already getting a little age on me</li>
            <li> I think this concealer contains ingredients that have ruined my delicate skin!</li>
            <li> As a first time mom of an infant my eye circles were getting horrible!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s shiny and thick!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything under the sun for my horrible dark circles that I have been cursed with my entire life.</li>
            <li> Very thick.  </li>
            <li> This is very thick and paste like.</li>
            <li> I have horrible bags under my eyes and using a little tiny drop not even a drop</li>
            <li> However, I have been using it for almost a month  now, and I noticed my under eye area getting worse and worse looking.</li>
            <li> This concealer was very drying and it looked horrible by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The medium does not have a yellow base -its</li>
            <li> I dab Under eyes &amp; seal with Laura Mercier secret brightening powder #1 &amp;</li>
            <li> It was still difficult to put on and not look like you have a thick layer on your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to thin it out and cover it with plenty of powder to help mitigate the high-shine.  </li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t find that it showed my wrinkles worse.</li>
            <li> BTW, I used this product for permanent under-eye circles due to chronic rhinitis (bad allergies).</li>
            <li> Maybe this could work for others but sadly it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> were exaggerated.</li>
            <li> From cucumbers to ice cubes to finger massages to expensive creams, I&#x27;ve tried it all.  </li>
            <li> , I feel like people can see me, and not my weird Melasma and Vitiligo.  </li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner, but was wrong color.</li>
            <li> I have been searching forever for a concealer like this to help camoflauge my red blotchy skin and my horrible baggy eyes.</li>
            <li> Sorry I tried it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep trying it to see whether I&#x27;m doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry you tried this!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I am going to contact the company as I think there is something wrong with it</li>
            <li> It covers my horrible dark circles, caused by allergies, and a scar on my chin.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this concealer</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed when I tried the concealer and nothing came out!</li>
            <li> Terrible concealer!</li>
            <li> I do not know what all the hype is all about because I was EXTREMELY disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I would hate to be without this concealer, so I bought two!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I read all the reviews before purchasing. I only wear it at night when I go out to cover my dark circles, Seems to heavy to wear in fluorescent lighting of an office &amp; too hard to apply correctly. Just use a touch like all the reviews say.</li>
            <li> I Iike the coverage this concealer gives. I would purchase it again as it does a. better job than some of the others I tried.</li>
            <li> I found this concealer recently through a makeup trial subscription.  I thought I loved my previous eye concealer until I discovered this one.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I am not one to write reviews.  About anything.  I started noticing under eye circles and darkening of the skin under my eyes about a year ago.  I have tried many a concealer--- both high end and drugstore brands.  NOTHING compares to this stuff!  I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the price, and was nervous about spending more than I usually would on a product I couldn&#x27;t even test.  It is WORTH EVERY PENNY and will last about 4-6 months with regular use.  You only need a TINY bit, and I  learned this from experience.  Take a tiny (end of a pencil eraser size) dab and warm it between your fingers-- then apply.  You can build coverage as needed.  I am so happy to have found a great product that works and lasts all day. The search is over!</li>
            <li> After trying this concealer, I immediately ordered a another tube.  It is thicker than I expected, so smoothing it out is a delicate process, but it does indeed seem to conceal and heal dark circles, puffiness, wrinkles, etc. better than any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Buy this, in this color.  It is amazing and tube last forever!!  Plus it stays on all day and makes your skin so soft and smooth.  It covers everything thing from dark circles to age spots to freckles.  Love this product!!  If in doubt, don&#x27;t be, money well spent.  Trust me, I have sensitive skin and this works miracles. 5 star product!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am pale and freckly. This evens out my skin and makes me glow:)</li>
            <li> Too light for my light to medium skin and creased immediately.</li>
            <li> Stays put. Covers well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lightweight concealer that would perform better than the stick concealers I&#x27;ve been using, so I tried this after reading several glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  - A little goes a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;  - Blended well with my skin tone and noticeably brightened my under eye area.&lt;br /&gt;  - Dried quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  - Didn&#x27;t last through a standard work day.&lt;br /&gt;  - Came off with the slightest rubbing (like for an itch).&lt;br /&gt;  - Quickly creased in high-humidity conditions (e.g., FL in the middle of summer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this concealer would be adequate for people with normal skin or who live in temperate areas.  However, I found that my oily skin coupled with high humidity rendered it totally useless.  It claims to be waterproof, but I personally didn&#x27;t see any evidence of that.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about how small it was-- .28 fl oz. However, a tiny bit of this gives you great coverage. The product comes out super thick, like a paste. I let it sit on my finger for a moment to warm up. This makes it much more blendable and smooth. It gives great coverage, I wouldn&#x27;t say perfect or flawless, but much better than most concealers-- especially in this price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have this product in Neutral Medium. At first I was thought it would be too dark, as I am very light skinned. The tone is just perfect though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only grievance with the product is that after a few hours my mascara always smudges down on my under eye. I think perhaps because the product is a little oily, the mascara settles. I set it with powder but still get the smudge. I just remember to give the mirror a check after a few hours and wipe away any dark areas. Besides that, the product itself holds up well through the day.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything under the sun for my horrible dark circles that I have been cursed with my entire life. This was probably the only product that I had not tried, so I figured why not.  After reading other reviews and seeing most people were fairly pleased, but many noted the dryness of the product, I decided to order it.  I have had it a few weeks now and I can say that it is a nice product, but it is a bit dry.  I find it works best when mixing a tiny amount (you don&#x27;t need much) with an eye cream and smoothly applying together, otherwise it does look cakey under your eyes.  The product does cover well but as with everything on the market, it just doesn&#x27;t last, and must be re-applied several times throughout the day... and remember not only do you have to pack this product, you must remember your moisture cream as well. Overall I am pleased with this product and probably will buy it again, until  another miracle concealer comes out that I will be tempted to try.</li>
            <li> Is a normal cover dark circles. Not what the description says that it helps to remove dark circles. If it is soft and easy to blend into the skin but I thought it was something different. I contiue using yet as any other brand. It has no fragrance and I love that. When compared with other more expensive brands worth buying it and also takes very much!</li>
            <li> The color description not on this item is way off it does not go over dark circles at all which sucks because the name of the product itself it says bye-bye under eye from what I can see highlights the ice remix the under eye circles more visible and is very cakey</li>
            <li> Beware if you have sensitive skin!!  I had been looking and looking at this product and finally decided to give it a try.  It is a GREAT concealer.  My dark circles were no longer visible after I applied the concealer; HOWEVER, after using for 2 days, I started itching under my eyes where I had applied the concealer.  I kept using the concealer, but after a week of use, I had to stop.  My under eye area was red, dry and extremely itching.  I do have somewhat sensitive, but not extremely sensitive skin.  I stopped using for a week and then tried one more time, but same thing...itching where I had applied the concealer.  I would recommend to anyone who has dark circles, but not sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great for concealing blemishes. I&#x27;ve tried many other products, but i still find myself coming back to this one as it looks the most natural, and complementary with other products (like powder, foundation, etc) I&#x27;m a big believer in Quality over Quantity, so even though it does cost a little more, it&#x27;s totally worth it. Plus, a tiny pea size truly goes a long way! Nice Job Bye Bye Under Eye</li>
            <li> I loved the feeling of this concealer, it feels very creamy silky and it covers everything but it creases so much under my eyes, my fine lines looked way worst. Maybe this could work for others but sadly it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only moderately impressed. It&#x27;s decent, but I have to say, I thought it would be this most awesome product, but it&#x27;s not. I noted what this item does for her skin blemishes on TV demonstration, however I didn&#x27;t see the same power of this product on myself when I used it on tiny, bluish veins on my ankles or calves in the summer.Also under eye circles are covered but only as much as countless other brands I&#x27;ve tried, and the creases were so apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just didn&#x27;t experience the results I hoped I would get. I&#x27;m disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Recommended For Me. prisrob 10-09-13</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not the coverage I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> hard to squeeze out fluid, doesn&#x27;t seem full, not worth the $$</li>
            <li> Best undereye concealer I have used. I&#x27;ve tried many, but always come back to this one. And it truly is &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Like others noted in reviews, a little tiny bit is all you need. It&#x27;s very easy to use too much and then it looks too heavy. It also has an oily/dewy finish so brushing afterward with a translucent powder is a must for a nice finished look.</li>
            <li> I like this, but it is really not that easy to spread.  I also use it with the concealer brush, but that doesn&#x27;t help much.  Not sure if I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very thick.  Color is lighter than I expected.  I think you could do better elsewhere with a concealer that was more fluid.</li>
            <li> Used this before.  It covers well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this concealer, and at first I did. It covered well and lasted all day. However, I have been using it for almost a month  now, and I noticed my under eye area getting worse and worse looking. It&#x27;s gotten to the point where it&#x27;s so dry the concealer just bunches up in little flakes instead of smoothly covering. I normally have smooth under eye skin because I use lots of oils, creams, etc. I think this concealer contains ingredients that have ruined my delicate skin! I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin either. This is the only change in my makeup/skincare routine, so it must be the cause. I&#x27;m disappointed after all the positive reviews from others.</li>
            <li> I wish I had a lifetime supply of this concealer. I use it as a concealer and a highlighter. It’s SO perfect. I have never in my life used a concealer that was full coverage like this one. For some reason the medium is the best for my skin, which is normally light. If you plan on purchasing this, I would say to be very careful with the color. The light color is perfect as a highlighter for me. It’s so perfect for a flawless look! The color in the picture is medium.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this concealer.  I had done research on different sites and read reviews on different sites.  It doesn&#x27;t last long enough for the price. Before lunch I have to reapply. I can get the same coverage with a drugstore brand for half the price. It also settles into creases.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage for under eyes and blemishes/redness. It is a very thick cream so must use only a tiny, tiny amount otherwise I experienced creasing under the eyes after smiling a few times meaning fine lines were exaggerated. It is quite pliable throughout the day though, so if it does move, I can pat it out smooth again without losing coverage.</li>
            <li> The order arrived on time. I was already sold on the Its cosmetic products. Bye Bye Under Eye really covers my dark circles and does not settle into my crows feet. I believe. If has collagen in it. I love the product so much I&#x27;m just worried they&#x27;ll stop selling the stuff.</li>
            <li> I have really dark circles under my eyes and this concealer does a great job covering them.  They don&#x27;t disappear completely but i can&#x27;t expect a miracle.  I would buy this concealer again.</li>
            <li> My sister told me about This product. When I tried hers I was hooked instantly. Not only does it cover anything and everything, it gives the skin a nice firm look from the collagen in it! I have nice skin to start with, but this just makes it look, WOW! It takes away the dark circles under your eyes instantly. I love this product and recommend it to everyone. Well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> Thank you for offering this product brand new.  This has amazing, lasting coverage and your business is extremely professional and reliable. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best full-coverage concealer I have ever used. A little expensive, but definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product, or basically the entire &#x27;it&#x27; line collection. you only need a tiny amount each time and a tube lasts me about 4 months with great coverage. I prefer this one over the newer under eye concealer (although that one matches my skin tone better) because I feel like it has better coverage. Two layers of this, you&#x27;re dark circles will be unnoticeable. If you can&#x27;t get this on amazon for whatever reason go to ULTA beauty, (aka where 90% of all my money goes) I&#x27;ve tried so many different concealers before, even ones more expensive than this, and this one works the best. I&#x27;d say my only complaint (and it&#x27;s really not huge) is that is says it gets rid of the natural dark circles with vitamin E (and I&#x27;ve used this stuff for about 2 years now) and I haven&#x27;t noticed any change. However I do highly, highly recommend this product and I will continue using it for years to come.</li>
            <li> Great concealer! I was expecting a great coverage not a wonderful one. It was definitely worth! Heard BB is the best concealer ever made.</li>
            <li> On my 3rd or 4th tube.  Lasts 9-12 months.  A little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a good concealer for my over 50 allergy/baggy, dark under eyes.  Naturally, the older I get, the more difficult it&#x27;s been.  With such good reviews on this product here on Amazon and You Tube, I decided to try this.  I am very impressed.  It is thick but easily blends, the shade is perfect surprisingly since they have only 2 shades.  The coverage is excellent which also surprises me since in the past, I&#x27;ve always used the crayon type but now they seem too dry.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of liquid concealers recently and they are too light and transparent.  IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Under Eye Full Coverage also has Vitamins C and K which over time, hopefully will correct/protect as well as conceal.  Under eye bags from age/heredity/allergies seem hopeless to eliminate entirely.  From cucumbers to ice cubes to finger massages to expensive creams, I&#x27;ve tried it all.  It has a moisturizing glow once on, some may want to use a setting powder but I stay away from those because of their tendency to settle in the fine lines.</li>
            <li> My complexion is light, similar to (Renee Zellweger) I bought both light and medium.  The light shade is way too light, it&#x27;s white like printer paper white !  The medium shade was perfect, I normally use concealer that is yellow based, but this shade worked well.  What I really like is that it stayed in place all day, NOT settling into lines.  Product is thick, however blended nicely.  I put just a dot on my hand and then apply.  Highly recommended, especially for us older chicks !</li>
            <li> Very heavy and sticky to apply. It does cover any dark circles however.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied , the little bottle was half empty . I won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product - you can use it for under the eyes or as make up foundation.  It covers beautifully and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I had been considering this for some time, and after reading about it in a blog I like, I thought I would give it a try.  I love how smoothly it goes on and how easy it is to blend.  It gives jut enough shimmer to act as a subtle highlighter, too, so my eyes don&#x27;t look so dead.  It&#x27;s very creamy, which I like, and even acts as a good eyeshadow primer ( if I apply too much and need to stretch it out further).  My mascara, sadly, does not agree with it, and easily gets smudged into the concealer, so I gave to be on the lookout for the battle under my eyes.  However, it&#x27;s still easy to smooth away if that happens.  I&#x27;ll keep using this concealer, since I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of that particular mascara, anyway.  This was my first foray into the it cosmetics brand, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll try more of their products...I&#x27;ve had my eye on that celebration foundation!</li>
            <li> Okay so I don&#x27;t have super duper dark circles, but I was still having trouble finding the perfect concealer. I have tried everything from  high end to low drug store end with no luck. Until this one! I have olive toned skin and Neutral fits me very well. The consistency is perfect. It&#x27;s thick, but glides on very smoothly. A little dab goes a long way. It immediately brightens my eyes and will stay all day as long as I use a setting powder. I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> It is the best concealer. It covers imperfections and I would not be without it.  I use anywhere I need it for spots on my body and especially for under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after trying EVERY concealer out there from Benefit Erase Paste, Boing, Estee Lauder, Neutrogena, Christian Dior, Tarte, etc. I ordered this after reading some reviews online and LOVE IT. IT goes on effortlessly with a concealer brush and takes just a tiny amount to cover my dark undereye circles. It does not show in my fine eye lines (late 40&#x27;s) and stays on ALL DAY with no need to re-apply. This is the most amazing product and it has inspired me to try the Pore Powder which is what i will be ordering next~</li>
            <li> This concealer was very drying and it looked horrible by the end of the day. I use a very good eye moisturizer before applying and it still dries out. It looks good when first applied but it has to be reapplied and when you reapply it, it REALLY makes your undereye area look and feel dry. This was NOT developed by plastic surgeons, the website says that is used on the patients of \\&quot;some of the leading plastic surgeons in Brazil.\\&quot; I will not buy this product again. BTW, I used this product for permanent under-eye circles due to chronic rhinitis (bad allergies).</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I read the reviews for this product that I paid an extra 20 dollars to have it shipped overnight. I was extremely disappointed when I tried the concealer and nothing came out! I squeezed some more and still nothing... Finally after pushing all the air out of the tube, I got a tiny bit.  The tube looks empty even though I just purchased it! What a rip off. This is such a waste of money, I would not recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> It Cosmetics Bye Bye Under Eye Full Coverage Waterproof Concealer is the best concealer I have found.  I use it under my eyes and for brown blotches on my face.  I use a concealing flat brush to apply, then blend the edges with my finger.  The neutral medium color is light and bright.  My skin tone is light-medium but found the natural medium to light to use on face.  I use it under my eyes, then blend in the tan color under eyes and use for blotches on my face.  The neutral medium turned gray on my blotches, but the tan - which is not dark worked great.  The tan also is not brightening which is better as a face concealer.  A little brightness is great for under the eye, but not the face.  When I use the neutral medium only around the eyes, my son said I had owl eyes.  It is easy to apply and a little goes a long way.  I also use the Bye Bye Pores HD silk micro powder puff to seal the concealer under eyes, than use a soft brush with the powder on the rest of my face.  It gives a nice finish and it really does not settle in the wrinkles like BE powders do.  I recommend this concealer, but watch the shades- the 2 are great for me.</li>
            <li> I got this a tried it out.  A little goes A LONG WAY.  Be careful to not squeeze out too much at once.  A tiny dot does both eyes.  I like that it is water proof too. Greast for a climates.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best concealer I have ever used. I have horrible bags under my eyes and using a little tiny drop not even a drop a dab of this will cover your entire under eye in full coverage. The bottle advertises your eight hours of sleep in a tube... Well they certainly hold try to that! I highly recommend this and even tho it&#x27;s pricey, if used correctly this bottle will last you like a year or close to it</li>
            <li> I suffer from allergies, so I always have bluish color circles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my wedding day I was determined NOT to have them, and so I bought this product hoping it would work...and it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It spreads very easily.  Let it warm up on your index finger before applying, or put it on a concealer brush and warm it up for a few seconds with a blowdryer before applying...It is smooth, and does not form wrinkles under the eyes like most thick under eye concealers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my late forties, and was concerned this concealer would show my fine lines--but it does not at all.  It is a very forgiving product, and does a wonderful job at concealing circles...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it is also waterproof--tears were no worry for me...that along with my waterproof mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a great product, and yes I recommend it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Namaste...</li>
            <li> This concealer does a great job of hiding my dark circles. A little goes a long way which means this lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this concealer but I finally decided to give it a try. This is my new favorite concealer! It&#x27;s full coverage, very moisturizing, and brightening.</li>
            <li> Not sure why everyone loves this. Yes it covers but it&#x27;s shiny and thick! Yuk. Sorry I&#x27;m already getting a little age on me don&#x27;t like the old concealing look of the &#x27;70&#x27;s raccoon eyes. And yes I blended but with that much shine it really stands out under your eyes. Sorry, I wanted to love it.</li>
            <li> have dark circles due to allergies, not great sleep etc.  you need very little of this product to get great results.  i use a cosmetic brush which makes it easier.  i first put on eye cream and let it absorb and then the bye bye under eye.  last for a while-maybe half the day.  i definitely look more awake when i use this product</li>
            <li> Love the It under eye concealer...I can use as a full face coverup..very good...love it. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> The product itself performs as advertised -- covers well and does stay put. I was very surprised to find the tube about 2/3&#x27;s empty after 10 days of use -- and I mean a little tiny bead of product used one time a day.That really is all it takes. I wondered at one point if I had been sent a return or a defectively container, it was that underfilled.  I formerly used cleu de pue (sp?), and I had the same stick for a year ( with lots of stick to go) when I got the bye bye under eye. Cleu de pue costs more, but the color and coverage is good, you just have to reapply it if it gets inadvertently removed. Of the two products standing alone I would gravitate toward the bye bye, but the partially filled tube has me a little irritated.  It seems deceptive.</li>
            <li> Seen this on QVC years ago and ordered it, love the product. It does everything it says it suppose to do. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it. I would rather have this than my foundation.</li>
            <li> Terrible concealer! Doesn&#x27;t provide any coverage. Gave it the benefit of the doubt for 1 week  and applied using different tools, beauty blender, brushes, and fingers. Would not recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a full coverage concealer.</li>
            <li> this is a great concealer. i got the tan first because i heard they run light - i am medium complected. I wanted a slightly lighter shade to mix with tan for the winter so i got the neutral/medium. The medium does not have a yellow base -its more white based so beware. So far this is my go to concealer -and ive tried them all.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from my sister for my 40th birthday. As a first time mom of an infant my eye circles were getting horrible! The first time I tried it I was taken aback by how thick the coverage was. Next time I was more conservative in my use and am now in love! I am very fair completed, did my normal cleanse &amp; moisture routine, then applied this with a concealer brush for maximum control. After a very busy day I still looked great that evening! Hooray for a great product. I can see myself using only this and a little mascara this summer for a natural and tested look. A bonus when sleep deprivation and aging are a fact of life.</li>
            <li> i have purchased many concealers, and none have the tenacity of this product. It stays on! It doesn&#x27;t even need powder to set, i put this concealer on in my inner eye corner and because of the sheen without powder, it looks amazing because it catches the light and looks luminous. I also use on my dark circles and it covers very well (i do use powder there). Also, this stuff doesn&#x27;t crease. I am very happy with this product.  Also, a little goes a long way. The only reason i didn&#x27;t give it full stars is because of the shade, it says neutral medium but i think it&#x27;s more of a cool base, and I am a yellow base. If they made this concealer in a warm base as well, i would be over the moon with it. But overall, a very good product.</li>
            <li> This is no miracle product, but is the best concealer I have found.  You use just a tiny bit and need to blend immediately. It sets very quickly.  It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of MAC and Estee Lauder, but I am finding this brand to have better coverage and it doesnt settle into fine lines like the heavier MAC and Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SO MUCH I BOUGHT ONE FOR MY SUSTER AND MY BEST FRIEND. EVERYONE LOVES IT!!!! COVERS EVERY MARK. SMOOTH AND BEAUTIFUL!</li>
            <li> Bye bye under eye concealer from IT cosmetics is creamy and covers very well!</li>
            <li> Wish I could give this 0 stars. Doesn&#x27;t blend. As thick as cement. I&#x27;ll keep using my $7 Maybelline concealer thank you very much.</li>
            <li> ok. not worth the price. very pasty. was a bye bye for me. works as a highlighter for light coverage but not full coverage. takes some time to work into skin not smooth or creamy. would i buy it again. nope.</li>
            <li> The only under eye concealer you will ever use after trying! I have light olive skin &amp; am 38 yrs young and I use the Tan, while my mother is 58 yrs young with lighter complexion and uses Medium. I never use this on spots or blemishes, because the tan would be way too dark for my face- perfect for only under my eyes. When I first received thought it was too dark, but it cancelled out the dark circles instantly. Use a very small amount, since it is thick- I dab Under eyes &amp; seal with Laura Mercier secret brightening powder #1 &amp; it is the best!! Larger tubes (super size) can be found on QVC. Tubes last literally forever &amp; so so worth it. Say goodbye to your under eye circles forever! A Must try- play with it &amp; give it a chance to get used to thick creamy texture.</li>
            <li> Excellent concealer, but use sparingly! Covers dark circles under eyes, also red spots or other pigment problems. I use under my mineral makeup and so far, it has been compatible. It is a super thick cream and I think this tube will last me quite a while.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like grease paint. The coverage is really thick. I found it really hard to apply. I could not get it to blend or feather out. Because it&#x27;s so greasy it doesn&#x27;t dry and smears if you try to layer over it.</li>
            <li> I bought the concealer initially in the \\&quot;light\\&quot; shade, because I have a very fair complexion.  Amazingly, the \\&quot;light\\&quot; is slightly too light for me!  I do use it at the inner corners of my eyes to add some light and brighten things up.  I really wanted to use it as a spot concealer for the problem areas I have along my lower cheek area and jawline.  I have the misfortune of having both Melasma (dark spots of hyperpigmentation that never resolved after pregnancy) and Vitiligo (areas that are completely white spots, absent of any pigmentation at all, an odd autoimmune issue).  Anyway, I went back and purchased the \\&quot;neutral medium\\&quot; shade, and it is absolutely amazingly perfect for covering both the hyper- and hypopigmented areas!  I have been so pleased, I feel like people can see me, and not my weird Melasma and Vitiligo.  After concealing, I set this with the It Cosmetics Powder Foundation, which I also absolutely adore.  This combination stays in place flawlessly for the entire day, which for me begins at 5am and goes until at least 10pm.</li>
            <li> The best dark circle concealer I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I simply would not be without this marvelous product! It is also packaged correctly so that it is not clumsy or to big to carry in my purse.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! Got it in my Ipsy Glambag and I fell inlove! Great coverage! At first I used it only for under my eyes. Sometimes I use it all over my face, like a foundation. Works wonders!! I will never buy anything else again.</li>
            <li> I really like this under eye cream. Coming from someone who has been self conscious about my under eye circles since about 12. This is bye far the best concealer for covering dark under eye circles that I have found... and trust me I have tried EVERYTHING. A little bit goes a long ways. Hope this review helps!</li>
            <li> Looks quite cakey and creases in fine wrinkles</li>
            <li> Bye Bye is an excellent product.  I wish I could find something a little better, however, as at my age, I could sure use the help.  I am working at a hospital as a volunteer (22 years) and would like to keep going a few more years (I am 80).  Perhaps you&#x27;ll come up with a more concealing product, but Bye Bye does help and I appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will keep my eyes open (He, He) for any new products that you might come up with.  Oh, if we could only stop time!  Thanks for your attention to my wishes.  Norma Heagy</li>
            <li> I love this concealer. It&#x27;s a little expensive but a very little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I developed the worst under eye circles in what seemed like overnight - maybe it was the switch from 30 to 31 years old?? In any case, this stuff is magic. It hides everything perfectly, doesn&#x27;t crease, and only takes the tiniest dot of it to cover both eyes. Can&#x27;t live without now.</li>
            <li> works great for hiding dark circles</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!  COVERS EVERYTHING</li>
            <li> This is a good product and I enjoy it BUT BEWARE, there isn&#x27;t much in it.  You have to squeeze the whole tube to get the little bit that is in it out, which is way at the bottom.  Truly, these tubes are not filled like they should be.  Certainly a little air is reasonable but this is definitely not ethical.  I won&#x27;t buy it again until they address this problem.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve gone through numerous undereye concealers from Sephora and Ulta, Lancome, you name it, but nothing made me happy. After reading about Bye Bye Undereye, I decided it was worth a try since a plastic surgeon developed it. You only need the SLIGHTEST dab on your finger to spread it. Very thick and creamy but spreads niceland conceals beautifully and stays on all day. The only con is that after one month when squeezing the tube, a lot of air came out which means it&#x27;t not a full tube. At first I thought it would last me a very long time, but now I wonder if there are more air pockets in it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best! It covers under eye circles perfectly and can be used for any other flaws that need to be covered. I ordered the sample size to try it out. It goes a long way and the sample lasted for moths. i ended up getting a full tube because I liked it so much.</li>
            <li> Great under eye concealer!  Waterproof, crease-proof, stays put &amp; doesn&#x27;t look cakey! It&#x27;s the best concealer that I&#x27;ve ever used!  Dark circles...GONE! Poof! A little bit goes a long way-</li>
            <li> Just another great product by It Cosmetics. It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t sweat off in the heat and blends in so nicely on the skin and it lasts forever. A little goes a long long way.</li>
            <li> Simply AMAZING!  I have an extensive collection of concealers from trying to hide my hereditary dark under eye circles.  Bobby Brown (dud, returned it), massive range of drugstore brands (ok, but just cannot cover &amp; last), Laura Mercier (nice but $$), Benefit Erase Paste (up until this was my go-to killer concealer).  I was so happy with Erase Paste I&#x27;d stopped searching; and then received a sample of Bye Bye Under Eye... I&#x27;m hooked.  A little goes a LONG WAY; light dab and then touch/dab to blend, then maybe feather in edges with a concealer or foundation brush.  Some have complained about rub-off and creasing but I&#x27;ve not had that problem, perhaps because I &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; it with a powder.  I&#x27;m sure any powder you like would do but I happen to have some Laura Mercier powder left from their UnderCover Pot.  Hold up to full day in Texas coastal heat &amp; humidity.  Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I guess I don&#x27;t love it as much as the other reviewers is because I might have expecting the Holy Grail.  I ordered the incorrect color but and maybe I am using to much but I don&#x27;t feel it covers my dark circles very well.  Any blemish or scar it works great on but will return and keep searching</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff! It is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have had this product for over a year and wasn&#x27;t sure how to get more. Amazon is the most convenient shopping place EVER. My product arrived without incident. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my eyes look brighter instantly!! Love this product so far. Pay attention to the other reviews- you do NOT need a lot of the product. I literally use the amount of a pin head and it covers BOTH eyes or else it would get gunky and not look as it is supposed to. Because I use so little, it will last a long time,so it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> This had great reviews, but I found it way too greasy to even be able to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This concealer is amazing for blemishes - it covers redness better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. For under eye circles though, it didn&#x27;t work as well. It almost seems to make them stand out more for me, even when patting the product instead of smearing and using extra layers. I watched YouTube tutorials and tried several different application techniques, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like this product is enough on its own - perhaps needs a color correcting layer under it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit - I wanted to add that this didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all, which is a huge plus. My eyes are extremely sensitive and it is difficult to find products that don&#x27;t cause irritation, no matter how carefully I apply.</li>
            <li> I simply LOVE this product. I use it daily. A little goes a long way. It lasts me all day. It&#x27;s creamy and for me it didn&#x27;t crease. I&#x27;m light skinned so I bought the medium light color. I learned about this product on YouTube about two years ago and I&#x27;m glad I found this product. It covers my under eye circles very well.</li>
            <li> good stuff... covers everything...</li>
            <li> Provides great coverage. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Love it........ been using it for years. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I received this concealer in a sample box and used it until the last drop. Pricey but WORTH it especially for those icky blemishes that just wont go away.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic for dark circles, skin discolorations and a host of other skin &amp;#34;flaws&amp;#34;. The product is very thick so a little bit goes a long, long way. I honestly could see this one tube lasting at least a year. The only problem I have stems from the fact I have under eye puffiness and if I&#x27;m not careful I accentuate the puffiness while trying to hide the dark circles. If you have the same problem as I, make sure to use a very , very small amount and apply it to the shadows under your &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34;. It truly hides all dark spots and shadows. IT Cosmetics is a great company and I own several of their products.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have dark circles below and on my lids, and between the bridge of my nose, and broken capillaries on my face and this product absolutely covers it all.  It took me about a week to master the application and this is what I learned. 1)  Less is more,  this product is buildable.  2) Apply the product with your fingertip and tap it into your skin.  Don&#x27;t rub it in. It takes a very small amount of this product.  I use about 3 pinhead amount.  This product is expensive but you get your money&#x27;s worth and because it takes such a small amount this product will last a very long time.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Great!! Very thick concealer, just a tiny bit covers alot. Have Not had an air pocket in my tube(as many have said they had)! I will buy more probably in a darker color! Love it...</li>
            <li> The tiniest amount will help cover/conceal!  Pretty darn good!  Good things come in small packages!And this be one of them!</li>
            <li> This concealer is simply amazing! I tried many many concealers by many diff brands from low-high end, spent thousands of dollars! I&#x27;m a self proclamed make up junkie!!! nothing ever covered my undereye cincles like this. It stays on ALL DAY!!! usually concealers slip off somewhere by noon but not this one! I will never ever use anything else!!!</li>
            <li> I am 32 years old, and have started to notice fine lines forming around my eyes over the last few years.  I&#x27;ve tried multiple different brands of concealer including Clinique, Neutrogena, Loreal, Lancome, etc, and they all looked cakey on my under-eye skin.  These other products also settled into the fine lines and made them look 100x worse.  I actually resigned myself to the fact that I looked better with dark circles than I did after applying these other under-eye concealer products.  Well, after doing some research online, I stumbled upon IT Cosmetics Bye Bye under-eye concealer, and decided to give it a whirl.  I seriously could not believe how well this stuff worked - I love it.  The product does settle into lines a little bit, but totally goes away if you blend a little when you see it.  This concealer is also not drying at all, which was really surprising because it is SO thick.  The first time I squeezed it out of the tube I actually thought there was something wrong with it, because it was so think and heavy.  You just need to squeeze out a tiny little bit - I usually squeeze onto the back of my hand first - then dab a little on your ring finger, then under your eyes.  Works perfectly.  Also, I am pretty fair (Irish heritage) with cool undertones, and the \\&quot;natural medium\\&quot; shade seems to match really well.  Hope anyone else who tries this has the same experience I have!</li>
            <li> It must have been old had like grain of dirt in it when I applied it</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage, very thick product. Little bit of a learning curve in using it. One tube last forever!!</li>
            <li> I am medium beige ((warm) skin tone with dark under-eye circles and fine lines.  Oily skin.  I have used Bobby Brown concealer for years until I recently recieved a sample of this.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;This tube will easily last over a year, with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for success:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Prep under eye area with moisturizer or primer -yes even us oily skin gals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Use a TINY bit.  This is very pigmented so alittle goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Do not over pat or play with the product, it does best if you let it &#x27;float.&#x27;  Over-working the product causes it to dry out and settle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> This works pretty well but I don&#x27;t think my tube was filled even though it came sealed. I squeezed and squeezed to get any out and I have to do it every time I use it. A high price for probably 1/2 teaspoon of product.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer because of the great coverage but you have to find the right product to set it with. This is a very hydrating concealer and almost has a glow to it. I have to set it with a good powder. My sister sets hers with the Mallys face defender and she swears by it. So if some of you use that already then this might be a good product for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous!  I love it!  It actually does what the ad says it&#x27;ll do.  I threw out my other concealers.  It costs more, but it will last a long time, as you only need a small amount to do the job.  This is now my  concealer.</li>
            <li> This concealer did not conceal anything!!! I do not know what all the hype is all about because I was EXTREMELY disappointed!!! This works no better than any drug store brand but the Cover Girl Eye Rehab is the best and for a way cheaper price! I&#x27;ve finally found a concealer that works!</li>
            <li> I was really expecting more from this. I watched infomercials and many reviews and all were raving about it. It was not what I expected. This is very thick and paste like. The shade natural medium is a lot lighter than I expected as well. I am light to medium skin tone and this was very pale. There are only 4 shades to choose from and this is the most neutral shade of the 4. It does take a little more work in order to blend it out. I use my finger to blend it under my eyes and a fluffy brush to blend the edges out. This seems to work the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;As for the coverage: It is highly pigmented and definitely covers darkness under the eyes and when set with powder creases minimally. (I usually have a lot of creasing under my eyes by midday). I learned over time that it is a must to set it with a fine powder or it will crease and move around a bit. When using it to cover dark spots on my face it is ok, but not a preferred concealer due to the consistency. It will do a good job under eyes but be aware it is very thick and  if you want something that is lightweight it might mot make you happy. If you need a highly pigmented concealer this will be a good selection. The only thing I wish I read in the reviews before is how thick and paste like it is. Again if you take your time it will blend out but that is an added step for me</li>
            <li> My sister has very dark circles under her eyes and I wanted to get her something to help conceal it.  After watching YouTube I decided to get this for her.  She loved it so much that I decided to buy some for myself.  I use a tiny tiny dab.  You can barely see it when I squeeze it out but it goes on thick and spreads out evenly it when I tap it with my ring finger all under my eyes where I need it.  She made a comment the other day about her dark circles not showing up in a photo when we had a picture taken with my family.  We both highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Favorite concealer of all time, I ordered in from the US because I can&#x27;t get it in Canada and I cannot imagine living without it. It is the only concealer I have found that works for me so far since I have dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavier weight concealer with buildable coverage that stays in place once applied without setting it with powder.  It don&#x27;t find it to be drying as it doesn&#x27;t settle into the fine lines around my eyes.  I have very dark purple circles from allergies so I do use a neutralizing primer underneath this concealer.  I have yet to find a concealer that works alone, but this comes close.  I love that it&#x27;s made by a cruelty free company.</li>
            <li> The best concealer in the WORLD&amp;#34;!!! I&#x27;m a makeup artist for MAC and I&#x27;ve tried just about every big name and drug store concealer. All crease.... not this one!!  I love how much coverage it has but how natural it looks :-) hands down THE best concealer on the market!</li>
            <li> Best ever concealer, stays on does not smudge, great coverage and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who requested it. She swears by this product. She knows her products well and does her research. Her face always looks flawless and she does not have any dark circles anymore.</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily skin for a 46 year old but this is not too greasy but yet it is moisturizing and holds up well without creasing.  It is very thick so a little bit goes a long way.  You really just need one tiny dot.  Let it warm a few seconds on your skin or between your fingers to make it easier to apply.  I really like it.  It is my second tube.  The first one lasted about 7 months.</li>
            <li> i will buy this over and over again. This concealer does not look caked on your face and it doesn&#x27;t get stuck in any wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST undereye concealer. It lasts forever because you only use a tiny bit. I just re-ordered product after a long time.</li>
            <li> Covers well . A little thick to apply quickly. Goes a long way. Good color match. Need skin to be moist before applying.</li>
            <li> I learned about IT Cosmetics by watching QVC.  I do like the product and I will continue to purchase it.  As always I am looking for something that is always better.  Bye Bye Under Eye covers the dark circles and age spots.  I would recommend this product for anyone to purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews, and found it exactly as advertised. Use very little and don&#x27;t play with it a lot.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this a couple months ago and I LOVE it! I will be purchasing the full size now. I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews, but I am on this one b/c I saw multiple comments on how hard it is to spread due to it being so thick. First off the instructions say to warm it up by rubbing on back of hand. My secret is to put a LITTLE dab (a little goes a long way, especially using this method) on my finger and put it in front of the space heater for a few seconds while rubbing the concealer between my 2 index fingers. The consistency turns from thick and hard to spread to creamy and spreadable just like your foundation. Only the coverage is still awesome! I used this to hide my dark under-eye circles. The quality that makes this stand out from the rest is it doesn&#x27;t crease! Hope this review helps!!</li>
            <li> Leaves a greasy feel to the skin.  Never blends properly!  Not impressed for its high price.</li>
            <li> Its a perfect conceler i love it</li>
            <li> That is the first word I would use to describe this product.  I tried using less and mixing it with my daily moisturizer.  It was still difficult to put on and not look like you have a thick layer on your eyes.  I kept trying smaller  and smaller amounts.  Never found the perfect amount to mix with moisturizer.  It is light reflective however, definitely difficult to blend, tends to seep into fine lines and after a few hours actually makes them look deeper than they are.  Of course, all of these reviews are opinions, but my opinion is, if you&#x27;re over 45...this is not what you want to purchase.</li>
            <li> This is an effective concealer, but it&#x27;s not without some major (or at least major for me) draw backs.  It&#x27;s very thick, and because it&#x27;s waterproof it can be hard to wash off.  But by far, the biggest flaw in this product is that It&#x27;s *very* shiny.  It&#x27;s not matte at all.  The first time I used it, I put it on a little too thick, and since it&#x27;s shiny, it made my face look very strange.  I&#x27;ve learned to thin it out and cover it with plenty of powder to help mitigate the high-shine.  For me, the draw backs aren&#x27;t worth the price of this product.</li>
            <li> I have been blessed with very dark circles under my eyes and have tried countless undereye concealers. This is the first I&#x27;ve tried that actually covers all day. I have several girlfriends that are now using it. A little pricier than some but you use so little,  it lasts for months...more than pays for itself.</li>
            <li> Great color and coverage.  A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> I have been on the search for a great concealer since I was 13. This is the best I&#x27;ve ever found. It covers my horrible dark circles, caused by allergies, and a scar on my chin. I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner, but was wrong color. Ordered Neutral Medium. Received Light. Am requesting refund.</li>
            <li> The best concealer ever!  I have tried every brand going, expensive and cheap.  This not only covers but the hint of highlighting helps light reflect and your whole eye area looks brighter.</li>
            <li> This a great emollient under eye cover cream. A little bit goes a long way. It lasts all day as well.</li>
            <li> Best concealer I have used.</li>
            <li> If you have dark under eyes then this is the product for you. I got a sample of it years ago and have been using it ever since. Its something of a miracle and it lasts forever, so don&#x27;t let the price throw you off.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product, the doctor i work for told me about it because we both have HORRIBLE dark circles. This product is just amazing, it completely covers the circles and looks so natural. I honestly dont know why i didnt discover this way before!</li>
            <li> THE BEST PRODUCT EVER!</li>
            <li> I have been searching forever for a concealer like this to help camoflauge my red blotchy skin and my horrible baggy eyes. I&#x27;m absolutley in love. However it did cause me to break out on my chin, where I was using it to cover ONE zit. After using it for multiple days I started breaking out even worse. My skin isn&#x27;t usually acne prone so I was a little weirded out, but I think the product&#x27;s THICK formula is to blame. Overall I would 100% recommend, but if you do have acne prone skin, use sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS- Forgot to add..you&#x27;ll save about $20 buying it off the Ulta website vs buying it on here.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST under eye concealer I&#x27;ve ever used. I am 60 and I&#x27;ve tried them all over the years. This one does what it says it does. But it&#x27;s super important to buy the brush that goes with it. I&#x27;ve gotten my set from a shopping channel that sells this line. I&#x27;d say the brush is a MUST. It&#x27;s a two ended brush. One part you gently dab it on under your eyes and the other side of the brush you gently brush it smooth where you want the coverage. It only takes a teeny bit of product to use under both eyes. It is thick but spreads easily when you use as demonstrated on videos. If you find its too thick etc. then you used too much!  It really does last me all day long. I will never buy another product other than this one.</li>
            <li> This eye concealer is too drying and it makes you look grey underneath the eyes.</li>
            <li> product truly covers all the darkness under my eyes and I use it on my eyelids. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> I received a sample in my Ipsy bag last month and I LOVE this stuff. Rub a bit between your fingertips first to warm it and then apply and it covers everything quickly. I use a drop the size of seed bead to cover all around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have very dark circles under my eyes and it covers them so well. I wish it lasted through the day which is why i gave it 4 instead of 5 but I do recommend this to anyone with dark circles. Just carry it in your purse with you if you are going to be out of the house all day.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer!  You only have to use a tiny bit of it, but it spreads and covers like nothing else!  I have rosacea, and my red nose is very hard to cover, but this product hides my secret.  It is a very dense, color-rich product; I sometimes use it as foundation on my entire face.  I would hate to be without this concealer, so I bought two!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to mention that the color is lighter than expected, but in my case the next tome is too dark, so what I do is apply a drop of this on my hand and a tiny tiny drop of my foundation, mix it lightly with my finger and then apply - works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a product I will keep using in the future (:</li>
            <li> OK, I have shopped around all over the place, tried millions of concealers and have found this one to be the best one (so far).  It goes on very easy and conceals very well.  I have always had dark circles and have used many different concealers, some worked OK, but this one works great.  I think I have found the ONE!</li>
            <li> I have been using this concealer for 1.5 years and can NOT be without it. . . if I begin to get low I go and promptly reorder. LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> This concealer works just about as well as any other I&#x27;ve tried except it&#x27;s heavier. My dark circles still show, and I find it difficult to work with. Maybe it works for someone, but not me. Sorry I tried it. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage! Moisturizers as it covers. Does not cake or dry up. You may want to use a setting powder, because it has a dewy finish. I am a concealer junkie and this is my favorite to cover my dark circles.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my skin type. It lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t have to be reapplied. I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Although lighter than expected I love this product. It stays ON</li>
            <li> I cant tell you how amazing this product is because Im gonna throw it away. It turns out its made in china.</li>
            <li> The best under eye cream.  I have tried many and none compare to this. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have very dark circles and fine lines around my eyes. I like this product. It might be the best one I&#x27;ve found through a lot of research. You seriously only need a dab about the size of a pin head. It does crease even though I set it with a fine concealer powder, but not as much as some other concealers. I will buy it again but I have one issue with the packaging. It clearly states on the tube that it contains .28 oz. I saw in another review that there was a lot of air in the tube. The size of the tube is very deceiving as to how much product you&#x27;re getting. Comparing this tube to a .25 tube of highlighter that I have, the Bye Bye tube is maybe half full. UPDATE:  1/25/15.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium brown hair and light skin. The neutral medium concealer looks natural and not like racoon eyes. You need to apply a little primer first. I found that using a Q-tip to apply concealer works great. You get the concealer right where you want it. I then apply my tinted moisturizer to my face. Then I go back and tap the concealer out of the creases and apply Bare Minerals concealer powder in summer bisque. You may have to tap the creases a couple more times throughout the day, but it&#x27;s worth it b/c this stuff kind of dries and doesn&#x27;t stay greasy like most concealers. You might want to check the Dermastore to order. They have it for $24.00.  Hope it works for you as it does for me.</li>
            <li> This is my one &amp;#34;can&#x27;t live without&amp;#34; makeup item. Not only do I use this for eye coverage, I use it as a whole face concealer. I have red spot and adult acne. This product is excellent at covering any facial discoloration and stays on all day long. I have gone through many, many concealers in the past and this has better coverage than some of the top designer brands like MAC, Dermablend, Urban Decay, etc. it also lasts forever because very little product goes along way. And to top it off, it doesn&#x27;t trigger additional breakouts like other brands have. My skin is healthier after using this.</li>
            <li> Use small amount because it is heavy.  BUT, it does cover and stays on.</li>
            <li> I received a travel size of this product as a &#x27;gift-with-purchase&#x27;. I was instantly in love.  It is a little tube of magic!</li>
            <li> The concealer does cover very well but, it settles down into the lines and you have to smooth it out from time to time... I&#x27;m returning it and will probably not repurchase it unless I absolutely have to!</li>
            <li> This works really well. Use a little water if it comes out too thick for you.  Covers great and looks natural</li>
            <li> It actually works.  I cannot believe it. I have used probably close to 40 products trying to cover up my awesome allergy induced circles and  nothing up until this product has ever worked.&lt;br /&gt;So impressed</li>
            <li> It went on more thickly than I&#x27;d expected and didn&#x27;t cover as well. I&#x27;ll keep trying it to see whether I&#x27;m doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> I gentle sqeezed the tube, expecting the cream to funnel out .  However, the bottom seam opened up and cream just  squirted out . How can i return cream and money refund ? thank you</li>
            <li> Thought coverage would be a little better after viewing on QVC models.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve just started to get lines and a little puffiness under my eyes at 40 and this brightens me right up and takes away that tired look. Also use on a little red dot I have on the bridge of my nose and it hides it splendidly. Very happy with. Also, it&#x27;s worth noting, a little bit is all you need. This tube will probably last me six months to a year.</li>
            <li> Last&#x27;s forever and stay&#x27;s on a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd It product I have purchased. I have allergy rings around my eyes, am a babyboomer and this product works pretty well with a brush. You dont use a lot like other products and it covers very well.  A tube like this will last a long time and it is worth the money!! I have light skin not the pure white porcelain and I use the lt/med.</li>
            <li> Very little is needed to help with undereye darkness.  Stays on all day.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot that is for sure.  I have had this now for several months and still have enough left to keep me going.  My dark circles are hereditary and super dark.  I can use this and a little powder with my tinted moisturizer and good for the day.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite concealer, it stays on all day. You only need a tiny bit so the small tube last a pretty long time. The color blends really well year round.</li>
            <li> This product really does a good jog for dark circles under the eyes. I had tried several items in the drugstores, but when someone recommended this product so highly I just had to find out for myself. It really does a great job in covering and hiding all the imperfections I have under the eyes. Thanks, I love it!</li>
            <li> I am an older woman who has wrinkles and not-so-flawless skin. I use Bye Bye Under Eye as my foundation.  I learned that trick from watching &amp;#34;It&amp;#34; products on TV and I am so glad I did!!  This porduct gives me the coverage I need without being too thick nor does it look spotty or make my wrinkles look like big cracks on my face.  It gives me beautiful. natural coverage while covering my flaws.&lt;br /&gt;Will not go back to any other product and I have tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, IT!!!</li>
            <li> have never used a concealer before and tried this product. Will never try another.  This feels so good on the skin because of the vitamins in it. You will not be sorry you tried this!&lt;br /&gt;Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Super coverage, great color match.</li>
            <li> I found it to be a bit thick and challanging to apply, but it is not worth sendind back, because I can use it</li>
            <li> Works well.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Definitely works for dark circle concealer.  Tube is a generous amount, and will last a long time.  This is my second tube ordered and very pleased</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work any better than the cheap drug store brands.</li>
            <li> Full coverage concealer that zapped my deep dark under eye circles. Waterproof and easily layered under foundation and powder. No creasing and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I would give zero stars as I would NOT purchase this product.  I am going to contact the company as I think there is something wrong with it i.e. it is gritty, so needless to say it is not smooth and I got the lightest, but as I have fair complection it is too dark.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past before. I think that it is the beds under concer of all time ! It can also be used to cover up red spots and other discoloration on the face or other parts of the body . Won&#x27;t rub off and  stays put until u wash it off! It&#x27;s a keeper for me foever!</li>
            <li> this is the best under eye concealer!  A beauty must!  Does not tug when applied or leave the under eye dry</li>
            <li> Best undereye treatment for dark circles I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> It took forever for them to ship it out without even keeping you informed. It totally sucks!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give 0 star if I can pick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, at many price points, but I come back again and again to this product. It goes on easy and even, and doesn&#x27;t crease, flake or irritate. Great coverage for my relatively dark under eye circles, and it lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> I barely sleep having a teething toddler and this cream works nice to cover my bags and dark circles. its a good price too since you barely need any to cover them up. A tiny amount goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. It covers any little(or big) flaw great!! I use this as a foundation. A little bit goes a long way.A must have for anyone who wears makeup</li>
            <li> Great Product &amp; quick delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands of concealer for under my eyes. The best I have found so far was MAC. It works well but is really thick and didn&#x27;t brighten up my eyes at all. I received this IT bye bye under eye in my IPSY bag and was amazed. When I first squeezed the tube I thought it would come out liquid but it came out pretty thick. Once on, it&#x27;s great coverage and feels light! It also has a shimmery undertone, which is what you want for dark circles because it reflects the light away and doesn&#x27;t absorb it. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the most AMAZING product I have ever used. My dog scratched me across the face (I wasnt playing and it was a total accident!) And I tried green concealer and other products to cover it up but nothing worked... except that little miracle tube! Such an excellent product!</li>
            <li> good coverup, not sure its waterproof, I didn&#x27;t find that it showed my wrinkles worse.</li>
            <li> I love the product but Is it possible that it&#x27;s very old???  Mine had clumps in it.  I will buy elsewhere....</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a tube to try out and I really like the way it covers up any shadow under my eyes.  It provides good coverage without being cakey.  Doesn&#x27;t bleed or crease either.  A little goes a long way so this tube will last you a long time.</li>
