            <li>The consistency of this oil is perfect.</li>
            <li>and it softens the hairs great as well</li>
            <li>The price of Bath By Bettijo is also great</li>
            <li>Loved it the 1st time and after 6 months it was gone.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells wonderful and lasts a long time (great value)!</li>
            <li>I love this oil!  </li>
            <li>This works great and leaves your legs silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>The scent was nice, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this brand again.</li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and I suppose it feels nice.</li>
            <li>In the bottle I get a strong but pleasant almond smell from this oil.</li>
            <li>Really great stuff and better than most that cost much more.  </li>
            <li>It has the most amazing smell and</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more lemon scented</li>
            <li>which I find refreshing, but this scent was a turnoff for me.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The two that have already tried it, love the product.  </li>
            <li>That is Ok since it lubes well.</li>
            <li>The problem I have is that since I shave my head AND beard, I find having to use more than say the Pacific Shaving Oil.</li>
            <li>But...the Pacific Shaving Oil costs much more.</li>
            <li>Shaving oil and Gillette create the smoothest, most comfortable and best shave possible.</li>
            <li>They shipped all over the place as requested and everything arrived just fine.  </li>
            <li>Great oil especially for the price</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and makes shaving easier.  </li>
            <li>I only use this oil for leg shaving (I’m a cyclist) and for that it works great.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the smell did not linger on my skin once out of the shower</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ingredients - natural and good</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>We, my wife and I, enjoyed the product so much we ordered a bottle for each of our children to try.  </li>
            <li>For the price this is just about as effective as the eShave as far as protection</li>
            <li>(Vitamin E, aloe, etc)&lt;br /&gt;Price - not bad</li>
            <li>I would surely buy some more in the future.</li>
            <li>and I really do like the lightly scented Lemon Almond scent.  </li>
            <li>Also, it ain&#x27;t cheap, and it goes by fast.</li>
            <li>my legs feel so soft and smooth after I shave!  </li>
            <li>and this (just right).</li>
            <li>It’s much less pleasant during the shaving process though.  </li>
            <li>Have been through multiple brands of shaving oils over the last few years in search of the best oil for the dollar ... most of them can get quite pricey.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this, I think it is pricey for the size (which is why I am giving it 3 stars), and I have since switched to just using Aloe with the same results...</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a bit more than I can afford on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>A few drops stay on the leg and insure a smooth, easy, and cut-free shave.</li>
            <li>much cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li>really</li>
            <li>I also did not think it made much of a difference in how my skin felt after shaving.</li>
            <li>The oil is really oily.</li>
            <li>I use this on my whole face, including my goatee</li>
            <li>This works very well for me, by reducing my razor burn and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>But, it does not add much to the shave.</li>
            <li>It may give you a sense of added luxury and comfort, but it really does not do much.</li>
            <li>so it feels nice after the shave but still a bit heavy.</li>
            <li>Better than any other oil I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The product is fine quality, but not very useful.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the wet shave it as much about economy as it is luxury, so no need to spend more money on a superfluous item such as this.</li>
            <li>The scent is not strong but is noticeable for awhile and the smoothness lasts a good long time.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a strong marzipan, but most critically, the consistency is not great for shaving.</li>
            <li>Other brands have a higher viscosity and really cling to the beard.</li>
            <li>Since using this, I&#x27;ve had far fewer nicks, cuts and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>A few drops provide enough lubrication for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended I try this oil when shaving, especially the bikini area, because of the soft feel afterwards!  </li>
            <li>I do have a very sensitive neck when shaved and this prevents any irritation that I would normally get just as well as any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I tried different applications--direct application to the razor, direct application to the face, mixing it with my cream, etc.</li>
            <li>Just get your shaving area wet, put a dime-sized drop in your hand and rub it onto the shaving area, then shave as normal (using your shave gel/foam).  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the smell of this, I think it is pricey for the size (which is why I am giving it 3 stars), and I have since switched to just using Aloe with the same results...much cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> I use this before lathering up my face with my DE razor.  It drastically improves the condition of my face after a shave.  Less cuts and harsh irritated areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Smell - subtle&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients - natural and good (Vitamin E, aloe, etc)&lt;br /&gt;Price - not bad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Small size :(&lt;br /&gt;Nothing really</li>
            <li> This is my second order. Loved it the 1st time and after 6 months it was gone. Great oil especially for the price</li>
            <li> A friend recommended I try this oil when shaving, especially the bikini area, because of the soft feel afterwards!  I thought it was a bit small and expensive at first...but it&#x27;s worth every penny!  You only need a dime sized drop...and my bottle has lasted over 6 months!  It leaves a light layer of moisturizing oils, even after the shower, that helps to keep your skin soft, and it seems to eliminate the terrible \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; effect afterwards!  I don&#x27;t shave without it anymore!</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a recommendation and I found it disappointing. The biggest negative was the overpowering almond aroma. I thought it would be more lemon scented which I find refreshing, but this scent was a turnoff for me. I also did not think it made much of a difference in how my skin felt after shaving.</li>
            <li> Simply said.... Shaving oil and Gillette create the smoothest, most comfortable and best shave possible.</li>
            <li> This oil is a bit thick compared to some others I&#x27;ve used. I have dry skin so it feels nice after the shave but still a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> This oil was too thin. Other brands have a higher viscosity and really cling to the beard. this ran out of my hand and didn&#x27;t provide the same level of protection. The scent was nice, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this brand again.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  It has the most amazing smell and my legs feel so soft and smooth after I shave!  I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to soap again.  I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> This product has converted me to shaving oils.  Shaving creams always dried out my skin, but this leaves my legs soft and moisturized.  It smells fantastic and makes shaving easier.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This works great and leaves your legs silky smooth.  Plus it smells wonderful and lasts a long time (great value)!</li>
            <li> We, my wife and I, enjoyed the product so much we ordered a bottle for each of our children to try.  They shipped all over the place as requested and everything arrived just fine.  The two that have already tried it, love the product.  Once you use it you&#x27;ll hate going back to regular shaving lotion or gel.</li>
            <li> This shaving oil is so simple to use. Just get your shaving area wet, put a dime-sized drop in your hand and rub it onto the shaving area, then shave as normal (using your shave gel/foam).  Since using this, I&#x27;ve had far fewer nicks, cuts and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> The oil is really oily. That is Ok since it lubes well. The problem I have is that since I shave my head AND beard, I find having to use more than say the Pacific Shaving Oil. But...the Pacific Shaving Oil costs much more.</li>
            <li> I get the best, closest shave with this oil. Better than any other oil I have ever used. The blade lasts longer too.</li>
            <li> Nice scent.A few drops provide enough lubrication for a smooth shave. I would surely buy some more in the future.</li>
            <li> Have been through multiple brands of shaving oils over the last few years in search of the best oil for the dollar ... most of them can get quite pricey.  I still prefer the eShave Verbena Lime, but @ $20 per bottle that&#x27;s a bit more than I can afford on a regular basis.  For the price this is just about as effective as the eShave as far as protection and I really do like the lightly scented Lemon Almond scent.  I use this on my whole face, including my goatee and it softens the hairs great as well, my wife loves the softness it provides.  The scent is not strong but is noticeable for awhile and the smoothness lasts a good long time.  I do have a very sensitive neck when shaved and this prevents any irritation that I would normally get just as well as any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have used similar products before.  This works very well for me, by reducing my razor burn and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this oil is perfect. It’s not so oily that it gunks up my razor but not so thin that I have to use a lot of it. I only use this oil for leg shaving (I’m a cyclist) and for that it works great. A few drops stay on the leg and insure a smooth, easy, and cut-free shave. In the bottle I get a strong but pleasant almond smell from this oil. It’s much less pleasant during the shaving process though.  While shaving I get a slight whiff of rancid almond/lemon. Fortunately, the smell did not linger on my skin once out of the shower so it’s not a concern. I’ve been experimenting with various shaving oils and so far I’ve tried Shave Secret (too thick), Pacific Shaving Company (too thin), Jack Black (too pricey), King of Shaves Alpha Formula (almost as good as Bath by Bettijo) and this (just right). The price of Bath By Bettijo is also great so I’m be using this from now on.</li>
            <li> A little on the thin side, heavy lemon &amp; almond scent that almost seems manufactured.</li>
            <li> Really great stuff and better than most that cost much more.  Only the e-shave white tea has beat this one out but for the cost I will still keep this one around and trade up turns.</li>
            <li> The product is fine quality, but not very useful. It smells nice, and I suppose it feels nice. But, it does not add much to the shave. I tried different applications--direct application to the razor, direct application to the face, mixing it with my cream, etc. It may give you a sense of added luxury and comfort, but it really does not do much. I have been going without it for the past few months, and cannot tell a difference. Then again, maybe that is because I use proper wet shave technique. May if you shave with the canned goop and do not properly prep your face, this stuff will enhance your shave. But, in that case, you are just sticking a bandaid on an open wound. If you get your wet shave technique down, you should not require this product. In my opinion, the wet shave it as much about economy as it is luxury, so no need to spend more money on a superfluous item such as this. Also, it ain&#x27;t cheap, and it goes by fast.</li>
            <li> The scent is a strong marzipan, but most critically, the consistency is not great for shaving. The oil is somewhat thin and does not great lubrication qualities. Im a bit sorry I chose this one soley due to the low performance.</li>
