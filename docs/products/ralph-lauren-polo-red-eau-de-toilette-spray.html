            <li>Best bang for this price, this scent is completely amazing and smells fresh and fruity but not like heyyyyyyyy fruity.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need many spritzes, as it is a very potent and pleasant scent.</li>

            <li>Smell amazing on my husband</li>
            <li>This cologne smells amazing, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Amazing service.</li>
            <li>in all, a good buy, but it would have gotten 4 stars if the parts were more sturdy.</li>
            <li>Not offensive and close is when its noticed and liked in comment.</li>
            <li>I had tested a sample of this cologne and it was nice.</li>
            <li>but can also work for a nice occasion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the kind of guy to douse myself in cologne</li>
            <li>I bought this cologne because my girlfriend mentioned that she thought it smelled nice.</li>
            <li>My son is thrilled with the cologne.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the absolute best scents out there period!</li>
            <li>I can still use the pump, but it is kind of a pain.</li>
            <li>Transaction was quick and easy with a great price!</li>
            <li>Smells great, comes in all original packaging like I saw at the mall, you won&#x27;t be dissappointed.</li>
            <li>It STILL smelled strongly of the cologne!  </li>
            <li>Also was very cheap.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>I reach for this more days than not.</li>
            <li>it smells great boyfriend loved it as a present!</li>
            <li>They love it also.  </li>
            <li>Arrived without the spray top.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments from using it.</li>
            <li>but once it settles, the scent changes and I found that it got better the more it sat on my skin.</li>
            <li>The more I marinated in it, the better the scent became.</li>
            <li>The scent was even working its magic on me as I kept smelling my wrists throughout most of the day :-)  </li>
            <li>B000GHYTUY Rochas Man]] have become my favorite scents (for now).</li>
            <li>smells so many.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it lasted for more than an hour.</li>
            <li>Loves this much better</li>
            <li>this is my husband&#x27;s favorite aroma.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that most women tend to like cologne&#x27;s with this type of smell</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, mine was bought at a reputable store.</li>
            <li>This was the girlfriends favorite ouf of the bunch.</li>
            <li>Love this cologne, had to get it, saw it in my store (Macy&#x27;s)</li>
            <li>Lasts longer than most others that i have tried</li>
            <li>I went ahead and ordered 6 more from this.</li>
            <li>I hope all will be from the improved concentration version of the perfume :)</li>
            <li>If someone is close to you, they will be able to tell.  </li>
            <li>If you walk by someone, they will be able to tell.  </li>
            <li>This scent seems to smell better as the day goes on as well.  </li>
            <li>I love my man wearing this.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>me and my love this smell</li>
            <li>I think anyone would love to use it..</li>
            <li>Tried Polo Red on a whim and an excellent whim it was.  </li>
            <li>Son loves it and a lot better price than at mall.</li>
            <li>I picked up this cologne because it was a very unique smell (and I had a gift card).</li>
            <li>more importantly my girlfriend LOVES it.</li>
            <li>This cologne is just as I expected -- wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Polo Red smells incredible.</li>
            <li>If you get more than three to four hours before this wears off consider yourself fortunate.</li>
            <li>but this one really smells good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, pricing was great (cheaper than duty free) ... it is my new stink for 2014.</li>
            <li>Luckily we were able to find another spray top to work.</li>
            <li>I couldâ€™ve easily interchanged them and not noticed.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wanting a scent that you can easily smell on yourself, this might not be for you.  </li>
            <li>However, it isn&#x27;t nearly as strong as we&#x27;ve come to expect from Polo scents.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and would have given it five stars if it didn&#x27;t dissipate so quick.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and lasts all day</li>
            <li>Smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>cologne has a light and sweeter scent to it</li>
            <li>Light scent, not overbearing.  </li>
            <li>Great for daily use or dressing up.  </li>
            <li>Polo Red is a great scent.  </li>
            <li>Everyone has loved the smell so far.</li>
            <li>Such a great and unique smell.</li>
            <li>I love it very much.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff, but I don&#x27;t LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Searching for the spray top was not in my timetable while getting ready for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cologne smells so light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Like sweet cinnamon.</li>
            <li>It settles into a nice, mature scent.</li>
            <li>im told how good i smell so that should be enough proof.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and in great shape - this is an original bottle - not an imitation.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers said it wears off quickly, but I haven&#x27;t found that.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li>I am writing this review specifically to address the reviewers who say this wears off too quickly.  </li>
            <li>I applied 3 quick squirts to my neck and collar.  </li>
            <li>That might be why people are saying the scent fades away or dissipates rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even believe how quickly this scent fades.</li>
            <li>Thank you for delivering so quickly.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments from women of different ages who tell me they love the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li>This is my new fragrance all the ladies love it no matter the age.</li>
            <li>This scent is rich, citrusy at first</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d put it in my top 5 so far.</li>
            <li>The smell is the same, and the design of the container is also eye catching.</li>
            <li>the heart beat of America Smell of success</li>
            <li>/ matter&lt;br /&gt;Dressing for success 2015</li>
            <li>I definitely worth a whiff.</li>
            <li>Of all the cologne&#x27;s I&#x27;ve worn, this has been my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite BY FAR.</li>
            <li>These two bottles were much more concentrated than what I had purchased before directly form the RL site.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>love the initial smell, and it&#x27;s extremely unique......</li>
            <li>Other than that a good product.</li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>My husband puts it on right after showering---almost before he leaves the house</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about that, but right now it&#x27;s my calohne of choice.</li>
            <li>Not over powering, just right.  </li>
            <li>I love the way Polo Red smells, but it wears off so quickly that it&#x27;ll be gone by the time you arrive at your destination.  </li>
            <li>A nice citrus &amp; woodsy scent, that is light &amp; not overpowering &amp; has gotten me quite a few compliments.</li>
            <li>Came super fast.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and it lasts longer than expected.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend absolutely loves it, so that gives it a boost!</li>
            <li>My friend loves it, he said it smells red:-)</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I sprayed a bit on my wrists and neck.</li>
            <li>A bit over-powering at first.</li>
            <li>My Dad really likes it!</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it lasts a long time worth the money</li>
            <li>so I would recommend it for more of the younger generation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cologne will last 4-6 hours like most colognes.</li>
            <li>So fellas if no one is wearing this at your job be the first one to put it on.</li>
            <li>in the stores smells great but doesn&#x27;t last for too long maybe 4 hours or so</li>
            <li>This is the most different Polo fragrance I&#x27;ve ever worn.  </li>
            <li>Really like the scent!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Also wood,sage and coffee really make this a manly,exciting,seductive and powerful smell.</li>
            <li>By the time I got to my desk in my office, the scent was already working its bewitching spell on a few individuals</li>
            <li>Great smell but does not last very long.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice clean scent for everyday wear!</li>
            <li>For me, a subtle scent works great.  </li>
            <li>I received this scent as a gift from a good friend for Christmas and I must say that Polo Red and Polo Blue are my favorites from the Polo Cologne series.</li>
            <li>I laughed when I read that people said it only lasted for 15 minutes because it is simply a lie.</li>
            <li>It goes without saying the POLO Red has been loved by all since it was launched recently.</li>
            <li>I will buy the same product from a real store and see if it is any better.</li>
            <li>+ years ago--particularly loved the long lasting ability of the scent.  </li>
            <li>Smell strong initially.</li>
            <li>Good for long lasting  affect but nothing fancy like Versace Pour home</li>
            <li>it smells good but doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and was delivered earlier than expected which was a good surprise.</li>
            <li>I bought this immediately after smelling it; great initial citrus and fruity scent, mellows after a few minutes with woodsy undertones.  </li>
            <li>So much so that I didn&#x27;t even need to use any today.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>My son really wanted this.  </li>
            <li>kinda pricey but much cheaper on here then</li>
            <li>My gf wants me to where it for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Thanks...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This is fast speed sexy,seductive smell.  </li>
            <li>The aroma lasts all day for me, I don&#x27;t agree with the reviewers who say it fades fast.</li>
            <li>unlike many other colognes it didn&#x27;t give me a headache.  </li>
            <li>After using this cologne for about two weeks and continuing to feel the same way as I felt when I wrote my original review something happened that made me feel I needed to update my review.  </li>
            <li>Well 13 hours after applying Polo Red, and working a full shift, I can still readily smell the scent.</li>
            <li>Christmas stocking present, price was right!</li>
            <li>First of all I will say that I have actually gone from two spritzes to one because this cologne is a little too strong (not a bad thing).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if those stating the scent wears off quickly have olfactory issues or they got counterfeit Red</li>
            <li>He normally wears Brut..</li>
            <li>That had about a 5 foot projection and longevity after nearly a full day, this lasts as long as it takes to walk from the bathroom to the kitchen for a cup of coffee before heading to work.  </li>
            <li>I guess Ralph Lauren found the olfactory oasis because Polo Red is right there.</li>
            <li>, I sorta got used to the new smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so upset about this, as I was hoping to make this my new signature scent.  </li>
            <li>the smells is nice its not as powerful as other fragrances ive worn in the past  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fussy about my cologne, so that being said I have no complaints about polo red.</li>
            <li>I have many favorites and the day, my mood usually dictates what I put on however</li>
            <li>Have been a big Polo fan for years, starting with the original Polo for my dad</li>
            <li>I have a LOT of colognes and this was something very different from my other colognes, so I thought it&#x27;d be an interesting purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently bought polo red for a wedding, I quickly found this isnâ€™t the scent for me.</li>
            <li>a bit smaller than expected but its fine</li>
            <li>Yep, scent is completely gone off my skin.  </li>
            <li>Showered with fragrance-free body wash, fragrance-free lotion, applied both cologne and body spray, but it&#x27;s completely gone by the time I get to work.  </li>
            <li>A 19 year old&#x27;s delight.  </li>
            <li>The only issue people had with it was that the smell disappeared fast.</li>
            <li>However, I think RL has fixed this.</li>
            <li>Polo Red is a spicy goodness with ingredients smelling like fresh cut red grapefruit and tangy lemon.</li>
            <li>the original polo, green bottle?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a big fan of Polo Black for a longtime now, but polo red may be a contender for my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I had the exact opposite experience with my Polo - Red.</li>
            <li>what its worth; I have been a long time user of D&amp;G Lite Blue -</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new cologne and bought this one and two others after testing them at a local mall.</li>
            <li>Peeved I spent $78 for the large bottle and another $20 for spray.&lt;br /&gt;Remember</li>
            <li>Try spraying it on your clothes if you want it to last all day but another spray in the early afternoon</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll go back to my old standby summer scent.  </li>
            <li>Subtle and sweet.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Way better than the sample in the magazines and that smells good!</li>
            <li> My partners&#x27; favorite cologne, smells good!</li>
            <li> Best bang for this price, this scent is completely amazing and smells fresh and fruity but not like heyyyyyyyy fruity.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need many spritzes, as it is a very potent and pleasant scent.</li>

            <li> Smell amazing on my husband</li>
            <li> This cologne smells amazing, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Amazing service.</li>
            <li> in all, a good buy, but it would have gotten 4 stars if the parts were more sturdy.</li>
            <li> Not offensive and close is when its noticed and liked in comment.</li>
            <li> I had tested a sample of this cologne and it was nice.</li>
            <li> but can also work for a nice occasion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the kind of guy to douse myself in cologne</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne because my girlfriend mentioned that she thought it smelled nice.</li>
            <li> My son is thrilled with the cologne.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the absolute best scents out there period!</li>
            <li> I can still use the pump, but it is kind of a pain.</li>
            <li> Transaction was quick and easy with a great price!</li>
            <li> Smells great, comes in all original packaging like I saw at the mall, you won&#x27;t be dissappointed.</li>
            <li> It STILL smelled strongly of the cologne!  </li>
            <li> Also was very cheap.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I reach for this more days than not.</li>
            <li> it smells great boyfriend loved it as a present!</li>
            <li> They love it also.  </li>
            <li> Arrived without the spray top.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments from using it.</li>
            <li> but once it settles, the scent changes and I found that it got better the more it sat on my skin.</li>
            <li> The more I marinated in it, the better the scent became.</li>
            <li> The scent was even working its magic on me as I kept smelling my wrists throughout most of the day :-)  </li>
            <li> B000GHYTUY Rochas Man]] have become my favorite scents (for now).</li>
            <li> smells so many.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it lasted for more than an hour.</li>
            <li> Loves this much better</li>
            <li> this is my husband&#x27;s favorite aroma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that most women tend to like cologne&#x27;s with this type of smell</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, mine was bought at a reputable store.</li>
            <li> This was the girlfriends favorite ouf of the bunch.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne, had to get it, saw it in my store (Macy&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> Lasts longer than most others that i have tried</li>
            <li> I went ahead and ordered 6 more from this.</li>
            <li> I hope all will be from the improved concentration version of the perfume :)</li>
            <li> If someone is close to you, they will be able to tell.  </li>
            <li> If you walk by someone, they will be able to tell.  </li>
            <li> This scent seems to smell better as the day goes on as well.  </li>
            <li> I love my man wearing this.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> me and my love this smell</li>
            <li> I think anyone would love to use it..</li>
            <li> Tried Polo Red on a whim and an excellent whim it was.  </li>
            <li> Son loves it and a lot better price than at mall.</li>
            <li> I picked up this cologne because it was a very unique smell (and I had a gift card).</li>
            <li> more importantly my girlfriend LOVES it.</li>
            <li> This cologne is just as I expected -- wonderful!  </li>
            <li> Polo Red smells incredible.</li>
            <li> If you get more than three to four hours before this wears off consider yourself fortunate.</li>
            <li> but this one really smells good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, pricing was great (cheaper than duty free) ... it is my new stink for 2014.</li>
            <li> Luckily we were able to find another spray top to work.</li>
            <li> I couldâ€™ve easily interchanged them and not noticed.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wanting a scent that you can easily smell on yourself, this might not be for you.  </li>
            <li> However, it isn&#x27;t nearly as strong as we&#x27;ve come to expect from Polo scents.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and would have given it five stars if it didn&#x27;t dissipate so quick.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and lasts all day</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> cologne has a light and sweeter scent to it</li>
            <li> Light scent, not overbearing.  </li>
            <li> Great for daily use or dressing up.  </li>
            <li> Polo Red is a great scent.  </li>
            <li> Everyone has loved the smell so far.</li>
            <li> Such a great and unique smell.</li>
            <li> I love it very much.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, but I don&#x27;t LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Searching for the spray top was not in my timetable while getting ready for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cologne smells so light and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Like sweet cinnamon.</li>
            <li> It settles into a nice, mature scent.</li>
            <li> im told how good i smell so that should be enough proof.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in great shape - this is an original bottle - not an imitation.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers said it wears off quickly, but I haven&#x27;t found that.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review specifically to address the reviewers who say this wears off too quickly.  </li>
            <li> I applied 3 quick squirts to my neck and collar.  </li>
            <li> That might be why people are saying the scent fades away or dissipates rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even believe how quickly this scent fades.</li>
            <li> Thank you for delivering so quickly.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments from women of different ages who tell me they love the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li> This is my new fragrance all the ladies love it no matter the age.</li>
            <li> This scent is rich, citrusy at first</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d put it in my top 5 so far.</li>
            <li> The smell is the same, and the design of the container is also eye catching.</li>
            <li> the heart beat of America Smell of success</li>
            <li> / matter&lt;br /&gt;Dressing for success 2015</li>
            <li> I definitely worth a whiff.</li>
            <li> Of all the cologne&#x27;s I&#x27;ve worn, this has been my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite BY FAR.</li>
            <li> These two bottles were much more concentrated than what I had purchased before directly form the RL site.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> love the initial smell, and it&#x27;s extremely unique......</li>
            <li> Other than that a good product.</li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> My husband puts it on right after showering---almost before he leaves the house</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about that, but right now it&#x27;s my calohne of choice.</li>
            <li> Not over powering, just right.  </li>
            <li> I love the way Polo Red smells, but it wears off so quickly that it&#x27;ll be gone by the time you arrive at your destination.  </li>
            <li> A nice citrus &amp; woodsy scent, that is light &amp; not overpowering &amp; has gotten me quite a few compliments.</li>
            <li> Came super fast.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and it lasts longer than expected.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend absolutely loves it, so that gives it a boost!</li>
            <li> My friend loves it, he said it smells red:-)</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I sprayed a bit on my wrists and neck.</li>
            <li> A bit over-powering at first.</li>
            <li> My Dad really likes it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it lasts a long time worth the money</li>
            <li> so I would recommend it for more of the younger generation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cologne will last 4-6 hours like most colognes.</li>
            <li> So fellas if no one is wearing this at your job be the first one to put it on.</li>
            <li> in the stores smells great but doesn&#x27;t last for too long maybe 4 hours or so</li>
            <li> This is the most different Polo fragrance I&#x27;ve ever worn.  </li>
            <li> Really like the scent!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Also wood,sage and coffee really make this a manly,exciting,seductive and powerful smell.</li>
            <li> By the time I got to my desk in my office, the scent was already working its bewitching spell on a few individuals</li>
            <li> Great smell but does not last very long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice clean scent for everyday wear!</li>
            <li> For me, a subtle scent works great.  </li>
            <li> I received this scent as a gift from a good friend for Christmas and I must say that Polo Red and Polo Blue are my favorites from the Polo Cologne series.</li>
            <li> I laughed when I read that people said it only lasted for 15 minutes because it is simply a lie.</li>
            <li> It goes without saying the POLO Red has been loved by all since it was launched recently.</li>
            <li> I will buy the same product from a real store and see if it is any better.</li>
            <li> + years ago--particularly loved the long lasting ability of the scent.  </li>
            <li> Smell strong initially.</li>
            <li> Good for long lasting  affect but nothing fancy like Versace Pour home</li>
            <li> it smells good but doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and was delivered earlier than expected which was a good surprise.</li>
            <li> I bought this immediately after smelling it; great initial citrus and fruity scent, mellows after a few minutes with woodsy undertones.  </li>
            <li> So much so that I didn&#x27;t even need to use any today.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> My son really wanted this.  </li>
            <li> kinda pricey but much cheaper on here then</li>
            <li> My gf wants me to where it for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Thanks...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is fast speed sexy,seductive smell.  </li>
            <li> The aroma lasts all day for me, I don&#x27;t agree with the reviewers who say it fades fast.</li>
            <li> unlike many other colognes it didn&#x27;t give me a headache.  </li>
            <li> After using this cologne for about two weeks and continuing to feel the same way as I felt when I wrote my original review something happened that made me feel I needed to update my review.  </li>
            <li> Well 13 hours after applying Polo Red, and working a full shift, I can still readily smell the scent.</li>
            <li> Christmas stocking present, price was right!</li>
            <li> First of all I will say that I have actually gone from two spritzes to one because this cologne is a little too strong (not a bad thing).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if those stating the scent wears off quickly have olfactory issues or they got counterfeit Red</li>
            <li> He normally wears Brut..</li>
            <li> That had about a 5 foot projection and longevity after nearly a full day, this lasts as long as it takes to walk from the bathroom to the kitchen for a cup of coffee before heading to work.  </li>
            <li> I guess Ralph Lauren found the olfactory oasis because Polo Red is right there.</li>
            <li> , I sorta got used to the new smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so upset about this, as I was hoping to make this my new signature scent.  </li>
            <li> the smells is nice its not as powerful as other fragrances ive worn in the past  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fussy about my cologne, so that being said I have no complaints about polo red.</li>
            <li> I have many favorites and the day, my mood usually dictates what I put on however</li>
            <li> Have been a big Polo fan for years, starting with the original Polo for my dad</li>
            <li> I have a LOT of colognes and this was something very different from my other colognes, so I thought it&#x27;d be an interesting purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently bought polo red for a wedding, I quickly found this isnâ€™t the scent for me.</li>
            <li> a bit smaller than expected but its fine</li>
            <li> Yep, scent is completely gone off my skin.  </li>
            <li> Showered with fragrance-free body wash, fragrance-free lotion, applied both cologne and body spray, but it&#x27;s completely gone by the time I get to work.  </li>
            <li> A 19 year old&#x27;s delight.  </li>
            <li> The only issue people had with it was that the smell disappeared fast.</li>
            <li> However, I think RL has fixed this.</li>
            <li> Polo Red is a spicy goodness with ingredients smelling like fresh cut red grapefruit and tangy lemon.</li>
            <li> the original polo, green bottle?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of Polo Black for a longtime now, but polo red may be a contender for my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I had the exact opposite experience with my Polo - Red.</li>
            <li> what its worth; I have been a long time user of D&amp;G Lite Blue -</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new cologne and bought this one and two others after testing them at a local mall.</li>
            <li> Peeved I spent $78 for the large bottle and another $20 for spray.&lt;br /&gt;Remember</li>
            <li> Try spraying it on your clothes if you want it to last all day but another spray in the early afternoon</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll go back to my old standby summer scent.  </li>
            <li> Subtle and sweet.</li>
            <li> The scent does not last that long.</li>
            <li> I passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised to read some of the reviews that state the scent (on them) does not last long - gone within an hour or less.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is hard to describe, it&#x27;s not overbearing at all, just be sure to use very little!</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews say that it faded quickly, but I have not experienced that one bit.</li>
            <li> One son wears Polo Blue and now the other wears Polo Red.</li>
            <li> It sat in my travel kit with the other 2 testers I keep refilled with D&amp;GLB until I forgot to refill and was left with only this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> But yea I would recommend this to wear when it&#x27;s not super cold or super hot .</li>
            <li> Irrespective of how much I spray, people can hardly smell it.</li>
            <li> as long your body chemistry works with the scent.</li>
            <li> This includes a long list of colognes like, Acqua Di Gio, Abercrombie and Fitch&#x27;s Fierce and even Sex Panther.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and Wow everyday i wear this</li>
            <li> It did not last as long as other RL fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a shame that it does not last as long as some other colognes that will last half a day.</li>
            <li> The Polo Red is a very pleasing fragrance, unfortunately, it does not last long.  </li>
            <li> not sure if it is the nature of the product or is it just the stock i got from amazon is old but some of the previous ralph lauren parfumes i got from macy&#x27;s and ralph lauren store were long lasting than this one.</li>
            <li> I use Polo Blue, Black Sport and others and like them all.</li>
            <li> Other people can smell it on me \\&quot;slightly\\&quot; still after a 30 minutes, but after an hour or two there&#x27;s nearly no trace.</li>
            <li> It is nice for anytime, dressing up or going out casual!!  </li>
            <li> My only current negative thought...</li>
            <li> but it should last you for a few months</li>
            <li> After reading these reviews I was worried it would be a waste of money for me to buy Polo Red.</li>
            <li> minus 1 star.</li>
            <li> We cautioned a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> other polo</li>
            <li> Like the smell, duh!!&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad value to make you guys smell a little better.</li>
            <li> Then after about a half hour or so, gone.  </li>
            <li> so I cannot compare it to a previous purchase</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle, but is definitely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Go with Armani, or Polo Black.  </li>
            <li> Buy some today and be less smelly.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has a little bit of self worth or dignity should NOT waste their mothers hard earned money on this crap.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone looking to change up their scent a little.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I was always a Polo (green bottle) man since it&#x27;s inception.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not a strong projection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say I can&#x27;t imagine what everyone is talking about saying it doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> but I found the fragrance extremely weak and unlike other Polo colognes.</li>
            <li> Gift for my son who is hard to buy for.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, it&#x27;s a common problem with polo products.</li>
            <li> never liked ralph lauren  </li>
            <li> Like I said, this scent is subtle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad it doesn&#x27;t last longer.</li>
            <li> Either way, it&#x27;s a waste of $50 for me :(</li>
            <li> The Polo series cologne are a bit on the expensive side</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great cologne for the price, and not too flashy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s either the perfume itself is like this or something wrong with the way Amazon is sending it.</li>
            <li> packaging look like fake</li>
            <li> its casual</li>
            <li> Could be used for a casual night out or day to day.</li>
            <li> i got a bad batch ??</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this stuff, but I don&#x27;t LOVE it. I&#x27;m pretty fussy about my cologne, so that being said I have no complaints about polo red. The longevity isn&#x27;t great, but that&#x27;s what you get with an EDT. Smells very good and I&#x27;d put it in my top 5 so far. My girlfriend absolutely loves it, so that gives it a boost!</li>
            <li> I asked someone what they were wearing and this was their answer.  Now I get tons of compliments, &amp;#34;Ohh you smell good!&amp;#34;  Love it!</li>
            <li> I smelled a sample of this in GQ&#x27;s magazine, and instantly had to have it. The smell is the same, and the design of the container is also eye catching. I reach for this more days than not. My complaints are that the product&#x27;s spray tip seems rather flimsy, and even has popped off when I opened the cap 3 or 4 times. Searching for the spray top was not in my timetable while getting ready for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good buy, but it would have gotten 4 stars if the parts were more sturdy.</li>
            <li> it smells great boyfriend loved it as a present!</li>
            <li> Great scent. Subtle and sweet.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne!!! Bought two as gifts for my partner and father.  They love it also.  And once again another purchase from amazon at a great price!!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Way better than the sample in the magazines and that smells good!</li>
            <li> This smells so good! I bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it too</li>
            <li> Mywife loves it, that&#x27;s all that counts!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re gonna like the way you smell, I gurantee it</li>
            <li> its smell so good i got it yesterday</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and lasts all day</li>
            <li> This cologne smells so light and fresh.  Some reviewers said it wears off quickly, but I haven&#x27;t found that.</li>
            <li> Arrived without the spray top. Luckily we were able to find another spray top to work.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. Buy it.</li>

            <li> I bought it as a gift. My friend loves it, he said it smells red:-)</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction. No issues.</li>
            <li> This is personal and you will have to try for yourself. I like the woodsy spice air it creates. Not offensive and close is when its noticed and liked in comment.</li>
            <li> I had tested a sample of this cologne and it was nice. But when I received the actual product in a bottle, it exceeded my expectations. You don&#x27;t need many spritzes, as it is a very potent and pleasant scent. I get many compliments from using it. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I received this scent as a gift from a good friend for Christmas and I must say that Polo Red and Polo Blue are my favorites from the Polo Cologne series. This scent is rich, citrusy at first but once it settles, the scent changes and I found that it got better the more it sat on my skin. The first time I used it, I sprayed a bit on my wrists and neck. A bit over-powering at first. By the time I got to my desk in my office, the scent was already working its bewitching spell on a few individuals I passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised to read some of the reviews that state the scent (on them) does not last long - gone within an hour or less. I had the exact opposite experience with my Polo - Red. The more I marinated in it, the better the scent became. The scent was even working its magic on me as I kept smelling my wrists throughout most of the day :-)  Three hours after spraying it on myself, my wrists and neck were as aromatic as ever. Dunno. Maybe it&#x27;s just my body chemistry. Not everyone will have the same reaction.  I recommend this to anyone wanting to expand their horizons with their cologne fragrances. I have many favorites and the day, my mood usually dictates what I put on however this one, along with [[ASIN:B000C219QA Polo Blue]] and [[ASIN:B000GHYTUY Rochas Man]] have become my favorite scents (for now). The Polo series cologne are a bit on the expensive side but it should last you for a few months as long your body chemistry works with the scent. Recommended and good luck.</li>
            <li> Great product, smooth transaction</li>
            <li> smells so many.  I am a big fan of the polo house, so when I found out there was a scent I wanted to smell it.  it smells powdery and woodsy.  its casual but can also work for a nice occasion.  its definitely a fall scent.  overall if you like polo this I definitely worth a whiff.</li>
            <li> Smell amazing on my husband</li>
            <li> Great scent, lasts through the day - good price too!</li>
            <li> I love the way Polo Red smells, but it wears off so quickly that it&#x27;ll be gone by the time you arrive at your destination.  If you plan on wearing this to work, you&#x27;ll have to reapply it every hour or so.  Who has time for that?  What a shame.  It&#x27;s a very nice fragrance, and unlike many other colognes it didn&#x27;t give me a headache.  I just wish it lasted for more than an hour.</li>
            <li> My Dad really likes it! He normally wears Brut..lol Not any more !! Loves this much better</li>
            <li> So for the the best of polo I love the smell and it lasts a long time worth the money</li>
            <li> this is my husband&#x27;s favorite aroma.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it. The fragrance is hard to describe, it&#x27;s not overbearing at all, just be sure to use very little!</li>
            <li> I bought this as gift for my husband he really loved the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in great shape - this is an original bottle - not an imitation. Love the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I have not given it as a gift yet or it hasnt been used yet, but it is low stocked reason is it is one of the #1 colgnes out there right. it smells good that i have smelled from samples.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of Polo Black for a longtime now, but polo red may be a contender for my favorite scent. A nice citrus &amp; woodsy scent, that is light &amp; not overpowering &amp; has gotten me quite a few compliments.</li>
            <li> Great product, but pricey.</li>
            <li> Mmmm I got this for my boyfriend and I loooove smelling it!</li>
            <li> Of all the cologne&#x27;s I&#x27;ve worn, this has been my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite BY FAR. This includes a long list of colognes like, Acqua Di Gio, Abercrombie and Fitch&#x27;s Fierce and even Sex Panther.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cologne has a light and sweeter scent to it so I would recommend it for more of the younger generation. I&#x27;ve noticed that most women tend to like cologne&#x27;s with this type of smell so if you&#x27;re looking for a cologne to impress your lady and you&#x27;re under 30, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cologne will last 4-6 hours like most colognes. I laughed when I read that people said it only lasted for 15 minutes because it is simply a lie. Try spraying it on your clothes if you want it to last all day but another spray in the early afternoon and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I like this scent and more importantly my girlfriend LOVES it. After reading these reviews I was worried it would be a waste of money for me to buy Polo Red. Well I didn&#x27;t have to, my girlfriend bought it. I don&#x27;t know if those stating the scent wears off quickly have olfactory issues or they got counterfeit Red but this stuff LASTS. I&#x27;m not the kind of guy to douse myself in cologne so two spritzes and I&#x27;m good. Well 13 hours after applying Polo Red, and working a full shift, I can still readily smell the scent. My only current negative thought... I wish my girlfriend had bought me the big bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12-12-13  After using this cologne for about two weeks and continuing to feel the same way as I felt when I wrote my original review something happened that made me feel I needed to update my review.  First of all I will say that I have actually gone from two spritzes to one because this cologne is a little too strong (not a bad thing).  Secondly today I wore a sweater that I haven&#x27;t worn since the day before thanksgiving (the day I got the cologne).  I had no washed the sweater.  It STILL smelled strongly of the cologne!  So much so that I didn&#x27;t even need to use any today.  Needless to say I can&#x27;t imagine what everyone is talking about saying it doesn&#x27;t last.  Possibly they are getting a counterfeit product?  I don&#x27;t know, mine was bought at a reputable store.</li>
            <li> Have been a big Polo fan for years, starting with the original Polo for my dad 20+ years ago--particularly loved the long lasting ability of the scent.  The Polo Red is a very pleasing fragrance, unfortunately, it does not last long.  My husband puts it on right after showering---almost before he leaves the house the scent has disappeared.  I love the scent and would have given it five stars if it didn&#x27;t dissipate so quick.</li>
            <li> This is my new fragrance all the ladies love it no matter the age. Every time I wear it a female will say one of three thing you smell great,what are you wearing and what are you doing later!!! So fellas if no one is wearing this at your job be the first one to put it on. You can thank me later</li>
            <li> It smells very good, one of the best I have had.  I get complements all the time abut what I m wearing.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new cologne and bought this one and two others after testing them at a local mall. This was the girlfriends favorite ouf of the bunch. I would recommend to anyone looking to change up their scent a little. It was described as a fall scent by the woman trying to sell it. Could be used for a casual night out or day to day.</li>
            <li> I love it very much. I recommend you to try it. It worths trying. Very very very very nice.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Makes me smell like a million bucks and no not the deer lol. But yea I would recommend this to wear when it&#x27;s not super cold or super hot .</li>
            <li> Love it! Gift for my son who is hard to buy for.  One son wears Polo Blue and now the other wears Polo Red.</li>
            <li> My son really wanted this.  I got it for him for his birthday and as soon as he realized the purpose was not to smell like he bathed in it, I sorta got used to the new smell.</li>
            <li> One of the greatest colonge I have bought for it&#x27;s price I would defiantly buy again</li>
            <li> I bought this immediately after smelling it; great initial citrus and fruity scent, mellows after a few minutes with woodsy undertones.  Loved it.  Then after about a half hour or so, gone.  Yep, scent is completely gone off my skin.  I&#x27;m so upset about this, as I was hoping to make this my new signature scent.  I went ahead and got the body spray thinking that would help, but no.  Showered with fragrance-free body wash, fragrance-free lotion, applied both cologne and body spray, but it&#x27;s completely gone by the time I get to work.  Asked a co-worker to smell me and see if he likes the scent, he said he couldn&#x27;t smell anything.  Totally bummed out.  Guess I&#x27;ll go back to my old standby summer scent.  Peeved I spent $78 for the large bottle and another $20 for spray.&lt;br /&gt;Remember the original polo, green bottle?  That had about a 5 foot projection and longevity after nearly a full day, this lasts as long as it takes to walk from the bathroom to the kitchen for a cup of coffee before heading to work.  Stick with Burberry London.</li>
            <li> kinda pricey but much cheaper on here then in the stores smells great but doesn&#x27;t last for too long maybe 4 hours or so but overall I like it</li>
            <li> didnt smell anything like at macys. maybe its just me ,but its identical to guess seductive pour homme. i have the guess and the smell os identical.maybe i got a bad batch ??:(</li>
            <li> Love the scent !  Very nice.</li>
            <li> Light scent, not overbearing.  Great for daily use or dressing up.  Excellent addition to the Ralph Lauren Polo scent line.  I&#x27;m picky about my colognes but this was an excellent complement to my collection.</li>
            <li> Every guy should get this scent from Polo!! It is nice for anytime, dressing up or going out casual!!  A must scent, get your bottle and you will agree!!</li>
            <li> Yeah, the scent is great, but it lasts all of 20 minutes.  What a waste of money.  Apparently, it&#x27;s a common problem with polo products.</li>
            <li> I just like the smell of this regardless of what others might think</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne because my girlfriend mentioned that she thought it smelled nice. I&#x27;m not very into cologne, and just wanted something for nicer occasions or going out, but since I got it I have worn it nearly every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a great scent that stays with you all day. A lot of reviews say that it faded quickly, but I have not experienced that one bit. In fact, it stays on some of my shirts after I take them off and put them back in my closet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great cologne for the price, and not too flashy. Would be a great gift idea for any guy.</li>
            <li> Smells yummy on my hubby</li>
            <li> Love this cologne, had to get it, saw it in my store (Macy&#x27;s) and they had the same size of cologne for $63.25, so I rant to Amazon and found it about $20 cheaper so I had to get it. Smells great, comes in all original packaging like I saw at the mall, you won&#x27;t be dissappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a now ex-boyfriend. He loved it. This is a great fragrance and I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A 19 year old&#x27;s delight.  We cautioned a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use Polo Blue, Black Sport and others and like them all. But the Red? Maybe I got a bad bottle but this lasts about 15 minutes from time of application. I don&#x27;t get it. I think the product was legit as the box and bottle all look as they should but I found the fragrance extremely weak and unlike other Polo colognes. I have not purchased the Red before so I cannot compare it to a previous purchase but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Such a great and unique smell. This is my third time buying this cologne. My gf wants me to where it for the rest of my life. I don&#x27;t know about that, but right now it&#x27;s my calohne of choice.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells amazing, and it lasts all day. I have been getting a lot of compliments from the ladies at work, asking me what cologne I am wearing. I wear it all day for 12 to 14 hour work days.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.  This is the most different Polo fragrance I&#x27;ve ever worn.  Like sweet cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Lasts longer than most others that i have tried</li>
            <li> the smells is nice its not as powerful as other fragrances ive worn in the past  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again</li>
            <li> Smells great, good price compared to retail. Bought it for my son.</li>
            <li> It goes without saying the POLO Red has been loved by all since it was launched recently. The only issue people had with it was that the smell disappeared fast. It did not last as long as other RL fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two of these expecting the same problem. However, I think RL has fixed this. These two bottles were much more concentrated than what I had purchased before directly form the RL site. I went ahead and ordered 6 more from this. I hope all will be from the improved concentration version of the perfume :)</li>
            <li> The scent does not last that long. Other than that a good product.</li>
            <li> Got it for my son, and he likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Came fast.&lt;br /&gt;Good times.&lt;br /&gt;Carl Schmeklinberg</li>
            <li> Smells great on my husband!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!  Transaction was quick and easy with a great price!</li>
            <li> I think cologne is like art, to each their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what its worth; I have been a long time user of D&amp;G Lite Blue - My sister works @ Macy&#x27;s and brought me home a tester of the RLP Red. It sat in my travel kit with the other 2 testers I keep refilled with D&amp;GLB until I forgot to refill and was left with only this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it. To me it is still on the woodsy side, just with a hint of maybe vanillia?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, pricing was great (cheaper than duty free) ... it is my new stink for 2014.</li>
            <li> pleasant, very warm, winter fragrance</li>
            <li> Wonderful, as always from Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Polo collection. Delivery was also great, arrived sooner than estimated.  Thanks...Maria</li>
            <li> Smells so good! My boyfriend found this at a store but they were all out! I got it and I am in love with the smell!!</li>
            <li> never liked ralph lauren  other polo but this one really smells good</li>
            <li> Just what the grandson wanted......and it will be enthusiastically applied each time it is used!</li>
            <li> This cologne is just as I expected -- wonderful!  Thank you Ralph Lauren.</li>
            <li> Perfect Condition, box wasn&#x27;t bent or anything like that. Also was very cheap.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend literally cannot get enough of this</li>
            <li> Came super fast. Smells yummy.</li>
            <li> Smell strong initially. It take a while to settle . Good for long lasting  affect but nothing fancy like Versace Pour home</li>
            <li> Can I just say this smells so yummy.......Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really like the scent!</li>
            <li> I am writing this review specifically to address the reviewers who say this wears off too quickly.  I applied 3 quick squirts to my neck and collar.  36 hours, two showers and a change of clothes later and my fiancee sniffed me and said &amp;#34;I like that cologne.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I recently bought polo red for a wedding, I quickly found this isnâ€™t the scent for me. I realized I smelled so similar to the womenâ€™s perfume I couldâ€™ve easily interchanged them and not noticed. some words that are synonymous with polo red are : feminine, soft-handed, overpriced, field of roses (feminine roses), skipping/prancing, male attractor. Anyone who has a little bit of self worth or dignity should NOT waste their mothers hard earned money on this crap. If you are using this to attract girls, instead of sacrificing 80$ and your dignity, just get a sense of humor and an actual personality.</li>
            <li> Wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Great smell but does not last very long.  On me it usually only lasts 1-2 hours and then it is time to re apply.  It is a shame that it does not last as long as some other colognes that will last half a day.</li>
            <li> pleasant smell,  lasts all day</li>
            <li> This is Polo premiere cologne. I get as lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Polo Red is a great scent.  However, it isn&#x27;t nearly as strong as we&#x27;ve come to expect from Polo scents.  That might be why people are saying the scent fades away or dissipates rather quickly.  I think it&#x27;s just that it isn&#x27;t an overpowering scent.  It&#x27;s subtle, but is definitely noticeable.  If you&#x27;re wanting a scent that you can easily smell on yourself, this might not be for you.  Go with Armani, or Polo Black.  Like I said, this scent is subtle.  If someone is close to you, they will be able to tell.  If you walk by someone, they will be able to tell.  For me, a subtle scent works great.  It doesn&#x27;t shout for attention, but it isn&#x27;t hiding either.  This scent seems to smell better as the day goes on as well.  It settles into a nice, mature scent.</li>
            <li> Christmas stocking present, price was right!</li>
            <li> The perfume smelled great even Macy&#x27;s sent me a sample in mail. So, I did the fault of buying it. Irrespective of how much I spray, people can hardly smell it. The perfume smells great though but nobody will ever sense it. It&#x27;s either the perfume itself is like this or something wrong with the way Amazon is sending it. Either way, it&#x27;s a waste of $50 for me :(</li>
            <li> Amazing service. Wonderful product.  Very pleased!!</li>
            <li> a bit smaller than expected but its fine</li>
            <li> The packaging looks legit, the purchase was uncomplicated. I like the fragrance, but an hour after I slathered it on, a friend who has a nose like a bloodhound could not tell I was wearing it. I will buy the same product from a real store and see if it is any better. W</li>
            <li> Everyone has loved the smell so far. When women can&#x27;t keep their face off your neck, then it is a good cologne.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Smells amazing and it lasts longer than expected. Definitely worth buying. Getting a bigger bottle next time.</li>
            <li> I love my man wearing this.</li>
            <li> My partners&#x27; favorite cologne, smells good! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> packaging look like fake</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  Love it.  Good price.</li>
            <li> I picked up this cologne because it was a very unique smell (and I had a gift card). I have a LOT of colognes and this was something very different from my other colognes, so I thought it&#x27;d be an interesting purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the initial smell, and it&#x27;s extremely unique......however it lasts an INCREDIBLY short duration. I can&#x27;t even believe how quickly this scent fades. I&#x27;ve bought $20 colognes and spray cans that lasted longer. Other people can smell it on me \\&quot;slightly\\&quot; still after a 30 minutes, but after an hour or two there&#x27;s nearly no trace. Definitely not a strong projection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete deal breaker...I&#x27;m very disappointed. now I have to try to return an opened and used cologne to Macy&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend wears this all the time and I love it.  I have a bottle at my house for him as well as at his house.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice clean scent for everyday wear!</li>
            <li> My son is thrilled with the cologne.  Thank you for delivering so quickly.</li>
            <li> Like the smell, duh!!&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad value to make you guys smell a little better. Buy some today and be less smelly.</li>
            <li> It was good, it&#x27;s smelks great!</li>
            <li> I collect colognes, have for years and Wow everyday i wear this im told how good i smell so that should be enough proof. (IN MY OPINION) Ralph is killin&#x27;em with this.  This fragrance is great for gifts. This is fast speed sexy,seductive smell.  Polo Red is a spicy goodness with ingredients smelling like fresh cut red grapefruit and tangy lemon. Also wood,sage and coffee really make this a manly,exciting,seductive and powerful smell. I think this fragrance would work well for any age guy.</li>
            <li> me and my love this smell</li>
            <li> it smells good but doesn&#x27;t last that long. not sure if it is the nature of the product or is it just the stock i got from amazon is old but some of the previous ralph lauren parfumes i got from macy&#x27;s and ralph lauren store were long lasting than this one.</li>
            <li> Hhhhhm, great smell!!!!</li>
            <li> Polo Red smells incredible. This is one of the absolute best scents out there period! I think this fragrance is a masterpiece. It&#x27;s too bad it doesn&#x27;t last longer. If you get more than three to four hours before this wears off consider yourself fortunate.</li>
            <li> I like the scent though it could be a tad stronger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great fragrance. I think anyone would love to use it..</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  I was always a Polo (green bottle) man since it&#x27;s inception.  Tried Polo Red on a whim and an excellent whim it was.  Not over powering, just right.  I guess Ralph Lauren found the olfactory oasis because Polo Red is right there.</li>
            <li> The scent is great. I get many compliments from women of different ages who tell me they love the smell of this cologne. I would have given it 5 stars, but my bottle did not come with a spray nozzle, so minus 1 star. I can still use the pump, but it is kind of a pain. The aroma lasts all day for me, I don&#x27;t agree with the reviewers who say it fades fast.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and makes me smell good!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and was delivered earlier than expected which was a good surprise.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Best bang for this price, this scent is completely amazing and smells fresh and fruity but not like heyyyyyyyy fruity.</li>
            <li> Great sent, I have gotten plenty of compliments about this cologne. A great gift</li>
            <li> Son loves it and a lot better price than at mall.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell as great as the one in the mall</li>
