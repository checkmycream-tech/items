            <li> Excellent product. Fulfill their function.</li>
            <li> In love with this ! Though their is one thing I don&#x27;t like about it and that&#x27;s on step 2 when you apply the liquid/toner all over your face . It burn for like a minute or so but its something I can handle . Other than that I saw results in less than a week! Leaves your face feeling refreshed and smooth . I recommend buying this at Walmart since it&#x27;s cheaper there but the choice is yours :)</li>
            <li> I loveit but it does not seem to remove my acne. It does dry the pimples out dough. I also love the toner because it feels very good when applied on face.</li>

            <li> My teenage daughter used this product and was VERY satisfied with the results. It cleared her facial acne and now this is what she swears by for her daily routine. Great product.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel cool and clean</li>
            <li> Works great, I found it can be a bit drying so keep up with the moisturizer when using</li>
