            <li>They are durable and beautiful.</li>
            <li>i GAVE THESE GOODY BUTTER FLY CONTOUR CLIPS AS A GIFT.  </li>
            <li>+ I LOVE butterflies!!</li>
            <li>Best hair clips for toddlers w fine hair</li>
            <li>They might work as decoration but aren&#x27;t too good in terms of keeping hair in place on the head in a uniform manner.</li>
            <li>LOVED THEM.  </li>
            <li>They are very cute but the butterfly wings get tangled in her hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very fine hair, and these clips won&#x27;t stay in her hair.</li>
            <li>She gets compliments on her cute hair because of these clips.</li>
            <li>She looks absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing more.</li>
            <li>These are really cute, but rather flimsy.</li>
            <li>Cute - sparkles- does  not hug the hair</li>
            <li>They are lightweight, stay in place, and are super cute!</li>
            <li>These would be good for a baby but not for anyone over 3 with much hair.  </li>
            <li>I just hope the rest don&#x27;t do that too easily.</li>
            <li>These are perfect, &amp; you can wear your favorite colors as I do &amp; they aren&#x27;t just for little girls!!</li>
            <li>Thanks for thinking about color &amp; butterflies together!!!</li>
            <li>They have a stainless backing with a glittery gel coat on top and are quite durable.</li>
            <li>They really aren&#x27;t that cute either in person.</li>
            <li>So easy and so pretty</li>
            <li>VERY PRETTY.</li>
            <li>They are cute and open/close easy enough, but not as functional as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>Work very well on my youngest daughter&#x27;s fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Not expensive</li>
            <li>I only wish there were more colors included with the pack.</li>
            <li>The cips are really pretty</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; so well on my eldest&#x27;s thicker hair though she still uses them for pretty decoration.</li>
            <li>They do not have any sort of silicone/rubber in the middle to help hold fine hair (which I assumed, but thought I&#x27;d share for clarity).</li>
            <li>When you clip them into the hair, the bottom curves up too much, so they don&#x27;t sit on the head and there&#x27;s a large gap underneath.</li>
            <li>They would probably do well with straight hair.</li>
            <li>They are working as well as any other clip, but one did come with the colored plastic on top chipped off.</li>
            <li>While I love the design and colors, these do not work as well as other hair clips.</li>
            <li>These are lovely though small</li>
            <li>My little one was born with a head full of hair and at under 1 year old, her hair was very curly.</li>
            <li>my 4 year old granddaughter loves these clips and so do I.  </li>
            <li>Now she has developed the habit of pulling them out of her hair and putting it on her mouth, but that&#x27;s what babies do....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them since she was about 6 months old</li>
            <li>, she is 9 months old now.</li>
            <li>My nearly 2 year old has curly hair</li>
            <li>I bought these for my twin 3-year old girls.</li>
            <li>so I use them for my 18mth old baby and my 3 yr old.</li>
            <li>I like using these for my baby&#x27;s hair, for the little hair that didn&#x27;t grow long yet and looks too cute in her hair.</li>
            <li>I give her little afro puffs but use the clips to secure her hair that is slightly shorter in the front.</li>

            <li> Got these for my granddaughter she loves them.</li>
            <li> I like using these for my baby&#x27;s hair, for the little hair that didn&#x27;t grow long yet and looks too cute in her hair.</li>
            <li> Gets caught in hair due to butterfly detail.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality &amp; barely holds any hair.</li>
            <li> my 4 year old granddaughter loves these clips and so do I.  So easy and so pretty</li>
            <li> They are working as well as any other clip, but one did come with the colored plastic on top chipped off. Not expensive so it&#x27;s along the lines of you get what you pay for. I just hope the rest don&#x27;t do that too easily. They do not have any sort of silicone/rubber in the middle to help hold fine hair (which I assumed, but thought I&#x27;d share for clarity).</li>
            <li> The butterfly potion of this clip is too big while the clip part isn&#x27;t big enough.  I can&#x27;t capture enough hair in the clip and the butterfly part makes it &amp;#34;top-heavy.&amp;#34;  They are cute and open/close easy enough, but not as functional as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I got these because my bangs are growing out &amp; I HATE hair in my face + I LOVE butterflies!! These are perfect, &amp; you can wear your favorite colors as I do &amp; they aren&#x27;t just for little girls!! Thanks for thinking about color &amp; butterflies together!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my granddaughter and they are about 1.5 inches long. They have a stainless backing with a glittery gel coat on top and are quite durable. My granddaughter loves these clips and I would recommend these barrettes.</li>
            <li> I got these to hold back my baby&#x27;s bangs out of her eyes. They are lightweight, stay in place, and are super cute! She gets compliments on her cute hair because of these clips. Now she has developed the habit of pulling them out of her hair and putting it on her mouth, but that&#x27;s what babies do.... I&#x27;ve been using them since she was about 6 months old, she is 9 months old now.</li>
            <li> Poor quality - bent immediately and didn&#x27;t hold the hair.  I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> My little one was born with a head full of hair and at under 1 year old, her hair was very curly. I give her little afro puffs but use the clips to secure her hair that is slightly shorter in the front. She looks absolutely adorable. I only wish there were more colors included with the pack. I plan on purchasing more. Like another mom said, they do get tangled so I have to be very careful of the way I put them in and remove them.</li>
            <li> While I love the design and colors, these do not work as well as other hair clips. When you clip them into the hair, the bottom curves up too much, so they don&#x27;t sit on the head and there&#x27;s a large gap underneath. They might work as decoration but aren&#x27;t too good in terms of keeping hair in place on the head in a uniform manner.</li>
            <li> My nearly 2 year old has curly hair so I bought these to pin her hair back out of her face. They are very cute but the butterfly wings get tangled in her hair. I struggle to remove the clips without pulling her hair with them. They would probably do well with straight hair.</li>
            <li> i GAVE THESE GOODY BUTTER FLY CONTOUR CLIPS AS A GIFT.  I FELT THEY WERE OF A SUBSTANTIAL WEIGHT &amp; THE GIRL LOVED THEM.  VERY PRETTY.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be bigger.  it was listed at 2&amp;#34; but the other 2&amp;#34; clips I have are much bigger.  I did not take into consideration that the butterfly at the end is not part of the useable clip.  These would be good for a baby but not for anyone over 3 with much hair.  They really aren&#x27;t that cute either in person.</li>
            <li> These are really cute, but rather flimsy. My daughter has very fine hair, and these clips won&#x27;t stay in her hair. Plus, they&#x27;re so small I worry about her choking on one (I caught her putting one in her mouth).</li>
            <li> do not slip - even while playing soccer!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my twin 3-year old girls. There is a metal pin at the point of the clip which holds the two sides together. The pin catches their hair and pulls. I&#x27;ve actually ended up breaking their hair to get the clip out. The cips are really pretty but I can&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> Work very well on my youngest daughter&#x27;s fine hair.  Couldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; so well on my eldest&#x27;s thicker hair though she still uses them for pretty decoration.</li>
            <li> These are lovely though small so I use them for my 18mth old baby and my 3 yr old.They are durable and beautiful.I recommend you get one of these!!!</li>
            <li> The plastic color starts peeling from the metal clip after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> Best hair clips for toddlers w fine hair</li>
            <li> Finally found something to stay in her hair. Not easy to find in stores</li>
            <li> Cute - sparkles- does  not hug the hair</li>
