            <li> One of my clients commented on the plushness of this fleece pad recently.  Glad I purchased!</li>
            <li> Whoever measured the thickness of this pad must have confused millimeters for inches, because there is no way you could fluff this out to an inch. Doesn&#x27;t matter for my purposes, since I was mainly interested in covering the slickness of the massage table surface.  Still, in my opinion, it is false advertising.</li>

            <li> I have a standard size massage table and this didn&#x27;t quite cover the entire width for the table, which concerns me. It fits well enough, so I won&#x27;t be sending it back. But if I need another set in the future, I may consider anther brand. The pad itself is plush and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Meets expectations according to price</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. The softness is amazing and the secure straps and face cradle cover fit perfectly. I will definitely purchase a second set.</li>
