            <li>Lathers great with a bit of conditioning.  </li>
            <li>5:00 am took a shower and around 2:00 pm I still can smell the great scent of it.</li>

            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>It smells good but isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a good thing but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>Been using it on my hair and very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a 2-in-1 hair product that leaves your hair clean, moisturized, and smelling great, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>so it is nice to match the scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find it nice</li>
            <li>I hope it smells nice.</li>
            <li>and he liked the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice smell, works well</li>
            <li>and it cleans my hair nicely.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still getting a very strong smell from the shampoo</li>
            <li>Nice scent that doesn&#x27;t come across too strong.  </li>
            <li>The scent was okay.  </li>
            <li>Most shampoo/conditioners do not work well in my hair because it&#x27;s longer, and even though this is a guy&#x27;s product, I tried it out.</li>
            <li>and I love it~</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner delivers everything promised and more.</li>
            <li>Swagger might appeal to more of a 20 something than a 40 something because it has more of a cologne smell.</li>
            <li>The tagline for this was hilarious</li>
            <li>Being mostly bald</li>
            <li>But he is also mostly bald.</li>
            <li>Most men</li>
            <li>My hair feels better to the touch when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>many uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>love the way this stuff smells.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>like using conditioner on occasion and this 2 in 1 product is pretty good at cleaning and softening the hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it smells pretty darn good</li>
            <li>Has a really strong smell however really love the design and look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasant surprised to find that this product strikes a good balance between clean / light</li>
            <li>He is a fan of old spice and this is a great edition to his travel kit.</li>
            <li>I then have to comb through once more to get my hair to feel smooth.</li>
            <li>A great shampoo and conditioner with a masculine but not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>I was perfectly happy with my old shampoo, which also included conditioner.</li>
            <li>Old Spice Swagger is a great conditioner shampoo product.</li>
            <li>This is a nice and thick and creamy 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner, although if I&#x27;m being honest, it smells so good you can use it as a body wash, too!  </li>
            <li>The response I received when asking what he originally thought of it was, it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Love the clean scent.  </li>
            <li>NOW I can have the scent I love and a &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; that was meant to clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly fragrant and it washes out easily without any leftover greasy feeling after you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>The scent is not so strong that it will turn anyone off -</li>
            <li>For its combination of price, pleasant scent, and its clean / light / gentle feel on the hair, I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Swagger is a little lighter on the scent but both are excellent.</li>
            <li>Overall, It&#x27;s a great product that I&#x27;ll continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That only lasted 1 day and his appreciation for this shampoo/conditioner combination went up a great deal.  </li>
            <li>Old Spice Swagger 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner is good shampoo.</li>
            <li>Very nice, and it actually helps me sleep smelling this after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>Swagger 2 in 1 shampoo plus conditioner is a men’s hair care product with a nice scent and decent conditioning ability.</li>
            <li>The thing that has him most interested is the marketing blurbs on the bottles.</li>
            <li>It used to be that shampoo was relatively straightforward.</li>
            <li>Cheap and good, got it for about $1.50 which is less than what most people pay for shampoo or conditioner alone.</li>
            <li>The scent is a very mild, pleasing, manly scent that reminds me and my husband of some type exotic wood or maybe exotic wood related spice.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special.  </li>
            <li>He is a truck driver and doesn&#x27;t get home as often as he would like--he really enjoys having his favorite products with him, and he has added this to the collection for his travels.</li>
            <li>; The strength of a redwood and the mystic scent of the mint in Timber is power for your hair, soul and jet-powered chainsaw.&amp;#34; He is beginning to think this stuff is better than Viagra and much cheaper too.</li>
            <li>, Old Spice shampoo has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>In recent years, however, they&#x27;ve done some good marketing and changed their image.</li>
            <li>Not bad for a shampoo and conditioner combination.</li>
            <li>The next day he used it as intended and described the shampoo as &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; with a very good lather, and that his hair felt very soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li>His hair feels better and actually has more volume to</li>
            <li>The bottle lasts a long time, so it is a good value too</li>
            <li>The smell stays in your hair for a long time and makes your hair look good.</li>
            <li>This is a nice 2 on 1 combo shampoo and conditioner from Old Spice.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a nice big bottle of it too</li>
            <li>The smell stays in your hair for a long time and makes your hair look good.</li>
            <li>The conditioner element softens your hair enough to notice and leaves your hair feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li>These new products smell great, especially Swagger.</li>
            <li>Well, he thought it was body wash and complained that it didn&#x27;t lather very well, but it sure smelled great all day.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of the Swagger scent from Old Spice for deodorant, and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint either.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a simple kind of guy.</li>
            <li>Companies claimed that it cleaned your hair, perhaps smelled nice, and hopefully left your hair manageable.</li>
            <li>but I like the Old Spice better.</li>
            <li>This actually smells pretty decent and leaves your hair feeling good after rinsing, not slimey like some combo shampoo and conditioners can.</li>
            <li>Both have a pleasant smell that reminds him of his younger days when almost everyone wore Old Spice after shave.</li>
            <li>This has a new fresh smell!  </li>
            <li>I can recommend this product with no reservations as I found it to be both effective and pleasant enough without getting too ridiculous in terms of scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually gotten more comments on my hair today for it&#x27;s bounce and shine than ever before.  </li>
            <li>Probably the first quality you will notice is the scent-</li>
            <li>Pretty cool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In terms of the broader family of Old Spice scents, I tend to prefer Original.</li>
            <li>Strangely, it also feels very light while still feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Swagger has a clean masculine smell that doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like</li>
            <li>After using it, my husband&#x27;s hair was clean feeling and silky soft.</li>
            <li>Masculine, but still floral, almost like a cologne... but with a clean, soapy hint as well.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good but do not use this shampoo every day, it is very very harsh on your hair.</li>
            <li>If you wear your hair long, you may need more conditioner.</li>
            <li>My husband tried out both the Swagger and the Pure Sport.</li>
            <li>It is just a preference in smell that gives this one a 3 star and the Pure Sport a 4 star ranking.</li>
            <li>and while certainly noticeable, it isn’t overpowering like some shampoos can</li>
            <li>Like the large volume in the container.</li>
            <li>Large bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Pure Sport and Swagger.  </li>
            <li>So what, my hair&#x27;s clean and apparently conditioned too.</li>
            <li>He much prefers the Pure Sport smell to this Swagger.</li>
            <li>my son, who visits often, really loves this combined shampoo &amp; conditions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whatever the scent, my husband really likes it and</li>
            <li>The problem with this shampoo is that it doesn&#x27;t really fight off dandruff.</li>
            <li>My husband is Puerto Rican with very curly jet-black hair, and he never uses conditioner.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t run out nearly as fast.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t (and neither did my husband) feel that it was very conditioning.</li>
            <li>The problem with this shampoo is that it dosen&#x27;t really fight off dandruff.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again, but it&#x27; not any better than any other shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It creates a very rich, thick lather and after washing my hair feels exceedingly clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-You&#x27;re left with a clean feeling after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product left his hair so nice and soft and the scent really does last all day.</li>
            <li>and the same is true in my house.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, lathers very well with a small amount, and with the added conditioner, I find my hair incredibly soft the next morning after I&#x27;ve washed it.</li>
            <li>Helps to smooth dry winter hair.  </li>
            <li>It does a decent job of cleaning my sons hair and it leaves it shiney.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I like the Old Spice 2in1&#x27;s as much or more than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The two that he tried work the same and leave his hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So while this is a better product than I would have expected out of the Old Spice name, I could never with a clear conscience buy it.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s hair is softer than normal.</li>
            <li>The residue left on the hair could be a problem for some men, but other than that, it’s a good hair care product overall</li>
            <li>As time went on, they told you to repeat if necessary but the latest trend in shampoo for men is to tell you that a single application is all you need.</li>
            <li>So a shampoo that contains a conditioner is new to him.  </li>
            <li>While not too fragrant, it does smell nice in a subtle way.</li>
            <li>The shampoo / conditioner worked well, hair had a faint pleasant smell when dry and had that clean conditioned feel when as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Swagger 2 in 1 is sold in a large size bottle and if your hair is short like mine, a single bottle will last a good long time.</li>
            <li>Not your granddad&#x27;s old spice!  </li>
            <li>It does not dry out my hair too much as some others have done.</li>
            <li>As over the top as those Old Spice ads tend to be, there&#x27;s nothing out of the ordinary going on with this two in one shampoo/conditioner from the company.</li>
            <li>I especially like the large bottle size...</li>
            <li>At this point we have acquired a staggering amount of silly information about what particular chemicals will do to the eyes of rabbits, so there really isn&#x27;t much of a need to develop new tests and accumulate more info.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The product rinsed out easily in soft water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t care if it is top of the line, organic, expensive or bottom of the shelf, generic brand cheap.</li>
            <li>The old express</li>
            <li>that This Isn&#x27;t Your Father&#x27;s Old Spice is correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Old Spice 2 in 1 shampoos come in</li>
            <li>it is masculine and cologne- like, with the ability to linger for a while after use.</li>
            <li>I said, I like the cleaning ability of this shampoo and it does leave the hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Old Spice&#x27;s Swagger Shampoo &amp; Conditioner has a manly fragrance and comes in a manly-sized bottle.</li>
            <li>If you ask yourself what you might expect a shampoo to be like that&#x27;s made by Old Spice, this would be it.</li>
            <li>My mainstay thus far has been Head &amp; Shoulders.  </li>
            <li>The biggest difference is the lather on the Old Spice.  </li>
            <li>Old Spice has been something that I&#x27;ve always associated with old people, like my grandpa.</li>
            <li>and my hair is now soft feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 22 year old guy and have started to see strands of hair coming off my head ever since I started using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The deodorant that he wears is also usually the Fresh or the Pure Sport</li>
            <li>Overall, it seems to work as good as any other shampoo/conditioner combo that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>It really stays in the hair for a long time too.</li>
            <li>Large size means too much at once, can&#x27;t finish before next delivery is due.</li>
            <li>what that&#x27;s even supposed to mean, but I suppose their advertising agency figured nobody would pay them for the slogan \\&quot;for smooth and soft hair.\\</li>
            <li>This bottle will last a long time, as it doesn&#x27;t require much for each use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s taken Old Spice this long to come out with something like this (or for me to notice that they&#x27;d come out with something like this).</li>
            <li>Old Spice&#x27;s rebranding campaign has totally worked on me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He did cooperate for my review and after using this for awhile, went back to his old shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that this left my hair feeling softer.</li>
            <li>My hair felt a little rough immediately after my shower and wasn&#x27;t easy to brush through like when it&#x27;s conditioned.</li>
            <li>His hair is super fine and a little thin</li>
            <li>so he usually doesn&#x27;t use a conditioner, as most of them weigh the hair down and plaster it against his scalp.</li>
            <li>I used to just grab the most bland, least scented thing I could find on the shelf</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Swagger might appeal to more of a 20 something than a 40 something because it has more of a cologne smell.</li>
            <li> The tagline for this was hilarious</li>
            <li> Being mostly bald</li>
            <li> But he is also mostly bald.</li>
            <li> Most men</li>
            <li> My hair feels better to the touch when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> many uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> love the way this stuff smells.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> like using conditioner on occasion and this 2 in 1 product is pretty good at cleaning and softening the hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it smells pretty darn good</li>
            <li> Has a really strong smell however really love the design and look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasant surprised to find that this product strikes a good balance between clean / light</li>
            <li> He is a fan of old spice and this is a great edition to his travel kit.</li>
            <li> I then have to comb through once more to get my hair to feel smooth.</li>
            <li> A great shampoo and conditioner with a masculine but not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> I was perfectly happy with my old shampoo, which also included conditioner.</li>
            <li> Old Spice Swagger is a great conditioner shampoo product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice and thick and creamy 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner, although if I&#x27;m being honest, it smells so good you can use it as a body wash, too!  </li>
            <li> The response I received when asking what he originally thought of it was, it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Love the clean scent.  </li>
            <li> NOW I can have the scent I love and a &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; that was meant to clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly fragrant and it washes out easily without any leftover greasy feeling after you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> The scent is not so strong that it will turn anyone off -</li>
            <li> For its combination of price, pleasant scent, and its clean / light / gentle feel on the hair, I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Swagger is a little lighter on the scent but both are excellent.</li>
            <li> Overall, It&#x27;s a great product that I&#x27;ll continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That only lasted 1 day and his appreciation for this shampoo/conditioner combination went up a great deal.  </li>
            <li> Old Spice Swagger 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner is good shampoo.</li>
            <li> Very nice, and it actually helps me sleep smelling this after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Swagger 2 in 1 shampoo plus conditioner is a men’s hair care product with a nice scent and decent conditioning ability.</li>
            <li> The thing that has him most interested is the marketing blurbs on the bottles.</li>
            <li> It used to be that shampoo was relatively straightforward.</li>
            <li> Cheap and good, got it for about $1.50 which is less than what most people pay for shampoo or conditioner alone.</li>
            <li> The scent is a very mild, pleasing, manly scent that reminds me and my husband of some type exotic wood or maybe exotic wood related spice.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special.  </li>
            <li> He is a truck driver and doesn&#x27;t get home as often as he would like--he really enjoys having his favorite products with him, and he has added this to the collection for his travels.</li>
            <li> ; The strength of a redwood and the mystic scent of the mint in Timber is power for your hair, soul and jet-powered chainsaw.&amp;#34; He is beginning to think this stuff is better than Viagra and much cheaper too.</li>
            <li> , Old Spice shampoo has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> In recent years, however, they&#x27;ve done some good marketing and changed their image.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a shampoo and conditioner combination.</li>
            <li> The next day he used it as intended and described the shampoo as &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; with a very good lather, and that his hair felt very soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li> His hair feels better and actually has more volume to</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time, so it is a good value too</li>
            <li> The smell stays in your hair for a long time and makes your hair look good.</li>
            <li> This is a nice 2 on 1 combo shampoo and conditioner from Old Spice.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a nice big bottle of it too</li>
            <li> The smell stays in your hair for a long time and makes your hair look good.</li>
            <li> The conditioner element softens your hair enough to notice and leaves your hair feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li> These new products smell great, especially Swagger.</li>
            <li> Well, he thought it was body wash and complained that it didn&#x27;t lather very well, but it sure smelled great all day.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of the Swagger scent from Old Spice for deodorant, and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint either.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a simple kind of guy.</li>
            <li> Companies claimed that it cleaned your hair, perhaps smelled nice, and hopefully left your hair manageable.</li>
            <li> but I like the Old Spice better.</li>
            <li> This actually smells pretty decent and leaves your hair feeling good after rinsing, not slimey like some combo shampoo and conditioners can.</li>
            <li> Both have a pleasant smell that reminds him of his younger days when almost everyone wore Old Spice after shave.</li>
            <li> This has a new fresh smell!  </li>
            <li> I can recommend this product with no reservations as I found it to be both effective and pleasant enough without getting too ridiculous in terms of scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually gotten more comments on my hair today for it&#x27;s bounce and shine than ever before.  </li>
            <li> Probably the first quality you will notice is the scent-</li>
            <li> Pretty cool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In terms of the broader family of Old Spice scents, I tend to prefer Original.</li>
            <li> Strangely, it also feels very light while still feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Swagger has a clean masculine smell that doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like</li>
            <li> After using it, my husband&#x27;s hair was clean feeling and silky soft.</li>
            <li> Masculine, but still floral, almost like a cologne... but with a clean, soapy hint as well.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good but do not use this shampoo every day, it is very very harsh on your hair.</li>
            <li> If you wear your hair long, you may need more conditioner.</li>
            <li> My husband tried out both the Swagger and the Pure Sport.</li>
            <li> It is just a preference in smell that gives this one a 3 star and the Pure Sport a 4 star ranking.</li>
            <li> and while certainly noticeable, it isn’t overpowering like some shampoos can</li>
            <li> Like the large volume in the container.</li>
            <li> Large bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Pure Sport and Swagger.  </li>
            <li> So what, my hair&#x27;s clean and apparently conditioned too.</li>
            <li> He much prefers the Pure Sport smell to this Swagger.</li>
            <li> my son, who visits often, really loves this combined shampoo &amp; conditions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whatever the scent, my husband really likes it and</li>
            <li> The problem with this shampoo is that it doesn&#x27;t really fight off dandruff.</li>
            <li> My husband is Puerto Rican with very curly jet-black hair, and he never uses conditioner.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t run out nearly as fast.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t (and neither did my husband) feel that it was very conditioning.</li>
            <li> The problem with this shampoo is that it dosen&#x27;t really fight off dandruff.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again, but it&#x27; not any better than any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It creates a very rich, thick lather and after washing my hair feels exceedingly clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-You&#x27;re left with a clean feeling after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product left his hair so nice and soft and the scent really does last all day.</li>
            <li> and the same is true in my house.  </li>
            <li> It smells great, lathers very well with a small amount, and with the added conditioner, I find my hair incredibly soft the next morning after I&#x27;ve washed it.</li>
            <li> Helps to smooth dry winter hair.  </li>
            <li> It does a decent job of cleaning my sons hair and it leaves it shiney.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I like the Old Spice 2in1&#x27;s as much or more than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The two that he tried work the same and leave his hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So while this is a better product than I would have expected out of the Old Spice name, I could never with a clear conscience buy it.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s hair is softer than normal.</li>
            <li> The residue left on the hair could be a problem for some men, but other than that, it’s a good hair care product overall</li>
            <li> As time went on, they told you to repeat if necessary but the latest trend in shampoo for men is to tell you that a single application is all you need.</li>
            <li> So a shampoo that contains a conditioner is new to him.  </li>
            <li> While not too fragrant, it does smell nice in a subtle way.</li>
            <li> The shampoo / conditioner worked well, hair had a faint pleasant smell when dry and had that clean conditioned feel when as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Swagger 2 in 1 is sold in a large size bottle and if your hair is short like mine, a single bottle will last a good long time.</li>
            <li> Not your granddad&#x27;s old spice!  </li>
            <li> It does not dry out my hair too much as some others have done.</li>
            <li> As over the top as those Old Spice ads tend to be, there&#x27;s nothing out of the ordinary going on with this two in one shampoo/conditioner from the company.</li>
            <li> I especially like the large bottle size...</li>
            <li> At this point we have acquired a staggering amount of silly information about what particular chemicals will do to the eyes of rabbits, so there really isn&#x27;t much of a need to develop new tests and accumulate more info.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The product rinsed out easily in soft water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t care if it is top of the line, organic, expensive or bottom of the shelf, generic brand cheap.</li>
            <li> The old express</li>
            <li> that This Isn&#x27;t Your Father&#x27;s Old Spice is correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Old Spice 2 in 1 shampoos come in</li>
            <li> it is masculine and cologne- like, with the ability to linger for a while after use.</li>
            <li> I said, I like the cleaning ability of this shampoo and it does leave the hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Old Spice&#x27;s Swagger Shampoo &amp; Conditioner has a manly fragrance and comes in a manly-sized bottle.</li>
            <li> If you ask yourself what you might expect a shampoo to be like that&#x27;s made by Old Spice, this would be it.</li>
            <li> My mainstay thus far has been Head &amp; Shoulders.  </li>
            <li> The biggest difference is the lather on the Old Spice.  </li>
            <li> Old Spice has been something that I&#x27;ve always associated with old people, like my grandpa.</li>
            <li> and my hair is now soft feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 22 year old guy and have started to see strands of hair coming off my head ever since I started using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The deodorant that he wears is also usually the Fresh or the Pure Sport</li>
            <li> Overall, it seems to work as good as any other shampoo/conditioner combo that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> It really stays in the hair for a long time too.</li>
            <li> Large size means too much at once, can&#x27;t finish before next delivery is due.</li>
            <li> what that&#x27;s even supposed to mean, but I suppose their advertising agency figured nobody would pay them for the slogan \\&quot;for smooth and soft hair.\\</li>
            <li> This bottle will last a long time, as it doesn&#x27;t require much for each use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s taken Old Spice this long to come out with something like this (or for me to notice that they&#x27;d come out with something like this).</li>
            <li> Old Spice&#x27;s rebranding campaign has totally worked on me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He did cooperate for my review and after using this for awhile, went back to his old shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that this left my hair feeling softer.</li>
            <li> My hair felt a little rough immediately after my shower and wasn&#x27;t easy to brush through like when it&#x27;s conditioned.</li>
            <li> His hair is super fine and a little thin</li>
            <li> so he usually doesn&#x27;t use a conditioner, as most of them weigh the hair down and plaster it against his scalp.</li>
            <li> I used to just grab the most bland, least scented thing I could find on the shelf</li>
            <li> A small amount is all it takes for a short- haired person like me to lather up, rinse, and be ready to start my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the trade-off is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long throughout the day.</li>
            <li> so maybe thats only for those with long hair or maybe its exclusivelly for me.</li>
            <li> bottle is fairly large, and is a decent value for the current price (just shy of seven bucks).</li>
            <li> Old Spice has really stepped up their game.</li>
            <li> Softer than it has been in a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> Normally I found combination shampoo/conditioner products in the past to</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe there is a big demand from consumers that rabbits and other animals have shampoo poured into their eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Who cares if your hair is clean and conditioned if you have those mirrored expensive sunglasses and that jet-powered chainsaw.</li>
            <li> either a) dry my hair out or b)</li>
            <li> not a single person has come up to me and told me how cocky my hair looks.</li>
            <li> Over half the bottle left too.</li>
            <li> He thinks its a little bit more difficult to comb which is a little strange</li>
            <li> About the only possible drawback is that it does leave your hair feeling a little weighed down.</li>
            <li> There are no legal requirements or regulations that necessitate testing on animals (usually rabbits, because they do not have tear ducts in their eyes), so it is a practice that requires justification in the light of heightened concern over the unnecessary suffering of animals.</li>
            <li> In a world of scented mango rosebud shampoos, it can be hard for a guy to find something his style, but Old Spice has you covered.</li>
            <li> a few different smells.</li>
            <li> and I notice that, once my hair dries, I can still feel some of the conditioner even though I am careful to rinse thoroughly.</li>
            <li> so at my rate, this bottle will last me for a few months.</li>
            <li> &quot; I have absolutely no idea</li>
            <li> However, I have found that I need to periodically use a different shampoo &amp; conditioner to counterbalance how dried out this leaves my hair over time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t be buying it because I firmly and passionately oppose shampoos that are tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve changed nothing with my diet and am physically active.</li>
            <li> I typically use J. Ligett&#x27;s old-fashioned bar shampoo (without a conditioner), but received this as a sample for review, so I&#x27;m giving it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It’s not a huge issue, but it could be a problem for those who don’t like to feel any trace whatsoever of a hair care product after leaving the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not extremely strong scented</li>
            <li> If this is a problem with a high &amp; tight flattop, I do not want to know how bad it would be with longer hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about the swagger claims</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s not much more to say about shampoo, and manufacturers seem to have that problem too.</li>
            <li> My usual conditioner helps with these issues and this one isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked having to use separate shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> I know don&#x27;t use conditioner - or at least won&#x27;t admit to it,</li>
            <li> He has thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> weigh it down with a weird residue.</li>
            <li> will leave your hair so cocky youll need to buy it a pair of expensive mirrored sunglasses.</li>
            <li> This shampoo promises to \\&quot;leave your hair so cocky you&#x27;ll need to buy it a pair of expensive mirrored sunglasses.\\</li>
            <li> a weird flower.&lt;br /&gt;-The product lathered well</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Lost it&#x27;s smell after a month... now it has some generic pasty alcohol type smell, basically just goo. Over half the bottle left too. Was using it daily but now it&#x27;s time to find something else.</li>
            <li> Love the clean scent.  Not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells pretty good. It&#x27;s not extremely strong scented but you can definitely smell it all day. It does not dry out my hair too much as some others have done. It leaves my hair feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the Swagger scent from Old Spice for deodorant, and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint either. It smells great, lathers very well with a small amount, and with the added conditioner, I find my hair incredibly soft the next morning after I&#x27;ve washed it. I&#x27;ve never liked having to use separate shampoo and conditioner so I tend to go without conditioner... and I have to say, the way my hair feels after using this, it makes it my preferred choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Swagger body wash since it came out. Eventually I simplified my shower routine by using the body wash on my hair too. NOW I can have the scent I love and a &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; that was meant to clean hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and at 5 bucks...Amazon yet again beat the price of any retail store.</li>
            <li> Overall, It&#x27;s a great product that I&#x27;ll continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Swagger has a clean masculine smell that doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a weird flower.&lt;br /&gt;-The product lathered well&lt;br /&gt;-The product rinsed out easily in soft water.&lt;br /&gt;-You&#x27;re left with a clean feeling after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about the swagger claims but my wife likes the smell and that all that matters.</li>
            <li> my son, who visits often, really loves this combined shampoo &amp; conditions. He is a fan of old spice and this is a great edition to his travel kit. He is a truck driver and doesn&#x27;t get home as often as he would like--he really enjoys having his favorite products with him, and he has added this to the collection for his travels.</li>
            <li> As over the top as those Old Spice ads tend to be, there&#x27;s nothing out of the ordinary going on with this two in one shampoo/conditioner from the company. It&#x27;s not overly fragrant and it washes out easily without any leftover greasy feeling after you&#x27;re done. While not too fragrant, it does smell nice in a subtle way. The conditioner element softens your hair enough to notice and leaves your hair feeling nice and clean. I can recommend this product with no reservations as I found it to be both effective and pleasant enough without getting too ridiculous in terms of scent.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a shampoo and conditioner combination. The scent was okay.  This is a good product for the gym where you want to minimize the stuff that you carry with you when you shower up after your workout.</li>
            <li> This is a nice and thick and creamy 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner, although if I&#x27;m being honest, it smells so good you can use it as a body wash, too!  Most shampoo/conditioners do not work well in my hair because it&#x27;s longer, and even though this is a guy&#x27;s product, I tried it out. I&#x27;ve actually gotten more comments on my hair today for it&#x27;s bounce and shine than ever before.  The scent is not so strong that it will turn anyone off - in fact, it&#x27;s perfectly scented for getting up close!</li>
            <li> My husband will wash his hair with any product that I put in the shower for him. He doesn&#x27;t care if it is top of the line, organic, expensive or bottom of the shelf, generic brand cheap. He&#x27;s a simple kind of guy. His hair is super fine and a little thin so he usually doesn&#x27;t use a conditioner, as most of them weigh the hair down and plaster it against his scalp. He did like the texture of both this Swagger and the Timber that he tried out last month. Both have a pleasant smell that reminds him of his younger days when almost everyone wore Old Spice after shave. The thing that has him most interested is the marketing blurbs on the bottles. Swagger promises to :  will leave your hair so cocky youll need to buy it a pair of expensive mirrored sunglasses. Timber says,&amp;#34; The strength of a redwood and the mystic scent of the mint in Timber is power for your hair, soul and jet-powered chainsaw.&amp;#34; He is beginning to think this stuff is better than Viagra and much cheaper too. Who cares if your hair is clean and conditioned if you have those mirrored expensive sunglasses and that jet-powered chainsaw.</li>
            <li> Old Spice Swagger 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner is good shampoo.The best thing about it is its smells really good. It does a decent job of cleaning my sons hair and it leaves it shiney. He has thick curly hair. He thinks its a little bit more difficult to comb which is a little strange but overall it does the job and he likes it.He would recommend it .</li>
            <li> Good price perfect smell~I got it for my husband and I love it~</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner delivers everything promised and more. After using it, my husband&#x27;s hair was clean feeling and silky soft. Softer than it has been in a long time. The scent is a very mild, pleasing, manly scent that reminds me and my husband of some type exotic wood or maybe exotic wood related spice.  Perhaps something you might smell on a Caribbean pirate sailing ship or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the scent, my husband really likes it and the shampoo and conditioner do a great job. I expect we will be buying this again once this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> This actually smells pretty decent and leaves your hair feeling good after rinsing, not slimey like some combo shampoo and conditioners can. The old express that This Isn&#x27;t Your Father&#x27;s Old Spice is correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t be buying it because I firmly and passionately oppose shampoos that are tested on animals. There are no legal requirements or regulations that necessitate testing on animals (usually rabbits, because they do not have tear ducts in their eyes), so it is a practice that requires justification in the light of heightened concern over the unnecessary suffering of animals. At this point we have acquired a staggering amount of silly information about what particular chemicals will do to the eyes of rabbits, so there really isn&#x27;t much of a need to develop new tests and accumulate more info. I don&#x27;t believe there is a big demand from consumers that rabbits and other animals have shampoo poured into their eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while this is a better product than I would have expected out of the Old Spice name, I could never with a clear conscience buy it.</li>
            <li> Old Spice has really stepped up their game. These new products smell great, especially Swagger. The 2 in 1 is good for people with shorter hair. If you wear your hair long, you may need more conditioner. The bottle lasts a long time, so it is a good value too</li>
            <li> Old Spice 2 in 1 shampoos come in a few different smells. My husband tried out both the Swagger and the Pure Sport. He much prefers the Pure Sport smell to this Swagger. Swagger might appeal to more of a 20 something than a 40 something because it has more of a cologne smell. The deodorant that he wears is also usually the Fresh or the Pure Sport so it is nice to match the scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two that he tried work the same and leave his hair soft and clean. It is just a preference in smell that gives this one a 3 star and the Pure Sport a 4 star ranking.</li>
            <li> Swagger 2 in 1 shampoo plus conditioner is a men’s hair care product with a nice scent and decent conditioning ability. A small amount is all it takes for a short- haired person like me to lather up, rinse, and be ready to start my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like using conditioner on occasion and this 2 in 1 product is pretty good at cleaning and softening the hair. Probably the first quality you will notice is the scent- it is masculine and cologne- like, with the ability to linger for a while after use. I find it nice and while certainly noticeable, it isn’t overpowering like some shampoos can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I like the cleaning ability of this shampoo and it does leave the hair feeling soft. About the only possible drawback is that it does leave your hair feeling a little weighed down. My hair is thickest in the back and I notice that, once my hair dries, I can still feel some of the conditioner even though I am careful to rinse thoroughly. I then have to comb through once more to get my hair to feel smooth. It’s not a huge issue, but it could be a problem for those who don’t like to feel any trace whatsoever of a hair care product after leaving the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swagger 2 in 1 is sold in a large size bottle and if your hair is short like mine, a single bottle will last a good long time. I tend to use it only 3 days per week so at my rate, this bottle will last me for a few months. The residue left on the hair could be a problem for some men, but other than that, it’s a good hair care product overall and one I recommend.</li>
            <li> Old Spice&#x27;s rebranding campaign has totally worked on me. When I saw they were making shampoo now, I jumped on it. I used to just grab the most bland, least scented thing I could find on the shelf but I have to admit, Old Spice shampoo has a nice scent to it. I had been using &amp;#34;Bulk Up&amp;#34; but now I&#x27;m trying the &amp;#34;Swagger&amp;#34;. Swagger is a little lighter on the scent but both are excellent. In a world of scented mango rosebud shampoos, it can be hard for a guy to find something his style, but Old Spice has you covered.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Smells like the rest of the &#x27;Swagger&#x27; stuff. As a dude, I&#x27;m not a big connoisseur of hair products. But this stuff works great. This bottle will last a long time, as it doesn&#x27;t require much for each use. Heck, it even works great as a body wash. For the price compared to similar products, you probly can&#x27;t beat the value. I&#x27;ll buy it again when I run out in....who knows...6 months?</li>
            <li> Has a really strong smell however really love the design and look. Not such a fan of the shampoo though. I think I&#x27;ll stick with their deodorant instead.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully. Large size means too much at once, can&#x27;t finish before next delivery is due.</li>
            <li> Love this product works great everything it says it does it does!</li>
            <li> Husband loves this stuff. It makes him smell manly!</li>
            <li> The hubby said I like the smell. The smell stays in your hair for a long time and makes your hair look good. The problem with this shampoo is that it doesn&#x27;t really fight off dandruff.</li>
            <li> I thought 2 in 1 meant shampoo and body wash, I should&#x27;ve read closer, its shanpoo and conditioner. So what, my hair&#x27;s clean and apparently conditioned too.</li>
            <li> The tagline for this was hilarious so how could I ignore getting it?  I gave it to my husband to try out, assuming he would know what to do with it.  Well, he thought it was body wash and complained that it didn&#x27;t lather very well, but it sure smelled great all day.  The next day he used it as intended and described the shampoo as &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; with a very good lather, and that his hair felt very soft afterwards.  My husband is Puerto Rican with very curly jet-black hair, and he never uses conditioner.  This product left his hair so nice and soft and the scent really does last all day.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome compliment to the body wash I&#x27;ve been using for years. Also, it&#x27;s great to take to the gym when I don&#x27;t want to carry around two things to wash myself with. I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s taken Old Spice this long to come out with something like this (or for me to notice that they&#x27;d come out with something like this).</li>
            <li> Being mostly bald I got this for my nephew. But he is also mostly bald. I hope it smells nice.</li>
            <li> A great shampoo and conditioner with a masculine but not overpowering scent. Been using it on my hair and very pleased with the results. Like the large volume in the container.</li>
            <li> Nice scent that doesn&#x27;t come across too strong.  Most men I know don&#x27;t use conditioner - or at least won&#x27;t admit to it, and the same is true in my house.  So a shampoo that contains a conditioner is new to him.  The response I received when asking what he originally thought of it was, it&#x27;s okay and he liked the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He did cooperate for my review and after using this for awhile, went back to his old shampoo.  That only lasted 1 day and his appreciation for this shampoo/conditioner combination went up a great deal.  His hair feels better and actually has more volume to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s now sold on it and would get it again.</li>
            <li> Old Spice&#x27;s Swagger Shampoo &amp; Conditioner has a manly fragrance and comes in a manly-sized bottle. If you&#x27;re looking for a 2-in-1 hair product that leaves your hair clean, moisturized, and smelling great, this is a good product. I especially like the large bottle size... you don&#x27;t run out nearly as fast.</li>
            <li> It used to be that shampoo was relatively straightforward. Companies claimed that it cleaned your hair, perhaps smelled nice, and hopefully left your hair manageable. Aside from that, they told you to lather, rinse and repeat. As time went on, they told you to repeat if necessary but the latest trend in shampoo for men is to tell you that a single application is all you need. In this case, it works. I was perfectly happy with my old shampoo, which also included conditioner. I was surprised that this left my hair feeling softer. Prior to this I was using a men&#x27;s shampoo by Dove. It works well and I still like it, but I like the Old Spice better. My hair feels better to the touch when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s not much more to say about shampoo, and manufacturers seem to have that problem too. This shampoo promises to \\&quot;leave your hair so cocky you&#x27;ll need to buy it a pair of expensive mirrored sunglasses.\\&quot; I have absolutely no idea what that&#x27;s even supposed to mean, but I suppose their advertising agency figured nobody would pay them for the slogan \\&quot;for smooth and soft hair.\\&quot; It&#x27;s good shampoo, it does an excellent job with my hair, but not a single person has come up to me and told me how cocky my hair looks. There are no surprises here. If you ask yourself what you might expect a shampoo to be like that&#x27;s made by Old Spice, this would be it.</li>
            <li> Old Spice Swagger is a great conditioner shampoo product. Highly recommended.  Leaves my hair feeling and smelling great.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the smell, and its a great value.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see a 2-in-1 shampoo added to the Swagger scented product line. However, I have found that I need to periodically use a different shampoo &amp; conditioner to counterbalance how dried out this leaves my hair over time. If this is a problem with a high &amp; tight flattop, I do not want to know how bad it would be with longer hair.</li>
            <li> Great smelling shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, works well</li>
            <li> Cheap and good, got it for about $1.50 which is less than what most people pay for shampoo or conditioner alone.</li>
            <li> Not your granddad&#x27;s old spice!  This has a new fresh smell!  Lathers great with a bit of conditioning.  Helps to smooth dry winter hair.  Large bottle and you don&#x27;t need a lot.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I like the Old Spice 2in1&#x27;s as much or more than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  My mainstay thus far has been Head &amp; Shoulders.  The biggest difference is the lather on the Old Spice.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get a lot of foam.  There are a range of scents.  I&#x27;ve tried the Pure Sport and Swagger.  I like them both, but I prefer Swagger.  In terms of the broader family of Old Spice scents, I tend to prefer Original.</li>
            <li> Old Spice has been something that I&#x27;ve always associated with old people, like my grandpa.In recent years, however, they&#x27;ve done some good marketing and changed their image. I figured I would try out the shampoo/conditioner to see what I thought. Overall, it seems to work as good as any other shampoo/conditioner combo that I&#x27;ve used in the past. I think the combo never works quite as well as individual shampoo and conditioner but since I&#x27;m a guy and have short hair, it&#x27;s not that big of a deal. It smells good but isn&#x27;t overpowering. That&#x27;s a good thing but the trade-off is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The shampoo / conditioner worked well, hair had a faint pleasant smell when dry and had that clean conditioned feel when as well. The shampoo / conditioner worked as well as any standalone conditioner I have tried. I am very happy with this product and it has a good value here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I used this myself this morning, as did my husband last night. I like the scent. It&#x27;s woodsy and has a hint of spicyness. It really stays in the hair for a long time too. However, I didn&#x27;t (and neither did my husband) feel that it was very conditioning. My hair felt a little rough immediately after my shower and wasn&#x27;t easy to brush through like when it&#x27;s conditioned. My husband&#x27;s hair is softer than normal. It&#x27;s been two hours since my shower and I&#x27;m still getting a very strong smell from the shampoo and my hair is now soft feeling. I did not use any product on my hair though and it&#x27;s quite frizzy and puffy. My usual conditioner helps with these issues and this one isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is a nice 2 on 1 combo shampoo and conditioner from Old Spice.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a nice big bottle of it too so you&#x27;ll get many uses.&lt;br /&gt;it smells pretty darn good and it cleans my hair nicely.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good but do not use this shampoo every day, it is very very harsh on your hair. I&#x27;m a 22 year old guy and have started to see strands of hair coming off my head ever since I started using this shampoo. I&#x27;ve changed nothing with my diet and am physically active. I will not be using this product anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.  Nothing special.  I would buy it again, but it&#x27; not any better than any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews scared me when I read it. This shampoo is the best shampoo ever. 5:00 am took a shower and around 2:00 pm I still can smell the great scent of it. I love it and I will keep buying it again and again.</li>
            <li> My brother uses this brand of deodorant and it smells great! Thought I would give the shampoo a shot for my hubby. Smells awesome and he loves it!</li>
            <li> I like the smell. The smell stays in your hair for a long time and makes your hair look good. The problem with this shampoo is that it dosen&#x27;t really fight off dandruff. It makes a lot of white stuff come off your head. I have long hair so maybe thats only for those with long hair or maybe its exclusivelly for me. Either way, Im going for something else.</li>
            <li> I typically use J. Ligett&#x27;s old-fashioned bar shampoo (without a conditioner), but received this as a sample for review, so I&#x27;m giving it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way this stuff smells. Masculine, but still floral, almost like a cologne... but with a clean, soapy hint as well. Very nice, and it actually helps me sleep smelling this after I wash my hair. Pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It creates a very rich, thick lather and after washing my hair feels exceedingly clean. Strangely, it also feels very light while still feeling moisturized. Normally I found combination shampoo/conditioner products in the past to either a) dry my hair out or b) weigh it down with a weird residue. I&#x27;m pleasant surprised to find that this product strikes a good balance between clean / light / moisturized hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is fairly large, and is a decent value for the current price (just shy of seven bucks). For its combination of price, pleasant scent, and its clean / light / gentle feel on the hair, I give it 5 stars.</li>
