            <li>basically a good product.&lt;br /&gt;Negative:  The picture of the product is NOT what you get</li>
            <li>Product was really good</li>
            <li>but it seems good quality</li>
            <li>just used it once did a good job</li>
            <li>I got a good quality of cocoa butter and don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it for my hair and body butter mixes.</li>
            <li>It has a good chocolate aroma.  </li>
            <li>but when used to make things like sunscreen and lotions they melt well and keep your skin feeling silky smooth with a nice undertone of chocolate, yum!!</li>

            <li>, in actuality - is astounding to me.  </li>
            <li>You will not be thrilled with the packaging</li>
            <li>Nice, whipped cream, for you to store in glass</li>
            <li>This product smells really nice</li>
            <li>I ordered this cocoa butter to make my own moisturizing bars and whipped body butter.  </li>
            <li>Smells SO good and chocolately....and love it in my homemade body butter.</li>
            <li>You can take it out and warm it up in your hand like a lotion bar.  </li>
            <li>smells delicious, and it had a much stronger chocolate scent than another brand i had ordered just days before.  </li>
            <li>I am using this product to make my own hair concoctions.</li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>Nice package.</li>
            <li>I let a tub of it sit in sink of warm water while I shower</li>
            <li>I use it for my belly butter concoction and for when I make my own chocolates.</li>
            <li>VERY strong cocoa smell, great, smooth texture.  </li>
            <li>Great prices and quick shipment.</li>
            <li>When I seen this on my door step I was excited to get it inside and see if it was as good as I hoped.</li>
            <li>; It has an extraordinary aroma and texture and very suitable for chocolate making.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;eat</li>
            <li>I Love this product.</li>
            <li>Plus I love the smell....</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>But this is a great natural product for making your own skin remedy recipes.</li>
            <li>Oh and the smell is wonderful open up a Hershey&#x27;s bar</li>
            <li>I have bought this product many times, and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>so that says a lot..  :-)</li>
            <li>I ordered this after getting a cocoa butter massage and falling in love with the scent.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to start making things with this stuff, the scent will make your mouth water and the feeling of cocoa butter just can&#x27;t be replicated :)</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth texture and taste.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product have bought it twice already!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>Love this stuff will buy agin</li>
            <li>the shipping/handling was more than the product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, which is correctly described as a hershey&#x27;s chocolate bar.</li>
            <li>It has such a beautiful scent too!!!</li>
            <li>and I move about a lot better.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing like sweet chocolate.</li>
            <li>Cooling recipe mixture is, in my opinion, best done at room temperature, so long as you have air conditioner in that</li>
            <li>The smell alone is worth it, very good moisturizer and much healthier for the skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to use it!  </li>
            <li>If you.love cocoa butter sticks, you will deFinitely not be disappointed!</li>
            <li>This makes it more easily softened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>use with coconut oil to make my own natural facial and body lotions-smells delightful and no chemicals on my skin-just soft and smelling wonderful</li>
            <li>that brand smelled good, too, but did not smell nearly as strong and good as this brand, and i had the open containers side by side to be able to compare them.  </li>
            <li>I can negotiate the stairs a lot more comfortably</li>
            <li>The pain is still there, but the swelling has subsided and I am a lot more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The product itself seems of superior value but the packaging not so much.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and works great for everything I&#x27;ve used it for so far (eg body butter, soap, and lotion).  </li>
            <li>and once it dissolves it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t soften as easily as a pre-prepared massage bar.  </li>
            <li>Hold a chunk close to the torso or under the arm or inside the elbow for a while, it&#x27;ll soften and will be easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to store.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to use after shower.</li>
            <li>Is cocoa butter supposed to smell so strong?</li>
            <li>Love, love love the real cocoa scent this butter delivers.</li>
            <li>Pure and refined!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find a place where I could get it so easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>Black soap is excellent from this company as well.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the smell tremendously.</li>
            <li>But I am concerned now, because they no longer say its \\&quot;Edible\\&quot;,  which is important to me.  </li>
            <li>The plastic jar is cheap and the seller knows this.</li>
            <li>IT WAS SUCH A GREAT DEAL</li>
            <li>great as a lotion, I melt some Dow add essential oils</li>
            <li>You do NOT get Amazon Prime free shipping with this company and, crappy packaging notwithstanding, you will pay through the nose for the \\&quot;handling.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Cheap packaging, pay through the nose for shipping and</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been really fantastic.</li>
            <li>Bought it to make my own sugar free &amp;#34;chocolate chips&amp;#34; and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin so soft and smells so good.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>My wife found offensive even when significantly diluted in coconut oil.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve been cheated out of 2.4 oz of product which is fairly significant considering that&#x27;s about 15% of what I should have received (or $1.39)...but other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>It weighs a full pound in the container</li>
            <li>I use this product to make bath and body products with and I will be purchasing a lot more real soon</li>
            <li>This cocao butter is imported from Ghana where they grow the cocoa pods, so it&#x27;s really fresh and rich, and SMELLS</li>
            <li>Other then that its great.</li>
            <li>Just do research before purchasing on how to adequately use the product.</li>
            <li>The jar doesn&#x27;t seem too flimsy to me, it wasn&#x27;t damaged and it came in 2 days, very fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>I think to sell this natural organic products better, the seller should always give instructions and methods to use them.</li>
            <li>It still melts nicely with body heat for topical applications.</li>
            <li>This is a winter staple in our house, I put in Lemon or rose essential oils to keep the smell fresher.</li>
            <li>HalalEveryDay is my favorite place to buy Cocoa Butter and all of my natural products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cocoa butter came in the package pictured, it is in nice sized chunks which is actually convenient</li>
            <li>This is probably useful far more than lip balm.</li>
            <li>It melts very well, and has a rich chocolate smell.  </li>
            <li>AND THE PIECES WERE THE RIGHT SIZE</li>
            <li>Great raw product.</li>
            <li>Great for making your own chocolate especially if you need a low carb (low sugar) option.</li>
            <li>They spread very well and moisturizes very well and smooth...</li>
            <li>Just to be perfectly clear here&#x27;s a definition: \\&quot;Actual, computed, or estimated weight of a good without its container and/or packaging.</li>
            <li>This raw cocoa butter is amazing!</li>
            <li>Maybe try putting it in hot bath water.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the exact smell.</li>
            <li>I will order more in the future from this company.  </li>
            <li>This is the first cocoa butter to come with a safety seal, which I appreciate since I am purchasing this for cooking and baking.</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing this item.</li>
            <li>I would have rather had more uniform smaller chunks.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really care!  </li>
            <li>Leave the jar in a sink of hot water while you shower and apply when it is in liquid form.</li>
            <li>and I was left holding the lid while most of the cocoa butter went on the floor.</li>
            <li>I used it to make body butters and lip balms, and they turned out wonderfully soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>To me it make more sense to find a new container that is AIR TIGHT and is able to be used by the buyer.</li>
            <li>I was a little girl, my aunt used to give us aluminum molds with globs of cocoa butter to take pool-side; we placed them on the cement walks around our pool; the cocoa butter melted; we used it on our skin to prevent burning; worked like a charm!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note of caution:  If you plan to use the cocoa butter to make some cream, make sure the recipe you plan to use is accurate to a \\&quot;T.\\</li>
            <li>Positive:  </li>
            <li>It has a very strong chocolate scent, stronger than other cocoa butters I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have only made one batch of moisturizing bars because the cocoa butter has too strong of a cocoa smell.  </li>
            <li>The strong smell is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I think it takes some getting use to, but once you melt it down it can be very good for use with other oils.</li>
            <li>I really like this cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely buy from them again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to, but it seems alright to me.  </li>
            <li>Chocolate aroma is intense.</li>
            <li>It coats the skin really well.</li>
            <li>This makes it much easier to use.</li>
            <li>and it helps so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely one of the more natural options on Amazon.</li>
            <li>After about 6 weeks, I noticed I can now easily stand and walk after sitting for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I shaved the large chunks with a grater to measure it out without having to heat the butter to high temperatures.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real pain to melt, but that seems to be the nature of the substance, not a reflection on this particular brand.</li>
            <li>let it cool a bit, pour it back into the plastic container</li>
            <li>This is why I like this particular brand.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, and was exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for quality</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this option for the quality and ease of use.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for Cookies and Chocolates that I make, because it&#x27;s one of the most reasonable Raw Cocoa Butters on the Market.  </li>
            <li>easy to blend with the other ingredients needed.</li>
            <li>I am becoming more well versed in cocoa butter, they all seem to come a little different than the last depending on the brand.</li>
            <li>It was packaged nicely in a heavy plastic jar with a screw top lid.</li>
            <li>In the past this was a great product for Brownies and other Chocolate type desserts that I have made.  </li>
            <li>But it is still a great value and such a tiny bit goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li>so I can be sure it&#x27;s air tight to keep it&#x27;s freshness!</li>
            <li>I can live with that.</li>
            <li>I cannot live with that.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased when I received my raw cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>So, until they start marketing this Raw Cocoa Butter as \\&quot;Ediable\\&quot; and safe to use in Cooking and Baking.  </li>
            <li>so I continued to search and found a better price on Raw Cocoa Butter, so went with that.  </li>
            <li>It is raw and much more natural.</li>
            <li>This brand seems to be more heat stable than other brands I have purchased because it arrived in irregular little chunks that moved freely about the container instead of one big melted mass like the others.</li>
            <li>have given this concoction to friends and co-workers and I am hoping they will experience the same positive results.  </li>
            <li>The quality is super and will make nice cold cream bars and goat milk soap.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, my kids smell like cookies everyday and this truly helps their skin in these dry winter months!</li>
            <li>This time, whip from low to very high speed.  </li>
            <li>Used it for hard lotion bars and it melted nicely and mixed well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably not used to raw cocoa butter, but this smell was too strong.</li>
            <li>I ever  used in my whole entire life.</li>
            <li>I have tried writing directly to the company to find if this is still \\&quot;Edible\\&quot; Cocoa Butter, but have not receieved an answer yet.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft.  </li>
            <li>I was so surprised at the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Smells terrific, if mixed properly its super velvety on your skin.</li>
            <li>Update, have used this in chap stick and lotion bars and love it, only downside is my other half doesn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li>My handsome little grandbaby loves to smear it all over his little body, it has even helped with the eczema on his cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in shavings in the container and because of the rich hard nature of the butter it does not fill the container it comes in.</li>
            <li>With that being said, every few dollars saved is a few more dollars in your pocket.</li>
            <li>and my hands get really dry and cracked in my busy season and use my lotion bar every day</li>
    </ol>

            <li> like always good butter</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> This smells so good like a chocolate bar.  </li>
            <li> Arrived in good time and good packaging.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> This is good cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li> Appears to be good quality butter.</li>
            <li> basically a good product.&lt;br /&gt;Negative:  The picture of the product is NOT what you get</li>
            <li> Product was really good</li>
            <li> but it seems good quality</li>
            <li> just used it once did a good job</li>
            <li> I got a good quality of cocoa butter and don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it for my hair and body butter mixes.</li>
            <li> It has a good chocolate aroma.  </li>
            <li> but when used to make things like sunscreen and lotions they melt well and keep your skin feeling silky smooth with a nice undertone of chocolate, yum!!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> I really do love this stuff!  </li>

            <li> Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> , in actuality - is astounding to me.  </li>
            <li> You will not be thrilled with the packaging</li>
            <li> Nice, whipped cream, for you to store in glass</li>
            <li> This product smells really nice</li>
            <li> I ordered this cocoa butter to make my own moisturizing bars and whipped body butter.  </li>
            <li> Smells SO good and chocolately....and love it in my homemade body butter.</li>
            <li> You can take it out and warm it up in your hand like a lotion bar.  </li>
            <li> smells delicious, and it had a much stronger chocolate scent than another brand i had ordered just days before.  </li>
            <li> I am using this product to make my own hair concoctions.</li>
            <li> Nice scent.</li>
            <li> Nice package.</li>
            <li> I let a tub of it sit in sink of warm water while I shower</li>
            <li> I use it for my belly butter concoction and for when I make my own chocolates.</li>
            <li> VERY strong cocoa smell, great, smooth texture.  </li>
            <li> Great prices and quick shipment.</li>
            <li> When I seen this on my door step I was excited to get it inside and see if it was as good as I hoped.</li>
            <li> ; It has an extraordinary aroma and texture and very suitable for chocolate making.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;eat</li>
            <li> I Love this product.</li>
            <li> Plus I love the smell....</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> But this is a great natural product for making your own skin remedy recipes.</li>
            <li> Oh and the smell is wonderful open up a Hershey&#x27;s bar</li>
            <li> I have bought this product many times, and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> so that says a lot..  :-)</li>
            <li> I ordered this after getting a cocoa butter massage and falling in love with the scent.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to start making things with this stuff, the scent will make your mouth water and the feeling of cocoa butter just can&#x27;t be replicated :)</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth texture and taste.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product have bought it twice already!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> Love this stuff will buy agin</li>
            <li> the shipping/handling was more than the product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, which is correctly described as a hershey&#x27;s chocolate bar.</li>
            <li> It has such a beautiful scent too!!!</li>
            <li> and I move about a lot better.  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing like sweet chocolate.</li>
            <li> Cooling recipe mixture is, in my opinion, best done at room temperature, so long as you have air conditioner in that</li>
            <li> The smell alone is worth it, very good moisturizer and much healthier for the skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited to use it!  </li>
            <li> If you.love cocoa butter sticks, you will deFinitely not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This makes it more easily softened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> use with coconut oil to make my own natural facial and body lotions-smells delightful and no chemicals on my skin-just soft and smelling wonderful</li>
            <li> that brand smelled good, too, but did not smell nearly as strong and good as this brand, and i had the open containers side by side to be able to compare them.  </li>
            <li> I can negotiate the stairs a lot more comfortably</li>
            <li> The pain is still there, but the swelling has subsided and I am a lot more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The product itself seems of superior value but the packaging not so much.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and works great for everything I&#x27;ve used it for so far (eg body butter, soap, and lotion).  </li>
            <li> and once it dissolves it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t soften as easily as a pre-prepared massage bar.  </li>
            <li> Hold a chunk close to the torso or under the arm or inside the elbow for a while, it&#x27;ll soften and will be easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to store.</li>
            <li> so it is easy to use after shower.</li>
            <li> Is cocoa butter supposed to smell so strong?</li>
            <li> Love, love love the real cocoa scent this butter delivers.</li>
            <li> Pure and refined!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find a place where I could get it so easily and quickly.</li>
            <li> Black soap is excellent from this company as well.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the smell tremendously.</li>
            <li> But I am concerned now, because they no longer say its \\&quot;Edible\\&quot;,  which is important to me.  </li>
            <li> The plastic jar is cheap and the seller knows this.</li>
            <li> IT WAS SUCH A GREAT DEAL</li>
            <li> great as a lotion, I melt some Dow add essential oils</li>
            <li> You do NOT get Amazon Prime free shipping with this company and, crappy packaging notwithstanding, you will pay through the nose for the \\&quot;handling.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Cheap packaging, pay through the nose for shipping and</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been really fantastic.</li>
            <li> Bought it to make my own sugar free &amp;#34;chocolate chips&amp;#34; and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin so soft and smells so good.</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> My wife found offensive even when significantly diluted in coconut oil.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been cheated out of 2.4 oz of product which is fairly significant considering that&#x27;s about 15% of what I should have received (or $1.39)...but other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> It weighs a full pound in the container</li>
            <li> I use this product to make bath and body products with and I will be purchasing a lot more real soon</li>
            <li> This cocao butter is imported from Ghana where they grow the cocoa pods, so it&#x27;s really fresh and rich, and SMELLS</li>
            <li> Other then that its great.</li>
            <li> Just do research before purchasing on how to adequately use the product.</li>
            <li> The jar doesn&#x27;t seem too flimsy to me, it wasn&#x27;t damaged and it came in 2 days, very fast delivery!  </li>
            <li> I think to sell this natural organic products better, the seller should always give instructions and methods to use them.</li>
            <li> It still melts nicely with body heat for topical applications.</li>
            <li> This is a winter staple in our house, I put in Lemon or rose essential oils to keep the smell fresher.</li>
            <li> HalalEveryDay is my favorite place to buy Cocoa Butter and all of my natural products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cocoa butter came in the package pictured, it is in nice sized chunks which is actually convenient</li>
            <li> This is probably useful far more than lip balm.</li>
            <li> It melts very well, and has a rich chocolate smell.  </li>
            <li> AND THE PIECES WERE THE RIGHT SIZE</li>
            <li> Great raw product.</li>
            <li> Great for making your own chocolate especially if you need a low carb (low sugar) option.</li>
            <li> They spread very well and moisturizes very well and smooth...</li>
            <li> Just to be perfectly clear here&#x27;s a definition: \\&quot;Actual, computed, or estimated weight of a good without its container and/or packaging.</li>
            <li> This raw cocoa butter is amazing!</li>
            <li> Maybe try putting it in hot bath water.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the exact smell.</li>
            <li> I will order more in the future from this company.  </li>
            <li> This is the first cocoa butter to come with a safety seal, which I appreciate since I am purchasing this for cooking and baking.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> I would have rather had more uniform smaller chunks.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really care!  </li>
            <li> Leave the jar in a sink of hot water while you shower and apply when it is in liquid form.</li>
            <li> and I was left holding the lid while most of the cocoa butter went on the floor.</li>
            <li> I used it to make body butters and lip balms, and they turned out wonderfully soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> To me it make more sense to find a new container that is AIR TIGHT and is able to be used by the buyer.</li>
            <li> I was a little girl, my aunt used to give us aluminum molds with globs of cocoa butter to take pool-side; we placed them on the cement walks around our pool; the cocoa butter melted; we used it on our skin to prevent burning; worked like a charm!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note of caution:  If you plan to use the cocoa butter to make some cream, make sure the recipe you plan to use is accurate to a \\&quot;T.\\</li>
            <li> Positive:  </li>
            <li> It has a very strong chocolate scent, stronger than other cocoa butters I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have only made one batch of moisturizing bars because the cocoa butter has too strong of a cocoa smell.  </li>
            <li> The strong smell is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I think it takes some getting use to, but once you melt it down it can be very good for use with other oils.</li>
            <li> I really like this cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li> I will absolutely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to, but it seems alright to me.  </li>
            <li> Chocolate aroma is intense.</li>
            <li> It coats the skin really well.</li>
            <li> This makes it much easier to use.</li>
            <li> and it helps so much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely one of the more natural options on Amazon.</li>
            <li> After about 6 weeks, I noticed I can now easily stand and walk after sitting for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I shaved the large chunks with a grater to measure it out without having to heat the butter to high temperatures.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real pain to melt, but that seems to be the nature of the substance, not a reflection on this particular brand.</li>
            <li> let it cool a bit, pour it back into the plastic container</li>
            <li> This is why I like this particular brand.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, and was exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for quality</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this option for the quality and ease of use.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for Cookies and Chocolates that I make, because it&#x27;s one of the most reasonable Raw Cocoa Butters on the Market.  </li>
            <li> easy to blend with the other ingredients needed.</li>
            <li> I am becoming more well versed in cocoa butter, they all seem to come a little different than the last depending on the brand.</li>
            <li> It was packaged nicely in a heavy plastic jar with a screw top lid.</li>
            <li> In the past this was a great product for Brownies and other Chocolate type desserts that I have made.  </li>
            <li> But it is still a great value and such a tiny bit goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> so I can be sure it&#x27;s air tight to keep it&#x27;s freshness!</li>
            <li> I can live with that.</li>
            <li> I cannot live with that.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased when I received my raw cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> So, until they start marketing this Raw Cocoa Butter as \\&quot;Ediable\\&quot; and safe to use in Cooking and Baking.  </li>
            <li> so I continued to search and found a better price on Raw Cocoa Butter, so went with that.  </li>
            <li> It is raw and much more natural.</li>
            <li> This brand seems to be more heat stable than other brands I have purchased because it arrived in irregular little chunks that moved freely about the container instead of one big melted mass like the others.</li>
            <li> have given this concoction to friends and co-workers and I am hoping they will experience the same positive results.  </li>
            <li> The quality is super and will make nice cold cream bars and goat milk soap.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, my kids smell like cookies everyday and this truly helps their skin in these dry winter months!</li>
            <li> This time, whip from low to very high speed.  </li>
            <li> Used it for hard lotion bars and it melted nicely and mixed well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably not used to raw cocoa butter, but this smell was too strong.</li>
            <li> I ever  used in my whole entire life.</li>
            <li> I have tried writing directly to the company to find if this is still \\&quot;Edible\\&quot; Cocoa Butter, but have not receieved an answer yet.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft.  </li>
            <li> I was so surprised at the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Smells terrific, if mixed properly its super velvety on your skin.</li>
            <li> Update, have used this in chap stick and lotion bars and love it, only downside is my other half doesn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> My handsome little grandbaby loves to smear it all over his little body, it has even helped with the eczema on his cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in shavings in the container and because of the rich hard nature of the butter it does not fill the container it comes in.</li>
            <li> With that being said, every few dollars saved is a few more dollars in your pocket.</li>
            <li> and my hands get really dry and cracked in my busy season and use my lotion bar every day</li>
            <li> Then they have they think they&#x27;re in the right to leave negative feedback.  </li>
            <li> Comes in chunks and chunks last for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely clue less.</li>
            <li> I dry brush my entire body before entering the shower, or bath.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy at all and lasts a long time, the fragrance also lasts so you will smell divine all day.</li>
            <li> , i actualy melted it down and days later it was back to orginal hardness.</li>
            <li> sp dont waste time melting down the whole thing</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to melt the whole thing to get what I need like the other small jar I have.  </li>
            <li> I mixed it with my shea butter and other oils</li>
            <li> The 1 pound lasts me a very long time too, which is nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is natural in the raw no frills cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> However, I do eat it straight out of the tub after I&#x27;ve broken the chunks into smaller chunks.</li>
            <li> What I will not live with again is the shipping charge.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I got a few huge chunks and a lot of small chips.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars is because when I received this item the lid was loose so when I took it out of the  package the bottem half dropped</li>
            <li> Gross weight less tare weight equals</li>
            <li> and i have very dry skin...</li>
            <li> This one comes in a tub with chunks of cocoa butter, they look very dry</li>
            <li> Just know that raw coca butter is pretty hard.  </li>
            <li> As expected.  </li>
            <li> This product was not what I expected ...</li>
            <li> It smells and tastes as expected...</li>
            <li> You will have butter that&#x27;s like thin sheets of paper that melt so much faster when rubbed between the hands.</li>
            <li> It comes in big chunks - it&#x27;s not pellets or anything, which makes me think that it is actually raw.</li>
            <li> I am definitely using it everyday!</li>
            <li> Melts and blends well with other oils.</li>
            <li> but i also add mango butter and other oils when making my lotions.</li>
            <li> The smell can over power other ingredients</li>
            <li> the other &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; product was already in a (poured-into-the-container) cream(y-ish) form.  </li>
            <li> My cocoa butter arrived by the expected date and was just as described!</li>
            <li> This product was explained well by other consumers.</li>
            <li> I use liquid or solid black soap, then this raw butter.</li>
            <li> Although it has that nice result, the project we are doing requires less scent so we used so much less of this for the base ingredient.</li>
            <li> This product was hard to maneuver because it was packed so solid.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my skin and it has smoothed out some dark marks I had on my skin(chocolate toned skin) .</li>
            <li> The tiniest ones I can melt down and redo after the stuff cools</li>
            <li> Whatever clothing your wearing that covers your skin after rubbing down with this butter will still have the butter on it.</li>
            <li> I had difficulties with going up and down the stairs and standing up after sitting for a period of time.  </li>
            <li> I had to melt it down to use it.</li>
            <li> Melt it down in a microwave, add a little olive oil to the fully melted liquified butter, then allow it to reharden in the fridge.  </li>
            <li> It can be a little oily but it will dissolve into your skin rather quiklcy</li>
            <li> do little by little</li>
            <li> disregard the negative reviews by people who have no idea what they were buying and should not be let loose on the internet, with a credit card.</li>
            <li> , I put some in a microwave for a few seconds to soften it up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few cocoa butter oils.  </li>
            <li> but if you are looking for RAW product this is it.</li>
            <li> a comment or two in these reviews have mentioned that there is nothing to indicate that this raw cocoa butter brand is edible, but that is not true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t seem as raw as the product halal is selling.</li>
            <li> It is not a refreshing or soothing smell.  </li>
            <li> I combine some of the products and use them everyday!</li>
            <li> I usually blend it with my shea butter to eliminate the odor, which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> It is hard, and hard to soften to apply to skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rock hard chunk.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter was hard and did not mix well..</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> I am serious</li>
            <li> I bought this cocoa butter to make hard lotion bars and now I always smell like chocolate!  </li>
            <li> A few minutes after you apply it on your skin, it DOES NOT feel greasy!!!!</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would melt and be everywhere by the time it reached me.</li>
            <li> It comes in chunks and pieces, from which you can choose as you need apposed to digging and stabbing through a mold.</li>
            <li> Not saying it is a bad product, just dont know how to use it.</li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I Love this product. This best cocoa butter I ever  used in my whole entire life. Get this product!!!! I am serious</li>
            <li> I dont even know how to apply this product. It is hard, and hard to soften to apply to skin. Maybe try putting it in hot bath water. Im clueless. Not saying it is a bad product, just dont know how to use it. Just do research before purchasing on how to adequately use the product.</li>
            <li> I also bought a pound of this. It&#x27;s a rock hard chunk. I&#x27;ve not way to break it. And I dont know how to use it. I&#x27;m completely clue less. I think to sell this natural organic products better, the seller should always give instructions and methods to use them.</li>
            <li> I really do love this stuff!  It melts on the skin and makes a great moisturizer. I used it during pregnancy and after.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, the quality is excellent and the seller is fantastic.  I have already used it for making soap - it turned out just as it always has - excellent!  I will definitely purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Please disregard the negative reviews by people who have no idea what they were buying and should not be let loose on the internet, with a credit card. How anyone can purchase an item which they don&#x27;t know how to use - don&#x27;t know what it IS, in actuality - is astounding to me.  Then they have they think they&#x27;re in the right to leave negative feedback.  Unbelievable!  You&#x27;re on the computer, people - use Google!***</li>
            <li> Comes in chunks and chunks last for a very long time.  They spread very well and moisturizes very well and smooth...</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful addition to the lotion I was making.  It smells just like chocolate--but is an oil!  Really wonderful stuff--great for your skin!</li>
            <li> like always good butter</li>
            <li> This raw cocoa butter is amazing! Plus I love the smell....I mixed it with my shea butter and other oils and I am amazed at its moisturizing properties. I am definitely using it everyday!</li>
            <li> I love this product. The seller has an awesome line of products. I will continue to purchase from HalaEveryDay. Great prices and quick shipment.</li>
            <li> I had been on the hunt for this product in bulk, and there it was. It arrived quickly, and was exactly what I wanted and expected. I was very excited to find a place where I could get it so easily and quickly.</li>
            <li> As expected.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is natural in the raw no frills cocoa butter. You will not be thrilled with the packaging but if you are looking for RAW product this is it. I&#x27;ve mixed it with Shea and coconut oil and it&#x27;s amazing! If you are looking for something like Palmers then get Palmers with synthetic stuff in it. But this is a great natural product for making your own skin remedy recipes. Oh and the smell is wonderful open up a Hershey&#x27;s bar and that&#x27;s the exact smell.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased when I received my raw cocoa butter. I was afraid it would melt and be everywhere by the time it reached me. That was not the case. I opened up the jar and was instantly happy that i purchased the prouct. The smell of cocoa permeated the room. My daughter and I use the product twice a day. I microwave it for about 45 seconds and apply it as I would lotion and I also put it in her hair when I braid or twist it. This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this brand.  I will order more in the future from this company.  The quality is super and will make nice cold cream bars and goat milk soap.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product many times, and love it.  But I am concerned now, because they no longer say its \\&quot;Edible\\&quot;,  which is important to me.  I have been using it for Cookies and Chocolates that I make, because it&#x27;s one of the most reasonable Raw Cocoa Butters on the Market.  I have tried writing directly to the company to find if this is still \\&quot;Edible\\&quot; Cocoa Butter, but have not receieved an answer yet.  So, my quess is that it&#x27;s not \\&quot;Edible\\&quot;  So, until they start marketing this Raw Cocoa Butter as \\&quot;Ediable\\&quot; and safe to use in Cooking and Baking.  I will have to stop Using it.  :-(  I hope things will change soon.   In the past this was a great product for Brownies and other Chocolate type desserts that I have made.  NO I AM NOT SCARED OF SATURATED FAT. . . . . .SATURATED FAT IS NOT WHAT CAUSES HEART DESEASE.  Anyway, I hope this Company will look into selling it again as a Butter that can be used in foods.</li>
            <li> Well.  The cocoa butter smelled delicious.  I did not use a scale, but it looked like one pound. Good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was a little girl, my aunt used to give us aluminum molds with globs of cocoa butter to take pool-side; we placed them on the cement walks around our pool; the cocoa butter melted; we used it on our skin to prevent burning; worked like a charm!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note of caution:  If you plan to use the cocoa butter to make some cream, make sure the recipe you plan to use is accurate to a \\&quot;T.\\&quot;  Otherwise, you might wind up with melted cocoa butter ALL OVER your kitchen counters AND floors...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More notes:  Cooling recipe mixture is, in my opinion, best done at room temperature, so long as you have air conditioner in that room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, you might want to place the mixture in the REFRIGERATOR, not the freezer, for about 15 minutes.  Whip at very low speed of an electric mixer. Let it rest at room temperature.  Refrigerate for another 10 minutes.  Whip again.  This time, whip from low to very high speed.  I think you will like the results...Nice, whipped cream, for you to store in glass containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, do you know what is great?  A few minutes after you apply it on your skin, it DOES NOT feel greasy!!!!</li>
            <li> Yes, I bought this as a skin care product but when I opened the jar and out burst a SYMPHONY of CHOCOLATE I thought I might want to nibble it (I refrained.  I know it&#x27;s not meant to be eaten, LOL).  A beautiful additive to a skin/hair care product.</li>
            <li> I really like this cocoa butter.  It came in chunks and to make it easier to use on my body, I put some in a microwave for a few seconds to soften it up.  This smells so good like a chocolate bar.  My skin is so soft.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> This product smells really nice and once it dissolves it is easy to apply.  It can be a little oily but it will dissolve into your skin rather quiklcy and i have very dry skin...so that says a lot..  :-)</li>
            <li> I ordered this after getting a cocoa butter massage and falling in love with the scent.  It doesn&#x27;t soften as easily as a pre-prepared massage bar.  I found that I could apply it in two ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Melt it down in a microwave, add a little olive oil to the fully melted liquified butter, then allow it to reharden in the fridge.  This makes it more easily softened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Hold a chunk close to the torso or under the arm or inside the elbow for a while, it&#x27;ll soften and will be easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is wonderfully moisturizing and smells lovely.</li>
            <li> Love, love love the real cocoa scent this butter delivers. Combined with coconut oil, you have a an &amp;#34;Almond Joy&amp;#34; fragrance. Use it in my soaps and body butters. Arrived in good time and good packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered from another company before (Mountain Rose Herbs), who have excellent quality control and this matches what I&#x27;ve seen there.  Highly recommended for quality and it&#x27;s a good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> This cocao butter is imported from Ghana where they grow the cocoa pods, so it&#x27;s really fresh and rich, and SMELLS oh so chocolaty! Yum!! It&#x27;s in shavings in the container and because of the rich hard nature of the butter it does not fill the container it comes in. But it is still a great value and such a tiny bit goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> SO Thrilled with this product!!! Smells amazing and was a great price. Label notes that the shelf life is 3 years, just FYI. I can&#x27;t wait to start making things with this stuff, the scent will make your mouth water and the feeling of cocoa butter just can&#x27;t be replicated :)</li>
            <li> Some of it is flakes and some big honking chunks. The tiniest ones I can melt down and redo after the stuff cools down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It do get rid of the itch. and yet it is not greasy for ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already ordered a second pound of it to go in the freezer for next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dray</li>
            <li> I ordered this cocoa butter to make my own moisturizing bars and whipped body butter.  I have only made one batch of moisturizing bars because the cocoa butter has too strong of a cocoa smell.  It is not a refreshing or soothing smell.  I am very disappointed.  Is cocoa butter supposed to smell so strong?</li>
            <li> Pure and refined!!! Love it! I combine some of the products and use them everyday! my skin feels AMAZING!!!! Worth it!</li>
            <li> Loves the way this make my hands, elbows and feet feel. My handsome little grandbaby loves to smear it all over his little body, it has even helped with the eczema on his cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> Ordered for a project, and it came out so great. The smell alone is worth it, very good moisturizer and much healthier for the skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> Smells SO good and chocolately....and love it in my homemade body butter. I&#x27;ll be making some lotion bars next with it!</li>
            <li> Bought it to make my own sugar free &amp;#34;chocolate chips&amp;#34; and it worked very well. Nice and smooth texture and taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this same batch of Cocoa Butter twice now for making body butter at home. It&#x27;s definitely one of the more natural options on Amazon. It comes in big chunks - it&#x27;s not pellets or anything, which makes me think that it is actually raw. It melts very well, and has a rich chocolate smell.  The 1 pound lasts me a very long time too, which is nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used it for cooking, so I won&#x27;t speak to that.</li>
            <li> The packaging!! When I seen this on my door step I was excited to get it inside and see if it was as good as I hoped. The product itself seems of superior value but the packaging not so much. The plastic jar is cheap and the seller knows this. They put athletic tape around the bottom of the lid to keep critters out and to keep it from spilling during the shifting process that occurs during shipping. To me it make more sense to find a new container that is AIR TIGHT and is able to be used by the buyer. I now need to transfer this to another container so I can be sure it&#x27;s air tight to keep it&#x27;s freshness! This stuff has a 2-5 year shelf life if stored correctly!!</li>
            <li> This was everything I was looking for.  VERY strong cocoa smell, great, smooth texture.  Just know that raw coca butter is pretty hard.  You can take it out and warm it up in your hand like a lotion bar.  I will absolutely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I made shea, cocoa and coconut lotion for chrsitmas gifts. the qualifty is very good! The smell is amazing, my kids smell like cookies everyday and this truly helps their skin in these dry winter months!</li>
            <li> Smells edible. Melts and blends well with other oils. If you are looking for Coco butter stop searching. I highly recommend this option for the quality and ease of use. It comes in chunks and pieces, from which you can choose as you need apposed to digging and stabbing through a mold. :o)</li>
            <li> use with coconut oil to make my own natural facial and body lotions-smells delightful and no chemicals on my skin-just soft and smelling wonderful</li>
            <li> I bought this cocoa butter to make hard lotion bars and now I always smell like chocolate!  Plus it doesn&#x27;t even make my face break out.  LOVE this stuff and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> this stuff lasts me for 3 months max but i also add mango butter and other oils when making my lotions. This is a great buy and my skin and infant son skin adores it a lot</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product have bought it twice already! I use it in lotions,body bars and lip balms. The smell can over power other ingredients but if you dont mind smelling like chocolate that&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few cocoa butter oils.  For a decadent chocolate scent, this is an excellent choice! The package was delivered leak-tight as well, so no loss of oil in shipment.</li>
            <li> This product was not what I expected ... The cocoa butter was hard and did not mix well.. Will not purchase again..</li>
            <li> a comment or two in these reviews have mentioned that there is nothing to indicate that this raw cocoa butter brand is edible, but that is not true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from the product description: &amp;#34; It has an extraordinary aroma and texture and very suitable for chocolate making.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;eat away and enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i got it to make creams with, but will not hesitate to use it in cooking should the opportunity arise.  smells delicious, and it had a much stronger chocolate scent than another brand i had ordered just days before.  that brand smelled good, too, but did not smell nearly as strong and good as this brand, and i had the open containers side by side to be able to compare them.  the other &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; product was already in a (poured-into-the-container) cream(y-ish) form.  it didn&#x27;t seem as raw as the product halal is selling.</li>
            <li> great for what it was needed for</li>
            <li> I am using this product to make my own hair concoctions. It&#x27;s all I thought it would be. Great packaging.</li>
            <li> Great product; great seller, great price</li>
            <li> We simply love this product! Smells awesome and silky on my skin!</li>
            <li> WHEN I FOUND THIS ONSITE IT WAS SUCH A GREAT DEAL THAT I STOCKED UP.&lt;br /&gt;WORKS GREAT FOR CHAPPED HANDS, FEET AND THE PIECES WERE THE RIGHT SIZE</li>
            <li> Excellent product. The strong smell is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great for DIY skin care products</li>
            <li> Great for making your own chocolate especially if you need a low carb (low sugar) option. It&#x27;s all fat! Great for Keto diets!&lt;br /&gt;Also great as a lotion, I melt some Dow add essential oils and you have a great balm!</li>
            <li> Smelt great and felt equally great on my skin</li>
            <li> using for stretch marks! smells great, i actualy melted it down and days later it was back to orginal hardness. sp dont waste time melting down the whole thing do little by little</li>
            <li> This is good cocoa butter.  It smells fantastic and works great for everything I&#x27;ve used it for so far (eg body butter, soap, and lotion).  The only problem was the weight.  I ordered this 1 Lb (16 oz) jar and received 13.60 oz.  It weighs a full pound in the container but it says \\&quot;1 Lb Net Weight\\&quot; not gross.  Just to be perfectly clear here&#x27;s a definition: \\&quot;Actual, computed, or estimated weight of a good without its container and/or packaging. Gross weight less tare weight equals net weight.\\&quot;  So, I&#x27;ve been cheated out of 2.4 oz of product which is fairly significant considering that&#x27;s about 15% of what I should have received (or $1.39)...but other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to, but it seems alright to me.  It smells like I believe it should, feels like I imagined it would, and is definitely quite moisturizing.  It&#x27;s a real pain to melt, but that seems to be the nature of the substance, not a reflection on this particular brand.</li>
            <li> This is my third cocoa butter purchase on Amazon (each from different sellers/companies). This is the first cocoa butter to come with a safety seal, which I appreciate since I am purchasing this for cooking and baking. This brand seems to be more heat stable than other brands I have purchased because it arrived in irregular little chunks that moved freely about the container instead of one big melted mass like the others. It still melts nicely with body heat for topical applications. It smells and tastes as expected... Like unsweetened white chocolate.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing this item. I was happy with the cocoa butter. I enjoyed the smell tremendously.</li>
            <li> Great product of use in making lotion bars. Nice scent. easy to blend with the other ingredients needed.Nice package. Easy to store.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff will buy agin</li>
            <li> Appears to be good quality butter. Pleasant chocolate scent. I let a tub of it sit in sink of warm water while I shower so it is easy to use after shower.</li>
            <li> Positive:  Wonderful smell, excellent texture, basically a good product.&lt;br /&gt;Negative:  The picture of the product is NOT what you get--it&#x27;s in a simple plastic bag with a tiny label on the front--no information. I can live with that. What I will not live with again is the shipping charge. You do NOT get Amazon Prime free shipping with this company and, crappy packaging notwithstanding, you will pay through the nose for the \\&quot;handling.\\&quot; The shipping charge was $11.75, and the product \\&quot;only\\&quot; $9.75.  I cannot live with that. My fault for not noticing, but shoot, this was not the heaviest thing I ordered and the shipping/handling was more than the product. Cheap packaging, pay through the nose for shipping and **handling.** Definitely NOT the cheapest product I could have ordered at $20.95/lb. Won&#x27;t make that mistake again.</li>
            <li> Great for preventing stretch marks.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, was able to get it with free shipping.  It is not offered on Am. Prime so I continued to search and found a better price on Raw Cocoa Butter, so went with that.  I am a soap maker...thesoapmaker.net  With that being said, every few dollars saved is a few more dollars in your pocket.</li>
            <li> I bought this, it&#x27;s good, and the large size of the enclosure, also smelled good, I bought this for my mother and her friend and is happy with this product</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it for my belly butter concoction and for when I make my own chocolates.</li>
            <li> This is a winter staple in our house, I put in Lemon or rose essential oils to keep the smell fresher. for all over body moisture.</li>
            <li> oh my gosh i love the smell!!!! its great for making lotions and stuff. amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. I have not used it to make any type of food nor body products. However, I do eat it straight out of the tub after I&#x27;ve broken the chunks into smaller chunks. I also add it to my coffee. Yummy!</li>
            <li> Good deal! Very easy to work with and crumbly! Awesome for homemade cosmetics!!!</li>
            <li> My cocoa butter arrived by the expected date and was just as described! Chocolate aroma is intense. Will probably buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. I used it in combination with unrefined Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at the quality of this product. It was packaged nicely in a heavy plastic jar with a screw top lid. I fell in love with this immediately! This product smells butter than chocolate!!! It feels great on the skin as a body butter although it takes quite a bit of rubbing and warming to use it. It is not greasy at all and lasts a long time, the fragrance also lasts so you will smell divine all day. My only complaint is that I got a few huge chunks and a lot of small chips. I would have rather had more uniform smaller chunks. I use this product to make bath and body products with and I will be purchasing a lot more real soon</li>
            <li> I keep this butter in stock in my home. I use it for my skin and it has smoothed out some dark marks I had on my skin(chocolate toned skin) . It leaves your skin so soft and smells so good. I take my baths or shower then rub this all over my skin. It coats the skin really well. Whatever clothing your wearing that covers your skin after rubbing down with this butter will still have the butter on it. I work 10 hour shifts and the butter is still protecting my skin when I get off. I love this product. I melt my butter let it cool a bit, pour it back into the plastic container it comes in, with about 1/3-1/2 cup or extra virgin olive oil. Once it&#x27;s back to solid form, I use a spoon and scrape the butter. This makes it much easier to use. You will have butter that&#x27;s like thin sheets of paper that melt so much faster when rubbed between the hands.</li>
            <li> Product was really good and I got it on time.</li>
            <li> Smells terrific, if mixed properly its super velvety on your skin.</li>
            <li> HalalEveryDay is my favorite place to buy Cocoa Butter and all of my natural products.&lt;br /&gt;My hair, skin and body are in a better state now that I can find the best butters.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It smells amazing.  I have been using it to make lotions and it&#x27;s been really fantastic.</li>
            <li> Cocoa butter came in the package pictured, it is in nice sized chunks which is actually convenient so I don&#x27;t have to melt the whole thing to get what I need like the other small jar I have.  It smells just how it should, cocos butter will overpower what you use it in.  The jar doesn&#x27;t seem too flimsy to me, it wasn&#x27;t damaged and it came in 2 days, very fast delivery!  I have yet to use it but it seems good quality and I&#x27;m excited to use it!  Update, have used this in chap stick and lotion bars and love it, only downside is my other half doesn&#x27;t like the smell but I don&#x27;t really care!  I work in a kitchen and my hands get really dry and cracked in my busy season and use my lotion bar every day and it helps so much and I still keep this at 5 stars!</li>
            <li> just used it once did a good job</li>
            <li> This is probably useful far more than lip balm. Although it has that nice result, the project we are doing requires less scent so we used so much less of this for the base ingredient.</li>
            <li> Thank you to all the former reviews. I dry brush my entire body before entering the shower, or bath. I use liquid or solid black soap, then this raw butter. AMAZING!!!! Almost all of my scarring from stretch marks on my stomach are gone. Black soap is excellent from this company as well. Leave the jar in a sink of hot water while you shower and apply when it is in liquid form. I love the smell, which is correctly described as a hershey&#x27;s chocolate bar.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of Cocoa Butter and this is the best value and quality for your money. I use this for making my own body butter and hair moisturizer!!! It has such a beautiful scent too!!!</li>
            <li> In good condition, great product, and right on time!</li>
            <li> Used it for hard lotion bars and it melted nicely and mixed well.  Great</li>
            <li> I suffer from osteoarthritis on both knees.  I have been taking a lot of supplements like Move-free, Glucosamine, condroitin, etc. and I have never felt any relief.  I had difficulties with going up and down the stairs and standing up after sitting for a period of time.  I bought this product, shea butter and castor oil and mixed them together (65% shea butter/25% cocoa butter and 10% castor oil.  It created a pasty cream that I applied liberally on my knees every morning.  After about 6 weeks, I noticed I can now easily stand and walk after sitting for a long time.  I can negotiate the stairs a lot more comfortably and I move about a lot better.  The pain is still there, but the swelling has subsided and I am a lot more comfortable.  The only side effect is that my knees are baby-smooth in texture.  I can deal with that!  LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given this concoction to friends and co-workers and I am hoping they will experience the same positive results.  Oh, one girl at work used it with her psoriasis.  The affected area has now cleared.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! If you.love cocoa butter sticks, you will deFinitely not be disappointed! There are huge chunks of cocoa butter in this container, so u are geTting an excellent deal compared to buying the sTicks.</li>
            <li> I am becoming more well versed in cocoa butter, they all seem to come a little different than the last depending on the brand. This one comes in a tub with chunks of cocoa butter, they look very dry but when used to make things like sunscreen and lotions they melt well and keep your skin feeling silky smooth with a nice undertone of chocolate, yum!!</li>
            <li> This product was hard to maneuver because it was packed so solid.  I had to melt it down to use it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is delicious. Smells amazing like sweet chocolate. Great in homemade body goods.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably not used to raw cocoa butter, but this smell was too strong. My wife found offensive even when significantly diluted in coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I got a good quality of cocoa butter and don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it for my hair and body butter mixes.</li>
            <li> I use this product for soap making.  It has a good chocolate aroma.  This is why I like this particular brand.  It is raw and much more natural.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell, love it</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars is because when I received this item the lid was loose so when I took it out of the  package the bottem half dropped and I was left holding the lid while most of the cocoa butter went on the floor. Other then that its great.</li>
            <li> Great raw product. It has a very strong chocolate scent, stronger than other cocoa butters I have tried. I used it to make body butters and lip balms, and they turned out wonderfully soft and smooth. I shaved the large chunks with a grater to measure it out without having to heat the butter to high temperatures.</li>
            <li> This product was explained well by other consumers. I did like the fragrance and the product itself. I think it takes some getting use to, but once you melt it down it can be very good for use with other oils.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  This is the second time I have ordered it.  I usually blend it with my shea butter to eliminate the odor, which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
