            <li>I am determined to keep them looking their best.</li>
            <li>My sister tried it before and was very happy with this product,so I bought it</li>
            <li>Now I am so proud of how they look</li>

            <li>and it is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely impressed and glad I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>its been keeping my nails from getting damaged, so it is also a good preventive care so your nails don&#x27;t get damaged with acrylic or gels.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I use everytime that I change my nail polish, it&#x60;s really good to my nails, they used to break very easy, but now it&#x60;s changing</li>
            <li>but my nails are very strong and in good condition.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought 2 bottles!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing...</li>
            <li>It is amazing how it works.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know quite what this stuff does, but...</li>
            <li>Worth buying !!!  </li>
            <li>This is the most amazing stuff I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t leave any kind of coating on your nails, so you can paint over the top of the nail hardener,</li>
            <li>I am assuming that I would need to use it more often to prevent the breakage.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use as directed.</li>
            <li>I have returned to using just Nail Magic and hoping they&#x27;ll recover.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to see that Amazon is carrying</li>
            <li>Years ago, Living Nail was the best product for hardening nails and had similar ingredients.  </li>
            <li>and I am totally  pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>My nails have never looked better than they do now.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how it works, just that it does, and have turned many of my friends onto the stuff over the years.</li>
            <li>The ends will also seem much more resistant to chipping and breaking when you bash them against things.</li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN USING THIS SUPERB NAIL PRODUCT FOR SEVERAL YEARS, AND IT IS SO ASTONISHING.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing, and a true nail saver.</li>
            <li>I got the product in a timely manner but product made my nails break at the skin easily.</li>
            <li>they were growing and strong</li>
            <li>&amp; with this stuff my nails stay strong.</li>
            <li>No polishes claiming to grow strong nails have ever worked.</li>
            <li>or if the nails will remain strong once the desired results are achieved.</li>
            <li>I have never had strong nails and have tried almost everything to make them grow.</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff, and honestly the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found that fixed my peely-nail problem.</li>
            <li>I now apply lotion regularly and my nails and fingers have never looked so beautiful.</li>
            <li>(recommendation is 1-2x), and my nails are looking fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Initially my nails looked great</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s no longer available, I decided to try Mavala</li>
            <li>(please keep Mavala available)</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and quick drying.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>The manicurist even commented that she rarely encounters customers with nails as strong as mine.</li>
            <li>My nails are definitely harder and feel healthier, so I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absorbed into your nails in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(something definitely sinks in, and I&#x27;m sure some more vaporous stuff disappears into the ether)...</li>
            <li>Mavala Scientifique just soaks right</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, two weeks later I have long strong nails, like I haven&#x27;t had in years!</li>
            <li>I have soft nails that rip easily and break off.</li>
            <li>My nails are soft and breaks easily.</li>
            <li>absolutely PROMISE you that you will find, within a pretty quick timeframe, that your nails will stop splitting apart and peeling and breaking at the tips.</li>
            <li>and I like it very much</li>
            <li>This product made my nails very brittle!</li>
            <li>Its really help !</li>
            <li>I applied it exactly as directed for 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>2 Plus, which works pretty well for my nails.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Mavala!</li>
            <li>The only thing that sorta helped was a home treatment with hot olive oil, but it&#x27;s time consuming, and didn&#x27;t give such good results.</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff, and honestly the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found that fixed my peely-nail problem.and one tiny bottle will last you a LONG time.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to grow long nails.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few months, once a week as directed, and I finally have beautiful nails.</li>
            <li>PERFECT product, it does what it promess, my nails are so hard and long after 30 days using it!</li>
            <li>Follow the instruction and enjoy your nails healthy and long in a very short time.</li>
            <li>For that reason, I think this would be worth a try for new customers since it has gotten such good reviews from other users.</li>
            <li>It seems to help but it will take a while for my 2 &amp;#34;problem nails&amp;#34; to tell the real story.</li>
            <li>/&gt;See, this item uses formaldehyde much like Brazilian straightening systems for hair.</li>
            <li>I thought it was really helping my nails</li>
            <li>I do my whole nail instead of the tips</li>
            <li>Most \\&quot;hardeners\\&quot; offered by other makers have fibers or create a polish-like barrier.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Mavala Scientifique is seriously great stuff, and one tiny bottle will last you a LONG time.</li>
            <li>However, when I use as directed my nails are less brittle, healthy, and hold polish longer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Maybe the brush should be a little better quality.</li>
            <li>I have been using a little more than it recommends in the box.</li>
            <li>With consistent use of Mavala Nail Hardener, you will have STRONG nails that grow long due to no breakage.  </li>
            <li>Definitely read the instructions first.</li>
            <li>WARNING: your skin near your nail hardens too...</li>
            <li>Based on some of the reviews I read, this seemed to be the answer to my soft nail issue.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for over 10 years, and I believe it works because my nails split and get soft from being in water.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a nurse &amp; I was my hands &amp; apply hand sanitizer frequently</li>
            <li>I started with the no chip manicures which helped keep my nails looking good, but it becomes expensive and time consuming.  </li>
            <li>If the Mavala had worked for my nails, what I like about it is that it isn&#x27;t a polish, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it becoming too thick and then peeling off of your nails.</li>
            <li>you pick up a bottle, here is all you need to do: paint the tiniest amount of the liquid onto the very tips (like, the last 1mm - no more than 2mm max - honestly, don&#x27;t paint it further down the nail than this as it won&#x27;t help) of each fingernail.</li>
            <li>This is exactly the product I have spent close to two years searching for!  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve had this for over a year now, and it&#x27;s barely made a dent.</li>
            <li>You only need a little of this on the ends of your nails and it is absorbed.</li>
            <li>Naturally, being a teenage know-it-all, I rolled my eyes at my mother&#x27;s many suggestions that I try painting a little of the liquid in this tiny little jar of hers onto my nails, but when I finally deigned to humor her and give it a go?</li>
            <li>It seems like a small bottle but for me that little bottle lasts the whole year, totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The little bottle will last you forever, and now it comes in a pen-type applicator too (much safer for carrying in one&#x27;s purse).  </li>

            <li> The little bottle will last you forever, and now it comes in a pen-type applicator too (much safer for carrying in one&#x27;s purse).  </li>
            <li> I started with their STOP nail-biting deterrent and then discovered that this tasted equally bad AND really helped my nails to grow long and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I can finally grown my nails long!</li>
            <li> The only way I can grow long nails is by using this product!</li>
            <li> So it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This product has been rated highly by other users, so I think the efficacy of it must be specific to the user.</li>
            <li> My nails went from soft and breaking, to long and hard.  </li>
            <li> I could lay my little teenage hands on, and finding (to my frustration) that none of them worked.</li>
            <li> I have used lots of different products before but this was the only one that could make my nails hard.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails harder and stronger.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not so.  </li>
            <li> Over the years it&#x27;s gotten harder and harder to find, so I&#x27;ve tried other products.  </li>
            <li> I did not exactly get the results I expected.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very small, but it seems it will last a long time</li>
            <li> Not sure what the problem is, but I feel it actually weakens the tops of my nails.  </li>
            <li> It takes a minute to use (literally) since you put a little on the tips of your nails, let it dry, and off you go.  </li>
            <li> I tried the product for about two and a half months using it weekly as the instructions state to do.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great little stocking stuffer .....</li>
            <li> Repeat this process once a week, maybe twice if you&#x27;re a little obsessive like me.</li>
            <li> The instructions are a little intimidating</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to aplly on your cuticles or they will get hard as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried at least a half dozen other products,  without results.  </li>
            <li> However, formaldehyde is both dangerous, and applications of too much causes brittleness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The index, middle and ring fingers on both hands have become thin and tend to peel.  </li>
            <li> I do have probably unusually thin, fragile nails (thus the need for a hardener).</li>
            <li> It does feel a little uncomfortable if it touches the skin, but no major reactions.</li>
            <li> My nails started chipping so bad, I wore them short and they still looked bad, and would brake easy.</li>
            <li> So, I think it&#x27;s a waste of money!</li>
            <li> stuff is UNBELIEVABLE!  </li>
            <li> Seriously you should try it.</li>
            <li> I used it every day at the beginning, filing my nails also, to get rid of the bad stuff, but now once a week (maybe twice) seems to be enough.</li>
            <li> My nails getting hard !</li>
            <li> It works on your tips but my nails broke at the weak point where you stop with the product.</li>

            <li> This stuff is awesome! I can&#x27;t grow my nails out without it! I got it years ago when Nordstrom carried it, and once they discontinued it, I found it here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this about a month. Easy to apply and quick drying. It seems to help but it will take a while for my 2 &amp;#34;problem nails&amp;#34; to tell the real story. Maybe the brush should be a little better quality.</li>
            <li> This product made my nails very brittle! My nails were chipping before I used it, and this product made it worse! I definately will not be buying this product again!</li>
            <li> Well it didn&#x27;t make my nails any stronger. So, I think it&#x27;s a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works</li>
            <li> My nails have always been bad--splitting, breaking, peeling.  I started with the no chip manicures which helped keep my nails looking good, but it becomes expensive and time consuming.  At a meeting, a coworker turned me on to Mavala.  I was complaining because ANOTHER nail broke and my hands looked awful.  She immediately recommended Mavala Nail Hardener, and I ordered it on the spot from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is UNBELIEVABLE!  My nails went from soft and breaking, to long and hard.  I apply it twice a week (recommendation is 1-2x), and my nails are looking fantastic.  I&#x27;ve had one nail break since I started using it, and that had a chip in it, so it made sense.  I&#x27;m completely impressed and glad I gave it a try.  It takes a minute to use (literally) since you put a little on the tips of your nails, let it dry, and off you go.  It&#x27;s absorbed into your nails in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to give this a try.  I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing stuff I have ever used. I have been using this for years now and it is the only thing that can stop my nails from tearing and breaking. I have soft nails that rip easily and break off. You only need a little of this on the ends of your nails and it is absorbed. I like that it is not like a nail polish and is just disappears into the nail.</li>
            <li> It works, thats all there is to it. It makes my nails harder and stronger. It can dehydrate them though, so I occasionally switch between a hydrating nail treatment and this nail hardener. I put this on one day before I do gel nails and its been keeping my nails from getting damaged, so it is also a good preventive care so your nails don&#x27;t get damaged with acrylic or gels.I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for 2 years. So it lasts a long time. I recommend this 100%!</li>
            <li> Its really help ! My nails getting hard !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice but my nail is still breaking. I am assuming that I would need to use it more often to prevent the breakage. WARNING: your skin near your nail hardens too...kinda gross.</li>
            <li> My nails started chipping so bad, I wore them short and they still looked bad, and would brake easy. The only thing that sorta helped was a home treatment with hot olive oil, but it&#x27;s time consuming, and didn&#x27;t give such good results. This product is amazing, two weeks later I have long strong nails, like I haven&#x27;t had in years! I used it every day at the beginning, filing my nails also, to get rid of the bad stuff, but now once a week (maybe twice) seems to be enough. I also use the opi nail strengthener as a protective layer, because this is not to be confused with nail polish. The bottle is very small, but it seems it will last a long time (they say it&#x27;s one year supply), as you only use it on the tip of the nails. Make sure you use as directed. It does feel a little uncomfortable if it touches the skin, but no major reactions. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Based on some of the reviews I read, this seemed to be the answer to my soft nail issue.  Absolutely not so.  I applied it exactly as directed for 6 weeks.  My nails are in horrible shape - much worse than when I started using Mavala - won&#x27;t stop peeling and paper-thin.  So sad.  I have returned to using just Nail Magic and hoping they&#x27;ll recover.</li>
            <li> I used to get this product at JL Hudson (now defunct).  I started with their STOP nail-biting deterrent and then discovered that this tasted equally bad AND really helped my nails to grow long and healthy.  Over the years it&#x27;s gotten harder and harder to find, so I&#x27;ve tried other products.  They always disappoint.  Most \\&quot;hardeners\\&quot; offered by other makers have fibers or create a polish-like barrier.  Mavala Scientifique just soaks right in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep an eye out for this whenever I travel abroad.  The last time I found it (at a pharmacy on a French island), I stocked up.  The little bottle will last you forever, and now it comes in a pen-type applicator too (much safer for carrying in one&#x27;s purse).  I&#x27;m so glad to see that Amazon is carrying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great little stocking stuffer .....</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> Initially my nails looked great but then they became brittle and started breaking.  After three months I still don&#x27;t see any growth.</li>
            <li> This Mavala nail hardener is pricey, and also tiny! BUT! i&#x27;ve had this for over a year now, and it&#x27;s barely made a dent. I use this on my nails probably once a week, or once every two weeks. My nails are definitely harder and feel healthier, so I&#x27;m happy with this purchase. Try it!</li>
            <li> This is exactly the product I have spent close to two years searching for!  I have tried at least a half dozen other products,  without results.  Years ago, Living Nail was the best product for hardening nails and had similar ingredients.  Since it&#x27;s no longer available, I decided to try Mavala and I am totally  pleased with the results.  The index, middle and ring fingers on both hands have become thin and tend to peel.  Mavala is correcting the problem and now I actually have nails to paint!  So glad I bought 2 bottles!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  (please keep Mavala available)</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. My nails are stronger since I began using it.</li>
            <li> I did not exactly get the results I expected. I got the product in a timely manner but product made my nails break at the skin easily. It works on your tips but my nails broke at the weak point where you stop with the product. They grew but I did not keep them but about 2 weeks and then I started over. :(( I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 10 years, and I believe it works because my nails split and get soft from being in water.  However, when I use as directed my nails are less brittle, healthy, and hold polish longer.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, and a true nail saver. The secret is that you cannot use it too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, this item uses formaldehyde much like Brazilian straightening systems for hair. By painting this on it changes the cross links in protein causing the nails to become stronger. However, formaldehyde is both dangerous, and applications of too much causes brittleness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow directions closely, only apply to nails, and wash wash wash when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> Worth buying !!!  Works amazingly !!!  Will order it FOREVER !!! My nails have never looked better than they do now.</li>
            <li> I thought it was really helping my nails they were growing and strong like they used to be then poof one broke then another and now I&#x27;m back to where I was with peeling, splitting, breaking nails. Something I had never experienced before.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried Mavala Scientifique nail hardener, well... you should. I was introduced to this stuff by my mother around 20 years ago back when I was trying out every nail strengthening/hardening/protecting product I could lay my little teenage hands on, and finding (to my frustration) that none of them worked. Naturally, being a teenage know-it-all, I rolled my eyes at my mother&#x27;s many suggestions that I try painting a little of the liquid in this tiny little jar of hers onto my nails, but when I finally deigned to humor her and give it a go? Yeah. It worked. This stuff is amazing... I have no idea how it works, just that it does, and have turned many of my friends onto the stuff over the years. It&#x27;s just a shame that it&#x27;s such a total pain to find it in stores these days... and I&#x27;m talking in Europe, never mind here in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you pick up a bottle, here is all you need to do: paint the tiniest amount of the liquid onto the very tips (like, the last 1mm - no more than 2mm max - honestly, don&#x27;t paint it further down the nail than this as it won&#x27;t help) of each fingernail. Sit there for maybe 30 seconds to a minute waiting for it to absorb/evaporate (something definitely sinks in, and I&#x27;m sure some more vaporous stuff disappears into the ether)... you&#x27;re done for the day. Repeat this process once a week, maybe twice if you&#x27;re a little obsessive like me. If you paint your nails, you need to do this UNDER your nail polish or it won&#x27;t work. It won&#x27;t leave any kind of coating on your nails, so you can paint over the top of the nail hardener, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely PROMISE you that you will find, within a pretty quick timeframe, that your nails will stop splitting apart and peeling and breaking at the tips. The ends will also seem much more resistant to chipping and breaking when you bash them against things. I honestly don&#x27;t know quite what this stuff does, but... it works. That is all I need to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mavala Scientifique is seriously great stuff, and one tiny bottle will last you a LONG time. Awesome stuff, and honestly the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found that fixed my peely-nail problem.and one tiny bottle will last you a LONG time. Awesome stuff, and honestly the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found that fixed my peely-nail problem.</li>
            <li> I work in  health care so i wash my hands constantly. I can see the difference in two weeks so breakage.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible!  When I 1st received it I applied it daily hoping to &amp;#34;toughen&amp;#34; up my nails...it worked. After that i applied it once or twice a week and my nails couldn&#x27;t be stronger or prettier. Now I use it once a week &amp; I haven&#x27;t broken a nail or experience splitting since. I&#x27;m a nurse &amp; I was my hands &amp; apply hand sanitizer frequently &amp; with this stuff my nails stay strong.</li>
            <li> This product has been rated highly by other users, so I think the efficacy of it must be specific to the user. I do have probably unusually thin, fragile nails (thus the need for a hardener). It actually made one of my nails break in the middle of the nail at the line of application (where the white begins and the nailbed leaves off). I tried the product for about two and a half months using it weekly as the instructions state to do. I kept having breakage, so I have gone back to using Nailtiques, Formula 2 Plus, which works pretty well for my nails.  Footnote:  If the Mavala had worked for my nails, what I like about it is that it isn&#x27;t a polish, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it becoming too thick and then peeling off of your nails. For that reason, I think this would be worth a try for new customers since it has gotten such good reviews from other users.</li>
            <li> I can finally grown my nails long!</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS SUPERB NAIL PRODUCT FOR SEVERAL YEARS, AND IT IS SO ASTONISHING.  IT ACTUALLY WORKS! THE BEST!!</li>
            <li> I have suffered for 30+ years with weak nails that peel and break as soon as they begin to grow. No polishes claiming to grow strong nails have ever worked. I have been using this for a few months, once a week as directed, and I finally have beautiful nails. I learned about buffing the nail surface too and trimming cuticles. I now apply lotion regularly and my nails and fingers have never looked so beautiful. I have always been a nail biter and picked at my cuticles and skin around my nails too making them look horrible almost all the time. Now I am so proud of how they look I am determined to keep them looking their best. This stuff works great, seems like a miracle. Will buy again as I don&#x27;t know if you have to keep applying it forever or if the nails will remain strong once the desired results are achieved. Thanks Mavala!</li>
            <li> The only way I can grow long nails is by using this product! It is amazing how it works. I have used lots of different products before but this was the only one that could make my nails hard. Just be careful not to aplly on your cuticles or they will get hard as well. It seems like a small bottle but for me that little bottle lasts the whole year, totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to grow long nails. My nails are soft and breaks easily. I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks and it is great. It actually works. I have tried several similar products, and none of them could compare to this.</li>
            <li> Works wonders. If your nails are peeling, splitting and breaking this is the product for you. Seriously you should try it.</li>
            <li> The instructions are a little intimidating but once you thoroughly read through them, it all makes sense. Definitely read the instructions first. I have been using this product for two weeks and can already see a big difference in the strength of my nails. I have never had strong nails and have tried almost everything to make them grow. This is the only product that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> I use everytime that I change my nail polish, it&#x60;s really good to my nails, they used to break very easy, but now it&#x60;s changing</li>
            <li> PERFECT product, it does what it promess, my nails are so hard and long after 30 days using it! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Not sure what the problem is, but I feel it actually weakens the tops of my nails.  They break off (well, not all at once, but one or two at a time) a couple of hours I put this on.  I was so hoping to find a product that would help me grow out my nails damaged by the way I took of gel nail polish, but I think this is not it for me.  Well, not everything works for everybody and you don&#x27;t know until you try.</li>
            <li> Girls....it does what it promised !!! Follow the instruction and enjoy your nails healthy and long in a very short time. Two thumbs up !!!!</li>
            <li> My nails have grown to record lengths... I think they are the longest that they have ever been. They never chip anymore. I have been using a little more than it recommends in the box. I do my whole nail instead of the tips but my nails are very strong and in good condition.</li>
            <li> With consistent use of Mavala Nail Hardener, you will have STRONG nails that grow long due to no breakage.  My nails have always been thin and began to peel or break before they could gain any length. After one month of use, my nails were stronger and longer than they had ever been. The manicurist even commented that she rarely encounters customers with nails as strong as mine. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My sister tried it before and was very happy with this product,so I bought it and I like it very much</li>
