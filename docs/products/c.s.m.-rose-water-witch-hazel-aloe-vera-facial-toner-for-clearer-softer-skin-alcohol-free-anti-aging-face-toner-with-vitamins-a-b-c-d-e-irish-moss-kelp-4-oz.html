            <li>Such a refreshing mist, plus</li>
            <li>Well the first thing I noticed about it is its a lot bigger than I expected which made me happy</li>

            <li>It smells good, it is easy to apply, a little bit goes a long way so the bottle lasts quite a while -</li>
            <li>and I wake up with super soft skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for a base moisture or an overall refreshing mister!</li>
            <li>Ready to go.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and have to be very cautious of what I use on my skin.</li>
            <li>I just received it and although it leaked in shipping, there is enough of the product here to enjoy.</li>
            <li>I received this product at a promotional price for testing and reviewing purposes and I highly recommend it to everybody!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works wonders</li>
            <li>This helps moisturize where it needs to, and really keeps my pores in check.  </li>
            <li>the scent was too much for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had a few people comment this past week on my skin looking great and make up more natural and dewy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>but when I sprayed it on my face,  it&#x27;s not a delicate sprayer.  </li>
            <li>After trying a lot of harsh things, I decided to try a more natural route.</li>
            <li>The smell is very natural and I added a couple of drops of lavender oil.</li>
            <li>I do have very sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>the way, why has no one else mentioned a short fizz when first applied?</li>
            <li>I have been on the search for some natural products to use on my clients because I noticed that by switching over, my skin became less red and irritated and just looked glowy and more plump.</li>
            <li>I really like that this product also contains a blend of seaweed and irish moss.</li>
            <li>It covered my face in big droplets and way too much spray.  </li>
            <li>I am sensitive to scents, and this is a bit overpowering for me until it faded.  </li>
            <li>During the summer I will keep it in the refrigerator for that extra cool refresher face spritz during the dry 100+ degree heat.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel fresh and tight.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona and my skin is very dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li>When I first used it though, I felt a slight tingling on my face but ever since then, I haven&#x27;t felt anything.  </li>
            <li>I am positive this is beneficial for other people after reading the reviews of others, but after trying it several times I had to stop...</li>
            <li>It does have enough moisture in it though to keep my skin from cracking in the dry weather I live in before I have the chance to put on moisturizer.</li>
            <li>so I just spray it straight to my face and wipe it down with cotton balls/pads.  </li>

            <li> I have eczema and have to be very cautious of what I use on my skin.</li>
            <li> I just received it and although it leaked in shipping, there is enough of the product here to enjoy.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a promotional price for testing and reviewing purposes and I highly recommend it to everybody!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works wonders</li>
            <li> This helps moisturize where it needs to, and really keeps my pores in check.  </li>
            <li> the scent was too much for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a few people comment this past week on my skin looking great and make up more natural and dewy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> but when I sprayed it on my face,  it&#x27;s not a delicate sprayer.  </li>
            <li> After trying a lot of harsh things, I decided to try a more natural route.</li>
            <li> The smell is very natural and I added a couple of drops of lavender oil.</li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> the way, why has no one else mentioned a short fizz when first applied?</li>
            <li> I have been on the search for some natural products to use on my clients because I noticed that by switching over, my skin became less red and irritated and just looked glowy and more plump.</li>
            <li> I really like that this product also contains a blend of seaweed and irish moss.</li>
            <li> It covered my face in big droplets and way too much spray.  </li>
            <li> I am sensitive to scents, and this is a bit overpowering for me until it faded.  </li>
            <li> During the summer I will keep it in the refrigerator for that extra cool refresher face spritz during the dry 100+ degree heat.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel fresh and tight.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and my skin is very dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> When I first used it though, I felt a slight tingling on my face but ever since then, I haven&#x27;t felt anything.  </li>
            <li> I am positive this is beneficial for other people after reading the reviews of others, but after trying it several times I had to stop...</li>
            <li> It does have enough moisture in it though to keep my skin from cracking in the dry weather I live in before I have the chance to put on moisturizer.</li>
            <li> so I just spray it straight to my face and wipe it down with cotton balls/pads.  </li>
            <li> I can really see a difference in my acne just after a few uses!</li>
            <li> This toner does not dry my face out like all of the other toners that I have tried and I have combination skin, which means that it can become itchy if I don&#x27;t put moisturizer on before it dries.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the fridge and spritz in the am after washing and let it slightly dry</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry or shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent the past few years, and a lot of money, trying every product on the market to clear my adult acne.</li>
            <li> my face is really dry, but my T zone is extremely oily.  </li>
            <li> and I have actually noticed that I had less breakouts and my face had less blackheads.</li>
            <li> I have extremely combination skin...</li>
            <li> It looks like black pieces/cotton hair from black trousers.</li>
            <li> I feel like this toner has made my skin a little stronger and resilient.  </li>
            <li> Came home and spritzed a few times.</li>
            <li> I hate putting too much moisturizer under my makeup (especially during the summer) because it just seems to make the foundation squish around.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure</li>
            <li> Use it everyday to get a refresh feel!</li>
            <li> Not a good smell</li>
            <li> Not your basic witch hazel base at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also energizing so if you&#x27;re tired just give yourself a spritz.</li>
            <li> everything from weather to the wrong product will trigger a break out or dryness imbalance.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Love this refreshing and toning facial mist!  It&#x27;s great for after the shower and before my moisturizer.  Has a light scent.</li>
            <li> Lovely mixture of function and scent. I bought this at a promotional price to try out and absolutely  love it. I have heard all these benifits of rose water but I am so sensative to scents. This is a great rose smell without being to overbearing and fake. Feels refreshing and light.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this spritz! It is so soothing ! I have the most sensitive skin on the planet..everything from weather to the wrong product will trigger a break out or dryness imbalance. I keep it in the fridge and spritz in the am after washing and let it slightly dry and then I use my rose hip oil ( also from CSM) and my skin is dewy and glowy all day:D!</li>
            <li> Such a refreshing mist, plus it&#x27;s organic and cruelty free!!!!  Excellent product for a base moisture or an overall refreshing mister!</li>
            <li> This feels terrific. It makes my face feel smooth! I like to use it before bed and I wake up with super soft skin. I give 4 stars because initially there is an off-putting smell. The smell dissipates after a few seconds and then a nice feature light rose scent is there.</li>
            <li> I have been on the search for some natural products to use on my clients because I noticed that by switching over, my skin became less red and irritated and just looked glowy and more plump. This product definitely added to these results. My pores have gotten smaller (what!!!! Do you know how many products I&#x27;ve bought with those claims?) and my skin just looks fresh. I put it on every morning before I apply my makeup and again afterwards. Then If I get home from work and need a refresh on my makeup, I don&#x27;t even have to go apply more or re-do my foundation. I just spray my face and voila. It looks fine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a few people comment this past week on my skin looking great and make up more natural and dewy. Thank you! This product is awesome and I will be placing an order in the next week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, why has no one else mentioned a short fizz when first applied? Both my clients and I experience this. Almost like a hydrogen peroxide type ingredient? I am not sure but it&#x27;s no bother because the product then seeps into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consensus: I love it! Not your basic witch hazel base at all. You&#x27;re skin will thank you for this. Photo attached is after nine hours of make up wear at work. Came home and spritzed a few times. Ready to go. No re-do.</li>
            <li> This toner is fantastic. It smells rosey, but with a hint of sweetness, like honey. Its very refreshing, does a great job at toning. I love to use it in the mornings after cleansing my face. I really like that this product also contains a blend of seaweed and irish moss. Mt skin really likes those ingredients and thi bottle is a mixture of magic. You can even use this, since it contains rose water, after your make up is done for a dewy healthy glow. In love qith this product its so useful! This is my honest opinion on trying this product.</li>
            <li> I value my skin. I know that it is the fist thing people see when they meet me. I needed a toner  to maintain my skin&#x27;s appearance. I wanted  a toner that was safe and effective. I love that this product is powerful and effective without being harsh on my naturally sensitive skin. I have eczema and have to be very cautious of what I use on my skin. The rosewater, aloe and witch hazel have been the holy trifecta of ingredients for my neck and face. This product combines safe ingredients to make my skin look younger and more supple. I recommend this product to anyone looking to retain and improve their skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li> Well the first thing I noticed about it is its a lot bigger than I expected which made me happy but when I sprayed it on my face,  it&#x27;s not a delicate sprayer.  It covered my face in big droplets and way too much spray.  It doesn&#x27;t smell good either,  kind of like rotten pomegranates. Not a good smell,  I don&#x27;t know what it is but I don&#x27;t like it at all.  The good thing is it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face. I&#x27;ll keep using it because the smell goes away pretty fast. If the company improves the spritzer and scent I&#x27;ll give it 5☆. I did receive this item in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and my skin is very dry and sensitive. This Rose Aloe Witch left my face feeling refreshed without drying it out. It also made my face feel well balanced and not oily either. It&#x27;s perfect to use in the morning after washing my face, before moisturizing and during mid day to refresh my makeup and to keep me from getting oily. It&#x27;s nice and light so it&#x27;s perfect to go under many coats of moisturizer and sunscreen that I to use to keep my skin looking young. I love the light rose smell as it&#x27;s very calming and the ingredients feel very natural and fresh. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have gotten this elixir, which I have been using as a toner and a finishing touch after putting on my makeup.  I have been spraying it on after washing my face and it&#x27;s a good toner so far.  When I first used it though, I felt a slight tingling on my face but ever since then, I haven&#x27;t felt anything.  The bottle is made of plastic and there&#x27;s a lot in it to last me for a while.  It is also a push spray bottle so I just spray it straight to my face and wipe it down with cotton balls/pads.  I also sometimes spray it after makeup for a glowing effect.  I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  This product was bought at a promotional price for the purpose of a product review.  This is also an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This is now, OFFICIALLY, my favorite toner! The smell is so relaxing and refreshing. I could try to explain it but you will never understand until you experience it for yourself. It makes my skin feel silky as soon as it makes contact with my face. This toner does not dry my face out like all of the other toners that I have tried and I have combination skin, which means that it can become itchy if I don&#x27;t put moisturizer on before it dries. But this Rose Aloe Witch toner feels amazing and it pairs very well with my current skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much my skin has cleared up since I started using the Rose Aloe Witch Beauty Elixir! I&#x27;ve spent the past few years, and a lot of money, trying every product on the market to clear my adult acne. After trying a lot of harsh things, I decided to try a more natural route. This spray is amazing. It smells good, it is easy to apply, a little bit goes a long way so the bottle lasts quite a while - and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry or shiny. It has helped me so much, I&#x27;m really glad I found it! It also makes me really happy to know that it isn&#x27;t tested on animals :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not to fond of the smell, but it&#x27;s definitely refreshing! It helps moisturize as well. Fast Shipping and good packaging. Received this product at a discounted rate for review.</li>
            <li> Perfect organic face toner . it&#x27;s super refreshing and the rose smell is really nice.</li>
            <li> works great you will like it try it</li>
            <li> I just received it and although it leaked in shipping, there is enough of the product here to enjoy. It smells clean and light. I think I&#x27;ll keep it in the refrigerator  this summer for a cool, refreshing spritz. I appreciate that this product is paraben free and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> This Rose Aloe Witch Elixir is very nice and refreshing. It also smells really nice – a gentle rose smell. It’s not overpowering at all. It makes my face feel fresh and tight. It also helps with acne and I get breakouts from time to time, so I’m very excited about that aspect. I love it that it also cleans my face, getting rid of the toxins. My skin tone is more even and my skin is glowing. I really love this tonic and I’ll be buying more once I run out. I received this product at a promotional price for testing and reviewing purposes and I highly recommend it to everybody!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using a facial toner recently and I had been thinking that I should. So when I was offered this Rose Aloe Witch Beauty Elixir for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered it to try. I have been using it for the last couple weeks and I have actually noticed that I had less breakouts and my face had less blackheads. This Elixir is awesome and I definitely recommend that you try this.</li>
            <li> I love how flawless and hydrated my skin feels after using this product. It also smells so fresh.</li>
            <li> The rose aloe elixir is a nice refreshing spray that makes your face feel nice and clean and refreshed. Not sticky and smells nice Also</li>
            <li> I like this product alot. It is not tested on animals which is a big bonus in my book. It is cooling and really leaves your face clean and refreshed. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every day as both a toner and also like &amp;#34;Mac Fix+&amp;#34; when putting on my foundation. Makes it blend out wonderfully and is highly nourishing to the skin. The smell is very natural and I added a couple of drops of lavender oil. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This toner smells great! I love the fact that it is not tested on animals and all the Great stuff that is in this stuff is just amazing! I can really see a difference in my acne just after a few uses! This stuff really works wonders</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this toner, can&#x27;t wait to try it. However, when i receive it this morning, I see something kind of dust inside the bottle. It looks like black pieces/cotton hair from black trousers. I wonder if it is supposed to be like this. please help me!</li>
            <li> This elixir smells DIVINE! It&#x27;s light,refreshing, not tested on animals and 97% organic. So happy i stumbled across this. It&#x27;s become part of my daily routine and I can already see the difference in my skin! Would certainly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love it. Refreshing! Use it everyday to get a refresh feel! Will buy again</li>
            <li> My son has a huge issue with acne and this is going to help him TREMENDOUSLY!</li>
            <li> i love it. It. It is nice and refreshing.</li>
            <li> First time it I used it, it tingled, but it made my skin really feel nice.</li>
            <li> One of the best toners I&#x27;ve tried.... I have extremely combination skin... my face is really dry, but my T zone is extremely oily.  When I use the incorrect toner or moisturizer, my face can get either flaky or greasy.  This helps moisturize where it needs to, and really keeps my pores in check.  I hate putting too much moisturizer under my makeup (especially during the summer) because it just seems to make the foundation squish around.  This and sunscreen is all I need for the summer.  I do have very sensitive skin... so I try a lot of stuff to just discard because they irritate or make me break out... but this has been good for my skin.  I feel like this toner has made my skin a little stronger and resilient.  Plus, I love the smell.</li>
            <li> This Rose Aloe Witch Elixir has a clean fresh rose sent. The ingredients feel clean and natural as soon as you spray it on your face. It&#x27;s refreshing and not drying. It does have enough moisture in it though to keep my skin from cracking in the dry weather I live in before I have the chance to put on moisturizer. During the summer I will keep it in the refrigerator for that extra cool refresher face spritz during the dry 100+ degree heat. It&#x27;s also energizing so if you&#x27;re tired just give yourself a spritz.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the product was it&#x27;s heavenly smell!!!!  It was purely divine!  My skin felt instantly tighter and smoother after just one use, and I noticed a remarkable decrease in acne, pore size and skin redness within the first week of use.  I&#x27;ve been using CSM&#x27;s Rosehip oil for a few months and have gotten many compliments on the appearance of my skin, so I&#x27;m thrilled to use this product in combination with my oil!  CSM&#x27;s dedication to using organic ingredients and not testing their  products on animals is just another reason why I am a very satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! It smells lovely, hint of rose, hint of witch hazel but that goes away after a couple minutes. I love that it is organic, paraben free, and not tested on animals. Big supporter of that here! I will definitely buy this product again and recommend it to anybody who asks about it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell.  I am sensitive to scents, and this is a bit overpowering for me until it faded.  I am positive this is beneficial for other people after reading the reviews of others, but after trying it several times I had to stop...the scent was too much for me.  I did receive this in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion,</li>
