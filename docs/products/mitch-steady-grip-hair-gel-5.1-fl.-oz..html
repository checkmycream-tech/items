            <li>Oh yea, delivery time was great!</li>
            <li>It achieves excellent results and if one can afford to buy tube after tube, it&#x27;s the way to go.  </li>
            <li>This is the best hair-gel for my hair, and I got a very good price from Amazon, I was very impressed.</li>
            <li>The smell is very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Great product and smells great!</li>
            <li>and as I said it smells great.</li>
            <li>Win win for once in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great hold but</li>
            <li>It did feel like I had gel in to the touch, but looked great.  </li>
            <li>He did a great job, I then asked him what hair product he recommended.</li>
            <li>Hold is great, doesn&#x27;t shine and I don&#x27;t get the issues with the smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find that it holds all that great.  </li>
            <li>good product.  </li>
            <li>My husband purchased this at a salon after a hair cut and loved it.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve read that using a good shampoo can help hold off the need for Rogaine.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>The gel has good hold and is very light, but the smell is just not for me.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice smell, holds my hair and is not sticky.</li>
            <li>My hair has a mind of its own if I don&#x27;t use gel.</li>
            <li>He really loved the support, yet it was light and not greasy,  </li>
            <li>consistency of product seems somewhat more like liquid than gel.  </li>
            <li>Says its much better than the ones they have at stores like target or the grocery.</li>
            <li>adorable hairstylist \\&quot;prescribed\\&quot; this for my husband 3 years ago</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to wash my hands after touching his hair</li>
            <li>Most mens cuts are $25-35 USD now</li>
            <li>I love the look on his hair.</li>
            <li>Love it for styling my hair.</li>
            <li>But i did like the Mitch shampoo that is for sure</li>
            <li>Its got medium hold at best, even though it states otherwise, which for me was not what I was looking for personally.</li>
            <li>Having used REDKEN products before, I found the paul Mitchell Men product to work better by holding the style longer in the day.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>The more you apply the firmer the hold.</li>
            <li>The label indicates &amp;#34;Firm Hold&amp;#34;, but I find it to be more medium hold.  </li>
            <li>Nice clean scent too</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the strong scent.</li>
            <li>Super grip and very light on hair.</li>
            <li>just as good as their normal gel, but this one has a cologne smell that isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>it smells great too and the scent lasts several hours.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Typically, most products work well right away</li>
            <li>I do use their other products though and they are all VERY good.</li>
            <li>Overall nice product!</li>
            <li>This product not only feels good when putting it on</li>
            <li>I think it has a neutral, kind of masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>We found it on amazon a bit cheaper and it ships quick.</li>
            <li>In an emergency I went to a Supercuts for a quick haircut.  </li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell Steady Grip Firm is the BEST gel I have found to scrunch my curls.</li>
            <li>First I noticed how little she had to use to get great results.  </li>
            <li>My goto gel right now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more light hold than firm hold as advertised.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have that gross stickiness that most gels do.</li>
            <li>I bought my first tube from her</li>
            <li>but this gel has no problem supporting it.</li>
            <li>going back to the tea tree gel - it&#x27;s much better than this product.</li>
            <li>So, 3 stars for good hold, but the smell just killed it for me.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a new hair style that&#x27;s more professional looking.</li>
            <li>Steady hold that doesn&#x27;t look greasy!</li>
            <li>Works very well otherwise.</li>
            <li>The odor is very offensive had to purchase another type of Paul Mittchell</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>MITCH DOUBLE HITTER SULFATE FREE 2-IN1 SHAMPOO &amp; CONDITIONER 8.5 OZ]]</li>
            <li>Holds very well.</li>
            <li>This product works very well, but its per tube cost is extraordinarily high.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommend</li>
            <li>I recently went to a new barber to prepare for my new upcoming full time job.</li>
            <li>Ended up looking fantastic with a nice firm hold, but not too firm.</li>
            <li>so I know what it normally looks and feels like.  </li>
            <li>hair is not stiff.</li>
            <li>My stylist used this on my hair to held my natural wave and curl.  </li>
            <li>It smells like something an old lady would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just figured for such a small bottle at that price, it would be more concentrated.  </li>
            <li>I was looking forward to trying this product as I have used Paul Mitchell products in the past with success.  </li>

            <li> I was looking forward to trying this product as I have used Paul Mitchell products in the past with success.  </li>
            <li> Also, you have to use a decent amount, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting after how little you have to use with the same brand shampoo.  </li>
            <li> He has thick curly hair and it works very well for him.</li>
            <li> In talking to the haircutter about using &#x27;product&#x27; and how I&#x27;ve been trying different products to keep my hair from sticking up after a cut she took down a tube of this and used it on me.  </li>
            <li> For years I used a different brand of gel that cost much less than this product.  </li>
            <li> you have shorter slightly curly or wavy hair, or of course straight and have been having a hard time finding something that works without the mess, flakes and friz, this product is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now of course when I run my fingers through his hair I can feel there is something in it, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like other products he&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> I massage a little into my hair then blow dry using a brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old guy; so my hair is now on the thin side.  </li>
            <li> I want something that will lock my hair into place without making it look like I hit it with a half gallon of hairspray.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;ll buy it here for less.  </li>
            <li> The tea tree gel smells a lot less</li>
            <li> Then I add a little spray to finish the job.  </li>
            <li> and he still uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to thin</li>
            <li> This is my go to gel for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it became harder and harder to find on shelves, and eventually it was discontinued by its manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not sure, find a hairstylist who uses it and ask if you can get a sample with a hair cut.</li>
            <li> I have thick, heavy hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they thought any guy would want to smell like this.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it performs well with my hair.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> Last, the smell is patchouli and it&#x27;s awful.  </li>
            <li> It will be a backup gel if I am desperate.</li>
            <li> Horrible way to stiff  and unmanageable</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> good product.  consistency of product seems somewhat more like liquid than gel.  Used this product for years so I know what it normally looks and feels like.  Could be formulation change.  Works very well otherwise.</li>
            <li> Great product and smells great!</li>
            <li> The odor is very offensive had to purchase another type of Paul Mittchell</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this at a salon after a hair cut and loved it. Says its much better than the ones they have at stores like target or the grocery. We found it on amazon a bit cheaper and it ships quick. He has thick curly hair and it works very well for him.</li>
            <li> just as good as their normal gel, but this one has a cologne smell that isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> This product not only feels good when putting it on it smells great too and the scent lasts several hours. When my husband comes home I always greet him with a kiss on the cheek just to catch a whiff of his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When shopping for products for someone whom is picky and tends to be a bit \\&quot;lazy\\&quot; when it comes to taking care of their hair, this product works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our adorable hairstylist \\&quot;prescribed\\&quot; this for my husband 3 years ago and he still uses it everyday. No flaking, no drying out of the hair, it doesn&#x27;t leave any gross residue or oiling feeling in his hair and as I said it smells great. Now of course when I run my fingers through his hair I can feel there is something in it, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like other products he&#x27;s used. I don&#x27;t need to wash my hands after touching his hair and I don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;ewe\\&quot; somethings on my hands and they feel gross feeling either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He gets an all day hold with this product as well, literately 12 hours, I&#x27;ve timed it the last 3 days just to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have shorter slightly curly or wavy hair, or of course straight and have been having a hard time finding something that works without the mess, flakes and friz, this product is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not sure, find a hairstylist who uses it and ask if you can get a sample with a hair cut. Most mens cuts are $25-35 USD now so whats the risk of getting the cut and having the stylist show you how to use this product at the same time? That way you can test it out and see if your hair likes it or not. Win win for once in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
            <li> Good product. Has a nice smell, holds my hair and is not sticky. Oh yea, delivery time was great!</li>
            <li> This is bought for my husband.  They used it in a salon where he got his hair cut, and he was &amp;#34;groomed&amp;#34;.  He really loved the support, yet it was light and not greasy,  I love the look on his hair.</li>
            <li> Great product.  My stylist used this on my hair to held my natural wave and curl.  not sticky and adds a ton of body to my hair.  The smell is very pleasant.  It is a man&#x27;s styling aid, but it works as well for women!</li>
            <li> Love it for styling my hair.</li>
            <li> Great hold but hair is not stiff. Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> For years I used a different brand of gel that cost much less than this product.  Unfortunately, it became harder and harder to find on shelves, and eventually it was discontinued by its manufacturer.  This product works very well, but its per tube cost is extraordinarily high.  It achieves excellent results and if one can afford to buy tube after tube, it&#x27;s the way to go.  If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive I&#x27;d give it a  5th Star!</li>
            <li> Horrible way to stiff  and unmanageable But i did like the Mitch shampoo that is for sure</li>
            <li> Steady hold that doesn&#x27;t look greasy! Highly Recommend</li>
            <li> This is the best hair-gel for my hair, and I got a very good price from Amazon, I was very impressed.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell Steady Grip Firm is the BEST gel I have found to scrunch my curls. Curls last all day.  I don&#x27;t use anything else.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This hair gel works well and I like the way it smells... my girlfriend does too.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have that gross stickiness that most gels do. I have thick hair and it performs well with my hair.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a medium hold with shine this is the product for you. If your looking for something that will glue your hair in place this is not the product for you. Its got medium hold at best, even though it states otherwise, which for me was not what I was looking for personally. I want something that will lock my hair into place without making it look like I hit it with a half gallon of hairspray. I do use their other products though and they are all VERY good.</li>
            <li> Having used REDKEN products before, I found the paul Mitchell Men product to work better by holding the style longer in the day.</li>
            <li> In an emergency I went to a Supercuts for a quick haircut.  In talking to the haircutter about using &#x27;product&#x27; and how I&#x27;ve been trying different products to keep my hair from sticking up after a cut she took down a tube of this and used it on me.  First I noticed how little she had to use to get great results.  The proof was in waiting.  Typically, most products work well right away and then either it turns into cement on my head or wears off and my hair fluffs up like a cartoon bunny in a dryer.  Not this.  My hair stayed put and looked natural and not at all wet.  It did feel like I had gel in to the touch, but looked great.  Another reviewer didn&#x27;t like the smell but I actually do.  I think it has a neutral, kind of masculine scent.  I bought my first tube from her and now I&#x27;ll buy it here for less.  I just ordered Mitchell&#x27;s Shampoo for men [[ASIN:B005NWMR56 PAUL MITCHELL MEN by Paul Mitchel: MITCH DOUBLE HITTER SULFATE FREE 2-IN1 SHAMPOO &amp; CONDITIONER 8.5 OZ]] and I&#x27;ll see how this goes.  I&#x27;m starting to thin and I&#x27;ve read that using a good shampoo can help hold off the need for Rogaine. :)  That&#x27;s a review for another day.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the strong scent. The tea tree gel smells a lot less</li>
            <li> I recently went to a new barber to prepare for my new upcoming full time job. I wanted a new hair style that&#x27;s more professional looking. He did a great job, I then asked him what hair product he recommended. He told me the pros and cons of both wax and gel. He happened to have a tube of  Paul Mitchel gel on hand, that he gave me a sample of.  Ended up looking fantastic with a nice firm hold, but not too firm. Bought some for myself shortly there after. Overall I definitely recommend this product, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying this product as I have used Paul Mitchell products in the past with success.  I also tried a styling paste recently and wanted to compare the two.  The gel has good hold and is very light, but the smell is just not for me.  Its like, I don&#x27;t know, patchouli or something.  All I know is I was having sensory flashbacks to college when I smelled it.  So, 3 stars for good hold, but the smell just killed it for me.  It will be a backup gel if I am desperate.</li>
            <li> My goto gel right now. I have thick, heavy hair but this gel has no problem supporting it.</li>
            <li> The more you apply the firmer the hold. Overall nice product!</li>
            <li> Holds very well. My hair has a mind of its own if I don&#x27;t use gel. Nice clean scent too that I like a lot.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have mentioned that they didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance of this product, but I don&#x27;t notice it.  The label indicates &amp;#34;Firm Hold&amp;#34;, but I find it to be more medium hold.  I massage a little into my hair then blow dry using a brush.  Then I add a little spray to finish the job.  I&#x27;m an old guy; so my hair is now on the thin side.  This product works for me.</li>
            <li> Good product. Super grip and very light on hair.</li>
            <li> This is my go to gel for everyday use.  Hold is great, doesn&#x27;t shine and I don&#x27;t get the issues with the smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that it holds all that great.  It&#x27;s fine, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more light hold than firm hold as advertised.  Also, you have to use a decent amount, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting after how little you have to use with the same brand shampoo.  I just figured for such a small bottle at that price, it would be more concentrated.  Last, the smell is patchouli and it&#x27;s awful.  I&#x27;m not sure why they thought any guy would want to smell like this.  It smells like something an old lady would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to the tea tree gel - it&#x27;s much better than this product.</li>
