            <li>It was a good investment and a great gift to give.</li>
            <li>It is smoother than the best I was able to get with a Mach 3, and my girlfriend agrees.</li>
            <li>Both razors give excellent shaves and I have no problem endorsing the purchase of either, but I believe the Merkur to be a bit more user-friendly.</li>
            <li>My technique has improved remarkably with the Merkur 34C as I no longer put pressure when shaving.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor, and the heft feels good in my hand.</li>
            <li>reviews gravitated towards the 34C as a good razor for newbies and experienced users alike for the price point</li>
            <li>Invest in some nice Feather blades and you&#x27;re in there!</li>

            <li>Nice product!</li>
            <li>The weight of the 34C, along with a really good blade, does all of the work and gives a great shave.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would never be able to shave with a razor,but this type of razor is perfect for African-Americam beards.  </li>

            <li>Good weight, I should have got the longer handle model.</li>
            <li>Good razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll also want to use some good pre-shave oil before you lather, so that the blade glides across your face.</li>
            <li>good shaver, i use it a lot</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to get a good soap (I use Art of Shaving cream for ease of use) and a good badger brush to lather with.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to get a good soap (I use Art of Shaving cream for ease of use) and a good badger brush to lather with.</li>
            <li>Good buy.  </li>
            <li>It is heavier than I thought it would be and that is good.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and efficient, and has excellent in-hand feel.</li>
            <li>: I like it, it is a good brush for the price.    </li>
            <li>it is a good blade and inexpensive.   </li>
            <li>and hopefully they will be as good as the reviews claim it to be in order for me to justify its price.</li>
            <li>- I use the Burleigh Chrome Razor and Brush Stand: it cost me $20, and I am supper impressed with this product quality and presentation (the packaging is fantastic)    </li>
            <li>The quality is that good.  </li>
            <li>The fit and finish are excellent.</li>
            <li>Wife commented, unsolicited, that my skin has looked really good since i started this method.    </li>
            <li>and it works really good with my skin type.  </li>
            <li>Its a quality unit and has good weight and balance to it.</li>
            <li>I started to lose hope on finding a good shaving method.</li>
            <li>Good luck with your search.</li>
            <li>With nice blades gives a great shave.</li>
            <li>Picked this up after reading all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Good shave</li>
            <li>Definitely a good starter razor.</li>
            <li>Expecting butterfly type, but works good</li>
            <li>Well made, good weight.</li>
            <li>This is a good DE razor, meets my needs.</li>
            <li>The merkur blades are good for about 3-4 shaves.</li>
            <li>Even Noxema is a good option.  </li>
            <li>so I wanted to find a good safety razor.</li>
            <li>Good quality product.</li>
            <li>Get a good blade, the sharpest you can find, and let it do the work.  </li>
            <li>So choose a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>some Personna and Feather blades and some good gel shaving</li>
            <li>Good blade takes hair off like it&#x27;s just wiping off a layer of</li>
            <li>Razor works good, still learning how to shave with it.</li>
            <li>I loved how protective it was but the butterfly-style blade mechanism started to seize up.  </li>
            <li>You get a good shave from these safety razors by learning how to use one, not the soap you put on your face.</li>
            <li>Good quality construction.</li>
            <li>- Don&#x27;t buy a safety razor like this Merkur, shave like you do with your Fusion, and expect a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are some tooling marks on it, but still it looks good.  </li>
            <li>I found this to not give a good shave.</li>
            <li>When you pick it up, it has good weight (almost like it has</li>
            <li>did some reason and Merkur seemed like a good choice to try as a starter.</li>
            <li>The chrome appears to be good quality as well.</li>
            <li>Good product, use a blade about three times, I don&#x27;t get any nicks</li>
            <li>Good Summary:</li>
            <li>The handle is non-slip and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>There is no way that I can call it good with one shave.  </li>
            <li>Good balance.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good value</li>
            <li>Take your time and use a good glycerin soap to work up your lather.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Merkur 34C to learn how to shave with a double-edged razor and it has been an excellent performer for fit, finish and function.</li>
            <li>My good friend told me tha</li>
            <li>seems like good quality</li>
            <li>Good for traveling.</li>
            <li>well built, feels good in my hand.</li>
            <li>quality workmanship; I&#x27;m delighted.</li>
            <li>The 34C is a good razor.</li>
            <li>This way you can a good blade that works for you.</li>
            <li>I like the size good grip</li>
            <li>it is good quality for the price.  </li>
            <li>Good razor and works as advertised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s superior to the cartridge based systems in every way.  </li>
            <li>Good shave for a fair price.</li>
            <li>Its a good entry level razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good razor.</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>He recommends you look up videos on The Art of Shaving store&#x27;s website for detailed directions on the best way to use these blades(says ignore videos on YouTube) and take your time while you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Please note: that you need a good shave soap or shave cream (not that combustible stuff in a can) for this product to work efficiently as designed.</li>
            <li>I recommend Speick shave cream with this razor, a good badger brush, and whatever your choice is of aftershave.</li>
            <li>This is a really good all-rounder.  </li>
            <li>I have learned that shave oil and good lather helps avoid cuts.</li>
            <li>good quality chrome finish.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because of all the good reviews of Merkur razors.</li>
            <li>Good razor.  </li>
            <li>If this would have been priced at 1/2 it would be a fair deal.  </li>
            <li>The Merkur 34C is a good razor.  </li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a good razor but not the shaving panacea that some would have you believe.</li>
            <li>this is a great razor to own...</li>
            <li>this is a great razor to own.</li>
            <li>No nicks, no cuts, no irritation, just a damn good shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for a good shaving cream/soap.</li>
            <li>Good weight, good size for medium hands.</li>
            <li>Good razor</li>
            <li>I discovered that Feather brand was really good for my skin and dialer type.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product...</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>Shaves good but doesn&#x27;t cut your face.</li>
            <li>Get a good cream and brush , don&#x27;t forget a stand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I recommend this, along with the Derby blades and some good face preparation.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re switching over from the radioactive-colored gel/plastic face-grater routine, it&#x27;s a good idea to take a gradual approach.</li>
            <li>You can do the with/against/cross method and lather every time, but even if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll get just as good as a cartridge, that&#x27;s the beauty.</li>
            <li>This is probably the best razor available, all categories.</li>
            <li>Product is of good quality.</li>
            <li>Hold is good.</li>
            <li>Takes a good a month or two</li>
            <li>Provides a good shave.</li>
            <li>were a good deal.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a good thing, because it lessons the chance that you&#x27;ll be tempted to push rather than</li>
            <li>With a good prep (lather, etc.), this razor will serve you well.</li>
            <li>It feels good in the hand, on my face and just performs well.</li>
            <li>Price is fair.</li>
            <li>and they all have been good razors to learn with.  </li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>Good item, as described, no troubles yet, good shipping and customer service.  </li>
            <li>It feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>Perfect blade gap for an efficient and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Good weight to it.</li>
            <li>Proud to own one.</li>
            <li>This razor is well made for the price, dont judge it by the blade they send with the razor because in my opinion it wasnt good.</li>
            <li>The blade that came with it worked really good for me</li>
            <li>This was a good beginning point, I don&#x27;t regret it.  </li>
            <li>Just as good as advertised.</li>
            <li>ANY form of shaving cream will result in a good shave.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend, he loved it, I tried it to shave my legs, I loved it.</li>
            <li>and it was good.  </li>
            <li>a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor is a good choice for anyone wanting a good, close shave.</li>
            <li>The razor itself is the perfect size and feel comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li>The weight is good, and it glides effortlessly when you use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- good weight</li>
            <li>It gives as good a shave as Gillette 3, 4 and five blade combinations.  </li>
            <li>Best DE razor available.</li>
            <li>If everyone knew how good shaving like this is Gillette would go out of business for the mens department immediately.</li>
            <li>and now a four pack good blades can cost you anywhere 15 to 20 dollars.</li>
            <li>The quality is good, or superior but go for the longer handle.</li>
            <li>Feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s environmentally a good it.</li>
            <li>Good weight and size.</li>
            <li>Took about a week to get a hang of this type of razor and learn good technique.  </li>
            <li>I also have an electric razor that I would use in a pinch, but also received a fair helping of razor burn from that too.</li>
            <li>they may be good for you</li>
            <li>This razor is a good quality and well built product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good razor.  </li>
            <li>The grip is superior even with some lather on it.  </li>
            <li>Using an Astra razor blade (for now) from an Amazon-sold variety pack, I found that the Merkur and the blade itself are surprisingly forgiving.  </li>
            <li>You do have to use a good quality shaving cream - not just one from the drug store.</li>
            <li>good weight, works as advertised, recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also own the Muhle  R89 and that gives and very nice shave as well.</li>
            <li>wonderful clean shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful object, in a manly and minimalist aesthetic, and it&#x27;s a nice thing to own in that respect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most beautiful thing on planet</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful piece made with outstanding craftsmanship.</li>

            <li>Paired mine with an Astra SP blade for an exceptional razor-to-blade pairing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The weight of the head is perfect and overall its a great product!.</li>
            <li>For me, the aveeno lotion works the best, although the olive oil, and only water work real good as well.</li>
            <li>It shaves great, feels good in the hand and works great whether your clean shaving, maintaining neat lines of your goatee or mustache or keeping the neckline neat on your beard..</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve heard many good reviews and the ratings on here are great for Merkur.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and seems great!</li>
            <li>the razor very smooth and great look</li>

            <li>Very pleased with the results.</li>

            <li>You will be very pleased.</li>
            <li>Sure, they work, but I have been using Personna blades to great satisfaction and am looking to try others as well when these run</li>

            <li>#34 is my favorite and its a great razor</li>
            <li>Okay moving on, this razor is great</li>
            <li>It has a good weight and feel to it, nice balance.</li>
            <li>Blade included is fair, but does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>so you get good shave and can maneuver nicely.  </li>
            <li>The razor itself looks nice and had a good weight to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite easily the best shave I&#x27;ve enjoyed.</li>
            <li>Best to shave right after a shower, use some pre-shave lotion or oil--Proraso or Art of Shaving</li>
            <li>With the right technique, this razor provides a consistently excellent, close shave, with almost no</li>
            <li>It is wonderful with the right blade</li>
            <li>I think most users will like this razor as it works well and gives very nice results once you get used to DE shaving techniques.</li>

            <li>It took me a full week to really figure out my face and neck shape/contours, as well as the best angle of attack of the blade itself, to get the best shave.</li>
            <li>This was the best decision I have ever made for my sensitive, rarely happy and irritible face.</li>
            <li>absolutly love this!</li>
            <li>-- so many options!  </li>
            <li>I would challenge beginners not to be scared of it as I was by the reviews of more senior shavers!</li>
            <li>More lather!  </li>
            <li>First time using a safety razor, and I have to say this razor is awesome.</li>
            <li>and I still love this product!  </li>

            <li>I have the Merkur 38c and love it!</li>
            <li>5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li>and I must say, I love it!</li>
            <li>and I think more men need to reconsider using cartridge razors and try a safety razor!</li>
            <li>This razor gives me a closer shave at a better cost to my wallet and the environment!</li>
            <li>I am really glad I did!  </li>
            <li>but it all turned out ok!</li>

            <li>and it got even better!</li>
            <li>You will need to purchase a good shave soap, some alum or a styptic pen, some lotion, and aftershave if you want a great shave, but those are really required for any great shave.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Outstanding razor!</li>
            <li>It arrived on time, in perfect condition, and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Probably cost a buck or two more to make than the $10 razors out there, just sayin&#x27;!</li>
            <li>Leave the latest cartridge razor fad on the grocery store shelves and buy this razor!</li>
            <li>After my first shave, I was TOTALLY impressed and had no issues.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it- best shave ever.</li>
            <li>but I do know that this Merkur HD gives me a pretty awesome close shave without any irritation or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>First off I lathered the shave cream real good and applied with brush to face for about 1 1/2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Then I took my time, followed these recommendations and got a perfect shave the first time with no nicks.  </li>
            <li>This was my first,  and it&#x27;s still the best shave I know of!</li>
            <li>Love this razor!</li>
            <li>Love this razor!</li>
            <li>I submerge the razor in hot water pre-shave and it works great coupled with Feather DE Blades!</li>
            <li>I am 61 now and the first time that I used it I was amazed, it was the best shave I ever had.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I decided to try DE shaving and I am so glad I did!  </li>

            <li>This was a great razor to start my set, and was easy to learn with.</li>
            <li>They are both great razors and will easily shave as close as the multiblade vibrating twin overhead cam 16 valve models at a quarter of the price.  </li>
            <li>The razor itself is a great quality and the weight makes the razor easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Works great, cleans easily.</li>

            <li>I started with Proraso, but these two brands are amazing.</li>
            <li>Its comfortable and my skin &amp; face look great.  </li>
            <li>It gives an amazingly close shave, with just 2 passes and a neck touch up.  </li>
            <li>Amazing razor feel like a man now</li>
            <li>Has an amazing feel in the hand.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s plenty of area for your fingertips on this razor, and the pattern on the handle provides a great slip free hold.  </li>
            <li>This razor makes the process effortless and amazing.  </li>
            <li>I figured they must have some amazing blade in it, so I put one of my feather blades in it to see the difference.</li>
            <li>There was none, it was still amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing shave</li>

            <li>Great weight and a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The blade is amazing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a Badger hair brush or fancy cream and am still getting an amazingly smooth/close shave.</li>
            <li>Nice quality razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that straight castor oil works best for me, which is cheaper than buying the packaged pre-shave oil.</li>
            <li>Well balanced, nice knurled stock.</li>
            <li>I liked the weight, I feel like it made learning how to shave with a safety razor</li>
            <li>and I really liked the result...</li>
            <li>Nice razor, I like to use feather blades with mine.</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s the point of having a nice luxury car with a variety of electrical problems.</li>
            <li>Very much liked the 2-piece construction.  </li>
            <li>Seems much better built than the Edwin Jagger, and the engineering is much superior regarding the screwing mechanism.</li>
            <li>When you combine it with good blades -- you have a winning combination.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a nice bonus that, in addition to coming with a Merkur blade, it&#x27;s also packed with a box of Dorco blades to try.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a nice bonus that, in addition to coming with a Merkur blade, it&#x27;s also packed with a box of Dorco blades to try.  </li>
            <li>Nice construction.</li>
            <li>but oh well, they perform nicely anyways.</li>
            <li>I loaded it up, got nice and lathered and began shaving.</li>
            <li>you want my advice on how to get the absolute best shave?</li>
            <li>Every man should own one.</li>
            <li>Reliable, nicely weighted, does the job.</li>
            <li>There are so many good things about this razor and the quality of the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>so we got him his own for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>The shave is great, and is more of an enjoyable experience than it was with the Fusion.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a good one and almost any shave will be luxurious.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice heft to it too.</li>
            <li>This one is so good, i bought 4 more for my boys.</li>
            <li>I was going to upgrade if I liked</li>
            <li>let its own weight do the work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pick a nice shaving soap that suits your needs.</li>
            <li>You will nick sporadically and the titanium dioxide will tidy things up (but man does it</li>
            <li>Make sure you get a good quality badger brush and shaving cream/soap.  </li>
            <li>Nice weight and feel to it.</li>
            <li>+ for most good safety razors).</li>
            <li>Fits in your hand nicely.</li>
            <li>effectively weighted razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The weight feels good and it helps make the shave all the better.</li>
            <li>It is a nice razor.</li>
            <li>This one is a nice medium comb.</li>
            <li>As nice as it would be to save money</li>
            <li>Best investment ever , my face thanks you.</li>
            <li>Nice weight...</li>
            <li>Nice razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The razor doesn’t get gummed up during the shave and dipping and shaking in a warm bowl or water or giving it a blast from the faucet</li>
            <li>/&gt;The razor doesn’t get gummed up during the shave and dipping and shaking in a warm bowl or water or giving it a blast from the faucet</li>
            <li>Nice razor.  </li>
            <li>It sits nicely there</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s nice and grippy.</li>
            <li>Boar hair brushes are supposed to be good for face lathering (which seems like better and faster preparation than bowl lathering).</li>
            <li>The razor is well built and feels nice in the hand.</li>
            <li>Fits hand nicely and works well in shaving.</li>
            <li>Wonderful weight and has stayed looking good after nearly a year of use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to do that with my Edwin Jagger, vintage Gillettes, or my $15 Feather Popular.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews of this razor used with the Feather blades and since most of the reviews were really good</li>
            <li>and he really liked it.</li>
            <li>The razor itself has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li>It was, however, quite effective in that role.</li>
            <li>Nice, heavyweight razor.  </li>
            <li>One day I&#x27;ll step it up and get some nice lathering shave soap &amp; a bowl, but until then this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice looking razor.  </li>
            <li>And twenty one years ago I paid 60.00 for this razor, the prices on Amazon are more than fair.</li>
            <li>The Merkur has a nice heft to it and combined with the feather and derby blades I have tried to date</li>
            <li>This razor has a nice weight to it.  </li>
            <li>That noted, it would be quite handy to travel with.</li>
            <li>I own the 39C as well and</li>
            <li>this is the absolute best shave he has ever had.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 2016-12-05&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this razor for over three years now, and it&#x27;s still as nice as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li>Its weight feels nicely balanced to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a in the pocket kind of purchase for someone like me wanting to start out with a quality razor, getting to learn the art, and not blowing the bank.</li>
            <li>Nice razor, but not for me.</li>
            <li>It provides an excellent shave and is built very well.</li>
            <li>Soak your brush in warm water while you shower.</li>
            <li>the money will own it for years to come.</li>
            <li>I liked that razor, but even though it is lined</li>
            <li>If you take the time to get used to it, and use good shaving lather you will love this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The quality of design, materials &amp; build are incredible -certainly worth the cost.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t figure out the differences between the popular ones listed</li>
            <li>so I went ahead and ordered 6 of them to do my own evaluation.</li>
            <li>It feels nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I find sharper blades like Rapira swedish stainless, Feather (the best in my opinion) and</li>
            <li>but it works very well and gives an excellent shave with the Merkur blades.</li>
            <li>I has a nice weight and balance to it.</li>
            <li>nicely balanced.</li>
            <li>This razor feels awesome and performs very well.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it.</li>
            <li>This Merkur seems kind of pricey</li>
            <li>Nice feel.</li>
            <li>I own 16  saftey razors, 6 being merkurs.</li>
            <li>Nice chrome finish.</li>
            <li>I own 8 safety razors.  </li>
            <li>I plan on contacting the manufacturer to see if the some kind of warranty.</li>
            <li>Feels nice in my hand.</li>
            <li>I just purchased it with the Merkur Platinum coated stainless blades, used this razor twice and have received the best shave yet.</li>
            <li>Nice weight and balance.</li>
            <li>Nice weight to it.  </li>
            <li>Well crafted and works nicely.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice quality product.</li>
            <li>There are dozens of blades, buying a couple of each of the ones with good reviews, should put you on the right path - happy shaving..</li>
            <li>nice razor,very comfortable, love it!!</li>
            <li>The razor is top notch, I was worried about the finish from reading other reviews, but the finish is perfect and looks great everywhere!  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product, excellent quality, built for life, easy to use, cheap to replace blades and shaves closer than anything on the market!     </li>
            <li>It has a very nice feel, not too hefty, not too light.  </li>
            <li>Happy that I made the move from the 4-blade systems to this great, classic method.  </li>
            <li>Merkur is a great brand, never disappointed.</li>
            <li>The merkur HD is more suitable for a beginner and even the more experienced shavers.</li>
            <li>Great razor - definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>Others have recommended this particular Merkur as one of the best.  </li>
            <li>I clean the razor before every use, and the chrome is still in great shape.</li>
            <li>After one year the razor looks great if I clean it up and has no rust.  </li>
            <li>Gives a great clean shave.</li>
            <li>This is a great foundation for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Something that people have to remember is that your razor is only as good as the blades that you use, so please do this razor justice and get some nice blades that feel great for your skin.</li>
            <li>VERY HAPPY AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR FOR BEGINNERS AND PRO&#x27;S</li>
            <li>you want to shave like your grandpa did and get a good clean quality shave...make the transition now!</li>
            <li>The lather builds up quickly, has great cushioning and glide, and the smell is amazing on both soaps.    </li>
            <li>My first shave with this razor, with one of the included Merkur blades, was incredible.</li>
            <li>The great reviews of this razor are all true.  </li>
            <li>, you will enjoy a close, smooth shave that looks good and feels great.</li>
            <li>First time using this razor achieved an incredible close shave.  </li>
            <li>I was brand new to DE shaving when I got this razor and it has worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Best new razor on the market.</li>
            <li>I feel the shave is as good or frankly most of the time now better than my Fusion (who now resides in the bottom</li>
            <li>They shipped quick and would happily order from them again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a relatively mild razor but it&#x27;s great to learn technique.</li>
            <li>Feels super premium, looks good, great weight on the skin, cleans easily.</li>
            <li>I got some nice soap, a badger brush, Merkur 34C, and a nice stand to top it all off.</li>
            <li>You should invest in a shaving brush (preferably badger hair), a good non alcohol based shaving soap/cream, a styptic pen (if you cut yourself this will effectively sanitize the area and stop the bleeding you can get these really cheap at any drugstore for a couple of dollars).    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li>Changing the blades is very easy.</li>
            <li>bulldog handle makes the razor very easy to maneuver; and the razor&#x27;s head allows for close shaving in under one&#x27;s nose.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very easy to replace blades (you just unscrew the bottom part and the head plate comes off)</li>
            <li>I have been using #34C for almost two months, and I find it very easy to maneuver on my face.</li>
            <li>Blades are very easy to change.</li>
            <li>If you have a porcelain, steel, or tile tub, this razor can get damaged very easily.  </li>
            <li>design makes it very easy to change a blade.</li>
            <li>Very easy to handle, substantial in the hand, and takes the guesswork out of blade exposure.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to change blades.</li>
            <li>Maintenance is very easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also cleans very easily and the blade is a breeze to change out.</li>
            <li>Very easy to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started my safety razor shaving with this razor and it was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The handle is shorter than the Parker but very easy to control.  </li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor over the $10 price point and it looks nice and feels nice and provides a great shave.</li>
            <li>Best shave of my life by far!  </li>
            <li>and finding that the more elegant and economical Harry&#x27;s cartridge razor, while excellent for what it is, didn&#x27;t shave any better than the Gillette razors.</li>
            <li>Now I do have 13 more different types of blades to try out, and find what works best for me, but as of right now I am very happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Great razor, thanks!!</li>
            <li>The Merkur is a very good razor at an extremely reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Good quality, easy to use and with the right blade, a great shave.</li>
            <li>The 34c provided a smooth, comfortable shave with no pulling of my beard, no unpleasant burn after each stroke and surprisingly it was even fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 34c is brilliantly designed and the chrome finish and heft make it a pleasure to own and to use.</li>
            <li>So far, for me, the Merkur blade is wonderful!</li>
            <li>So far, for me, the Merkur blade is wonderful!</li>
            <li>Good fit and finish for the price.  </li>
            <li>One of the most popular razors in the world.</li>
            <li>One motion with the 34C gets rid of more hair than the trendy 5 bladed junkers that I used to use.    </li>
            <li>It is by far the best shave that I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine was natural and the best for me, but was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>That being said the five free blades do good for starters, but I don&#x27;t think the blades where that grate</li>
            <li>I could shave my face to baby smooth, going with and then against the grain and have a good shave.  </li>
            <li>This thing is proof that sometimes the old ways are the best ways.</li>
            <li>Waiting on my Feather blades to arrive and hope they are worth the wait for a great shave.</li>
            <li>The replacement blades are cheap and I&#x27;m getting 20 good shaves out of a razor.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor order a sample pack and figure out what you like, not what is most popular.</li>
            <li>This model is the most popular of the safety razors according to online reading.</li>
            <li>I had a cheap Walmart DE razor and I loved it</li>
            <li>but wow,  this is the best investment you can get with shaving.  </li>
            <li>What a great shave, and so economical.</li>
            <li>The blade is held in securely and has good balance.  </li>
            <li>awesome, old school but sometimes old school was the best.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best razor</li>
            <li>Both the weight and length, in my opinion, provide a better sense of control when shaving, allowing for a closer shave and tighter lines if you&#x27;re wearing a beard or side burns of any kind.</li>
            <li>I enjoy giving myself a good shave.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t scream luxury or pricey like the Futur, but I honestly think I like it better.</li>
            <li>There are many who compare this to an Edwin Jagger DE89, which I also own (DE89LBL lined handle).</li>
            <li>Kind of a pain in the butt to change the blade case you have to unscrew the top part</li>
            <li>Best shave since I was 16 years old.</li>
            <li>If you like a good smooth shave, this and the quality blade of your choice (my choice was Personna) can deliver.</li>
            <li>Parker Badger Bristle Brush is amazingly soft and the Taylor Luxury Shaving Cream is superb...a magnificent combination to prepare your beard after showering.  </li>
            <li>Important to have a good blade with it.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is the most cost effective razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Today I used the feather blades and except for one or two nicks, my face was smooth and good to go.  </li>
            <li>The quality of this razor is outstanding, has a nice sturdy construction.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good, compact razor with good weight.</li>
            <li>New interesting but works great!</li>
            <li>it is a great beginner razor but still gets close with the right angle</li>

            <li>This razor is absolutely nice, has a good solid weight to it, and beautiful finish.</li>

            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a great razor for accomplishing a great close shave.</li>

            <li>If you are interested in a closer shave, for yourself or the man in your life, I recommend this as a great gift idea.</li>
            <li>This is my first DE Safety Razor and it has been a great one to learn with.</li>
            <li>This is my first  Safety Razor and it has been a great one to learn with.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>Went to shaving101.com and read about what is a good starter razor and decided to go with the 34c because of the shorter handle and many justified outstanding reviews.</li>
            <li>Vintage Gillette razors for $10 are made of higher quality materials, but it does give a great shave.</li>
            <li>Great first purchase for those who want to try a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>Great first time razor</li>
            <li>My skin has not felt this good in many decades, smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li>34C has been a great first DE razor for me.</li>
            <li>Great for first time users.  </li>
            <li>Good feel, good weight, and looks good hanging next to the sink.</li>
            <li>Everything everyone else has said is true, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>This razor gives a good shave and is made with true craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>to clean, chrome is excellent, very durable, blade sits squarely and snug.  </li>
            <li>I now discover after shaving for 30 years with subpar results, that good preparation and using a decent safety razor &amp; good blades are a must.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use (have never cut myself), and actually is much more enjoyable to use than cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>I love the close shave it provides and how it is so easy to use!</li>
            <li>Fine tool indeed!</li>
            <li>Holds blade very securely.  </li>
            <li>I have to be very light with the pressure.</li>
            <li>It provides a very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just a very smooth razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Very comfortable and forgiving.</li>
            <li>Very cheap (relatively).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a beautiful razor, and with shaving oil, it&#x27;s capable of more than I&#x27;m doing with it.</li>
            <li>not a better shaver on the market - perfectly weighted, for great control and balance.</li>
            <li>It feels nice in the hand, and blades are easy to change out.</li>
            <li>You can use this thing with pressurized can shaving cream, it works good except it clogs quickly.</li>
            <li>Thing is, if I want a quick, really good shave, the cartridge is the \\&quot;no-fuss\\&quot; way to go.</li>
            <li>It has a nicely machined look to it and a knurled grip so it won&#x27;t easily slip in your hand.</li>
            <li>Nice weight, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Polsilver - Super Iridium do a good job.</li>

            <li>I would guess and to be honest I can get a pretty good shave with disposables.  </li>
            <li>I actually enjoy waking up and whipping up my lather and shaving; I can&#x27;t find a better way to wake up!  </li>
            <li>Conclusion, the Merkur is well built, easy to clean, nice quality - I&#x27;m very glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a first time user, it takes a while trying to find the right angle that&#x27;s going to give you the perfect shave.</li>
            <li>It offers the perfect balance and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>It has a very solid feel and good weight, and paired with a good razor blade (there are many to choose from, so find one that works for you) results in a very satisfying shaving experience.</li>
            <li>Hi: It is as I expected: beautifully crafted and gives me a very nice shave.</li>
            <li>It works great, easy to clean and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>Shaves great, feels great in my hand and is easy to control due the nice hefty weight.  </li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>easier since I didn&#x27;t need to apply any more pressure than the razor already provided.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s waaay better shaving with this than cartridges...</li>
            <li>And as many people say the thing is that you don&#x27;t have to pressure it just let the weight of the shaver do its job.</li>
            <li>sure if this will work or not</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Blades are cheap!</li>
            <li>Blades are cheap!</li>
            <li>I will post more as I use it</li>
            <li>i found great reviews for this razor and decided to buy not knowing anything about straight razors.</li>
            <li>do your self a favor and get this razor and make shaving enjoyable rather than a task of the day.</li>
            <li>&quot; there can be no debate about which one performs better and gives you a better shave.  </li>
            <li>Feathers might be a bit risky for newbies, but are probably the most popular and perhaps sharpest blade available from what I gather.</li>
            <li>after using it for a month, I found the shaving experience much better than the Gillette fusion.</li>
            <li>He has a nice, close shave, which we both enjoy.</li>
            <li>A great alternative to the modern multi-blade methodology of shaving.  </li>
            <li>For those needing a more aggressive shave, think Merkur slant.</li>
            <li>How about paying 5 cents a week for razors and getting a better shave.</li>
            <li>The Bloc Osma alum block seemed like a good value, and it really does tighten up your skin nicely.    </li>
            <li>but once you try it, your will love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>as I&#x27;ve always viewed razors before, this is more of a premium quality tool.  </li>
            <li>There are so, so many types of skin and beards and preferences.  </li>
            <li>There are so, so many types of skin and beards and preferences.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent with a Feather double edge blade.</li>
            <li>and since I have to shave more often I wanted to invest in something that would not give me irritation.      </li>
            <li>on Youtube has excellent videos on how to shave properly.      </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about a month now and let me tell you I honestly now ENJOY shaving each day -</li>
            <li>Another thing I love about DE shaving is the cost of blades.</li>
            <li>Shaving was one of those things and they had the best tool for the job, a simple and efficient razor that got the job done and did it well.</li>
            <li>Shaving was one of those things and they had the best tool for the job, a simple and efficient razor that got the job done and did it well.</li>
            <li>A nice heft that leads to a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Shaving immediately became an enjoyable experience, and I have a closer, better looking shave to boot.</li>
            <li>I used the vibrating Fusion before I switched to this, and many others before that.     </li>
            <li>Boy, am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>So glad i am no longer paying $15 for 4 blades.</li>
            <li>Love this razor.  </li>
            <li>Much better shave, no razor burn and bumps.  </li>
            <li>the cost, but  better than nothing.</li>
            <li>No tugging or yanking just a really satisfying close shave.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>I just took my time and it was actually enjoyable.    </li>
            <li>Very maneuverable, and leaves my face feeling great.</li>
            <li>i like being able to install a blade while holding the handle and not having to hold the head between my fingers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that most of the longer reviews are more about the experience of shaving than the product itself.  </li>
            <li>Switching is one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve made recently.</li>
            <li>I looked into different razors, but wanted to get a quality one, many sites said this was the best.</li>
            <li>but in use the Merkur just feels more in control.  </li>
            <li>It may be what people say, its slightly more aggressive.  </li>
            <li>for design I love the 2 piece approach.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased the HD.</li>
            <li>Best you can get.&lt;br /&gt;All German...</li>
            <li>Most educated opinions pointed to a Merkur safety razor as one of the finest razors money can buy, so I took a chance and ordered the 34C.    </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll get a better shave.</li>
            <li>quite possibly the best</li>
            <li>quite possibly the best</li>
            <li>I love the portability this size provides.    </li>
            <li>Overall, one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li>I would give it a couple more stars if I were able.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too many blades does nothing more than drive up your monthly expenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Merkur safety razor is an excellent razor for anyone wanting to get started with more traditional shaving.</li>
            <li>My razor was over machined, and the top part isn&#x27;t square and curves toward the edge.</li>
            <li>So, just pick the one with the cheaper price and buy from a reputable seller.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite DE razor.</li>
            <li>The blade that comes with it is ok</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Because it is double-edged you get twice as many shaves as with any disposable.  </li>
            <li>The Schick gives me a lot better and smoother shave.</li>
            <li>bet it&#x27;s a much better shave with all the fancy soaps and brushes.      </li>
            <li>The Merkur&#x27;s design will last forever and never break and the shave is PERFECT.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Nice finish and fit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of durability, I think I did an okay job.</li>
            <li>I change my every 1 to 1/2 weeks, depending on how many times you shave in a week.</li>
            <li>Rinse off, use an alum bar or apply your favorite lotion or aftershave.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say I love it.  </li>
            <li>My hubby is totally satisfied with this razor.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I bought</li>
            <li>tried many electric razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a ok close shave to start</li>
            <li>LOVE shaving with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>Better blades keep blade from tugging.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>As soon as you master the shaving method, you will be quite pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>This 2-piece Merkur is much more dependable.  </li>
            <li>I love the design of this razor.</li>
            <li>Getting the razor has changed shaving all together for me, and I think of it as more of a relaxing and enjoyable experience than before.</li>
            <li>It has a longer handle and a bit more heft to it.</li>
            <li>Okay, it&#x27;s been awhile now.  </li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>He said his ingrown hairs have reduced a bit and his skin feels better.</li>
            <li>One hundred blades will last me two years and it is the best deal.</li>
            <li>Merkur and like it better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a bit worried about switching to a safety razor as I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d end up with all kinds of nicks.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t shave but during the work week) just to keep them healthy.</li>
            <li>Save you some cash and just stick with your favorite canned cream.</li>
            <li>The Gillette twin blade pivot gives me a better shave and that includes the multi blade razors.</li>
            <li>I thought each update of their razor would bring a better shaving experience.</li>
            <li>Glad I ordered refills along with it.</li>
            <li>The short handle doesn&#x27;t bother me at all since it fits me perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this razor one week ago and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I picked this up on the advice of the Badger and Blade forms and am quite pleased with the product as a hole, the razor is well built and after using it for three months</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor several years ago from Amazon and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the close shave.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>bought this when I decided to start using a safety razor again(I started on one and then switched to a gillette, many years ago) to see if I still like it.</li>
            <li>Love this razor.  </li>
            <li>A lot more enjoyable with soap and a badger brush than canned cream and your fingers.</li>
            <li>It makes for a better cut.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>As for blades, I went with the Amazon top reviewed and bought the Feathers.</li>
            <li>but when you get used to it, you will love it because you can swing the razor in all positions easily.&lt;br /&gt;9)</li>
            <li>I purchased this after many days of research.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this one and not the longer version.</li>
            <li>and it was a good shave and the free ones ihad received look cheap</li>
            <li>The Feather blades were noticeably better than the Astra and Derby blades, in all 3 razors.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding value for the price too.  </li>
            <li>It feels ok.  </li>
            <li>While I did not care for the blades that came with the razor, I absolutely love the razor itself.  </li>
            <li>magic shave, mach 3, Fusion (or</li>
            <li>Using Art of Shaving products and Merkur blades, I&#x27;m able to get a close shave with no razor burn/bumps.  </li>
            <li>This was a return to an earlier time and it still works great!  </li>
            <li>sure why but a DE sided razor came to mind</li>
            <li>but I think alot more people should use.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a great compromise between straight razor shaving and cost.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>Lasted 5 years until the top broke off.</li>
            <li>Also, on a side note - the handle unscrews from the bottom of the razor, not the top.  </li>
            <li>Which translates to sharper blades and better shaves on the cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice and light in my hand.  </li>
            <li>better personally.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, make sure to use soap or else it won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>i am satisfied from product</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Fantastic razor!  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>it more and more wih every use. ^_^</li>
            <li>But faster or a better shave?</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>Take the plunge, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>My Fiance&#x27; said, Best present ever!</li>
            <li>I love this razor and the blade that came with it.</li>
            <li>This straight razor is really, really great.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a great razor that didn&#x27;t cost a whole lot.</li>
            <li>more than 3 shaves</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>so I am learning, but I am extremely pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>They give a great, close shave, and are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>it cause more break outs?</li>
            <li>you are on the fence and have the time and money, I recommend adding 2 to 5 minutes to your shave time for a better, cheaper</li>
            <li>and I find it more enjoyable shave experience.  </li>
            <li>could have been better.  </li>
            <li>This is a FANTASTIC razor!</li>
            <li>This will probably be my most used and favorite razor.</li>
            <li>The blade that came with it is okay</li>
            <li>but the Persona Blades seem to work better in it.</li>
            <li>Words cannot describe how pleased I am with this razor.</li>
            <li>Makes shaving a much more rewarding activity; more relaxing as well.  </li>
            <li>cost of blades is much more acceptable as well.  </li>
            <li>I used Feather razor and I love how it shaves.</li>
            <li>I purchased a variety pack of blades and have decided the best for me is the Derby DE blades, although many others worked well too, only a couple I didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>The biggest difference in the quality of your shave with this razor will be from the blade, because the razor itself is tip top.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There had to be a better way.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using a EJ 89LBL for a bit now because most reviews said the Merkur 34C HD was too aggressive of a shaver.</li>
            <li>I love the way it shaves.</li>
            <li>and have been completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>no matter how many whiskers we had on our face,</li>
            <li>Then I re-lather and slide the razor against the grain, once again allowing the weight of the razor do the work and I have a nice comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>#34;it was the best shave of my life&amp;#34;, but my cheeks aren&#x27;t sophisticated enough to know the difference...</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many better razors to learn with.</li>
            <li>Double Edge Razor #34C because of the excellent feedback after doing a lot of research.</li>
            <li>This is probably one of the better purchases I&#x27;ve made.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, the cost savings I&#x27;m experiencing using this razor instead of the Gillette line is astonishing.  </li>
            <li>my wife and I agree that the Merkur gives me a much better shave than the Gillette Mach 5 system.  </li>
            <li>This one is recommended by most sites I&#x27;ve read</li>
            <li>Solid design and quality blades have resulted in my best shaves ever.</li>
            <li>After the many reviews I decided to take a shot</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>That has dissipated, so either I&#x27;m getting better at it or</li>
            <li>I am really glad that I decided to buy the Merkur 34c.</li>
            <li>and I now realize that it was a more aggresive razor.</li>
            <li>I love the quality</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading reviews on many razors, I decided to splurge on this one.</li>
            <li>a simple but elegant look and a perfectly knurled handle</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m also completely satisfied with the Merkur 34C HD.</li>
            <li>My plan is to shower and shave at night this week to get more practice.</li>
            <li>The Merkur HD is a safe bet for all beggining DE razor shavers out there.</li>
            <li>and I have not gotten many nicks.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I had m 4th shave with it tonight and each time it&#x27;s getting better and better.</li>
            <li>The more you use it, the better you&#x27;ll become.</li>
            <li>I have to say I am completely pleased with my purchase and have since been trying to my friends to also purchase this razor.</li>
            <li>The top unscrews and comes off.</li>
            <li>I wish more stuff was made like this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Order more with the razor.</li>
            <li>He shaves a lot more often than he used to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better for the environment than disposables, too.</li>
            <li>Ordered after reading reviews for many razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I went with this.  </li>
            <li>I still utilize my Gillette multiblade razor for a better shave.</li>
            <li>Its not too aggressive nor too safe.</li>
            <li>After two months of shaving with this I haven&#x27;t nicked or cut myself once, and I love the shave.  </li>
            <li>Been using for about 8 months and love it.</li>
            <li>Are you ready for a great shave?</li>
            <li>In fact, you&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
            <li>I could not be more satasfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I am trying different blades to find the perfect match.  </li>
            <li>I am now using a Weber and it is much better made and gives smoother shaves.</li>
            <li>It is a two piece design with the handle and comb guard as one piece and the top of the head removes to change out blades.</li>
            <li>The Merkur blade that comes with this razor is not the sharpest or most forgiving blade on the market.</li>
            <li>So glad I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>I love the shave.</li>
            <li>and it sure did.</li>
            <li>Over all its ok a littlesmaller than im used to</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s actual shaving qualities, but it looks and feels great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting a better shave with a cheaper razor.</li>
            <li>and I get a much better shave than with a multi edge.</li>
            <li>It sits on my granite counter-top without touching the blade to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this razor for a month and love it.</li>
            <li>Much better shave than a disposable or electric razor</li>
            <li>The balance, weight, ease of shave transforms the shaving chore to an enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li>This razor works much better for me and my face.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding razor.</li>
            <li>I used to use this type of shavers many years ago as a teenager, then moved on to gillette excel (two blades) and then 3 blades.  </li>
            <li>but now I get them a lot more.)  </li>
            <li>Safe to say though it was all hype.</li>
            <li>The weight and size is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>This truly is a durable razor that will last a lifetime of flawless shaves if you maintain it.</li>
            <li>Despite what the ads say, women don&#x27;t want it, and it just provides more things for your body chemistry to reject.</li>
            <li>That by itself will give you a MUCH better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not using an axe anymore, it&#x27;s more like a trusty knife.</li>
            <li>You MAY have to pay a bit more attention to what you&#x27;re doing, but if you&#x27;re a guy like me who has had to deal with bumps/irritation for years, you already were.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Construction of the Merkur 34C is top notch.</li>
            <li>Love this razor.  </li>
            <li>So much better than disposables.  </li>
            <li>Love this razor.  </li>
            <li>Shaves as well as your favorite 17 blade cartridge.</li>
            <li>Much better.</li>
            <li>After my son read many reviews and about razors.</li>
            <li>Thank you for offering such a great product!</li>
            <li>Much better than my multi-blade disposable.</li>
            <li>This used to be THE razor, and many articles still point to it.</li>
            <li>I switched from cartridges as they were not giving a close shave any more.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried this.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;ve thoroughly enjoyed - and frankly look forward to - shaving with this product.</li>
            <li>This Merkur razor shaves more deliberately than a proglide.  </li>
            <li>With the shorter handle, I feel there is more control.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more for my sons.</li>
            <li>the shaver works but after almost 9 months of trying out many blades I gave up.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay, though.</li>
            <li>Great weight, really allows you to avoid applying pressure.</li>
            <li>Top notch.</li>
            <li>and I have never gotten a better shave.</li>
            <li>Both are great products and are very forgiving on my face.  </li>
            <li>Once you find a brand of blade that works best for your facial hair/skin, you will notice the difference.  </li>
            <li>I love the thought of saving money on razor blades.  </li>
            <li>Sure it&#x27;s not the 5 blade razor that I was</li>
            <li>The quality of the product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>The screw in the handle loosens the top of the razor which is removed</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Have had this blade for a couple months now, and love the transition from the Mach 3 to this blade.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>the 34 is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use for a beginner and looks great.</li>
            <li>But I view this as investing in a skill that helps me know myself better, take better care of my skin, and feel more manly and confident.  </li>
            <li>Overall very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I chose the shorter handle as it also allows better control.</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my go to razor amongst many.</li>
            <li>and I love mine.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Shaving doesn&#x27;t take any more time than it did before.</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>Will spur more razor purchases</li>
            <li>That may be why I use it more.  </li>
            <li>make sure you try it with a diff blade</li>
            <li>I ended up giving this to a buddy and buying the 38 hd which was much, much better</li>
            <li>Not going to lie, but it gets that baby smooth feel!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I plan on holding onto it for many years to come.</li>
            <li>Quality that should last a lifetime...add a feather blade and experience an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to use the rasor yet because the blade had a nit</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t as for more from a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I looked into the best bang for my buck with shaving and kept coming back to safety razors.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>This razor is okay not my favorite, but i will still leave it in my rotation.</li>
            <li>I used the Feather butterfly for more than 2 years.</li>
            <li>but it got the touches started to change and thus after reading so many reviews, I have decided to choose this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>my &#x27;grandpa&#x27; used to use, because as things go on they are supposed to get better</li>
            <li>and it is so much better than those fancy disposable blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Be ready to bleed at frist lol</li>
            <li>Much better shave than when I have to use a disposable head system.</li>
            <li>I find that the Persona blades work the best for me; but the safety blade itself is a personal choice.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews, I went with the Merkur 34C and have been nothing but pleased.  </li>
            <li>Dip the ends in a bit of water if you need more.</li>
            <li>:) I</li>
            <li>And the razor is good quality and worth</li>
            <li>Some much better than those multi-bladed razors.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get use to this.</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy shaving now!</li>
            <li>I get a much better shave with this than a fusion.  </li>
            <li>When using an Astra or 7 o&#x27;clock I get a nice smooth shave and the blades are cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it .</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Performance is top notch</li>
            <li>but wonder why I messed around with all those pricey shaving systems for so many years.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I love it...</li>
            <li>But I love this razor.</li>
            <li>But I use this Merkur the most.</li>
            <li>I hope they&#x27;re enjoying it</li>
            <li>But eventually, I wanted something more substantial.  </li>
            <li>The price to quality ratio of this razor is outstanding.</li>
            <li>Outstanding razor.</li>
            <li>Razor works well, however I chose a more aggressive razor.</li>
            <li>Requires more prep time and attention</li>
            <li>My technique is gradually getting better and there is a difference in blades used.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It is simply the best shaving appliance that I have ever used!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE shaving now.</li>
            <li>Outstanding quality for price.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try a Merkur with a shorter handle to see if I could get better control and balance.</li>
            <li>but if you go and buy the cgeapest bladrs you can find youll get a better shave</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>Much better than the electric i switched from.</li>
            <li>The shorter handle is supposed to be more forgiving</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>so you get a warm smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This razor is top quality.</li>
            <li>Too many ingrown hairs, razor burn,</li>
            <li>I love it for its utility, for the replacement blade cost, and its durability.</li>
            <li>So I did some online research and found many people recommending safety razors, if for nothing than for their affordability.</li>
            <li>After, the second shave, I got the feel of it and am now getting the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from any razor.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to buying bulk premium blades online and saving even more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;People on forums said the 34c is more aggressive than the DE89...</li>
            <li>I Was under the impression that it would hold up better than that.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>Still testing the blades out to find my favorite.</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars because I like it but dont love it yet.</li>
            <li>I am well pleased with the 34C.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying shaving with this razor, it takes three passes but the shave is close and does not irritate my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get an enjoyable shave</li>
            <li>A friend told me about Merkur and glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>Love the feel of this.</li>
            <li>I also get a lot better shave while in the shower after having washed my face.</li>
            <li>sure there are better razors out there</li>
            <li>Having the screw at the bottom makes changing blades easier and faster than the top screw of the Jagger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish it had a bit more heft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably go with it in hopes of getting a greater heft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m satisfied, pleased with it, and glad that I got it.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to get a safety razor, I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with it.</li>
            <li>A much more enjoyable shaving experience than using disposable multi-blades razors.</li>
            <li>I have not cut or nicked myself one time :).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking with it :)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I did, and now shaving has become almost a hobby and something I look forward to doing instead of</li>
            <li>the shaves are much better.  </li>
            <li>It is not my favorite</li>
            <li>I think the Jagger manufacturing quality is slightly better than the Merkur.</li>
            <li>The best and most used double edge razor in the market.</li>
            <li>As in most cases, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Based on the Futur, I wasn&#x27;t sure that DE shaving was for me.  </li>
            <li>It comes with one Merkur blade which was perfectly okay to me</li>
            <li>like the way that it is a 2 piece over most others are a 3 piece.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is absolutely better than the cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>Merkur is the best razor I was shaving with in my entire life.</li>
            <li>Most of my life I used Gillette razors, butterfly, adjustable and ball-end.  </li>
            <li>much better for the skin....</li>
            <li>BUT IT IS STILL VERY EFFECTIVE AND EASY TO USE WITH MY VERY LARGE HANDS.</li>
            <li>Provides a great shave and is pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>A multi-pack with an assortment of blades would be a good purchase as well so that you can try out other manufacturers and find the best fit for your skin and beard type.</li>
            <li>A multi-pack with an assortment of blades would be a good purchase as well so that you can try out other manufacturers and find the best fit for your skin and beard type.</li>
            <li>*Now, I understand, that all you need is this safety razor, the right technique and a good blade.    </li>
            <li>Item came really quick and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because I didn&#x27;t really know what I was doing, but many blogs recommended this razor as the best for a rookie, and I&#x27;m glad I went with it.  </li>
            <li>Very nice and capable razor for the money.  </li>
            <li>But very nice shave, very proffesional looking.</li>
            <li>this was my first DE razor and is still one of my favorites!!!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty cheap razor that has a great reputation for the most part.</li>
            <li>The Merkur that came with is very sharp and gives a great shave, have Persona now, and they are OK, but not that great as they could be sharper.</li>
            <li>you are thinking about getting into classic shaving, this is a great place to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Great grip, decent heft,</li>
            <li>It is a snap to clean and you just twist off the handle and run warm water over it.</li>
            <li>What a nice feeling in the hand, smooth threads inside promote easy and safe blade changes.</li>
            <li>For best results, you have to shave against the grain with it -- that&#x27;s why the shorter-handle version is better than the long handle.  </li>
            <li>But shaves are clean and nice</li>
            <li>close shave well made decent price great starter.</li>
            <li>The product&#x27;s fit and finish is perfect, not a single flaw that I can find.  </li>
            <li>The whole ritual involved with the shaving is a bit more pleasant and well,</li>
            <li>I just love it, it fells good on my hand,  right size and a very close shave, price was good</li>
            <li>He has thick,curly,course hair and it gives a very clean close shave.</li>
            <li>I get a very clean shave (closer than Excel) without any irritation.</li>
            <li>It looks VERY CLEAN as WELL.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy that clean feeling from a good shave, I would strongly recommend that you give this a try.</li>
            <li>In all honesty I did take a pretty good chunk of skin off my face, but there is bound to be a learning curve.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t cut myself, but I could tell I could dice up my digits pretty good if I got in a hurry.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;d always thought my cartridge razor experience was pretty good.</li>
            <li>This is a good beginner razor, but at this price I would expect higher quality.</li>
            <li>Pretty good results.</li>
            <li>and I get just as good a shave with this as the higher end disposable cartridges (I know somebody will take issue with me not immediately saying that &amp;</li>
            <li>I wrote a review about a week after I got this, and I loved it, first de safety every had</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t buy the cheapest blades I can find, I&#x27;ve been using the feather blades which from all the reviews I could find had a pretty good rating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming that anyone who is interested in this type of product has already taken the time to pursue a good prep (i.e. soak,brush, lather, quality after-shave treatment etc.)</li>
            <li>While the Merkur may not be quite as pretty as the EJ, I find it to be functionally superior in a couple of ways.  </li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor, and seems like a good one for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used a Gillet Mach 3 and it was probably the best cartridge I have used and was smooth if I rubbed my face after shaving in one direction, but after shaving with this my face is literally \\&quot;baby bottom smooth\\&quot; in all directions, even my wife is surprised at how smooth my face is.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>and now I know why it is built well and sturdy with perfect weight if you like a long handle</li>
            <li>The first shave with a 34C, however, proved to me that I made a good move switching to a DE razor.  </li>
            <li>Well it was very easy to use and gave me the closest most comfortable shave ever-even closer and more comfortable than my Gillette Fusion Power.</li>
            <li>A fine German made razor that does a great job on my face!  </li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of weight for a great shave and is so easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my choice because this  razor is right there in the middle of the road for me on how it shaves, its amazing.</li>
            <li>new to \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaving, but this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I used a brand new blade but didnt have a great soap</li>
            <li>Unlike twist-to-open designs, razors like this Merkur have a top cap which allows for easy navigation around the nose.</li>
            <li>Great razor, shaves very close and comfortably.</li>
            <li>Good quality good weight and will last a life time</li>
            <li>and it was comfortable and just a generally more enjoyable experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought my 21 yr old son his own and were good to go.</li>
            <li>But honestly, for the money and for ease was great and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>Very well made, fit &amp; finish flawless, nice weight, very natural feel in the hand.</li>
            <li>The razor rinses clean very easily and you can just let the weight of the razor do the work.</li>
            <li>Excellent, close shave with a single blade.</li>
            <li>However, before treading into cut-throat territory I would strongly advise that you research, research, research and understand straight razor mechanics, angles, movements, maintenance and cost!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really more cosmetic than anything else as the razor works fine --</li>
            <li>Gillette Super Speed.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to clean, shines bright and holds the blade</li>
            <li>The Personnas are fine but the Feathers might be even better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Design:  I like that the design is simple and straightforward, and I appreciate its perfect balance.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely love to try any of their other products, because I&#x27;ve been so impressed with this.</li>
            <li>The Merkur 34C is the heftiest of all, it is the best manufactured of the 4, however also costs 5X more than the other 3 razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Edwin Jagger on the other hand feels elegant and flawless</li>
            <li>This razors works perfectly for removing it when I go back to a clean shaven look.  </li>
            <li>Very good product, I use it daily</li>
            <li>It is definitely not as close of a shave for me as the futur, but still very good.  </li>
            <li>Very good quality and solidly built razor.</li>
            <li>Take your time, get a good badger brush, some high quality shaving soap or shaving cream, and do something you may not have done in years -- enjoy shaving again!    </li>
            <li>This is a great razor and I enjoyed my first shave very much.  </li>
            <li>Try a DE, you will get a wonderful shave and possible develop nostalgia for those simpler times when men were proud to be men and life involved reminders of what is meant to be a man in daily life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Try a DE, you will get a wonderful shave and possible develop nostalgia for those simpler times when men were proud to be men and life involved reminders of what is meant to be a man in daily life.    </li>
            <li>They say to let the weight of the razor to do most of the work, so the weight is important.  </li>
            <li>Incredible double edged razor.  </li>
            <li>So far great on all counts.</li>
            <li>This razor combined with Merkur&#x27;s double edged platinum blades is an excellent shave that is far closer and superior to anything I have ever pulled off before.</li>
            <li>+ S&amp;H. For me, not only is this a financially awesome change up, but the quality is far superior as well.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that this razor has been raved as the best go to razor by wet shavers all across the board.</li>
            <li>While the Feather blades are sharper (more nicks) but the Merkur blade is fantastic and lasted me about 10 days without any issues.</li>
            <li>so I have nothing to compare it to, but so far its been great.</li>
            <li>I was becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the quality of shave</li>
            <li>I am still mastering the art of wet shaving, but this is an excellent tool for learning mastery!</li>
            <li>The razor itself is a lot shorter than the parker, but it seems to fit better in my hand.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my face since it is so smooth after using this.</li>
            <li>My first de safety razor, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I use Nivea sensitive shave gel and get a great shave.</li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth and healthy with no irritation.</li>
            <li>And enjoy a better, closer shave while you&#x27;re at it.</li>
            <li>As perfect a shave as I expected.</li>
            <li>Fit and finish is top notch.</li>
            <li>Just remember, the most important step of ALL is applying a pre-shave oil (I use Art of Shaving Sandalwood).  </li>
            <li>This razor has a very nice heavy feel to it and with a good blade is a very comfortable shaving instrument.</li>
            <li>But so far, it works great.  </li>
            <li>This feels sturdier and works great so far.</li>
            <li>That was a much better pairing and I got a smooth shave with no nicks.</li>
            <li>I have the Feather Light also which is much more money</li>
            <li>The razor that came with it gave me the closest most comfortable shave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I have a knock off because I do own a Merkur 38C safety razor and that shaves wonderfully.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most important part is #3.</li>
            <li>check it out and enjoy your morning BBS (Baby Butt Smooth) shave!</li>
            <li>This is coming from a person who use to use a Dovo Best Quality Straight Razor; straight razors give fantastic shaves *</li>
            <li>This is coming from a person who use to use a Dovo Best Quality Straight Razor; straight razors give fantastic shaves *</li>
            <li>Thanks good razor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try to move onto straight edge razors as this is as good as a shave as I could ask for.</li>
            <li>it feels really good in the hand, it has weight to it which make the shave very reassuring.</li>
            <li>It works well with either blade if I take my time, and those blades are very inexpensive, the derby&#x27;s are about a dime a piece when bought in bulk, and they are good for three or four shaves.</li>
            <li>The Derby blade provides a good shave and is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Mach 3 cartridge razor my whole life, and decided to get into DE shaving after reading a really good article, talking about the benefits.</li>
            <li>As you shave more and more, you&#x27;ll get better shaves as you&#x27;ll start to have a feel of the right angles.</li>
            <li>Just got it today and used it right away, Great shave, first time away from the multi blade type razors.</li>
            <li>While the Edwin Jagger DE89 falls more decidedly in the mild category, the Merkur 34C is more balanced in terms of aggressiveness.</li>
            <li>The razor has a real nice heft to it, and blade installment is easy (and you only have to do it once every 2-3 weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels very well-made, with a good weight to it in your hand and an easy glide.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a high quality razor that you can pass down to your son this is a good choice, if you just want a good cheap shave I would recommend the utopia or feather popular razors as they will provide an equally good shave for the non-conneseur.</li>
            <li>The shortness is kind of a plus, however, when getting the area right under your nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Merkur razor looks very nice and shiny but just like my 2 year old BMW -</li>
            <li>Honestly, the transition to Shaving The Right Way with this Merkur was easy.</li>
            <li>Besides being easy to use and giving a smooth enjoyable shave, it exudes the quality and refinement of a finely crafted tool.</li>
            <li>Other than that its a great buy!</li>
            <li>As this is my first DE razor, I love it!</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor and I gotta say, I enjoy shaving!!</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I LOVE SHAVING!</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the shaving experience!  </li>
            <li>Great looking, easy to clean, easy to install new razors.  </li>
            <li>The handle is easy to manipulate around my face.</li>
            <li>I use it as my daily shaver and couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning is incredibly easy</li>
            <li>Cleaning is incredibly easy   Razor won&#x27;t clog with hair like cartridges do    </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy, then, to recommend this.a value.  </li>
            <li>Easy, then, to recommend this.</li>
            <li>but it makes easy to maneuver in the groin area.</li>
            <li>Sharpening is just as easy as unscrew, pop off, insert, and tighten.</li>
            <li>Easy blade handling.</li>
            <li>And it is just as easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to replace blades.  </li>
            <li>Merkur also uses forged steel, so it shouldn&#x27;t snap as easily</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Quality build, easy maintenance &amp;  </li>
            <li>Easy to change the blade.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy control / manufacturability...</li>
            <li>Blades are easy to change, shave is close and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>......then my brother bought the Rick Harrison Micro Touch DE razor at wallmart and its 100000 times better, easier to clean, just twist and rinse.  </li>
            <li>The razor is well balanced and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>or if i have a bump on my face i can easily shave around it.</li>
            <li>So while I have close to no experience, this must be an easy to use razor.</li>
            <li>Easy to manuever around cleft and chin areas.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a beginner using double sided razor blades but this does a great job of convincing me to switch over.</li>
            <li>5 to 8 shaves per blade easily</li>
            <li>The heft of the razor makes shaving easier as it is easy to avoid applying pressure.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and maneuver.</li>
            <li>Have easily convinced my son this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>I was suprised at how easy it is to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and heavy-duty.</li>
            <li>Easy to change blades.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with thus razor and can see why it has such a great reputation.</li>
            <li>It is easy to change the blades.</li>
            <li>so its easy to hold while using.</li>
            <li>makes it easy for me.</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>Well built, easy to use, and just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The blade drops into the Merkur easily and tightens without issue.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning is incredibly easy</li>
            <li>the way, I chose this particular model because a lot of people have mentioned that it&#x27;s a good way to start with a &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; (or double-edge, DE) razor.  </li>
            <li>This is a great razor to start with if you want to see if this kind of shaving is for you, not very expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this product to any and every man.</li>
            <li>Overall the razor is nice and seems of good quality.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much to say about this razor that hasn&#x27;t already been said - it&#x27;s a great introduction to the world of double-edge shaving, and DE shaving in general is a vastly more pleasant (and cost effective) alternative to cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>Its highly recommended to use good shaving soap(Proraso</li>
            <li>I bought it because it was highly regarded as a good DE razor for beginners, and it did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>It is best to shave with a double edge right after stepping out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>This razor was so outstanding right Out Of The Box!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nicely built, lives up to its HEAVY DUTY title nicely, but will more than likely handle this like porcelain just because it is a maintenance tool, and any self respecting man maintains and makes sure their tools are in the best working condition to reduce the chance of failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure to go for the full effect with a brush and shaving</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s true what most of people say:</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor and I am loving this new-to-me but very-old-school style of shaving.</li>
            <li>Warm up the razor in hot water before using.</li>
            <li>Buy a styptic pencil and keep it handy at first.</li>
            <li>That is until this simple, beautiful razor landed at my door.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised,well built and nice weight</li>
            <li>but still provides a close shave for me in two passes (WTG/XTG) using an average at best blade.</li>
            <li>But first impression was nice.</li>
            <li>If you let it stay in warm to hot water it retains that temperature on the blade</li>
            <li>First shave was nice.</li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor, so take my review with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;It works nice mechanically.</li>
            <li>The blades that came with it are super clean and leave a nice smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>and once I glided this down my cheek,  it feel awesome.</li>
            <li>Easy to use; comfortable in the hand; easy to work around sideburns and neck.  </li>
            <li>Nice, good simple construction, solid weight, and great angle on the blade.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the razor seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>As a first time buyer of a safety razor, I looked at a lot of options, and weighed whether to get the longer handled model or not -- for me, the short handle works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>When it finally arrived I promptly fired up a scalding hot shower while visions of the perfect shave danced in my head.</li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>It took me about a minute or two to get the hang of the angle and the short handle, but came away with the best and closest shave on my first try.  </li>
            <li>Shaves fine.</li>
            <li>But, my technique for a safety razor is just fine.</li>
            <li>The shave I get with a safety razor is just fine.</li>
            <li>but I still manged just fine with this one.</li>
            <li>worked fine , no problems.</li>
            <li>This is a fine, quality piece of equipment.</li>
            <li>The strokes were easy and pain free, and the result was closer than Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heavy, looks beautiful, and fits nicely in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>and it gives a fine shave.  </li>
            <li>Some may prefer the longer handle version, but this works fine for yrs trly.</li>
            <li>Razor fine.</li>
            <li>and this works fine for me.</li>
            <li>This DE razor makes it easy to get a close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Not as fine shaving as it claims to have.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>That worked fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine a quality as one you&#x27;d find at the mall.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 2 piece, which is fine by me.</li>
            <li>My first one was a cheap one($10) from a beauty supply store to see if I even liked it.</li>
            <li>Seeing as it is the first DE razor I have used, have two more on order, once give those a try can give a better assessment of how it stacks up.</li>
            <li>Fine online and some skin conditioners.</li>
            <li>It is not a slight improvement but a remarkably improved shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>It is super safe</li>
            <li>If it had been too mild or too aggressive on both sides, it would be OK and you could deal with it.</li>
            <li>The Merkur 34c is the way to go, smooth shave, easy to use, easy to install the blade and the short handle works great.</li>
            <li>It gives me a perfect shave and actually makes me enjoy the task - a first since I began shaving decades ago.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a perfect shave and actually makes me enjoy the task - a first since I began shaving decades ago.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives a wonderful, close shave that I certainly prefer to any of my previous cartridge razors (I used shavemob before, which I liked).</li>
            <li>I recently purchased a brush, bowl and shaving soap kit, hopefully the combination of tools will make the shaving experience more pleasant.</li>
            <li>It is mild and forgiving, great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Blades are easy to change, the styling of the razor is attractive, and so far the feel for the quality is very high (weight, finish, precision of parts fitting together).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am relatively new to DE safety razor shaving, and happy to have found the right combination of razor, blade, soap, brush and after shave that works for me.</li>
            <li>Finding the correct angle was a little tricky, but once I got it, it worked awesome.</li>
            <li>I would prefer the handle to be a little longer,  but all together it is a wonderful tool.</li>
            <li>this little puppy is awesome!  </li>
            <li>I can certainly see why it is the favorite of so many.</li>
            <li>I have large hands but even though it is short it performs flawlessly.</li>
            <li>Thinking of getting a few more as gifts for my brother and my very good friends.</li>
            <li>I can tell you that some blades that got very good reviews did not turn out to be my favorites, at least not with this razor and my own conditions.</li>
            <li>The quality is excellent and it gives me a shave that is as good if not better than the high priced Mach 3&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I did really rush it tonight and got a little more irritation than I had been, but it seems to be a more forgiving learning curve than the straights, and a great way to get a better shave than disposables, at a better price point.</li>
            <li>The razor is very solidly built, feels great in your hands and performs a smooth shave without any nicks.</li>
            <li>I ended up with a huge cut on the side of my chin, and I still have the scar from it.</li>
            <li>He said it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Not that it was a huge problem before, but I would always get one or two when using the Fusion.  </li>
            <li>There is kind of an art to shaving with a double edge without getting cuts, but once you master it, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>That was a huge relief.  </li>
            <li>A huge plus.  </li>
            <li>I tried the razor with the feather blades and what a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>gives him a smooth shave, does not cause any razor burn, and is so easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Which is a huge departure from anything I ever had before.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Definitely watch those great Youtube shaving videos.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy it</li>
            <li>the blades it came with did the job, but i will experiment with others as soon as i need them, and replacement blades are CHEAP compared to cartridges.</li>
            <li>My primary shaving method before the switch as an electric razor, and while there may be a debate about which is \\&quot;greener\\</li>
            <li>important note though:</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li>Solid built with great balance.</li>
            <li>I will enjoy this for years to come.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and works great.</li>
            <li>It delivers a smooth, comfortable, irritation-free shave.</li>
            <li>The shave is smooth as any cartridge razor and I no longer have issues with rash.</li>
            <li>It did NOT come with the 5 free advertised blades, but who cares?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this Merkur for a few years now, and just wanted to say it&#x27;s excellent!</li>
            <li>lightly-</li>
            <li>but it works great with a regular gel.</li>
            <li>But the quality of the shave was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This razor, using one double-edged blade, has greatly reduced my ingrown hairs, which I understand can happen more frequently with modern cartridge or disposable razors.  </li>
            <li>The closeness of the shave is amazing, my irritation is virtually nil, it is cheaper than cartridges, and it makes you feel like a real man.</li>
            <li>I still have a damn smooth face and neck.</li>
            <li>so I could get a comfortable shave when I was in a rush.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect everyday razor.  </li>
            <li>This razor is a great upgrade to the no name brand safety razor sold by the giant retailers.  </li>

            <li>The smooth edge can, and will cause the razor jump or skid, resulting in a knick.  </li>
            <li>One thing that I&#x27;ve learned is that the lotion is critically important.  </li>
            <li>the blade do the work.&lt;br /&gt;Secret is use a medium pressure or light</li>
            <li>use light pressure.  </li>

            <li>I used the feather type blades and will admit that I have had the best few shaves with this item that I have ever had.</li>
            <li>I shave my head as well and there is no place I can&#x27;t get to for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Razor too course for light beards.  </li>

            <li>I enjoy the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of the razor in my hand.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been happily using an Edwin Jagger DE razor for several months now.  </li>
            <li>The blades are dirt cheap.</li>
            <li>Besides it would never have given me a close smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Easy to load blade and clean.</li>

            <li>It is easy to clean and to use.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need the adjustability this thing works fantastic.</li>
            <li>My face has never been so baby smooth.  </li>
            <li>The razor is easy to handle and clean.</li>
            <li>This was primarily done to offset the cost of replacement disposable blades.  </li>
            <li>The result has been fantastic.  </li>
            <li>CAN say that as a beginner, I felt comfortable using this from the get-go.  </li>
            <li>And they may not be as close and smooth as you&#x27;re used to.  </li>
            <li>I primarily use electric</li>
            <li>You get a nice looking razor that performs very well.</li>
            <li>If I were going to own just one quality razor, it would be the Merkur 34C which will provide a lifetime of use with reasonable care.</li>
            <li>Fantastic intro razor.</li>
            <li>The short handle also allows for great control and maneuverability.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>Side note on 5 blade offer: I contacted the seller because I didn&#x27;t receive 5 free blades.</li>
            <li>The free blades were so-so.. prefer feather or shark blades.  </li>
            <li>Very well weighted, nice to use.</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy shaving again.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect the packaging to be so cheap looking, though we don&#x27;t shave with the packaging.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise the same Paraso will work great.</li>
            <li>If you’re looking for economy, value, a green product, and an awesome shave</li>
            <li>This handle is short, but my husband says he thinks it&#x27;s great that way.</li>
            <li>The Merkur cut the whiskers like butter using a light touch and letting the weight of the razor do the work.  </li>

            <li>Keeps my face and nether regions and smooth as a veal cutlet</li>
            <li>recommend this razor for beginners or advanced users as I don&#x27;t see how you can get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>, if you are looking for a light handle this is not for you.</li>
            <li>This is just a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy not only are they cheeper</li>
            <li>I am razor bump free.</li>
            <li>Easy to load/unload and clean.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and change blades.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic razor.</li>
            <li>Too light.</li>
            <li>or how lightly it touched my face (never hade problems with it on my head though).</li>
            <li>Smooth shave.</li>

            <li>I enjoy shaving every morning now and receive a close, quality shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic service.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the type of shaving again that I once started with.  </li>
            <li>this mighty staff of</li>
            <li>I enjoy walking pas</li>
            <li>: I read somewhere that it&#x27;s easier to perform advanced techniques like buffing and j-hooks with a shorter handle.</li>
            <li>and I am still amazed at how smooth my face is and for how long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At this point, my shaves are just about smooth as glass with no nicks or irritation.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a free razor, but throw that away (or recycle it rather) and buy yourself a supply of Feather razors to get a close shave that doesn&#x27;t cut your face.</li>
            <li>Great for a coarse beard.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Blades are cheap</li>

            <li>Pair it up with a nice badger hair brush and some Taylor of Old Shaving cream and you will be shaving like your grand dad.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift for Christmas and I am absolutely blown away by how much more enjoyable shaving has become.</li>
            <li>Good razor, heavy and good quality.</li>
            <li>I rarely skip a day shaving now because I enjoy it much more.</li>
            <li>My face feels much better and shaving is actually enjoyable to me thanks to this razor.</li>
            <li>This razor was listed in many forums as a good overall razor, so I decided to order it and tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I also recently invested in a Boker straight razor and find the Merkur to compliment it perfectly for when I need to save time in the morning.</li>
            <li>I was trying to find a way to be able to carry more \\&quot;shaving-days\\&quot; in my camp pack, without all of the bulky blades offered by the modern razors.  </li>
            <li>The blade was easy to install, cleaning is super easy.  </li>
            <li>It kind of forces you to use your fingers to lightly hold the handle so that the non floating head can gently follow the contours of your face.</li>
            <li>so far so good.  </li>
            <li>The Merkue #34C is far superior.  </li>
            <li>But if you like old school razors, this is a good one, which is why I gave it three stars</li>
            <li>The stainless steel cleans very easily and the weight of the handle makes it easy to control.</li>
            <li>Great balance, no trouble finding the right angle.  </li>
            <li>The handle is small but it fits perfectly in both of our hands and is easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>Would I be able to find the right angle?</li>
            <li>Finding the right blade has taken more time than learning how to use this razor.</li>
            <li>A short handle gives very nice control.  </li>
            <li>No longer will I pay more for ridiculously overpriced cartridges that give me incredible razor burn!    </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and you enjoy a clean, comfortable shave, do yourself a favor and give this a try.</li>
            <li>The blade you choose is also important, but it is unique to each user.  </li>
            <li>This is a great razor that will keep you happy past the intermediate level of razors, if not your whole life.</li>
            <li>For those entering the double-edge razor arena, the Merkur is a solid piece of equipment and is good for a beginning and advanced shaver (according to those who are advanced double-edge shavers on the forums), and not nearly as brutal as I thought.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s nice not to have to brave the accusing eyes of a store clerk so they&#x27;ll open a locked cabinet just to get me a new razor head not made of gold but made to fit my off-the-shelf twin blade POS.  </li>
            <li>the right weight, glides easily over the face and cleans up easy.</li>
            <li>This product does what its supposed to - give a clean, smooth, old-fashioned shave every time.  </li>
            <li>I like the smooth clean shave this provides.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Merkur and Feather blades and can attest that they both fit and provide a clean, close</li>
            <li>It glides effortlessly through stubble and beard, leaving a smooth, clean path in its wake.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and is super durable.</li>
            <li>It has a nice natural weight that helps to make shaving easy and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The angle on the blade isn&#x27;t super aggressive, and it can be easily used for body shaving as well as face shaving.</li>
            <li>I require an exceptional razor with quality razor blades to achieve the professional look.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say exactly why, but the Merkur cuts more smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Proper technique with a good lather and safety razor has given me consistently smooth, clean shaves (my wife approves greatly of them) without the constant irritation and shaving bumps.</li>
            <li>I have always had a liking for things a bit more old school because, well, many older tools seem to provide with better results, albeit with more associated risk or effort involved.</li>
            <li>this razor still is super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Great construction, upper mild shave.</li>
            <li>Just finished my first DE Safety Razor shave with the 34C, very gentle on the skin, didn&#x27;t get any cuts but was left with an awesome shave after two passes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a solid simple razor, nicely weighted, grips beautifully, and almost as easy as using a disposable.</li>
            <li>Not only is it more cost affective, but I get a much better shave, and feel much better afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The 34C is small in stature (3 and 1/4 inches long and weighs 80.5 grams) but don&#x27;t let that deter you, this razor is well balanced and perfect for beginners like me or experienced shavers.</li>
            <li>Have fun!</li>
            <li>and you will be golden for like 2 years!     </li>
            <li>My first DE razor, so I cannot compare it to others, however I really do love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit it does take a bit of a learning curve to use this razor, but despite the first week of nicks, I love it.  </li>
            <li>Shaving with a traditional safety razor requires more time and practice than the latest Gillette cartridge gimmick design, but you get more control over the process.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reasons for switching:&lt;br /&gt;1) Environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li>Economically friendly.</li>
            <li>This razor and Merkur blades has made shaving enjoyable for the first time in my life</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m tremendously satisfied with my first DE shave.</li>
            <li>This razor is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It make take longer to shave,but the results are better and the refills much much cheaper!</li>
            <li>the provided Merkur blade my first shave was better than that of the disposable razors (with just a hint of burn).</li>
            <li>There is a bit of a learning curve (carved up my face pretty good the first time) but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>As for skin irritation, I find that I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference between both types.  </li>
            <li>razor is fairly short which is good because it forces you to focus on the angles and gives you done play as far as good aggressive a agave you want.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most enjoyable and comfortable way of shaving I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>The return/exchange process was straightforward and without hassle.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this in the mail.</li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed how the head retains heat when run through hot water while I rinse it off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still experimenting with different DE blades but so far every brand has fit perfectly in my Merkur razor.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth twice the price!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not aggressive and budget friendly.</li>
            <li>For the new wet shavers, practice makes perfect, make sure you have a good lather applied prior to shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s weight and balance make it ideal for gliding down my face with no pressure needed from me.</li>
            <li>So, overall, fairly happy with my first shaving experience with safety razors!</li>
            <li>After drying off, I splash on some aftershave (little more stinging) and by the time the aftershave dries, all irritation is gone, I smell great, my face is incredibly smooth and I am good until the following morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have a few other brands that are great, but the balance of the Merkur is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Like everyone mentions the Feather blade is amazing, but if you are new to this type of shaving I would not start off with that one.  </li>
            <li>I own one and bought this as a gift for someone new to shaving.</li>
            <li>I am new to this kind of shaving and the recommendations regarding this product are spot on.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to use the same type of blade for both razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love my DE razor a thousand times more than my old razor.</li>
            <li>much more clean shaven meant having to having to suffer through it even more frequently, which was something I was not looking forward to.    </li>
            <li>Going back to the old fashioned safety razor has been the best decision I have made.</li>
            <li>This razor can give you a squeaky clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Moist, squeaky clean skin can become tacky.  </li>
            <li>The combed edge will not adhere to squeaky clean skin.  </li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t need to have a clean shaven face for work, I&#x27;ve been shaving about 4-5 times per month, and changing the blade at the end of each month.</li>
            <li>I shave in the shower and its a snap to rinse and clean.</li>
            <li>No balancing of the blades or mis-alignment as the blade will sit securely on the top part and you can just drop the whole handle on it with the centre guide.</li>
            <li>Clean shave with no razor burn.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves the clean lines the razor provides</li>
            <li>Upon first use I found the razor to be easy load, and the handle length fine.</li>
            <li>You just feel the blade slicing cleanly and effortlessly through the stubble.</li>
            <li>It is definitely shorterf than most disposables but its actually nice to use.</li>
            <li>Overall great product and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Close, smooth, quick (i didnt have to keep going over and over and area to get the shave i was wanting)</li>
            <li>Both are terrific products on their own, but together, they are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I decided to exchange this for the long-handle version, which I am much happier and more comfortable with.</li>
            <li>Also a lot friendlier when attempting to cut a clean sideburn line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>to clean and change blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Out of the safety razors that I own, the Merkur HD 34c is one of my favorites that I keep going back to as I&#x27;ve yet to find anything that gives a better shave at any cost.</li>
            <li>I use this occasionally when I want a closer shave than electric and honestly it doesn&#x27;t take much more time.</li>
            <li>After spending some $$$ on that all you need are the razors which are super cheap here on amazon.</li>
            <li>As many have already stated, this is a great everyday,</li>
            <li>Such a smooth shave when you use a good cream and brush.</li>
            <li>I disassemble mine after each use and clean it off to prevent build up.</li>
            <li>My experience with saftey razors is limited, but it is a great razor.  </li>
            <li>After the shave, cleaning the razor is simple as most of the time a good run-through of hot water will suffice.  </li>
            <li>After the shave, cleaning the razor is simple as most of the time a good run-through of hot water will suffice.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this razor and it not only feels right while getting a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;The two-piece design makes blade changes a snap, and the razor holds the blades evenly and securely, giving you a consistent easily repeatable shave every time.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t say this lightly but do yourself a favorite a try &amp;#34;any&amp;#34; double edge razor and see for yourself that it provides the closest and most comfortable shave that you had had.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does sideburns with ease and the hair right under your nose is easy to get as well.</li>
            <li>This is a special razor.  </li>
            <li>Certainly the fastest I&#x27;m able to shave with this</li>
            <li>The razor is more aggressive than the one that I had been using and the blade that came with it certainly made me feel it so into the blade bank</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to pay Gillette $$$ for their proprietary cartridges, many people can get a quick, good enough shaves from them.</li>
            <li>However, the Merkur 34c shaves better than the EJ and is perhaps a little more aggressive which is a good thing, albeit, still a mild smooth consistent shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to put a new blade in, and to clean after shaving.</li>
            <li>I have short, broad fingers, so the size and weight are perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Like its predecessor this one gives an excellent shave and it does seem sturdier justifying the higher price for the Heavy Duty model.</li>
            <li>And the plating is smooth, even and consistent, lending to a comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor and I must say I am happy with it overall.     </li>
            <li>Great razor for beginners not very aggressive, but will give you a gret shave.</li>
            <li>Great DE razor to introduce oneself to wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>It works great as expected.</li>
            <li>Most of us today shave without a thought to how much of shaving is tradition as well as necessity.</li>
            <li>Most of us today shave without a thought to how much of shaving is tradition as well as necessity.</li>
            <li>Though perhaps not as cool as using an adjustable razor, or one with a butterfly opening to load blades, this razor does everything you could ask.    </li>
            <li>It may not be as cool to load as a &#x27;butterfly&#x27; DE razor, and it is not adjustable as some DE razors are.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Price:  For something that may well shave multiple generations of faces, I&#x27;d say this is a fair ripper of a value.  </li>
            <li>I also find that I will nick myself more if I&#x27;m going too fast.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s probably because there really isn&#x27;t that much you can say about something as simple and perfect as this.  </li>
            <li>Find yourself good blades and never look back</li>
            <li>Heavy weight in the handle has a real nice feel to it.  </li>
            <li>Although it is not adjustable this &#x27;feature&#x27; actually promotes good technique.</li>
            <li>it is soooo true.     </li>
            <li>Thanks for reading :)</li>
            <li>If you are looking at buying this model you have probably read or watched a handful of reviews about how grand this safety razor is and I agree, albeit I have nothing but modern razors for comparison.</li>
            <li>but it is definitely not ugly.</li>
            <li>Any razor can only be as good as the lotion.  </li>
            <li>Good weight, and simple design.</li>
            <li>good overall Blade.</li>
            <li>The knurling on the handle is good for keeping a solid grip on the razor.</li>
            <li>One of the true classics.</li>
            <li>Finally, treat yourself to a good shaving brush and soap.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know finite just me, but a read all the reviews and really wanted to believe in a better shave, but it didn&#x27;t happen with me.</li>
            <li>This means when you are taking it apart you don&#x27;t need to have your fingers anywhere near the blade which is a nice safety feature.  </li>
            <li>Obviously, much cheaper than five blade devices and works better.  </li>
            <li>This was a highly-rated DE razor, so I decided to try it because there seem to be many people who claim that DE razors are superior to the more common safety razors (e.g., Sensor Excel, Mach 3, etc.).</li>
            <li>I could make my life easier and save money by ising this razor and a good double edge razor blade.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>Paying so much for the cartridges I knew there had to be a better alternative.  </li>
            <li>Gave me razor bumps and many cuts even when shaving much slower than with disposable razor.</li>
            <li>Great razor, year old no problems, German made , need I say more?</li>
            <li>I really thought that a Merkur would be better constucted.  </li>
            <li>This Shaver with Japanese blades have made shaving a good experience.</li>
            <li>Not as cool,</li>
            <li>That is certainly true of DE razors, but your grooming ritual won&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re playing with a toy, either.</li>
            <li>did a very conservative cleanup pass after that and wound up with a categorically smoother shave on most of my face than I&#x27;ve ever had with a cartridge razor.</li>
            <li>It has a good short grip to it.</li>
            <li>The razors that are included are good and last about 3-4 shaves (I have medium stubble).</li>
            <li>Basically it does everything I hoped it would do, and it looks good enough to keep on my kitchen sink!</li>
            <li>needed something that would be faster and hopefully provide as good as a shave as the disposable, I turned to the double edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Get a brush and shaving soap for the full experience.</li>
            <li>Please buy some good Japanese razor blades.</li>
            <li>the grain&amp;#34; to get a really good shave just as I did with the injector razor and by doing that I get about the same results as I did before.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like being wasteful, and this is much cheaper, &amp;#34;greener&amp;#34;, and just a better shave than what I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that i cant make it through a full shave without my hand cramping.</li>
            <li>I was surprised as I watched some videos and was told to expect it to take months to learn this kind of shaving.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter and built of a better quality</li>
            <li>This was the best idea I have had lately and</li>
            <li>I love this razor, I really do.</li>
            <li>Overall good product but wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li>If you like a good shave and can spend an extra minute shaving, I recommend trying it.  </li>
            <li>When it came, it was actually a tad shorter than I imagined it would be, but this turned out to be a good thing.</li>
            <li>It really gives you a better and closer shave than disposables.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor from the art of shaving, i use a straight razor and love it.</li>
            <li>I really like this better then</li>
            <li>Solid feel and good weight.  </li>
            <li>Bought one last week and after the 1st shave, i can say its really good.</li>
            <li>I recommend you do some research online and make the leap to the tried and true method of shaving.</li>
            <li>I wish that I could say the same for the blade, but I hear that what&#x27;s good for one may not be good for another because our hair and skin combinations can dramatically affect the result that we get with the different blades out there.</li>
            <li>Good simple gear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but I really like the 43C Merkur.</li>
            <li>Astra is my favorite blade with this razor, very close shave, no pulling or tugging, and no irritation.  </li>
            <li>The price on this is still very affordable but does worlds better than the one I had before.</li>
            <li>Good DE Razor for basic shaving.  </li>
            <li>Anything is better than paying that much..</li>
            <li>I am able to shave very close to the nasal area; something my cumbersome multi-edge couldn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>and I get a super clean shave.</li>
            <li>It has good sturdy weight to it and therefore has a very solid feel in the hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they just don&#x27;t do a good job for me, and they don&#x27;t seem to have improved since last time</li>
            <li>The Merkur feels solid and has a good weight.  </li>
            <li>Whereas today&#x27;s modern disposable razors are nimble like a sports car, this is more like a truck but the comfort and smoothness cannot be beat.  </li>
            <li>As a brand new DE user, this was very easy to learn on.</li>
            <li>I liked the Jagger, but thought I would try a different model and selected this one (Merkur) based largely on the positive ratings, and have been pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have normal hands (I think) and the handle is more than adequate and quite comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Being new to wet shaving, I did a lot of research to determine what would be the best starter razor, and everywhere I looked</li>
            <li>Cartridge razors are costly and clog easily and never seem able to clear all the hair off my face without a lot of pressure and struggling.</li>
            <li>Well balanced, good weight, easy to use, and works as expected.</li>
            <li>Myriad elements like skin sensitivity and beard pattern combine to make your face unique, so, while one user may have a fantastic first shave with a safety razor, another may need to reach for a styptic pencil.</li>
            <li>as long as you take your time, listen to some good music as you shave, it makes the moment of shaving unique.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor and I am so glad that I made the change to wet shaving and getting very far away from the cartridge gimmick!</li>
            <li>The variety of high end shaving creams is great and a big part of what I enjoy as well</li>
            <li>It has really aggressive knurling, it&#x27;s easy to hold, nicely weighted, holds any standard safety razor blade, and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to set up, short heavy handle feels great and makes it easy to control, blades come off easily.</li>
            <li>Use the other to shave your pits and legs; your man will be happy.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a great razor.</li>
            <li>Great weight and extremely close shave.</li>
            <li>This gives an excellent shave (with a little practice) and the blades are so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>When you first use it, you&#x27;ll get a great shave but not as close as you would with a straight razor; I honestly thought that my product was defective as I got closer shaves by slightly loosening the head</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying a nice, weighty one like this, as the heft really allows you to stop raking the blade across your skin and let the razor&#x27;s weight do the job for you, resulting in a very smooth and gentle</li>
            <li>This is a great starter item that will last you forever if you take care of it (which is really easy, just make sure its dry at the end of each use).</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first DE razor and it suits my needs fine.</li>
            <li>The alum bar is far superior to alcohol-based aftershaves, so you should really consider upgrading to an alum bar.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and shaves well.  </li>
            <li>quick changeover - it takes about 15 seconds to change blades  </li>
            <li>I can tell you that the short feels better in my hand as I have more control</li>
            <li>Luckily a co-worker happened to inquire about what shaving method I used.</li>
            <li>Gives a mild but close shave.</li>
            <li>Edwin Jagger 1ej947sds Traditional English Best Badger Hair Shaving Brush Faux Ivory Medium</li>
            <li>I can say with confidence that this razor is perfect for me, but shaving is such an individual thing:  </li>
            <li>I can say with confidence that this razor is perfect for me, but shaving is such an individual thing:  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something about lathering up a nice bowl of soap and brushing it on the face, following by the smooth strokes that the Merkur provides.  </li>
            <li>So I made a second pass, more hairs removed but many still remained.</li>
            <li>Why did we leave shaving with these, when they are a far superior shave to modern razors?</li>
            <li>Cleans up quickly.</li>
            <li>Just a super razor, gets the job done with style and ease.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy weight (balanced, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap) and fits great in my hand.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had the foresight to buy a 10 pack of Merkur blades along with it.</li>
            <li>The experience of prepping, shaving, and post-shave rituals creates satisfaction that is absent from today&#x27;s more contemporary methods.</li>
            <li>did a quick look on Amazon and found a 15 pack of just Mach3 blades for $34 and a handle with handle with 2 blades for $18.  </li>
            <li>The wet shaving method is clearly more effective.</li>
            <li>With practice it takes only five to ten minutes to get an excellent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It easier, smoother, and more enjoyable than I anticipated, and I look forward to my next shave.</li>
            <li>Now I get a quick close shave, no nicks, no pulling, no burning.</li>
            <li>The texture on the shaft is unobtrusive and effective, keeping my grip sure even when my hands are wet and/or soapy.  </li>
            <li>you want a great shave, this is the razor for; and don&#x27;t forget to buy the Feather stainless double edge blades for a Razor and blade combination that can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>the cost savings is tremendous.</li>
            <li>I have used many razors since, most recently electric razors.  </li>
            <li>One of the reasons I chose this razor was that it was not flimsy and that it had only two separating parts:the top blade holder section and the bottom holder section with attached handle that screws into the top</li>
            <li>So shaving choices which include which shaving soap or cream, soap brush or can cream, and  personal choice of a DE blade brand that works best are items each user needs to decide on for themselves based on their personal conditions.</li>
            <li>which no need to press while shave and let you feel that you are handling something worthy.</li>
            <li>Tremendous shave quality, I like the Merkur blade that came installed in the handle as well as the Feather blades everyone has suggested.</li>
            <li>and I also very much better understand the comments about better control with the short handle.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the short handle fool you, it works exceptionally.</li>
            <li>Shaves very similarly, and I LOVE that the top piece screws in via the knob on the bottom to make this a 2pc razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are more expensive razors out there, but this one is awesome.</li>
            <li>This is a nice tool to hold in your hand - nice and heavy, well made, etc.  </li>
            <li>Gives him a super close shave without all irritation.</li>
            <li>It feels like a higher quality razor though I am sure the quality of the other Merkur products is just as good.</li>
            <li>This system of shaving is much more high quality than anything that the disposable companies could ever produce and is just a quick.</li>
            <li>But now I enjoy shaving very much.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend theis razor to any one I love the quality and craftsmanship of this razor</li>
            <li>Love the razor highly recommend</li>
            <li>sure enough,  all the good reviews about it are true as far as I can tell you.</li>
            <li>I think my time with the straights, and my respect (fear) of the blade lent to such a good shave right out of the box.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant and refreshing experience.in the past month if that gives you an idea.</li>
            <li>It is short, but holds its own it weight, making it perfect for a new wet shaver trying to learn the skill.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously, there is more potential for nicks with these, but I was surprised how easy and effective</li>
            <li>This razor is weighted so nicely, which is why I picked it over the many other options out there.</li>
            <li>very first shave was closer than any I&#x27;ve ever had before</li>
            <li>My attitude on shaving is that you need to shave both with and against the grain in a hot, steamy environment, because the goal is a shave so close that you have completely smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I just went with Persona since they were pretty cheap</li>
            <li>Very pleased overall.</li>
            <li>, if the $40 is not a concern, then it is a fantastic first safety razor.</li>
            <li>I find a safety shaves better that way than with canned cream – plus you get the full old time experience!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied both with my decision to change to using a double edge razor and the quality of this</li>
            <li>This is based on my very first shave with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor, and so far I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>The 39 is sweet looking and fun to use</li>
            <li>Although the old GEM model was a good introduction, the quality of the Merkur was is of a solid quality that marks my commitment to every purchasing over priced multiblade refills and polluting the planet more than needed.</li>
            <li>This razor clears cut hair easily as there is an unimpeeded chamber beneath the blade which is large and diverts everything</li>
            <li>The old one I could hold perfectly when shaving, even with very wet soapy hands and it would never slip</li>
            <li>This is a great classic safety razor that is built to last.</li>
            <li>i wish i amazon would allow me to choose the length of my own reviews, sometimes there isn&#x27;t much to say, particularly if there are lots of reviews already</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and very forgiving</li>
            <li>The product is \\&quot;cool\\&quot;, it is better on the budget and the environment over a long run, but the shaving experience is not as good as with a new 3-blade Gillette.</li>
            <li>Much classier and closer-cutting than a modern cartridge razor, and very easy to adapt to.  </li>
            <li>Awsome razor very well built heavy duty works great with feather blades easy to replace blades and clean</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the great thing about this razor: When you you run it over your face (without much pressure applied due to the comfortable weight of the razor)</li>
            <li>the shave is not as aggressive as other models available making it perfect for someone starting out.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite razor</li>
            <li>I was like the many folks out there dulling up mach 3s and then dreading having to pay for new cartridges.  </li>
            <li>Shaving becomes a new thing for you - much better.</li>
            <li>I can use a new blade every time I shave and still save a ton of money and get a better shave.</li>
            <li>sure it&#x27;s because of my new shaving method).</li>
            <li>The fit is good however the finish is average.  </li>
            <li>This is a great starter razor for someone interested in wet shaving.</li>
            <li>Sample packs with a variety of different brands are available on Amazon to help you decide which razor blade is suitable for your skin and beard.</li>
            <li>Great razor for first time wet shavers.</li>
            <li>razor is very well made, and easy to load.</li>
            <li>However, when you consider that it&#x27;s all metal, the blades are easily changeable, easily recyclable, much cheaper, you&#x27;ll be getting a straight razor close shave without the headache of stropping, servicing, oiling, and honing.</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>Open-blade razors are best used for shaving long facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t get better results and it seems as though the first pass going with the grain really doesn&#x27;t do anything for</li>
            <li>The day after the first shave left me with no nicks, a good feeling and the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t tried many DE razors, and this one was my first one.</li>
            <li>It is a very well built razor it doesn&#x27;t break easy.</li>
            <li>Overall very well constructed, and gives a nice close shave!</li>
            <li>The design of the head doesn&#x27;t really allow for hair to get stuck inside the razor, but can be easily cleaned once taken apart.</li>
            <li>It is very responsive and easy to control.</li>
            <li>This makes it easy to gently snug up the head without having to handle it.</li>
            <li>My favorite razor so far!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li>but this is a high quality product!!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on the first blade!</li>
            <li>The results are pretty close to it though!</li>
            <li>Choosing the right blade for yourself is pretty important.</li>
            <li>Like many men, I get ingrown hairs on my face when shaving with the typical 2-10 blade trendy razors you see on commercials.  </li>
            <li>fixing of blades is vey easy as it is only two peaces but for sure not like the butterfly ones.</li>
            <li>There is nothing better than getting a close shave with a single blade instead of getting hair stuck in the triple blade and more razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used mine daily for over a year now and the fit and finish remain good as new.  </li>
            <li>Often this 34hd and the EJ89 are compared to each other as a great first razor.</li>
            <li>* Public service announcement: Your preshave preparation is very important to a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>It looks great on its stand in my little man corner on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>Great quality but just a little too aggressive for my skin.</li>
            <li>This cream got some great reviews along the lines of &amp;#34;I&#x27;m astonished that a cheap cream from a big global brand is my new favorite cream&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>High quality metal, easy to open, easy to replace the blade, easy to clean, etc.</li>
            <li>Good weight, looks slick, and the blades are super easy to change out.</li>
            <li>Very good weight will never go back to a standard razor.</li>
            <li>The razor looks good, has a good finish, but for a big guy, it would be nice if the handle were a little longer and larger diameter.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing razor and my purchase of it completes a journey back to using a DE razor.</li>
            <li>great razor it will take a few times to get use to it</li>
            <li>This thing is great quality and is heavy so a lot of pressure is not needed when shaving.</li>
            <li>Biggest problem with this razor is the fact that it only leaves a .5-1mm blade showing, so if you intend to get an amazingly close shave, you will not get that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaves very close and smooth for me with a feather blade.  </li>
            <li>The razor is heavy and feels great in your hand.</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the old-school feel and knowing I&#x27;m not throwing as much trash into the landfills.</li>
            <li>Never would have guessed that I would enjoy the experience of shaving with a safety razor as much as I have.</li>
            <li>I got it from Simply Beautiful/Amazon at the amazing price of $26.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect Merkur to produce cheap products because this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Recently made the switch to wet shaving and chose the Merkur 34#C because many of the reviews described it as a great place to start for newbies.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I will never go back to those razors again.</li>
            <li>Worth the price, even if it holds together a couple of years.</li>
            <li>while the listing only promises 5 free DE razor blades, many people in the reviews seem to have gotten feather blades with their product.</li>
            <li>buy this product, but just assume the free blades are a total loss and buy one of the more well regarded blade brands.</li>
            <li>The handle is fairly short, but the weight is nice.  </li>
            <li>Nice heavy duty , easy to use &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>Great and fast service even though it was free shipping was here in a few days</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that I have to shave more frequently, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like the shaver is tearing off a layer of skin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a success in both areas.  </li>
            <li>Going with an OLD SCHOOL razor is my latest step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying how the razor gives such a smooth shave, however, I haven&#x27;t settled on a razor brand yet</li>
            <li>Anyone who is thinking of making the switch, it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m only doing it for novelty sake to be frankly honest.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m only doing it for novelty sake to be frankly honest.</li>
            <li>The shave is better and the blades last longer and are dirt cheap to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have both this and the Edwin Jagger DE89, which I rarely use anymore.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>And worth paying the money for.</li>
            <li>Def your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>The perforated handle provides good grip even when your hands are wet and soapy from the shaving</li>
            <li>I own this and multiple razors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad bit slower going as I&#x27;m being more careful than I would be with a cartridge razor, but the results are much better</li>
            <li>Did research and this always popped up near the top.</li>
            <li>Now I use Sharks and rarely get cut at all.</li>
            <li>This is a well made razor that is simple to use and has a nice finish.</li>
            <li>Slightly more aggressive than most starting razors, but still gentle.  </li>
            <li>but nothing worth throwing this out for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never use s double edged razor before but after research and reviews, I found this to be a great razor to buy and use so far.</li>
            <li>Or safer (not cutting yourself during shaving)?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed DE shaving so far.</li>
            <li>If you can beat that with a multi blade system and have a fresh blade every week.  </li>
            <li>For the full year it will cost you $120ish the first year and then about $100 a year every year after that if you throw the blade away every week.  </li>
            <li>This razor is much better than those I used in the early sixties.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price paid.</li>
            <li>This is a good safety razor, but it is not stainless steel.</li>
            <li>the angle is not very aggressive so good for beginners.</li>
            <li>well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I rarely cut myself on those.  </li>
            <li>Worth the $43</li>
            <li>and I feel a bit more confident with it [also because of the grippy rough diamond texture on the handle].</li>
            <li>totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Something about it is just fun, and the shave feels a million times</li>
            <li>The handle is a bit of an expense but the blades are economical.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need some practice but it&#x27;ll be worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>I have used it now for several weeks and it does a nice job.</li>
            <li>and for me it is The last razor i will ever own.</li>
            <li>My skin is quite sensitive, so I should&#x27;ve known better.</li>
            <li>Love the old school razor.  </li>
            <li>end trying to think of something nice for me for the big day at the family gathering on Christmas Eve.</li>
            <li>Well worth the $$.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Norelco 5601X for most of my adult life.  </li>
            <li>Really good entry level safety razor for the curious.</li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>In this case it is, well worth it.</li>
            <li>If you pick up a bit of scuff, rinse, switch sides, fresh blade.</li>
            <li>The quality makes it worth the price.</li>
            <li>I started out with the Feather Popular, but always felt like it wasnt aggressive enough as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li>The razor is a true gem -- when loaded with a feather blade, it cuts my &#x27;Homer Simpson&#x27; beard like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li>and I rarely cut my face with them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy and the crosshatch pattern on the handle provides good grip, even when wet with water and</li>
            <li>DE shaving is much better than cartridge shaving by far.</li>
            <li>My styptic pencil is used rarely.  </li>
            <li>I rarely cut my face.</li>
            <li>Nice double edge razor.  </li>
            <li>Nice heaft to the razor, solid build.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Nice quality, yet simple.  </li>
            <li>Far better than any cartridge razor I ever used.</li>
            <li>It has a short handle and is nicely weighted so you do not have to press against your skin to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>Good product as expected.</li>
            <li>The best DE shaver you can for the money from beginner to advanced users you can never go wrong with this Merkur its a must have.</li>
            <li>A lot of useful info, insight and recommendations that has helped a lot.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this razor and would recommend it to anyone who does not need a long handle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth your money and your face to try these out.</li>
            <li>A wet shave is definitely the best shave you can get.</li>
            <li>This Merkur is nicely weighted, reminding you to simply glide the razor along your skin.</li>
            <li>but well worth the work.</li>
            <li>Some of the old timers like Old Spice, Aqua Velva blue ice and Clubman are still great aftershaves and I love them.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this razor after reading multiple reviews that this was a good all-around double-edge razor.  </li>
            <li>well worth the money</li>
            <li>I find that the shorter handle is a nice advantage, providing enough balance and weight while also allowing me to shave around my neck without being cumbersome.  </li>
            <li>I used it last night for the first time and could not believe how smooth and easy this thing shaves!</li>
            <li>One side of the blade (the included blade) stuck out slightly more than the other, which made that side shave more aggressively than the other side, which shaved too mild to get a good cut.    </li>
            <li>In general, these will give a close shave, at an incredible price (pennies for a blade replacement if you buy the \\&quot;Sharp\\&quot; brand - my favorite), and precision typically found in the straight razor.    </li>
            <li>in all, I love this razor and strongly recommend it either as a first safety razor or for users who want something a bit different to try.</li>
            <li>The razor itself here is nice and weighty, and the short handle just seems to be the right length.</li>
            <li>The is very nice - I just miss the butterfly open action instead of removing head to change blade</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice to go back to old school shaving.</li>
            <li>Due to Amazon&#x27;s commendable return policy, one can try several razors and return those which don&#x27;t perform the best.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very small, however for me this is for the best - it helps not to put too much pressure when shaving.</li>
            <li>That being said, probably most people would be ok with it, as the other reviews tend to indicate.</li>
            <li>Ergonomics are better due to the knurling and the increase in diameter at the end of the handle--both facilitate a better grip and thus control during the shave.  </li>
            <li>For a super close shave, I have used a shaving oil first and then applied the shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, heavy duty construction.  </li>
            <li>feels great , solid, smooth  well engineered, can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to stop the insanity of overpriced disposables and ineffective electrics</li>
            <li>investment is good because razors are not as pricey as Gilette and other competing brands.</li>
            <li>As long as you treat this razor like gold, it&#x27;ll treat you even better!</li>
            <li>Very we&#x27;ll built worth the money!</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is perfect (at least as good, if not better than, cartridges)&lt;br /&gt;Excellent,</li>
            <li>recommend this razor to ANYONE who wants to get a high quality razor without dishing out a huge wad of cash!</li>
            <li>you are on the right track.</li>
            <li>With Drip Stand, Ivory, Medium]] was right around $100.</li>
            <li>Yes that&#x27;s right - 10 cents.</li>
            <li>right.    </li>
            <li>Enter safety razors, stage right.  </li>
            <li>So now I am looking for the right soap again.  </li>
            <li>It puts just the right amount of curve onto the blade.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>The Merkur was just right.  </li>
            <li>imposes on blades seems just right.</li>
            <li>weight is just right</li>
            <li>and it does aid in applying the right amount of pressure so that I don&#x27;t cut myself (that often).</li>
            <li>so it seemed like the right move at the time.</li>
            <li>I could IMMEDIATELY tell that I made the right choice in this razor.</li>
            <li>I like both right now.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s at the right angle, it shaves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably try out the variety pack of razors to find the right brand.</li>
            <li>These razors are the just the right weight and hold the blade just right for a close shave with out razor burn.</li>
            <li>is about 3-4 minutes, as opposed to 30 seconds or so with a Mach 3 right out of the shower with my trusty [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The balance just doesn&#x27;t feel right</li>
            <li>and if you KNOW HOW TO SHAVE right</li>
            <li>you take your time and do it right</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just right for me since my hands are a medium size.</li>
            <li>I thought it would take me a while to get used to it, as some say, but I got the hang of it right away.</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>and they are right about it being</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still working on technique and trying to find just the right blade.  </li>
            <li>The razor has the right heft</li>
            <li>nicks or cuts after finding the right blade for my beard.  </li>
            <li>I was right.  </li>
            <li>If you want a razor that gets the job done for the right price, buy this razor.</li>
            <li>Fits my hand just right.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to all of this I would strongly suggest getting a variety pack of DE razor blades so you can find one that works well for you.</li>
            <li>Also, my face feels great after a shave with this, where a Mach-3 would leave my face so raw</li>
            <li>As a completely new user of double edge razors, I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Although someday I might get a model that provides a more aggressive shave (after I develop more skill using it), this razor is fine for me right now - and likely for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li>and I make short light strokes without applying too much pressure, as it really is nice and heavy duty with good weight to it.</li>
            <li>It is amazing that this is how it has been done for so many decades in the past, and somehow we were all duped into thinking cartridge-based safety razors</li>
            <li>Just a steady guiding of the razor across the face with an accurate touch.  </li>
            <li>One note on this particular vendor: the razor came with 10 free blades (not 5),</li>
            <li>I have found that my irritation is substantially reduced and I actually enjoy shaving now and the blades are so cheap that you will quickly recoup your initial investment in cost savings compared to using a Gilette.    </li>
            <li>That nut at the bottom is what makes this one stand out among some of the others - it allows for easy disassembly, safe removal/replacement of the blade and maintains a solid feel to the whole razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with Mach 3 Turbo for many years, but was really interested in trying the old school method.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that getting a clean edge is much easier with the broader DE blade.</li>
            <li>Just as applying with a brush is superior to using your fingers, Having a single blade, which you can control, is much better than scraping multiple blades across your skin.</li>
            <li>short length makes it very easy to control &amp; use.</li>
            <li>No other razor I have found works better for me.  </li>
            <li>No other razor I have found works better for me.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor for beginners or advanced users as I don&#x27;t see how you can get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend a badger brush and it does make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This razor is my new go to razor, great feel and plenty of control with when wet.</li>
            <li>it just takes to much care and time to get the job done right for me!</li>
            <li>I must start out by saying I am one of those men with a beard that seems to be made of wire and skin that is incredibly sensitive - shaving has never been fun, easy or without issues since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>The weight, blade angle, and aggressiveness were different than my previous razor, but I&#x27;m very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>Even compared to the DSC, I can get more shaves -- better shaves -- for half the cost on blades.  </li>
            <li>Wanted to try a double edge razor, the razor is very well constructed, &amp;#34;worried that I would slice my face to bits&amp;#34;, hasn&#x27;t happened, easy to use, Taylor of Bond street cream , great close shave, went from shaving twice a week to almost daily,, love the scent and feeling, only reason not to get five stars, the length, should have bought the longer razor</li>
            <li>The razor case is great because you can just slide the used blade into the underside of the small case that the blades came in</li>
            <li>Weird how cheap and not getting cut was the way, in my mind to a good safe shave using the multi blade</li>
            <li>This first week I have cut my self 4 out 5 times but the shave is so close it is worth the pain of the learning curve.</li>
            <li>Okay, one gripe is it doesn&#x27;t do that cool butterfly open on top like I&#x27;ve seen some other razors do, instead the whole top just unscrews by twisting the bottom of the handle.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it, but it seems I can only occasionally get as good a shave as my disposable razors</li>
            <li>Great razor if you have small hands.</li>
            <li>The handle is short but very balanced and offers great feedback while shaving.  </li>
            <li>This was my first razor since stepping off the Gilette/Schick merry go round, and it was a great first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found you can go as cheap or expensive as you would want to and still be able to find a good quality razor that meets your needs.</li>
            <li>So far to early to give a full honest review I will update later once I have a lot more shaves.</li>
            <li>I felt that was high but with the high grade steal, I can&#x27;t see wearing this out for many years.  </li>
            <li>So far, the Merkur has proved very easy to get started with and the blades that came with it are excellent and last at least 1 week.  </li>
            <li>of the extremely helpful wet shaving celebrities on YouTube recommend the Merkur 34C HD as the ideal safety razor for novices, and after my first shave, it&#x27;s easy to see why.</li>
            <li>The short handle is perfect to rest on my little finger.  </li>
            <li>The shorter handle seems to be precise for me, I also have a long handle but prefer the smaller more agile 34c.</li>
            <li>: quick disassemble/assemble, easy to clean, fits nicely in large hands, solid construction</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as easy as the butterfly opening of other razors, but the two piece construction allows the blade to be grasped and changed safely.</li>
            <li>and I am kind of excited to be back to the old ways.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting the new model of Norelco (fantastic electric razor)  each year for hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li>I used this razor yesterday for the first time right after getting it.</li>
            <li>B002MUAP2E Razorba Back Hair Shaver]] which gives me a comfortable, safe, close, diy, and easy reachable back hair shaving.</li>
            <li>Overall, this razor is more than worth the money.</li>
            <li>The knurled handle offers plenty of grip, loading the razor is incredibly easy and it feels sturdy and stable in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shave prep is more extensive but worth it</li>
            <li>Shave prep is more extensive but worth it  </li>
            <li>However, if you properly learn proper shaving habits, you will greatly reduce the odds of this.  </li>
            <li>when I get done, my face and throat are completely smooth and stay that way for 2-3 days, which even considering my slow beard growth is a good shave.</li>
            <li>it is very sturdy with a nice finish, something that looks like it will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>with somewhat sensitive skin, this provided a very quick shave.</li>
            <li>If you are remotely considering making the switch to wet-shaving, or are already a wet shaver looking for an excellent razor, do yourself a favor and order this razor.</li>
            <li>Simple to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Although sturdy with a great grip, the razor felt really small in my hand at first.</li>
            <li>The Feather was a mild shave, but didn&#x27;t cut the hair very well.  </li>
            <li>Along with some great German or Japanese blades like Wilkinson or Feather, this thing is a pleasure to use with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>The time to shave and clean the razor is a bit longer, but using this razor and the Personna Prep Double Edge Razor Blades (100 pack at 35 cents each) gets me a much closer shave at a much better price.  </li>
            <li>But if you use a lighter touch this is perfect because it is heavy enough to compensate.</li>
            <li>The construction is very solid and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Its back to the good old days of shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I forgot what a good shave the old Double Edge razors give, plus all the money that I save not buying razors every month or so.</li>
            <li>Great value for the price - should last a lifetime with proper care.</li>
            <li>The blades are hilariously inexpensive compared to disposable or cartridge razors, even the ones made of German-made medical grade steel, meaning you can change them out as often as you like, even every shave, and still be economical.  </li>
            <li>it has been super smooth and enjoyable to use, with less razor burn than the Fusion.</li>
            <li>Being a gluten, I decided I needed another safety razor, even though a Merkur will last a lot longer than a human LOL.  </li>
            <li>Get good cream, I like Taylors Old Bond, get a mid price badger brush and a stand and a blade sample pack.</li>
            <li>I went for the Merkur 34C after reading about the strong grip it offers because of its weight (it does) and, well, because its Merkur.</li>
            <li>I get generic blades from a local pharmacy for now, and still get a great shave.</li>
            <li>I use shaving soap and was very pleasantly surprised about how easy the transition was.  </li>
            <li>so I primarily use this razor to keep my neck and upper cheeks trim and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I think I may have fallen in love with my new baby soft face!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sharp and I nicked myself pretty good.</li>
            <li>Wet shaving is the way to go, plus I get a better shave!</li>
            <li>Changing the razor and giving it a full cleaning is simple: just twist the bolt at the bottom of the razor, hold the top piece of the head and the side of the razor and pull apart gently.</li>
            <li>Changing the razor and giving it a full cleaning is simple: just twist the bolt at the bottom of the razor, hold the top piece of the head and the side of the razor and pull apart gently.</li>
            <li>Overall,  I am happy with the purchase as it is a higher quality tool than cheaper razors and should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>It takes only a little more time than I used to spend gnawing at my face with my electric razor and is much more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>I love well made tools that serve their intended purpose, so this German made beauty is right up my alley.  </li>
            <li>can fit easily in the palm of my hand--which I see as a benefit for travelling, but that might make some want to get the long handled version.  </li>
            <li>and I find the short handle very comfortable maneuver around your face and jawline.  </li>
            <li>I was kind of expecting to be able to jump into shaving with a double edged razor without much fuss, but it really is very different from cartridge razor shaving.  </li>
            <li>Feather became very very gentle...</li>
            <li>A great starter razor, the Merkur blade is also a very forgiving blade and allows you to learn if you are new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many Merkur razors, including the 37C (Slant), Progress, and Futur (extremely aggressive); and the 34C outperforms these razors at delivering a comfortably close shave.</li>
            <li>No cuts, smooth finish or extremely efficient and safe.</li>
            <li>I always grip the razor near the head so the shorter handle is fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Finally I have a real razor that can easily and smoothly cut my Barb Wire Wiskers.</li>
            <li>you want to try wet shaving on the cheap, the Lord L6 is a mild but acceptable $10 alternative available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>A true classic.</li>
            <li>Nice to get back to the older style!👍🏾</li>
            <li>If you enjoy shaving, this razor is balanced to give a decent close shave without applying much pressure to the razor.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The razor leaves a large space open between the blade and the guard bar so that this razor never gets clogged and is always easy to clean by just running water over it or shaking it under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great high quality heavy razor.  </li>
            <li>Though I am enjoying the shave very much and I have only done it twice with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Superior build quality (actually I feel a little better than my Futur at twice the price).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been amazingly reliable and gets the job done with minimal irritation.  </li>
            <li>This one has a smaller blade gap but more aggressive angle than the kelvin.  </li>
            <li>The more knowledge you have prior to face shaving</li>
            <li>I really, really like this razor!</li>
            <li>I bought this as my first safety razor.</li>
            <li>realize that the short handle was better for me...</li>
            <li>be sure you are buying the Japanese brand and not the knockoff Thailand blades.</li>
            <li>this is your first DE razor</li>
            <li>There is no pivot-head which means you must be aware of and account for the organic curvature of your face and neck.</li>
            <li>and it will take you about 20 minutes the first time</li>
            <li>;)  -Rene N.</li>
            <li>glad I gave safety razors a second chance.  </li>
            <li>But since it s the first safety razor I ve used in 25 years, i can t tell you how it compares to others.</li>
            <li>Fast service too!</li>
            <li>I finally made the switch from the cartridge to the DE razor, and glad I did.  </li>
            <li>This razor is exactly what was described and is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>This is a \\&quot;no frills\\&quot; DE Razor and does exactly what it should do.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>First time in my life I now look forward to shaving AND with the Merkur</li>
            <li>This is my first DE safety razor.</li>
            <li>This seems obvious, but coming from a Mach 3, I was used to haphazardly touching up stubble without applying additional shaving cream.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a hot idea with a DE razor.</li>
            <li>Therefore I settled for a electric trimmer because it was the only thing safe for me to use.    </li>
            <li>Pay extra attention to how your hairs grow on your neck area, where it matters the most how you cut it.)</li>
            <li>So first couple shaves with this</li>
            <li>This is my first double-edge blade razor.  </li>
            <li>This razor is supporting my wanton shaving laziness</li>
            <li>My favorite double edge safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I still remember the first time that I used it, it shaved closer than the Gillette Mach whatever I was using at the time.</li>
            <li>Better buy a StipTick at the same time.</li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor after years with a \\&quot;modern\\&quot; multi-trac.  </li>
            <li>Then several years ago my lovely wife purchased a shaving brush, mug and upscale razor.  </li>
            <li>First off this is my first safety razor</li>
            <li>You will never get a better safety razor than Merkur, this is the second one I have had</li>
            <li>Also, for the first time I didn&#x27;t bleed at all after shaving against the grain.</li>
            <li>As many have noted, you shouldn&#x27;t grip it, so I would imagine a longer handle might actually be detrimental.</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>If it your first time using the razor, I recommend watching a \\&quot;how do use\\&quot; video online.</li>
            <li>I first</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The first time I shaved with a cartridge razor</li>
            <li>First time buying and using a DE Razor.  </li>
            <li>Which is exactly what I was looking for when I started DE shaving 4 months ago.</li>
            <li>only is it a cheaper method, but the shaves come out a lot better and closer.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to try different blades.</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s that consistent.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my first DE razor</li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor and it works well for me.</li>
            <li>, that was my first mistake.</li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor.  </li>
            <li>You realize that when you first pick it up.</li>
            <li>Your savings might be higher or lower depending on how often you change your blades.</li>
            <li>Worked from the first time.</li>
            <li>This one is exactly what I was wanting.</li>
            <li>I suggest coupling it with a higher quality shave cream.</li>
            <li>My first was a Weishi razor purchased on eBay.  </li>
            <li>I prefer Derby Extra, mostly for the price in comparison to the others.  </li>
            <li>The Dorco that came with my first razor also seemed rather forgiving, but I haven&#x27;t tried another one since.  </li>
            <li>Love the short handle.</li>
            <li>then I decided to invest more money after reading the reviews here on amazon and let me say &amp;#34;Guys the Razor matters&amp;#34; This razor is like the gold standard in safety razor shaving!</li>
            <li>So I decided it might be worthwhile to go back to the old-school &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The short handle for beginners like myself allow greater control over the razor.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>No complicated adjustments to allow any metal to stress and break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But if I&#x27;d seen it first hand I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
            <li>My first safety razor.</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>First off let’s not kid ourselves.</li>
            <li>It was my first time to shave with a DE razor</li>
            <li>My daily shave has become an enjoyable meditation time, instead of a chore!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>At first, I used the Merkur blade and cut my face a lot.</li>
            <li>The Jagger never failed to cut me to pieces.  </li>
            <li>First time using a DE razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first double edge razor and it works ok.  </li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor.  </li>
            <li>Merkur HD is my first razor.  </li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor.</li>
            <li>The last one I drop in my tub and the top broke off.  </li>
            <li>My favorite double edge safety razor.</li>
            <li>People recommend the short handle for greater control</li>
            <li>: it is the first thing people see when they look at you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(my first DE safety razor, so theres a learning curve for me)&lt;br /&gt;liking</li>
            <li>First, let me put this in context: I had never used a double-edged (DE) razor before.</li>
            <li>This was his first type of razor like the Merkur.  </li>
            <li>I dove into the wetshaving world eyes open and this was the most recommended razor for wetshaving virgins.  </li>
            <li>I remember this type of razors as the first I learned to shave with as my father used them.</li>
            <li>My first DER.  </li>
            <li>some irritation after the first use.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using a safety razor</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will last me for year and years to come.</li>
            <li>First of all, let me disclose that I&#x27;m a woman and that I use this razor for body shaving.</li>
            <li>Although I will say that it&#x27;s easier to get an occasional nick, mostly on the front part of my shin if I put pressure on the blade.</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor</li>
            <li>I was worried about the short handle and just about went for the longer but am glad I got this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this is my first razor; I like the fact that the safety bar is fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My initial impression is happily satisfied.</li>
            <li>This razor reminds me of the razor I cut my first beard on, my dad&#x27;s Gillette Fat Boy.  </li>
            <li>The 34C is a no-frills razor that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>Again, not that big of a deal, but anyone who has a problem safely handling double-edge blades needs to just grow a beard.  </li>
            <li>Actually buying two more, one for travel and one for my 19 y/o son.  </li>
            <li>Ok, if you are still with me, so for one year of shaving changing the blade every week and only shaving 6 times a week.  </li>
            <li>That adds up to about $55 dollars in the first year.  </li>
            <li>First off, let me say, that I have never written a review of any product.</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more of the blades when I run out, which will be months away, since the blades last a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Its pretty well documented then plating issues and customer service problems with merkur.</li>
            <li>I gained confidence in the first couple of strokes as it was easier on my face than the cartridge&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>My first shave</li>
            <li>Should last a life time and even more .</li>
            <li>but I like my Edwin Jagger Faux Ebony Double Edge Safety Razor better.</li>
            <li>absolutely love it and will never go back.</li>
            <li>It is well made, and holds the blade exactly where it should giving an even cut on both sides.</li>
            <li>The short handle works for most, but does not work for me.  </li>
            <li>After a year now I purchased my first Merker 34C HD.</li>
            <li>Since this was my first shaving experience I just kept on using Gillette razors, from the atra to the sensor and eventually the mach 3.  </li>
            <li>I tried many different ways to shave with it, stick with Gillette razors, nobody comes close to them.</li>
            <li>shaving is all setup now to be affordable, fun, and very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>big win - blades are sooooo much cheaper and last much longer!</li>
            <li>My first time using a safety razor.</li>
            <li>Having to shave a lot with the fire department, I wanted something more efficient while being close at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first DE safety razor.</li>
            <li>This was the first razor I bought when I switched off cartridge razors.  </li>
            <li>You may not be able to get a Porsche but the Merkur gives you affordable German craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only owned this razor for a couple days, but I already love it.</li>
            <li>My first razor was the Parker 99r</li>
            <li>I was timid on the first shave but for ONE blade it had a WAYY smoother stroke without yanking than any razor i have ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t realize the handle was so short, but eventually I was able to adjust</li>
            <li>it is waayyy much better than all them regular multiblade cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>(okay, well, the occasional nick, still).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly</li>
            <li>Would I be able to use short strokes without any pressure, overcoming my cartridge razor habits?</li>
            <li>These are some of the unknowns facing the first-time DE shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the first stroke with the 34C put my concerns to rest.</li>
            <li>It can only get better from here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being the first blade I&#x27;ve tried, all I can say is that I had no problems with it.</li>
            <li>My first DE Razor.</li>
            <li>smaller and thicker body looks much better in chrome.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this razor and have enjoyed the change to this shaving</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting back to DE shaving after many years away.</li>
            <li>This thing will last more than my life time.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>You plop the blade on and screw the top back on.</li>
            <li>The razor blade seats pretty consistently,so  </li>
            <li>I just tried this razor for the first time.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried the Merkur, I thought it wasn&#x27;t working because there was no resistance at all -- but it was working fantastically.  </li>
            <li>First time DE shaver, and</li>
            <li>this is my first ever DE razor.  </li>
            <li>Used with your favorite double-edged blades (I prefer Israeli-made Personna Red)</li>
            <li>All those new-fangled over-marketed modern B.S. razors with their balls and lubricating strips and what-not aren&#x27;t worth doodly-squat.</li>
            <li>I tried switching from creams to gels to hot foam, it made no difference.</li>
            <li>I used the Merkur HD for the first time tonight; this was the first time ever using a DE safety razor.</li>
            <li>This was the first safety razor i have ever owned.</li>
            <li>This is my first doube edge razor so have nothing to compare it to</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor and it is virtually fool proof.</li>
            <li>this is my first razor like this.</li>
            <li>This is my first attempt at using safety razor and wish I would have done it once I started shaving years ago.</li>
            <li>Two sections of this review - looks / first impressions, and function.    </li>
            <li>Now to the shaving: I used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>I had a cheaper brand that i bought locally and this functions much better.  </li>
            <li>I especially like how I can better maneuver shaving under my nose and</li>
            <li>I recommend getting a sample pack to try many different kinds of blades.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I really do love the shave but the only thing I haven&#x27;t figured out is how to shave close under my nose.  </li>
            <li>This razor will last more than a lifetime.</li>
            <li>The short handle allows me to have more control while shaving.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too much razor for me!  </li>
            <li>First off, as I would tell anyone, a quality shave is the product of a lot of factors.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pick up a DE razor for the first time when you have to catch a train in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>but WOW, talk about a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my nephew wanted for his birthday.  </li>
            <li>Like many others, I browsed the numerous forums and reviews online before deciding which razor to get.</li>
            <li>The short handle makes it more maneuverable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a bit of a learning curve though, I cut may face for the first month or so.</li>
            <li>My first one still looks like the day I bought it.</li>
            <li>I love it and haven&#x27;t looked back!</li>
            <li>This is my first de razor.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very well worth the effort.</li>
            <li>It is not difficult to get a BBS (baby bottom smooth&amp;#34; shave from this razor.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this razor as my first safety razor.</li>
            <li>The first razor I ever shaved with was a safety razor that was my dad&#x27;s during WWII, government issued.  </li>
            <li>This is my first D.E. razor.</li>
            <li>This was my first DE razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the blade that came with it, not the higher quality blades I purchased, so I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s giving me a closer shave than a cartridge razor.  </li>
            <li>The first thing you will notice is the weight and how well made the razor is.</li>
            <li>The weight is crucial because it allows better manipulation and control.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>My first DE razor.</li>
            <li>; Well, in this case, they make them EXACTLY like they used to.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is my first quality razor and I was tossed between this and the 1904.</li>
            <li>This was must first safety razor.</li>
            <li>It is my first DE razor.</li>
            <li>The most you could possibly spend on blades</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor.</li>
            <li>Just shaved with it for the first time Not difficult.</li>
            <li>Just received this razor today and I have had my first shave with it already</li>
            <li>while in this; it is only one fix and make sure it is tighten will</li>
            <li>Used mine for the first time on Christmas morning.</li>
            <li>First of all this is a very well made razor!</li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s very inexpensive!</li>
            <li>First DE used.</li>
            <li>just used it for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li>My first foray into safety razors.</li>
            <li>I will admit you need to be more cautious and not rush when using a double edge razor, but that&#x27;s not a problem.  </li>
            <li>It is rounded enough to prevent that, but is a bit more pointy.  </li>
            <li>I did use the included blade for the first three (3) shaves and am now trying out blades from a sample set.</li>
            <li>my first every DE purchase</li>
            <li>This razor has absolutely changed my outlook on shaving!</li>
            <li>First shave and</li>
            <li>At first you will get a bunch of cuts and there is about a month learning period.</li>
            <li>It does everything that my former Gillette multi-edge razor did and more.</li>
            <li>When looking to buy a double edge razor most reviewers recommended Merkur.</li>
            <li>I bought this a my first DE razor and could not be happier.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m really pleased with it.</li>
            <li>at least four great three pass shaves per blade (WTG, XTG, ATG).  </li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor.  </li>
            <li>The bottom part spins to release the safety guide, as opposed to having to spin the entire top off.</li>
            <li>Excellent Shaver and would buy another one if this one fails for whatever reason.  </li>
            <li>Love it and will never go back!</li>
            <li>I spoke to the sellers, and they issued me a replacement blade for the one that had been bent, at no charge and first class priority.</li>
            <li>Solid as a rock and rust free!</li>
            <li>My first safety razor was the Edwin Jagger chrome plated razor.  </li>
            <li>First and foremost-</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I decided to pay extra for this razor.</li>
            <li>My first safety razor.</li>
            <li>The difference is this will last for 30 years or more.</li>
            <li>Heavy in the hand, good shave.</li>
            <li>After watching a few YouTube videos on how to prepare a good lather I was off.</li>
            <li>I also find that i can be much more precise with the Merkur and get those little bits of hair right under my nose</li>
            <li>I had to order a new one right away!</li>
            <li>The process of opening a jar of shaving cream (mine is sandalwood, which is quite pleasant), brushing it on and creating a lather, then letting the blade do all the work cutting my beard is just a nice way to start the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I own a few super speeds that I don&#x27;t use as often anymore.</li>
            <li>The shave was the smoothest I&#x27;d ever experienced, and I was worried the Merkur razor would not live up to the hype, just because the shave soap and scrub made such a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will likely invest in these other shaving tools to get an even better shave down the road, but my point is that you don&#x27;t need all the extras to get an awesome shave with</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, to sum up: amazing quality, very low price (compared to other products), better shave.</li>
            <li>Also, the checkered grip on the shaft is extremely grippy; I find that most of this checkering is just for show, but this grip really works and is comfortable.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the longer handled ones are fine too, but I like the appearance of this little gem.</li>
            <li>It feels just right in the hand, it is very well made, and it gets the job done well.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do as well right up under my nose, and I was gentle on my lower neck</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend to anyone who wants to shave the right way.</li>
            <li>But the plate flexes the blade to just the right angle for a really close shave.</li>
            <li>Get a few different blades up front (shipping will be free now vs. later) and find the one that works best for you.</li>
            <li>The shave is very nice, I have thick beard hair and this razor cuts through it with no problem.</li>
            <li>I recently did my first shave with this beauty and was not disappointed at all!  </li>
            <li>a little practice the razor provides the closest, most comfortable shave you will find.</li>
            <li>The Derby blades that came with it are also nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>The blade itself is quite sharp and effective, but shaving around the neck caused a bit of skipping.  </li>
            <li>EVEN IF YOU HAV SENSITIVE SKIN!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razor and worth the money!</li>
            <li>It is a very good razor for the price and the ATT razor is expensive, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor, it is high quality!!!</li>
            <li>This razor is rated very high and for good reason, it&#x27;s always a risk purchasing something that you have never tried and that&#x27;s why I rely heavily on my fellow reviewers</li>
            <li>point is that the blades are very high quality and you don&#x27;t have to use a new one for each shave, though they&#x27;re just about cheap enough and easy to find that you probably could.</li>
            <li>Either I&#x27;ve got a super wimpy face, or somebody stuffed the ballot box, or the emperor has new clothes, or lemmings are jumping of a cliff.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor to get your strokes down and comfortable with but after two uses i feel im ready for the single blade.</li>
            <li>If you are new to wet shaving and looking for a razor , this razor is is an exceptional choice.</li>
            <li>It took a few practice runs on my legs before I hit the bikini zone and wow what a great shave.</li>
            <li>I would and have recommended this razor to friends, and if you are looking for a great wet shave look no further.  </li>
            <li>I would and have recommended this razor to friends, and if you are looking for a great wet shave look no further.  </li>
            <li>The affordability of wet shaving is such a great saving.  </li>
            <li>wet shaving with a brush, soap, and DE razor is the only way to fly.</li>
            <li>It will almost certainly last my lifetime and is nice enough to be worthy of passing on to a child or grandchild.</li>
            <li>The chrome is substantial and it&#x27;s generally just a fine product.</li>
            <li>I also have larger hands and still find this short handled model easy to use, because shaving with this style razor is done more with your finger tips.</li>
            <li>Finally, any razor is only as good as it&#x27;s blade.</li>
            <li>The tighter you twist, the more likely you can break the handle (just like when you put too much force to tighten a screw, and it screws up the thread).</li>
            <li>Love the short handle...makes it much easier to maneuver across the face.</li>
            <li>Great shave, but you really nee to shave slowly and with the grain or you will cut the hell out of yourself.</li>
            <li>It was my second attempt at this type double edge razor to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>As a first time DE safety razor user I was apprehensive to use this razor, but from the first use I wonder why I was wasting so much money on plastic junk.  </li>
            <li>Also much much cheaper to use over time that the current better quality cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>and I love how much money I save with the double edge razor.</li>
            <li>It has practically eliminated the razor bumps I&#x27;ve had on my neck for my entire adult life (and to be honest, I expect it will --</li>
            <li>Really good razor for starting or if you&#x27;re just looking for something different.</li>
            <li>This German razor cost $15 more but is so much nicer.  </li>
            <li>, so it should resist nicks, dents, and mechanical wear better than the more common brass razors with chrome plate.  </li>
            <li>I still give it 4/5 because I don&#x27;t really understand why this DE has a short handle compared to most others.</li>
            <li>After sampling different blades, I have settled in on Astra Superior Platinum blades as they seem to be the sharpest and longer lasting blades for me.  </li>
            <li>Though there was a short adjustment period where I had nicks and cuts, I appreciated the greater control (and the cost savings) compared to cartridge razors.  </li>
            <li>Simply,it doesn&#x27;t have as much blade exposure as the 38C,and this problem had a great negative impact on my shaves with it.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised on how much better this &#x27;old style&#x27; razor performed compared to modern razors in terms of shave comfort and closeness.  </li>
            <li>Just the right size and weight to get a good shave in the hard to hit neck areas.</li>
            <li>Finally, the razor head can&#x27;t fit into the spot right under my nostrils-</li>
            <li>Good weight, very little pull , let&lt;br /&gt;the blade do the work.</li>
            <li>For anyone, like me, with less than fond memories of the old gillettes, this razor is a remarkable improvement.</li>
            <li>, this one specifically is perfect sized, only have problems in tight spaces by having a large head (Directly under the nose).</li>
            <li>And, the other thing that is just as good as the better shave is the fact that the blades cost less than 50 cents apiece</li>
            <li>handle is not very long, but I find that it is easy to grip and maneuver.</li>
            <li>This works great for that as well, just be careful when you do it as these blades are much sharper than anything from big name companies.</li>
            <li>The short overall length is something you might have to get used to, but is perfectly balanced to allow you to shave with minimal pressure.  </li>
            <li>I made the switch to &#x27;real&#x27; razors ;-) and could not be happier.</li>
            <li>So as far as cost, you at getting something that is more than 2X as cheap the first year and something nearly 20X cheaper the next.  </li>
            <li>This is a replacement for a Merkur long handle which lasted about 8 years before being dropped one too many times.  </li>
            <li>razor is one of the most recommended razors for beginners and long time users.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li>Other reviews on this site have been great in learning how to use a double edge razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much the finest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Love it, wish I didnt wait so long to get it.</li>
            <li>I cannot shave against the grain, never have been able to, not surprised</li>
            <li>It has taken me this long to start to feel confident with the Merkur.</li>
            <li>The weight of the razor when I first pulled it out of the box was very pleasing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the long handle version.</li>
            <li>First time I used it, I applied too much pressure (</li>
            <li>Better than the long handle for my face.</li>
            <li>Much research led me to this as my first DE razor</li>
            <li>I usually have to go against the grain on my chin and cheeks to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li>the end result is no better than a good safety razor.</li>
            <li>Sometimes in grown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually used Gillette Fusion line of razors which were good.</li>
            <li>This razor is small and has some good weight to it.</li>
            <li>The shave is as good and long lasting as the time you&#x27;re willing to put in.</li>
            <li>Though i have been using de razors for the past 15years which are farely good, wanted to try merkur 34 c for all the comments its receiving the popularity it has.</li>
            <li>After a month and half, this Merkur blade is as good as new.</li>
            <li>The only thing you should be doing right now is ask yourself why you haven&#x27;t bought this yet!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend fits the hand just right</li>
            <li>I am using it with my regular shaving Gel after a hot shower and it works fine</li>
            <li>I just lined up the safety bar with my side burn, held the razor at angle that felt balanced in the hand, and let the razor glide down my cheek under its own weight for an inch.</li>
            <li>but if you have large hands the long handle is the better choice.</li>
            <li>No other way to shave for me than an old school &amp;#34;Hot Shave&amp;#34;.  Love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using the modern 2-5 blade disposable razors for years and they are just so much better (faster, less maintenance, and safer-you can easily cut your finger when loading a new blade).</li>
            <li>This razor is of high quality and love the smaller handle and weight.</li>
            <li>After watching several how to videos on YouTube and reading many reviews on Amazon I decided on and highly recommend this razor, feather blades, Escali badger brush, and Proraso shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Very heavy duty, price is fair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just as good if not better than most cartridge type razors and much cheaper in the long run...</li>
            <li>I simply take a little more time to make sure I get everything right at the jaw line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(In other words, shaving with the Merkur 34C is very easy.)</li>
            <li>This handle makes shaving &#x27;Fun&#x27;  If you are new to this type of shaving handle, take your time while shaving to reduce nics and cuts.  </li>
            <li>Sick of paying crazy amount of money for today&#x27;s razor blades (4 blade) Using the Merkur #34 C works excellent, a better shave and the money I will save is incredible.</li>
            <li>I hope this review helps someone out there that thinks that his skin is super sensitive, because it is probably not.</li>
            <li>This thing is smaller than I thought but still easy to use.</li>
            <li>The short handle was easy to convert to.</li>
            <li>The handle is short and easy to control.  </li>
            <li>It had a learning curve after the milder shave from the old super speeds.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a solid product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>My advice is not to try a dry shave and do not go against the grain of your hairs until you have a better feel for the razor.</li>
            <li>Thirty bucks got me 12 cartridges before, now i can easily get 200+ blades for the same price.</li>
            <li>After his first shave with the Merkur HD double edged razor he was amazed at how smooth and close his shave was.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to take apart and the blade adjustment is very simple.  </li>
            <li>and I have used Wilkinson blades exclusively for the same consistent smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I simply guide the razor as it seems so easy to have a feather touch (no pun intended).</li>
            <li>The Art of Shaving told me to use the blade only 10 times, but i have easily gone over that with the 1 blade</li>
            <li>Simple to use and easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>As an added bonus, it also allows easily loosening of the head to open it up a bit for rinsing.</li>
            <li>This razor is straight old school cool</li>
            <li>Strong 2nd place to 1954 Gillette</li>
            <li>/&gt;People who favor DE razors claim everything from them providing a better shave, to being faster, to being much cheaper (in the long run).</li>
            <li>The handle provides enough weight for good balance without being too long or unwieldy.</li>
            <li>Brand new razor in original package and came with one new Merkur blade.</li>
            <li>a Parker 100% Pure Badger Bristle Black Handle Shaving Brush, and an Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>ultimately decided to try this from Merkur, and have enjoyed using it very much thus far.</li>
            <li>It is considered a very gentle razor and therefor very easy to use for somebody new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>The heft of the razor allows for a nice glide down your face without applying to much force.</li>
            <li>I have fairly large hands and the \\&quot;small\\</li>
            <li>have large hands, while I have not tried one of the longer handled razors</li>
            <li>People with large hands may want to consider a longer-handled model by Merkur.</li>
            <li>I use it with a pure badger brush and William mug soap.  </li>
            <li>I have large hands</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning on purchasing one as a gift for my old-school father and am certain he&#x27;ll appreciate the quality.</li>
            <li>have* taken off large amounts of skin from using shaving techniques picked up with cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from the learning curve involved in changing the way I shave, I just had some surgery which will leave a fairly large raised scar on my neck.</li>
            <li>You will certainly take pride in your shave with this.</li>
            <li>If you have large hands purchase the 38C, this felt like it was baby sized when I picked it up.</li>
            <li>If this is your first double edge razor it might take you 3-4 shaves before you get use to the smaller/heavy razor compared to your old one, but i now love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 100 Astra razors and also a blade sampler.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, its kinda fun shaving with an old timber type one too!</li>
            <li>overall this razor is easy to use, and not irritating.</li>
            <li>To put this into a bit better perspective, the Merkur razor along with 100 blades cost me less than 6 months worth of Gillette Mach 5 heads alone (which is to say, not including the price of their razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an excellent safety razor, at least based on my limited experience.</li>
            <li>If you only hold the razor with 3 fingers (picture chop stix) then you should be fine.</li>
            <li>In terms of blade quality, the standard ones that came with the razor work fine for me.</li>
            <li>Toss in a couple extra packs of razors or anything else with this fine razor bag.  </li>
            <li>In the end the shave is closer as I go with and against the grain, and there is no irritation as the blades are always sharp - because I am willing  to replace them more often.</li>
            <li>However, when I used the Big Ben blades, I was fine.</li>
            <li>it should work fine with big hands.</li>
            <li>I had forgotten what it is like, after shaving with the less than satisfying mass market safety razor and multiple blade nonsense for more years</li>
            <li>This razor is a short handled razor which is fine with me</li>
            <li>I had been pretty public about me switching from cartridge shaving to DE shaving originally for cost savings, despite the upfront investment.  </li>
            <li>Of course the savings is huge, but I never expected such a great shave from such a simple blade.</li>
            <li>If you are still interested, then why should you buy this particular razor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>The design is pretty classic</li>
            <li>It is easy to grip, aggressive enough for a very close shave, but not so much as to slice up my face.  </li>
            <li>first DE razor was a decent Edwin Jagger.  </li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t like it at all for the first week, mainly because I was overly worried about getting cut.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re interested in a classic shaving experience</li>
            <li>A classic razor in all regards!</li>
            <li>This is a nice little razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Modern cartridge style razors are more expensive but so much more convenient!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a nice little companion that offer</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this to anyone trying DE shaving for the first time.</li>
            <li>When I first received the razor, I had really high hopes after reading all of the reviews.  </li>
            <li>The Merkur HD is of high quality, and affordable blades make it the logical choice for all men suffering from five o&#x27;clock shadows out there.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this razor for first time buyers which is what I am.</li>
            <li>There is also some discussion out there about how it might fit into your hands if you&#x27;re a large person with bigger hands and all of that.</li>
            <li>Handle is a little on the short side-making it great for travel.</li>
            <li>Allows for a good grip and ease of hitting the hard spots on my chin.</li>
            <li>If you want a razor that will last about a year or two then this is for you; otherwise, there are better quality razors out there for a little more money.</li>
            <li>I like using sharp blades and that they are super cheap.</li>
            <li>You will not get as good a shave and will dull the blade much faster.</li>
            <li>This razor is easy to use, with the proper technique, and much more pleasing than other forms of shaving that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Provides a heavy feel, is easy to clean and replace blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Blades are much cheaper and available at your local CVS, Walgreens etc.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve really started to enjoy the ritual of preparing shaving cream and taking my time with multiple passes etc.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s this good with the cheap ones, I can&#x27;t wait to buy some expensive ones, for like $5.00!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>most shaving websites recommend, I use HeadBlade&#x27;s HeadSlick shaving lotion, touch up with a styptic pencil when needed (not very often, unless I rush or apply too much pressure) and finish up with Gilette Aftershave Gel.    </li>
            <li>Mercur heavy duty is by far the most comfortable smooth daily shave.</li>
            <li>I was using an old vintage Gillette razor that was 80 years old, and when I changed to this, I noticed a huge difference in the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li>I got a sample pack of replacement blades and was much happier with some others.</li>
            <li>I transitioned to wet shaving with this product after using Mach 3 for many years.</li>
            <li>so much money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m much happier with the quality if shaves I&#x27;m getting now than I have ever been.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Shaving is really a skill</li>
            <li>All I can tell is that I have a much, MUCH closer shave</li>
            <li>It really made me almost regret jumping on the safety razor train.  </li>
            <li>On another note they listed it with 5 free blades, mine came with 1 merkur blade and 10 extra korean made blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have gotten no blades for free; I could have ordered some along with my initial order for a couple dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave is much closer than the disposable cartridge razor.  </li>
            <li>Since I was hesitant about buying a safety razor after years of using modern razors with multi blade disposables, I am commenting on that aspect.</li>
            <li>It is high quality!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to apply much pressure.  </li>
            <li>Now, I feel like my shave is cleaner for about a day longer, and much smoother on day 1.  </li>
            <li>crafted design, functional, and a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Solid and comfortable design.</li>
            <li>After my second shave I was blown away at how smooth silky</li>
            <li>Handling of spent blades can be kind of a pain, but overall it is definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Be forewarned though, make sure your face is wet or it WILL CUT YOU.  </li>
            <li>Regardless of which razor you choose, once you&#x27;ve purchased it, you&#x27;ll be ready to start saving money on shaving for the rest of your life.</li>
            <li>I really like the chrome finish and weight of the razor.</li>
            <li>but I actually really like it.</li>
            <li>I have smaller hands but can still grip it securely using two or three fingers.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready for the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleased with them; prices for DE blades can vary widely, and the Dorco&#x27;s are on the cheaper end.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using too much pressure on.</li>
            <li>I really like this company.    </li>
            <li>I can reasonably expect my razor to outlast me...</li>
            <li>The Merkur 34c really stood out with</li>
            <li>The Merkur 34c is very well made.</li>
            <li>(How much are those cartridge blades now, $2 apiece?</li>
            <li>Unlike a modern razor it dles</li>
            <li>I started shaving with Save Secret shave oil with this razor and it makes for great combination.</li>
            <li>But, if you can take a moment to spoil yourself and to enjoy the necessary ritual of manhood.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.</li>
            <li>You REALLY have to know what you&#x27;re doing to use a safety razor.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really review them.</li>
            <li>what i really like about this razor is the knurled handle and the 2 piece design.</li>
            <li>the razor holds the blades straight with an even blade exposure on both sides.</li>
            <li>and this blade really does let you get things done</li>
            <li>To my surprise they were already smooth after a cross grain pass.  </li>
            <li>I got a very close shave with no nicks.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Tips: use the weight of the the Merkur razor to cut your hair - don&#x27;t apply much force, stretch your skin while shaving, shower or wash your face with warm water prior to shaving (open pores), don&#x27;t use any chemicals after a shave,</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this should be the modern way to shave., and tighten.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this should be the modern way to shave.</li>
            <li>Get a straight razor and learn to use it.</li>
            <li>Overall a fantastic razor, if you like using safety razors.</li>
            <li>and i really like it.</li>
            <li>Unless of course your using a straight razor.</li>
            <li>I like the fact it is Stainless Steel</li>
            <li>Very close shave.  </li>
            <li>It also uses much cheaper blades.</li>
            <li>One pass with the grain and a second against gives me a shave as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Much closer shave.  </li>
            <li>My husband has this razor and really likes it.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy and well built.</li>
            <li>Thanks to everyone who had already posted reviews on this.</li>
            <li>I received mine this week and thanks to the videos on YouTube, have shaved twice with not one nick.</li>
            <li>There were actually 10 blades included in my order, even though it said 5 free blades.</li>
            <li>It was much easier than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>So, I wouldn&#x27;t shave very often to try to save</li>
            <li>Last year I was given a free Proglide Flexball.</li>
            <li>I just expected more for the price.    </li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve seen the process, then you can make a more informed decision about whether wet shaving is for you.</li>
            <li>but this razor is very forgiving.</li>
            <li>but I enjoy it now that I am trying different blades.</li>
            <li>Much closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>So, after much research I decided to try wet-shaving.  </li>
            <li>I was not expecting to have to shave twice to get anything approaching a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>This is a very well made and balanced razor.</li>
            <li>I like it as much as my 1958</li>
            <li>the advancement isn&#x27;t really need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a straight razor shaver.</li>
            <li>The product shaves very well.</li>
            <li>The blade changing mechanism is also very convenient.</li>
            <li>This razor has all the weight you need to get a close, comfortable shave with all types of double edge blades.</li>
            <li>I may switch to a straight razor one day.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I used to use \\&quot;fast food\\&quot; razors.  </li>
            <li>There are also those who just like the experience of using a DE razor (I can&#x27;t say much about that, to each his own).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like all modern razors except stainless steel ones, it is made of nickel plated pot metal.</li>
            <li>You will throw out all of those Machs and track cartridges and get a real shave.</li>
            <li>unlike multi-blade razors, you really don&#x27;t need to use pressure for a closer shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very weighty and balanced and handles very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t found that too be much of a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He really likes the close shave</li>
            <li>Very well built.</li>
            <li>he knew what real shaving is about.</li>
            <li>If you do I notice it lifts one side of the blade too much.</li>
            <li>I really like the weight of this razor as well as the knurled handle.</li>
            <li>The two piece design is really convenient I find.</li>
            <li>I expected this razor to be better constructed than my Parkers.  </li>
            <li>I upgraded to the 38C and enjoy having the added weight and extra</li>
            <li>So I really don&#x27;t need the leverage of a longer handle the way I needed it with a cartridge razor</li>
            <li>I really like the weight and quality of this product, but I wish the handle was about an inch longer.</li>
            <li>I really feel like I am pampering my face.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Much.</li>
            <li>and I find this razor not to be very aggressive.</li>
            <li>This razor along with a brick of Feather blades, Proraso shaving cream and badger brush causes me to wonder how modern cartridge razors ever took hold to begin with.</li>
            <li>I shave my whole head except a goatee.</li>
            <li>does the modern man have hair on our face.</li>
            <li>razor itself is very well weighted and balanced.  </li>
            <li>it was doing its job very well.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>(going fast).  </li>
            <li>I like using this razor so much I shave every day now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very reassuring sensation.</li>
            <li>This razor has been very forgiving</li>
            <li>there is a longer-handled version if you really need it.</li>
            <li>Shaving is not as much of a chore now as it was.</li>
            <li>i really like the personna blades, which you can find on amazon for about $10 for 100</li>
            <li>LOVE this razor,but now I&#x27;m curious about the Seki/Feather AS-D2.....</li>
            <li>No adjustments to the razor are necessary (or possible.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are cheaper &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; razors available.</li>
            <li>and I really like</li>
            <li>The included blade was junk, didn&#x27;t cut my face but didn&#x27;t really cut my beard either, Immediately bought a pack of ASTRA brand blades.</li>
            <li>The finish on the Edwin Jagger is also much nicer.  </li>
            <li>they are only 19 bucks plus 10 free razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used everything from disposable razors to straight razors.</li>
            <li>(I even tried with just watter) all with the same results, completly pain free and close shave.</li>
            <li>He complains of razor burn and skin sensitivity after using these modern razors.</li>
            <li>but it seems very well built</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>And thanks for delivering it on time for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to those cheap plastic razors.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and simple design.</li>
            <li>I have also found this provides a much closer shave than any of the newer razors I tried.  </li>
            <li>If you are trying to find a cheap option, go with this razor and you will only have to buy a razor once.</li>
            <li>What I do appreciate is that I haven&#x27;t nicked myself that much using the DE razor.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I&#x27;ll continue using the DE razor and hope to improve over time and find it a much better solution for wet shaving.</li>
            <li>This works really well</li>
            <li>they really do differ and I recommend the sampler you can buy online.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to nick myself and I get a much smoother shave than disposables or cartridges.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see myself ever buying another one of these, unless it gets really worn out in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>;, you can do so with the confidence that this razor will not carve your face into a work of modern art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t complain I just decided to take responsibly for it.</li>
            <li>The highlight is the stainless steel design.</li>
            <li>This is ALL stainless.</li>
            <li>Not even comparable to this really.  </li>
            <li>I received the item very promptly.  </li>
            <li>It has been very seldom though, so thats why I gave it a four star.</li>
            <li>Fast forward three years</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Just got into wet shaving and have been in enjoying it from the beginning.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m getting used to it, I really like it.</li>
            <li>Where it really becomes an issue is shaving around your jawbone close to your ears.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy it immensely.</li>
            <li>There really is no reason to spend more unless you are collecting these type of razors.  </li>
            <li>The sample pack i purchased came with 50 blades wish i bought 25 feathers, because i will be getting a straight blade with disposable razors.</li>
            <li>They sent me the feather blades, which I greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>Thanks for taking care of me, will buy from seller again.</li>
            <li>, I think the build quality is much nicer.</li>
            <li>so I approached it very cautiously.  </li>
            <li>Semogue boar brushes rival silvertip badger brushes and are much cheaper.</li>
            <li>and you will get a close, comfortable shave that will cost you next to nothing.  </li>
            <li>I also use Clinique shave cream which stays very close to your face and doesn&#x27;t foam.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave and solid feel.</li>
            <li>so it will be ready for shaving again</li>
            <li>Much heavier.</li>
            <li>The razor replacement cartridges are very inexpensive compared to the name brand Gilette brands.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the weight and balance</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>and i really like it.</li>
            <li>Each razor has something I really like but the Merkur is my go to safest of the safety razor quiver I have.</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>It makes maneuvering the blade along the curves and contours of your neck and face much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like it so much</li>
            <li>Much easier to replace razors on this one.</li>
            <li>As many others say, try a few different blades in it...bought a sample pack and glad I did because did not dig the Feathers, they irritate my skin...</li>
            <li>they only sent me 3 of the 5 free Razor blades...</li>
            <li>A video I found very helpful on how to use a safety razor was http://youtu.be/2IuA8HGacJw</li>
            <li>Was a Mach 3 razor guy, but they price of their razor blades became too much for me.</li>
            <li>Did much research and settled on this razor.</li>
            <li>Zues haha,</li>
            <li>but really, it&#x27;s a razor that&#x27;ll make me pitch a sale for it.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>I could only shave comfortably with a cartridge razor about once a week.</li>
            <li>The quality of this razor really assists in the transition.  </li>
            <li>I change my blade every monday morning although I think I could run them much longer.  </li>
            <li>Works very well (Although I would have prefered one a bit longer).&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I gave wet shaving a try after not being able to stomach the disposable cartridge price at Costco.  </li>
            <li>The weight feels really well in my hand.</li>
            <li>Settled on this safety razor after much searching.</li>
            <li>Taking your time to get a smooth shave is essential to getting a shave as close as the multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li>My aged sun-damaged skin is in better shape than it has been in years.</li>
            <li>Nice and heavy</li>
            <li>The Merkur is a more aggressive razor then the old Gillette razors you might purchase on eBay or elsewhere -- but not one that needs to scare someone just starting out.</li>
            <li>(Fair Warning: unless you&#x27;re a regular wet shaver, don&#x27;t start out with Feather blades -- work up to them.)    </li>
            <li>This is going to be the last razor I own, and I&#x27;ll be passing it along to my younger generations.  </li>
            <li>Yours may or may not have this specific brand of blade packed with it, but it is nice to start off with a couple different brands of blades for you to try on your skin; blades do matter, and I would recommend trying</li>
            <li>Since this was kind of a trial I decided not to order a traditional kit and opted to continue using canned cream with extra moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I did purchase a badger brush to lather my face, and I make sure to shave after I shower so the hair is as soft as possible.</li>
            <li>Sometimes going back to the old days isn&#x27;t better.</li>
            <li>So far my favorite pairing with this is the Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Silver Blue</li>
            <li>In the winter there’s just something comforting about the feel of warm heavy metal on your face</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I feel the blade has at least as much to do with a good shave as the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a rounder face and was worried the short blade wold make it harder to shave but on the contrary it allows for good control of the blade.</li>
            <li>This razor is by far, my favorite razor, it&#x27;s my second Safety Razor</li>
            <li>I love this razor and it is a definite improvement over my old mach 3, plus replacement blades are a hell of a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>So before you run out and buy more cartridges for your old standby, pick a double edge razor and give it a shot.</li>
            <li>razor has a good weight to it and the shorter handle makes it easier (at least for me) to shave.  </li>
            <li>Nice and heavy.</li>
            <li>Far better than the USMC issue safety razor I remember from Parris Island back in 83.</li>
            <li>and I will likely purchase a badger hair brush, good shaving cream and change to a sharper blade from my variety pack (probably Feather) in the near future to assist the process.  </li>
            <li>Nice, heavy feel razor.  </li>
            <li>You have to be willing to slow down, learn, and experiment to get the best results.</li>
            <li>Be sure to try out various blades to see which one is right for you as they are not all created equal</li>
            <li>I see it in the same way that a groundskeeper might handle a big area: you use the tractor mower to do the large acreages, the little riding mower to do the intermediate work, and the hand-held weed whip to do the detail work: no one machine is perfect for the entire job, but in combination you get the job done quickly and cheaply.     </li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>Try using plain old shaving soap &amp; a brush, &amp; get a good lather.</li>
            <li>It takes about the same amount of time and I very rarely nick myself.</li>
            <li>It was a much bigger investment but for me it was very worth it.</li>
            <li>The heft is perfect and the short handle is just right for shaving down across the jaw bone as a longer handle could require me to bend my neck back to less comfortable angles to give clearance.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin or are not familiar with this type of razor and know exactly how to use it, then perhaps a different type of razor would be more appropriate for you.  </li>
            <li>My problem area is under the nose, and although the Merkur doesn&#x27;t shave that spot as economically as the Fusion precision blade, it works far better than any other solution I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>The first time you use that soap with your new razor you will think you came out of a barber shop with that smell and close shave    </li>
            <li>This was the first I bought new</li>
            <li>Yea it might cost a little bit more in the beginning, but this razor gives me a better shave and it is going to save so much money in the long run.  </li>
            <li>Part of it is technique, but the other part is absolutely the lack of better shaving tools and lotions that I now have.</li>
            <li>So I originally started shaving with a safety razor using the flawed Edwin Jagger DE89 because I heard good things about it as well</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted a razor with a short or long handle, but am glad I went with this one with a short handle.</li>
            <li>when compared to holding most modern cartridge razors it feels like there just isn&#x27;t enough space available for my average sized hands.</li>
            <li>I chose Derby blades (rated a 1) because my whiskers are fine, and because blades rated 1 are more forgiving (less likely to cut yourself).  </li>
            <li>Much better than any other razors with double/triple/quad edges.  </li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve shaved with the Gillette Fusion something or other and figured I&#x27;d never find a better shave.</li>
            <li>Despite having all those other razors, more often than not, I use this one.</li>
            <li>Outstanding razor and exceptionally sharp.</li>
            <li>After the first pass I actually checked the mirror to make sure it&#x27;d actually shaved me.</li>
            <li>Better than the other aggressive slant.</li>
            <li>have no experience with other Safety razors, but this is hands-down better than the 4-blade cartridge I was using before.</li>
            <li>see other reviews for more details.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the first blade more than five times (I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s advisable, but it&#x27;s my first safety razor, so what</li>
            <li>and I find I am using more pressure then on other safety razors I use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this to many of my other friends, some of whom are considering trying it too.</li>
            <li>but I am pretty sure this is going to be a permanent change and never look back at cartridge shaving again, especially once you consider the continuing costs involved with both.  </li>
            <li>was looking for a better alternative to shaving due to razor</li>
            <li>Takes me an extra 30 seconds over a disposable safety razor (a hair slower under the nose) but totally worth what I save not having to buy fusion pro glide blades!</li>
            <li>The single blades are super economical.  </li>
            <li>I am shave daily because I work in a professional environment, and it&#x27;s important how comfortable the shaves are because I certainly feel it, and razor burn and nicks affect the following</li>
            <li>bought for my husband who is an experienced shaver with the old style razors-he loved the weight of it, but after using it a while said a longer one would be better, and it is a little difficult to use due to the length of it..</li>
            <li>But since it is somewhat larger and clumsier than a disposable, I still keep my disposable at hand to clean up in and around my lips, nose, ears, and adam s apple.</li>
            <li>With the Merkur a 3rd pass is just for clean up.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>but you do need to be more careful compared to the normal cartridge razors to not nick yourself.</li>
            <li>it shaves great, far less irritation than the slant bar but equally as close.</li>
            <li>Clean shaves are a must daily</li>
            <li>I was scared that I would be carving up my face with a saftey razor, but as long as you&#x27;re patient you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Overall great razor though be warned it is quite small in size.</li>
            <li>The one razor was decent, but I really had to work to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I found this razor simple to use and to clean</li>
            <li>Quick and professional service, I&#x27;m excited to do business with these people again in the near future.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to make the switch to single blades, this razor will go easy on you while delivering a world-class shave.</li>
            <li>There definitely is a bit of a learning curve, but the whole process was surprisingly intuitive, especially if you read a blog or two about proper shaving technique.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried Dollar Shave Club, Henry&#x27;s, a straight razor (for the high maintenance shaver), and then on a whim decided to try a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will take less time with practice, and will save money on blades in the long term, so the investment was very worthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful, seriously substantial feeling in your hand, and the blades are very inexpensive, especially when bought in a pack of 100.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, this is a great razor to get you into the game.  </li>
            <li>You can get outstanding help if you are new to wet shaving on YouTube at &amp;#34;Paulshaves&amp;#34; too.</li>
            <li>Once I got the skills right and with combination of this cute small well built DE razor and blades ( I use both Personna and Feather) - shaving is not a chore.</li>
            <li>I definitely made the right choice in razor selection!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Takes up very little space and looks nice sitting on counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Takes up very little space and looks nice sitting on counter.    </li>
            <li>using one of these takes a little longer than more modern cartridge razors, but the shave is smoother...and so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>The three inch short handle really enhances my shaving experience tremendously.</li>
            <li>After that, apply something like Aveeno or a natural cream that doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance or alcohol(I just used Lubriderm daily moisture) and let that soak in(if you have a non-alcoholic after shave,its the time to use it).Finally,put something on that&#x27;s loose(boxers,soft panties) and made of cotton to prevent</li>
            <li>BUT the razor is only half of the battle, if you combine this razor with a good brush and shaving soap you will notice a difference.</li>
            <li>Why had men switched from such a sensible, elegant, and ultimately cheaper method of shaving towards ever more gimmicky and increasingly less effective disposable razors?</li>
            <li>This new, made to look classic, looks great but works poorly.</li>
            <li>At 24 cents a blade, that translates to huge long term savings.</li>
            <li>I bought the long handle, which I enjoy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a short razor, and I think it would be easier to follow old angles learned from disposables with a long handled razor, but being that this is a double edge, it may be good to start fresh.</li>
            <li>Wet shaving gives me fantastic shaves, and the variety of soaps available only add to the pleasure.</li>
            <li>and I find the blade loading/unloading simple although not as cool as the \\&quot;butterfly\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s short but has a good solid grip handle with a solid end grip.</li>
            <li>One video had the instructor shaving a five (5) day old beard, which by the way came off like a hot knife through butter.&lt;br /&gt;I summoned my courage and tried the DX razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep it short and sweet.</li>
            <li>I have some pretty sensitive areas on my neck, but using this razor has been a blessing.  </li>
            <li>After realizing that it wasn&#x27;t that hard to do and gave me a good shave without the razor bumps, ingrown hairs, and irritation of modern razors I decided it was time start fresh with a new razor that would last me years.</li>
            <li>Jumped head in first and no regrets!!!</li>
            <li>I normally use a Norelco rotary and then clean up with a disposable blade or possibly a cartridge like a Mach 3.</li>
            <li>I imainge I&#x27;ll be able to pass this razor down to my great-grandson 60 years from now.</li>
            <li>Most debate seemed to come down to this product and another from Edwin Jagger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I still have a pack of Feather blades to try but wanted to make sure my technique was down before trying those.  </li>
            <li>my favorite, hands down</li>
            <li>I will say this is a very early review as today was the first time I shaved using my new Merkur 34C HD DE razor.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it is a perfect little handle that shall last you for ages.</li>
            <li>Quality razor that gives a great shave in less time than my old Gillette and I will save $ in the long run.  </li>
            <li>The short handle takes a little adjustment, but the weight feel good.</li>
            <li>B01JB4UQ7C NEW!</li>
            <li>Incidentally, I have large hands and long fingers, the 34C was fine as the weight and non-slip knurled grip gave the feel of old world craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>I first got onto the single blade safety razor from an old cheap hand</li>
            <li>B002RJC1HC 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle &amp; Free Stand from Parker Safety Razor]]  -A mug to mix your lather  -And a few minutes of your time each morning    </li>
            <li>I tried all the \\&quot;new age\\&quot; razors that have very pricey replacement blades.</li>
            <li>I think alot of the modern and new razors are just to line the pockets of companies</li>
            <li>You want to take as much time as you need to pay attention to all the new sensations that guide the shaving process.</li>
            <li>Very forgiving for anyone new to DE shaving.</li>
            <li>As stated, I am new to this type of shaving, and I very seldom get cut.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind, I used to shave with straight razors, so I was somewhat familiar with shaving with a single blade.</li>
            <li>The shave it provides strikes me as middle-of-the-road with regard to aggressiveness, with some being more and some less.  </li>
            <li>The shave it provides strikes me as middle-of-the-road with regard to aggressiveness, with some being more and some less.  </li>
            <li>This shaves better, gives less no razor burn</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use with a careful technique.</li>
            <li>Better than what I previously used.</li>
            <li>I used my favorite brush and Jack Black Supreme Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following</li>
            <li>I wanted something that would give me a better shave, with less irritation.</li>
            <li>Cheaper, less irritation, better for your skin and for the environment...</li>
            <li>less is more.</li>
            <li>Seems to cut better if I loosen the blade slightly.</li>
            <li>But there are better options for less.</li>
            <li>I felt a lot better with this product then my previous razor.</li>
            <li>The Merkur seems to be less aggressive which is better for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To spending less time in the shower and more time in front of the mirror.</li>
            <li>Not as many nix as the week/s previous.</li>
            <li>Super solid, heavier than I expected, and easy to grip with that gnarled handle.</li>
            <li>buying this razor my main concern was which style should I get?</li>
            <li>In Conclusion,  You will not go wrong with this razor; I am sure that you will be glad you purchased</li>
            <li>The quality is such that it will last for many years if not forever.  </li>
            <li>- I used the Personna - Red from Israel - these are better than the Astra blades and double the price.   </li>
            <li>Get the 100 Shark Super Chrome Double Edge Safety Razor Blades to go along with it</li>
            <li>The classic.</li>
            <li>Classic.</li>
            <li>but I mainly now use Derby blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally bought one and stopped using regular shavers you buy in stores.</li>
            <li>Having purchased it on a whim as an alternative to the Gillette Super speed I&#x27;ve been using before now, I have gotten the chance to finally try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again be patient and it will soon be second nature like using the old, cheap multi blade</li>
            <li>This will give you a decent shave</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s built very solid, it has a good heavy feel in the hand.  </li>
            <li>and I have probably owned them all from the classic twin razor to the Mach 5 with a lubricating strip and vibrator</li>
            <li>For a fellow that shaves his head I went through cartridge razors fairly quickly, and while I replace these razors with the same regularity, they&#x27;re tons</li>
            <li>For a fellow that shaves his head I went through cartridge razors fairly quickly, and while I replace these razors with the same regularity, they&#x27;re tons</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any trouble producing good lathers, but in hindsight I think I would be happier with a smaller brush.</li>
            <li>A lot of reviewers and you tubers love this razor, even when compared to much more expensive options.</li>
            <li>curve).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a pack of 25 different blade types, so it is highly possible I will find a blade that I get even better shaves</li>
            <li>Unlike a traditional razor like the Mach 3, a safety razor is designed for more than one pass in different directions.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only marginally better than the injector razor that I formerly used.</li>
            <li>I found that Gillette Silver Blue blades work especially well with it - better than the blade that comes with it.</li>
            <li>But the electric shaver just can&#x27;t handle stubble older than 2 to 3 days</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re probably here because you&#x27;ve got some interest in trying a classic shave.</li>
            <li>The shorter handle actually allows for better control and movement (because there isn&#x27;t a lot of extra handle to deal&lt;br</li>
            <li>Classic look and feel.  </li>
            <li>several YouTube videos on how to use a DE razor and luckily haven&#x27;t nicked myself yet.  </li>
            <li>This was the main reason why I bought the Merkur 34C.</li>
            <li>I thought to myself, this is a proper and well-made tool and worthy of respect.  </li>
            <li>The gap is bigger and open comb is better.</li>
            <li>I wish that I had known about this particular brand of razor 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>Feels like it will last forever, just the opposite of most things in our disposable society.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s main competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor is heralded as a classic for a reason.</li>
            <li>I was initially concerned about the length of the handle, but those worries went away quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never go back to any other form of shaving, using a safety razor is one of the most relaxing things I&#x27;ve been able to do in a long time.</li>
            <li>The blades drop onto the pegs with alacrity and when the head is screwed down it lines up precisely and consistently every time.</li>
            <li>Single edge razors are really cheap.  </li>
            <li>After sampling a few of the brands I found that Derby suits me well and is a perfect combination of not being too dull where you will get resistance shaving and not being too sharp where you will cut yourself easily.  </li>
            <li>Overall, double edge shaving takes a little more time than cartridges but it&#x27;s cheaper and better for the environment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go splurging like I normally do for a more expensive model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go splurging like I normally do for a more expensive model.</li>
            <li>Due to the vagaries of shipping times, I actually received all my shave accessories before the razor arrived, so I had a chance to experience wet shaving with a Gillette Mach 3, good shave soap, and adequate face preparation before my Merkur razor arrived, and then compare the two.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a lot of other razors that I use from time to time -- including super speeds, adjustables, fat boys and tiny Gillette travel razors -- some more than 50 years old.</li>
            <li>Best shaves only require a single sharp blade and proper preparation.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to go from the typical double/triple blade razors sold at CVS etc to this Merkur.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the switch from cartridges.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>also highly recommend using an alum bar after you shave.</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t fault the seller (no promises having been made), the Dorco blades have been highly unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s high marks and praise from users.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>watched videos, done some reading, bought some high quality products......  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>High quality steel and finish.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this safety razor to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it, but I would also warn that shaving with a DE razor can be tricky.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for a beginner.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind a shorter handle razor, I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest trying anything else and seeing how it works for you.  </li>
            <li>purchased another highly rated razor just to compare.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Merkur.</li>
            <li>Blades are about $10ish dollars for a high quality 100 pack.  </li>
            <li>However I would highly recommend this to someone who is unsure of how to shave with a DE.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>what I&#x27;ve inspected of the build quality and everything, it isn&#x27;t over-priced, you are getting a high quality Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had peach fuzz all through high school</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>Unlike Feather, Merkur blades do not come highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product quite highly.</li>
            <li>so I started looking into buying a cartridge razor, but found the price of replacement cartridges rather high.  </li>
            <li>It is a high quality, durable, long-lasting razor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>workmanship, definitely a high end product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>High build quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Something highly recommended for a newbie, as well as the book &amp;#34;Gourmet Shaving.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor to anyone wishing to enter the art of shaving.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this if you are thinking of the switch.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for beginners.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for learning how to shave with a DE.</li>
            <li>So I bought this highly crafted razor like my Father used.</li>
            <li>Our fathers and grandfathers and further back passed tradition on as well and many of them shaved with a DE or a straight edge but with the advent of the cartridge razor the tradition has nearly died out.</li>
            <li>Our fathers and grandfathers and further back passed tradition on as well and many of them shaved with a DE or a straight edge but with the advent of the cartridge razor the tradition has nearly died out.</li>
            <li>Same great Merkur razor for a lot less than our local retailers were offering.</li>
            <li>Second, this razor is heavy, which admittedly provides a more aggressive shave than the super speed I used to use, but newer users should be cautious of applying pressure to this</li>
            <li>Its a razor blade guys, just be careful and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>Many passes needed.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes one little hair would have to be passed over 10 times.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which makes it a little more aggressive than the 34c.</li>
            <li>However, unlike the cartridge razor, the wet shaver can try a different brand of razor blade (you might be surprised to see how many are out there!)</li>
            <li>Also, being a two-piece, a little more care needs to be taken when handling/changing blades.  </li>
            <li>It forces you to take a little more time but</li>
            <li>Look around a little while and you&#x27;ll learn that this Merkur is top notch in the world of DE shaving.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>The closeness of the shave could be a little better.</li>
            <li>It does take a little more time shaving but it is a pleasure to do so.</li>
            <li>I find you need to spend a little more time</li>
            <li>You have to use a little more technique with any DE razor</li>
            <li>Though I admit it is a little more work</li>
            <li>This is a professional instrument and makes my 16-blade plastic-clad supermarket razor look like a toy (although it most certainly is not a toy; kids, don&#x27;t play with razors!).</li>
            <li>/&gt;DE technique is easy to learn due to the design</li>
            <li>offer a effortless shave  DE technique is easy to learn due to the design  </li>
            <li>The handle and weight make it easy to spin to use the other side.</li>
            <li>My first round has been with Merkur blades, and I&#x27;m about to experiment with other brands, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have a goof here and there, but overall I love the feel of the razor, the quality, the look, etc.  </li>
            <li>I decided to buy another razor and chose the Merkur 34C due to its strong reputation--basically being the state of the art in DE razors.  </li>
            <li>After a few strokes, it very quickly becomes intuitive, and you just know what inputs into the razor will give you that positive feedback.</li>
            <li>When you consider how cheap and easy it is to replace blades, which last for a month easy, this razor will make you feel silly for not making the move years ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild and safe and the cuts I would inflict on myself were from me not being careful where I had sharply raised blemishes on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relatively new to classic shaving, but I have to say</li>
            <li>your time with learning this classic way of shaving and do a your research if you are new at it.</li>
            <li>it is a great blade but expensive.   </li>
            <li>They really should issue a Merkur razor to young men as they enter puberty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I was wrong.</li>
            <li>Aside from that it&#x27;s a great investment over expensive cartridge based systems</li>
            <li>By the way, I clean and dry my razor and blade after each use; it looks like the day I bought it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working very well for me so far</li>
            <li>My shaves are much closer than my old Mach 5</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I came across the old school double-edge razor and the whole wet-shaving enthusiasts.  </li>
            <li>So far i really like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, I was surprised how much of a difference the pre-shave scrub and post shave lotion made.</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of it, it is not slow</li>
            <li>I really had no trouble adjusting and look forward to every shave.</li>
            <li>but the razor really needed to be professionally re-plated</li>
            <li>It comes with green tea and oatmeal, and I love how it smells and how my face feels after I apply this.</li>
            <li>Yours may or may not have this specific brand of blade packed with it, but it is nice to start off with a couple different brands of blades for you to try on your skin; blades do matter, and I would recommend trying several.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now, and love it.  </li>
            <li>I considered getting the long handled version because it was more like what I was used to, but this feels really solid in my hand</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and will last you a lifetime.</li>
            <li>and that last pass will be as gentle as the first.</li>
            <li>I used normal barbasol and nothing else</li>
            <li>is normal, but for the region we are working in this will be enforced a bit more}.Saying</li>
            <li>Only on rare occasions will you need to go against the grain.  </li>
            <li>The cheapest one gives me a better shave than this was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li>Been using this razor for a few months now and just love it.  </li>
            <li>It will definitely save money in the long run, and it turns shaving into an enjoyable ritual instead a hassle.</li>
            <li>So my buddy who is italian and pretty much a beard afficinado recommended the Merkur 34c to</li>
            <li>No nicks, closer shave, and most importantly, no irritation.</li>
            <li>find myself shaving a bit more often than I did with the multi-blade razors I used to waste my money on, but that&#x27;s no problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but of normal sized hands i guess of someone who is 6&#x27;3.</li>
            <li>I tried the blade that came with the razor at first and didn&#x27;t really like it and actually started to doubt about my decision.  </li>
            <li>I just love how if I dont shave a few days</li>
            <li>This is such a good close shave and in my opinion it is not challenging at all.  </li>
            <li>I rarely knick myself and I do my entire head and neck.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first double edge razor so I will say that it is not as close a shave as modern multi-blade types.</li>
            <li>but if you want a normal size length razor then get the longer version of this.</li>
            <li>Not to big and not to small a good normal size</li>
            <li>what I normally use with my multi-blade) and nicked myself a a lot.</li>
            <li>love coming across products that are built to last; and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this is the last razor I ever buy.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing about the electric is it is so fast and easy, but it comes nowhere close to even a disposable blade shave and within a few hours I have a pretty serious stubble going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normal shave really takes no longer than the old disposable, is closer and way cheaper once you have the set-up.  </li>
            <li>This razor has been reviewed with very positive user experiences and my experience confirm the public reviews are correct.</li>
            <li>Other than that it does fine.</li>
            <li>, if you&#x27;re new to double edge razors, there&#x27;s a sample pack which is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny, especially for a new DE user.</li>
            <li>After a few practice shaves, my shaves are just as fast and easy, with NO razor burn at all.</li>
            <li>I have had far less cuts and razor burn when using this razor, and it produces much better</li>
            <li>100 double edge blades for $22.00 right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>just got fed up with razor burn from cartridge razors - I would constantly break-out on the right side of my neck.</li>
            <li>but Personna Double Edge Razor Blades seem just right for my face</li>
            <li>It has enough weight that it gets through the toughest stubble and is just the right length to alter your grip when shaving on either side of your face.</li>
            <li>When you get the right lather, a blade that works for you, and a proper DE razor, you won&#x27;t even feel that you are shaving.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of the high price at first, but upon seeing and feeling the quality of the product I&#x27;m sure that it was worth it.</li>
            <li>It is heavy and well-made, with a simple two-piece design that makes changing razor blades quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned that some reviews said the handle was too short, but I find I hold it with my thumb and first 2 fingers rather than gripping it in my palm.</li>
            <li>Being a multi blade cartridge guys for the first couple years of my shaving &amp;#34;career&amp;#34; I was a little worried about getting cut, shaving causing more break outs and ultimately cost.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving my back hair (yes girls hate it) with cartridge/disposables using the awesome and simple and elegant</li>
            <li>and although I use hot water to warm up my brush, I now use cold water to shave because I felt hot water was opening my pores too much which increased irritation.  </li>
            <li>Maybe people with very large hands would prefer the longer handle version, but for me this has been working quitewell for the last 6 weeks or so that I&#x27;ve had it</li>
            <li>I am a tall male (6&#x27;2&amp;#34;) with decent sized hands.</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave with very little irritation.</li>
            <li>but the blades are sharp and cheap    </li>
            <li>Yes it felt smooth if I ran my hand along the grain, but go the other way</li>
            <li>I have light beard growth and have been shaving with this every other day since I received it without any irritation.</li>
            <li>What was impressive, even on the first shave there was minimal cutting and bleeding.  </li>
            <li>thing takes a bit of practice (I highly recommend short strokes the first shave or two)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the Merkur blade that came with it - it cut me up a lot (though I was new to this, so maybe it was my fault).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new with safety razors and did&#x27;nt</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a relatively new convert to shaving with a double-edge razor, having been brought up on disposable cartridges.  </li>
            <li>My new razor of choice?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relatively new to DE shaving, but I can tell you this, after having this razor,  </li>
            <li>For new people who are wanting to try this: I shave once a day, every day.</li>
            <li>My  go-to razor when I&#x27;m trying anything new (blades, creams, soaps, etc....)</li>
            <li>Moving into a new job that required me to stay</li>
            <li>and I am getting a smoother shave with a new blade every 10 day.</li>
            <li>hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Every new blade is like a new razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Every new blade is like a new razor.  </li>
            <li>but this new one I cannot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to shaving this way , I used to use Mac 3 .</li>
            <li>I bought my wife a brand new car for the summer and in return she bought me this razor.</li>
            <li>You read that right...a new multi-blade razor drags and pulls like shaving with sandpaper.</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried using a new system and feared that I&#x27;d knick and cut my self to shreds.  </li>
            <li>so new shaver beware - let the weight of the razor do the work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m new to this style of razor,</li>
            <li>The Merkur still looks like it is brand new</li>
            <li>The razor still looks brand new</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably try another brand when I have to get a new one.</li>
            <li>I received this razor in new condition</li>
            <li>Live and learn I guess.</li>
            <li>I also just like putting a new blade in and going,</li>
            <li>DE razor for someone new to this style of shaving.</li>
            <li>they also promised a new blade that didn&#x27;t come with it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who whats a quality razor to start out a new shaving addiction.</li>
            <li>Rinsing it off after every use has kept it looking new.</li>
            <li>I could live with it but decided to try another Merkur as the 34c</li>
            <li>Decided I wanted a new one</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this new</li>
            <li>I needed a new razor that would not irritate my skin...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to DE shaving</li>
            <li>and I do have to pay attention which I never did when I shaved with a new Gillette, but i get fewer ingrown hairs, and almost never get any razor burn like I did with that thing</li>
            <li>It could still pass for brand new.</li>
            <li>so I compared it with my new Merkur using Derby blades.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to keep a good grip on this short handle for that area.</li>
            <li>Their blades are not super sharp but this was good for me to start on and they still do well.</li>
            <li>The blade replaces easily and costs less than one-tenth of a gillette proglide replacement cartridge.</li>
            <li>In no time you will be enjoying and looking forward to your next wet shave.</li>
            <li>Maybe someday I&#x27;ll try the expensive stuff from Taylor of Old Bond Street and the like, but for now I&#x27;m happy with this Nivea cream.</li>
            <li>Shaving is not as easy, and the size of the shaving head makes it more difficult to see when near sideburns or underneath my nose.</li>
            <li>The only downside to this (unavoidably) is that it really does take time to learn how to use this properly and quickly.</li>
            <li>Nice heavy double edge handle.  </li>
            <li>I finally began to enjoy the entire process of shaving.</li>
            <li>Its weight and size encourages you to be gentle with the blade and produces a very close shave at the same time.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as smooth as the 38C , though the 34C&#x27;s blade gap should be bigger than my earlier 38C&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The single most important rule is to go slow.  </li>
            <li>Modern and new doesn&#x27;t always mean better</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It has a lot of weight to it, and feels very natural.</li>
            <li>skin is also very sensitive as well, so shaving with cartridge razors would always result in razor bumps and burn.  </li>
            <li>skin is also very sensitive as well, so shaving with cartridge razors would always result in razor bumps and burn.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high in glycerin, so it holds lots of water and leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Had used high quality, multi-blade razors, the Merkur far surpasses all of these.</li>
            <li>Very professional and well built.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for people with​ sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Some say you shouldn&#x27;t buy feather blades if you are new to double edge shaving, but I used them as my first blades and haven&#x27;t cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new into DE razors, so this is my first and only DE razor</li>
            <li>It seems expensive initially, but with the amount you save on razors (including the very tangible benefit of changing your blades more regularly because they&#x27;re so cheap), I&#x27;d say the outlay is well worth it.</li>
            <li>As far as blades are concerned, I purchased a 5-pack at my local drug store for $1.00 (that&#x27;s right, $1.00).</li>
            <li>so everyone saying it doesn&#x27;t give a good shave you clearly dont know how to use a safety razor or you aren&#x27;t that smart sorry</li>
            <li>After nearly a dozen shaves, this little fella is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>Just started shaving with a double edge, and this was my first razor.</li>
            <li>Blades I&#x27;ve used and like include Crystals, Derby Extras, and the pretty much universally recognized sharpest blades made: Feathers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first Double Edge Razor (safety razor).  </li>
            <li>how many nicks I&#x27;ve gotten in the past month if that gives you an idea.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The razor looks exactly the same as when I bought it, no rust, no signs of wear.</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really small</li>
            <li>Bear in mind, however, that I go through a 20-30 minute process every time, and it involves in-shower facial exfoliation, hot towels, glycerine shaving soap, brush, pre-shave oil, three razor passes and balm</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used the razor, I knew I&#x27;d never go back.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about the Merkur is how solid it is.</li>
            <li>WOW, what a difference!</li>
            <li>Surly, the only thing that disposables razors like the Mach 3 and Schick Quattro have going for them is that they&#x27;re able to automatically contour to every pivot of your face; the learning curve of shaving with the 34C or probably any other safety razor depends on the person but it may take you about 8 to 10 shaves to start getting baby faced smoothness.</li>
            <li>Having decided to go the double edge route I researched to find the best &#x27;starter&#x27; razor that would last and perform without fail.</li>
            <li>Just one thing as you shave since it has a slick top</li>
            <li>Because of this, I notice a few more nicks than the average user (or than I did with the Weishi), but when I get a chance to shave in soft water, the improvement is significant.  </li>
            <li>It is my first safety razor, and I can&#x27;t imagine switching back anytime soon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are other types of blades, and look forward to trying those out in the future.  </li>
            <li>My first double edge razor.</li>
            <li>This is my first double edge razor.</li>
            <li>For me it is about a week before needing a change - but it is significantly cheaper than any of the other disposable or multi-blade options.  </li>
            <li>If this is your first and only razor that you have used.  </li>
            <li>It is my first experience using a double edge razor</li>
            <li>First, this razor is relatively short, so large-handed users or those who prefer a longer razor should consider the 38C instead.</li>
            <li>This Merkur is the second I&#x27;ve owned (first one from another manufacturer fell apart...</li>
            <li>My first double edged razor.</li>
            <li>Far better than shaving with cheap disposables or expensive electric razors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure plain and simple and healthy.</li>
            <li>where I know I&#x27;m sensitive, so I did about as well there as I normally do.</li>
            <li>I have been using a badger brush from frank shaving, and the taylor of old bond st sandalwood cream, what a delight!</li>
            <li>First time using a DE razor, and it has taken some adjustment, but definitely like the razor.</li>
            <li>Yes, the handle is shorter than a typical disposable, but that&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>and I said WOW!</li>
            <li>I realize that I shouldn&#x27;t go for complete removal, but compared to the cartridge razor, I have to do at least 3 passes or more to achieve a real close shave.  </li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor after using disposable blade razors my entire life.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am an African American male who, like many others, has had to deal with razor bump issues.</li>
            <li>This is my first double edge razor.  </li>
            <li>Now I know where that extra money went;)  </li>
            <li>This is my first double edge razor.</li>
            <li>This is my first double edge razor.</li>
            <li>Tell P&amp;G to stick it and go old school!</li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant to use a different technology at first</li>
            <li>Excellent piece of hardware, though I found the handle to be too short and uncomfortable to shave with, especially compared to the Gillette Fusion I had been using.</li>
            <li>My beard comes in pretty coarse</li>
            <li>I already use the Merkur Futur Gold (probably the most... or second most expensive Merkur).  </li>
            <li>This is my first time trying out a double edge and after a lot of online reading I decided to get the 34c.</li>
            <li>I am 6&#x27;2\\&quot; and have pretty big hands.</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow!</li>
            <li>I do 2 passes, the first across the grain and the second against the grain.</li>
            <li>First time I have ever used a double edge safety razor and I am sold.</li>
            <li>The irritation of the cartridge razors is a thing of the past and to top it all off</li>
            <li>For a moment while shaving for the first time, I thought that the razor did not work; I didn&#x27;t feel a thing, i.e. there was no &amp;#34;tug or pull&amp;#34; of the DE blade on your facial hair.</li>
            <li>for the razor functioning itself, this is my first foray into double edged razors.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a double edge razor</li>
            <li>Initially I was interested because of the rising cost of easier shaves.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every article on wetshaving recommends this as a first razor, and I agree entirely.  </li>
            <li>I shave with the grain first pass, against the grain second pass</li>
            <li>Once I switched to shaving with a double edge razor, my skin was clearer after first use.</li>
            <li>Had it the next day for my first shave.</li>
            <li>The handle on this model is only about 3\\&quot; from the head of the razor, but it still does exactly what is supposed to.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it would make it more stable, but the lighter weight is noted and not preferred.  </li>
            <li>Try other blades if you order this razor and take the time to learn the techniques required to use this tool properly and you will be rewarded with a better shave than with one of those multi-bladed jobs.</li>
            <li>For a close shave, I will do two passes, the first with the grain and second against.  </li>
            <li>initially (being used to disposable razors), but decided the original design involved a short handle for a reason.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to any guy who&#x27;s tired of being reamed by those disposable cartridge rip-offs and who really wants a superior shave.</li>
            <li>but I never really used it full time.  </li>
            <li>This particular model has been considered a standard, and reputable for being of the highest quality and long lasting.</li>
            <li>This clears easily by dunking into the sink with little effort.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and only requires double-edge razors as replacements (which are much much cheaper than conventional 4 or 5 blade replacements).</li>
            <li>At 51 yrs old I discovered the wonder of the old classic double-edged (DE) razor.</li>
            <li>Very simple to use and clean I like it even though I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and sanitize for for those who have probems with skin infections and acne;  just disassemble and place in alcohol, or just dip the head of the razor in a small jar of alcohol, then let dry on you</li>
            <li>A little too small for my liking, nonetheless works great.</li>
            <li>Imagine my delight when I didn&#x27;t get a single nick during my first shave!</li>
            <li>I love this item, I get very harsh ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>clean the razor with a little antibacterial soap and a cheap toothbrush after every shave (being careful around the blades).</li>
            <li>I will admit I do not love it nearly as much as some others who describe their new shaving ritual as calming or therapeutic though I do enjoy it far more than I ever have shaving in the past.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and produces a very slick lather.</li>
            <li>look forward to learning more about other old school units and further my shaving education.  </li>
            <li>This old fashion shaving is getting new life for me.  </li>
            <li>far I can get four or five shaves from a blade and change when it begins to feel like I was using a NEW multi-blade razor.  </li>
            <li>I waiting a very long time before buying this razor and it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I have never used one before, but with a few strokes it was easy to pick up.  </li>
            <li>I quickly realized that I couldn&#x27;t drag the razor like I had before with the Gillette fusion.</li>
            <li>Not near as good as the Gillette Fusion at least for me.  </li>
            <li>Once I feel confident in the process and have mastered it, I look forward to stepping it up and possible passing this one down to my son.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to get one like the Merkur where the entire head clamps down on the blade.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the older razors work fine but need a really sharp blade to totally get the job done.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the short handle dissuade you - a short handle gives better control than a long one.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a problem shaving with it, but it actually looks funny its so short.  </li>
            <li>Everything they do say about DE shaving is true though - there is zero tugging or pulling and its miles ahead other shavers.  </li>
            <li>The handle is shorter than most of todays modern multiblade-headed razors which unlike DE (double edge) razors usually also have a floating head.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you are tired of cartridge systems and are willing to spend 1 minute more every day shaving (due to the fact that you need to be more careful).</li>
            <li>I really enjoy shaving with my new Merkur Heavy Duty.</li>
            <li>In essence this was a \\&quot;last resort\\&quot; in an attempt to get that close shave that lasted more than half a day and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling</li>
            <li>above lips better than typical cartridge razors.  </li>
            <li>When I used a disposable super expensive razor like the Gillette Fusion Proglide, I would get razors burn and as a results many bumps on my neck.</li>
            <li>Also I quickly got used to the short handle and actually like it now.</li>
            <li>I had only saved with multi-blade disposable razors, but have quickly made the switch and will not be going back.</li>
            <li>, this razor is quite steep investment and at $44 it is one of the more expensive ones in its class, but once you start factoring in long-term maintenance costs -- ie, replacement blades -- this razor quickly pays off.  </li>
            <li>I just plug in a sensor excel razor, cheap, no special razors,</li>
            <li>Sadly, even a normal blade feels better and closer with the right soap.  </li>
            <li>All in all this razor works just fine on his heavy beard, but he said he misses the adjustable angle of the Futur.</li>
            <li>All parts are heavy, all metal, and finely machined.  </li>
            <li>The construction is extremely sturdy, the razor looks to be very well made and you can tell that the Germans really took their time building this thing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s plain to see why this is a classic safety razor -- the perfectly-weighted handle is short enough to make it easy to control while generating enough pressure to support a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>These are my results, yours will almost certainly differ, and be equally valid.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I knew that if I ran the blades across my face, at a certain angle, I would definitely end up with ingrown</li>
            <li>I certainly recommend it if you&#x27;re just starting out.  </li>
            <li>This is largely me being very critical-</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy the little whiffs of scent throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>It is probably about a medium aggressiveness, and so it gives a smooth shave with little to no discomfort.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(oh gods does that sound naughty!).  </li>
            <li>If you are new to wet shaving (as opposed to cartridge shaving), then you have to decide if you are willing to learn a new skill.</li>
            <li>There is a slightly larger gap between the blade and safety rail, which allows the user to get a little closer but requires more precision.  </li>
            <li>Some people were saying that the longer handle Merkur was hard to maneuver while shaving the face and that it was intended more for shaving legs etcetera.</li>
            <li>I pair it with a super sharp blade, (Feather) and I get close shaves without carving my face up.</li>
            <li>If equipped with a super sharp blade like a feather, you must take your time.</li>
            <li>Outstanding safety razor that would be hard to improve upon.</li>
            <li>Hard not to be pleased...</li>
            <li>Blades are usually dirt cheap even for high quality ones.</li>
            <li>One factor that should benefit longevity is that this razor is solid stainless steel (from Solingen, Germany no less!)</li>
            <li>decided to purchase this razor after 3 weeks of research into wet shaving and in all honesty with much reluctance to try something that held a razor capable of leaving you in need of stitches.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been intentionally neglecting shaving since Amazon emailed me that it had shipped, so I had quite clear cut forest look going on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using various cartridge razors my whole adult life.</li>
            <li>For me, the Merkur with Feather blades was the clear winner.  </li>
            <li>I recently decided to give DE shaving a try while I was semi happy with &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; razor closeness and over effect the cost seemed silly to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a fairly mild razor, mild enough to shave with it daily without irritation; but open enough and with enough blade exposure and clearance to easily tackle a few days of growth.  </li>
            <li>Clearly used and returned.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and the merkur blades left my skin very irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Forget about your old style of shaving.</li>
            <li>and I smell likea barber shop (although not overpowering at all, my wife can&#x27;t tell) and shaving old school like my grandpa is just a bonus</li>
            <li>21 year old that has been using disposable razors from Costco since I started shaving.</li>
            <li>I just used thee old shaving foam</li>
            <li>Head is as far as I can tell the same as the regular entry-level Merkur (which I also bought for comparison), so whether you buy this or stick with the $29 entry-level &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; should depend on how important (a) 2-piece vs. 3-piece is to you, and (b) whether you like the short handle or not.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Micro Touch One with the included Dorco blades before I got this one, and soon realized that although I could tell Double Edge shaving was the way to go- after blowing too much money on Fusion blades-</li>
            <li>I have a fairly coarse beard that grows fast.  </li>
            <li>(In fact, I have no doubt that it&#x27;ll work far longer than just my lifetime.)    </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be MUCH happier if you force yourself to use fingertips only; the shorter handle encourages this.    </li>
            <li>My complete shaving set consisting of this razor, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>B002JW8S6K Bloc Osma Natural Alum Block]], [[ASIN:B000RI8BZQ Proraso Shaving Cream 5.2 oz (147 g)]], and</li>
            <li>This is similar to the price of two bulk-packs of Mach 3 refills from Costco, so don&#x27;t agonize too much.</li>
            <li>I am 35 years old</li>
            <li>and I used to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; using a electric trimmer because my skin is so sensitive that I couldn&#x27;t use any blades.</li>
            <li>All Natural Shaving Oil</li>
            <li>- I used the Kai Stainless Steel Double Edge Razor Blades from Japan-</li>
            <li>Not so much a disposable personal care item,</li>
            <li>A gentle hand is clearly necessary.  </li>
            <li>I, personally, have to use the lubricant oil or this gets to be a bit much for me.</li>
            <li>I NEVER had that from the old razors.    </li>
            <li>My father had what I call an old fashion double-sided razor</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably operator error, but it was getting old, man.  </li>
            <li>If your current shaving situation leaves you feeling less-than-satisfied as mine did, then you absolutely won&#x27;t regret picking one of these up.</li>
            <li>The result: nearly BBS shave with no blood or no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still go back to Straight Razor shaving</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still go back to Straight Razor shaving</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, I was a sucker too.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s an old expression: if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li>Freakin&#x27; old school.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seems to be enough to affect the quality of the shave, but when paying this much for a razor, I think it should be built</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no school like the old school</li>
            <li>So far, it does not disappoint.</li>
            <li>Solid and very well built.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I have used both the blades so far.</li>
            <li>it tends to get dried out and the blade does not flow smoothly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as using the razor, there is a learning curve to it.</li>
            <li>Then one day I thought of the old G.I. Joe razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll wait until we move to a soft water home to judge what is supposedly the sharpest blade on the market.  </li>
            <li>Much like getting a straight edge shave, the shave did not seem as close as I thought it should be, however, it seems to take longer for my facial hair to grow back.</li>
            <li>I fail to be overwhelmed by this razor and wet shaving, however, I am still using it and may become more pleased.  </li>
            <li>As far as a shaving soap or cream, some folks will say you need to buy fancy brushes and soap.</li>
            <li>I thought to myself, if I were to make the switch and since the cheap blades will pay for the actual razor over time I might as well purchase a more expensive Merkur.</li>
            <li>I am a novice at DE shaving ;I am 50 yrs old..</li>
            <li>I use a quality natural oil soap/creams that have  jojoba oil and  shea butter.</li>
            <li>Some dislike the short handle, but I found that, once I got used to it, I much preferred the shorter handle and the control it gave me over the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>and they were trying to get rid of a box of 20 year old Personna blades.</li>
            <li>Hold the razor at the very tip of the handle (opposite the head)and</li>
            <li>I used it this Merkur twice and it nearly ripped my face off.</li>
            <li>But the multi cartridge razor would leave my face so sensitive I would have to skip a day or two.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Merkur 34c and a tub of Taylor of old bond street sandalwood scent</li>
            <li>You may be surprised at what you find.</li>
            <li>It is very well built, I expect this will be the last razor I will ever have to buy as it is built</li>
            <li>I had old safety razors that worked well.  </li>
            <li>He decided to go retro and get the old school style razor for a closer shave than with disposables, and gets fewer ingrown hairs to boot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In closing dive in an try it its rather simple and not that much to get started in.</li>
            <li>A simple &amp;#34;twist &amp;#34; of the knob at the bottom of the razor will release the head for the blade change and you&#x27;re ready to shave.</li>
            <li>I am surprised about how well this works.  </li>
            <li>He says it is by far the closest shave he has ever had.</li>
            <li>and I am 50 yrs old.</li>
            <li>I decided to finally switch from the very well marketed cartridges to this safety razor.  </li>
            <li>Actual stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>Heavy, well finished, and precise blade release mechanism.</li>
            <li>but I prefer it to my old butterfly-opening razor because the blade angle at the edge provides a smoother shave.  </li>
            <li>My wife got this razor for me as an early father&#x27;s day gift.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve learned there&#x27;s a reason why the DE Safety razors where the only real choice for shaving for 100 years.  </li>
            <li>As the cost of replacement drug store brands has gone up dramatically he had been looking into the old school blades.</li>
            <li>far as the razor,my husband loves it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using Persona USA made blades with it (works well for my sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>: I used an Omega Professional (model 10049)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lather: I used Nivea Men Sensitive Shaving Cream, which comes in a 3.5oz tube.</li>
            <li>It often left me with lots of irritation and a reasonably close shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much heavier than your standard plastic Gillette or Schick.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have been prone to ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving with straight razors off/on for the last year or so.</li>
            <li>It has also reduced my shaving costs considerably.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving for nearly 20 years.</li>
            <li>So I grew to accept that shaving would just naturally involve a bit of discomfort.</li>
            <li>Think I&#x27;ll stick with my old reliable Gillette.</li>
            <li>I have been plagued with ingrown hairs and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is very well-made and will probably last for 30 years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been frequently bothered by ingrown hairs with the multi-blades razors, and haven&#x27;t yet (fingers crossed)</li>
            <li>Then I came across an online discussion regarding shaving and after a few minutes of search here and there, I was surprised to see that the old school shaving method that I used to use back when, has become the trend and is probably better for my skin (explained why I never had razor bumps before</li>
            <li>So far, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the selection.</li>
            <li>You can get a Maggard&#x27;s razor or a Parker 26c for cheaper and have a better, or at least equivalent razor.</li>
            <li>I am a 41 year old novice at DE shaving</li>
            <li>I use this combined with Feather blades, The Art of Shaving Lavender cream, a Parker silver tip badger brush, and finish with Nivea sensitive skin aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin always felt a bit inflamed and sensitive to the touch after using it, even with just 2 passes.</li>
            <li>Using the 34C with Personna reds and Nivea Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li>but after a few go&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve gotten comfortable with it.  </li>
            <li>I like the handle&#x27;s feel and action.  </li>
            <li>Now, I do feel like I get a closer shave than with the old mach 3, but it comes at the expense of adding a couple of minutes to my shave.</li>
            <li>I even like the Merkur razor blade included with the purchase, but razor blades are very subjective to the specific user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started shaving old school and bought this razor along with the soap,brush and stand.  </li>
            <li>I get a much closer shave despite the fact the it seems every hair on my face grows a different direction.  </li>
            <li>He has extremely sensitive, oily skin and this razor</li>
            <li>As far as the fear factor, of hacking your face.</li>
            <li>I very seldom have any nicks or cuts, no different from using a cartridge razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 57 years old</li>
            <li>After way too much research, I decided to buy this razor and give the Double Edge Safety Razor a try.</li>
            <li>I have nicked myself several times because of to much pressure being applied.  </li>
            <li>solid feel and size... works really well</li>
            <li>This was after reading a lot if reviews and trying to find a solution to sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I shave almost every day and have sensitive skin causing razor burn and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I still have to get used to loading and unloading the blade without the butterfly action.  </li>
            <li>I was using an old Gillette razor that my father-in-law had, so I’m</li>
            <li>and I think he misses his old razor.</li>
            <li>When you compare the cost of maintenance with this as compared to the disposable razors (namely the blades and frequency of changes), this is cheaper by far.  </li>
            <li>I began using an old butterfly type Gillett</li>
            <li>I ordered the Merkur 34C along with some additional Merkur blades, some Taylor of Old Bond Street St. James Luxury Shaving Cream,  </li>
            <li>My sensitive skin needs all the help it can get .</li>
            <li>When compared to my old Mach3 this thing has some weight and doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy at all.</li>
            <li>This razor fixed what I found lacking and didn&#x27;t cost an obscene amount.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve probably used it 5 times since I got it last week and not so much of a hint of a nick or cut.</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor after using cartridges for a long time.</li>
            <li>Plus, I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but my face feels a lot naturally lighter after the shave, when compared how it would after a shave with a Fusion.</li>
            <li>if I wanted to get anywhere near a close shave.</li>
            <li>handle is short (at his request) and very maneuverable.  </li>
            <li>After having done some considerable research, I asked for and received this razor for my birthday.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am a beginner and I had no trouble learning with this razor.</li>
            <li>WOW, the VDH is now part of my travel kit and the Merkur is the stay at home premium.</li>
            <li>I found no blemishes in the finish and it seems like it&#x27;s built to far outlive it&#x27;s owner.  </li>
            <li>But with each side having different shaving characteristics, it was too much to deal with.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to modern day multi blade cartridge systems.</li>
            <li>The merkur is solid and well made, very hefty and feels like a well built tank in your hand.</li>
            <li>Will never go back to modern technology or advertising.  </li>
            <li>Feels solid in the hand and shaves very well</li>
            <li>I love my Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s short and heavy and that&#x27;s what I love about it.</li>
            <li>Proraso green is what I went for and was pleased with the ease of shave and coolness the menthol and eucalyptus left.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also the rare thing these days which is obviously designed to last.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re moving from electric razors, you may want to learn about wet shaving before making the switch, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>And you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product, Merkur is really good, well made,</li>
            <li>Best shave I have ever had in my life, and I absolutely hate shaving before switching over.</li>
            <li>I tried a straight razor and while on my face it was ok the backside of your head with a straight razor is a bit scary</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t use shaving creams or soaps of any kind, which no matter how &#x27;natural&#x27; they may be, aren&#x27;t truly natural [always gotta be some darn chemical or refined ingredient in there or just unnecessary stuff].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To my surprise during my first shave, this cut so smoothly that i wasn&#x27;t sure if it was cutting at all!</li>
            <li>it was good, but expensive.</li>
            <li>Nice weight to the razor heavy in the hand don&#x27;t need to add any additional pressure to shave my rough bread.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although there was a little trial and error in the beginning, my routine is now pretty quick and simple.  </li>
            <li>I am new to DE shaving, but this razor is solid and comes highly recommended by others.</li>
            <li>When the price of new cartridges became almost equal to the price of this highly recommended razor, I bought one, about 6 months ago.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One new, high quality, double edge razor handle cost $50ish dollars.  </li>
            <li>I would like a little more handle but not as much as the other one.  </li>
            <li>Shaving with a DE brings back this tradition among men and puts this time-honored right of passage back in our hands.</li>
            <li>Shaving with a DE brings back this tradition among men and puts this time-honored right of passage back in our hands.</li>
            <li>Choosing the right angles will make or break the shave, I go for a 30 degree angle, than I try to get as low of an angle as possible to perform baby face shaves.</li>
            <li>The weight allows you to apply very little pressure while shaving and the size makes it easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>other beginners - be aware!  </li>
            <li>As a newbie to wet shaving w/ safety razor, I thought I had a unique opportunity to test some different razors before I developed any opinions or biases.</li>
            <li>Just drag it along at the right angle.</li>
            <li>There is definitely a learning curve in order to get a clean shave, especially coming from regular cartridge razors and electric razors which require no effort at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s dry now, by gad....and no broken parts!</li>
            <li>textured handle means I have full control, even with slightly slippery hands</li>
            <li>Had been a Mach III/Fusion guy till now, but I found I was going through the cartridges rather quickly (around 2 months, on average).</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor, and have been using it for two weeks now, and not one single nick.</li>
            <li>Clearly this is a product that is not only built to last a lifetime, but to be passed down from father to son and maybe one more time after that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a very solid construction and I have no doubt that I&#x27;ll be able to pass this down to my son when he gets old enough.</li>
            <li>It locks down nice and tight.</li>
            <li>One thing I really like is that the head is really flat</li>
            <li>The chrome on the top piece near the sharp edge pitted and came up allowing water to contact the metal underneath and created jagged sharp metal at the edges.</li>
            <li>the sharp part) is large in proportion to the handle, and it weighs about as much as a decent size wrench.  </li>
            <li>Easy to maneuver around my upper lip and chin and those tight areas.</li>
            <li>I also really like the fact that this razor looks and feels really weighty and high quality, and will never have the gross residue that builds up in a conventional razor that has rubber inserts.</li>
            <li>I love the short handle on this Merkur razor which makes it easy to shave in awkward places.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding quality and a serious instrument.</li>
            <li>Classic German .</li>
            <li>now it is a production, I tried with just oil in the shower to do a direct comparison and it is not a good method to try while learning it. :)</li>
            <li>the course of the past year, I have tried a number of safety razors, ranging from classic Gillette Super Speeds to designs like the RazoRock Stealth Slant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve put no less than 20 dudes onto this system for shaving.</li>
            <li>I love the small handle and overall size of this razor.  </li>
            <li>It seems to cut better for longer than all the multiple place disposables I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>That will only get you through the first third of the year.  </li>
            <li>But those are becoming harder and harder to find and buy.</li>
            <li>Initially I was concerned about the handle length (which was a lot shorter than my cartridge razors), after my first shave I found that the length of handle actually helped in the balance and control.</li>
            <li>After some research I couldn&#x27;t decide whether I wanted to heavy duty (fat) handle or the long model for better control and grip.</li>
            <li>You can buy a cheaper safety razor if you just want to try it out, I think they all pretty much come with a few blades.</li>
            <li>I originally got the product, and due to a problem with my local delivery agent (it was lost by the USPS, not the sellers, and was damaged)</li>
            <li>use this after a hot shower and only apply regular shaving cream by hand.</li>
            <li>This is my first double edge safety razor, and I doubt I&#x27;ll need to ever buy a second.  </li>
            <li>Also if you have large hands, you might want to consider a long handle model.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully by next week I have this down to 15-20 minutes and be comfortable DE shaving in the morning before work.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>They were simply way to high.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this Merkur to anybody looking for a double edge razor.</li>
            <li>A high quality well balanced double edge razor made in Germany.  </li>
            <li>Less cuts, less ingrown hairs, less razor burn, great smell with Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving Cream.  </li>
            <li>After several shaves I highly recommend Merkur and their 34C.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for several reasons.</li>
            <li>Besides the small size its very easy to use basic design feels like it will last a life time.</li>
            <li>I have been frustrated with the 2 giant razor companies&#x27; prices for many years, and the continual addition of more blades seemed ridiculous to me, especially when the companies discontinued their old models, which worked as well or better than the new ones.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I have huge hands, but the razor is only half the length of my Mach 3</li>
            <li>It is important for someone just starting to do some serious research on the various razors that are available because they have different levels of aggressiveness.  </li>
            <li>After watching several online videos and reading a few \\&quot;how to&#x27;s\\&quot; the switch was fairly easy for me.  </li>
            <li>I have nothing bad to say about this razor and it looks beautiful</li>
            <li>Long term, this is much, much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Light weight and small.</li>
            <li>I have relatively small hands and feel that the shorter handle on this razor is comfortable and controllable.</li>
            <li>It is not for the inexperienced shaver or a first time shaver.</li>
            <li>Turns out making numerous passes is normal with these types of razors, and that re-lathering &amp; re-shaving is something you&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li>As a first time \\&quot;wet shaver\\</li>
            <li>I switched from cartridges to this, it was my first foray into wet shaving and DE razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m ok with that because of its heavy head; this extra weight let&#x27;s the razor do all the work without me having to place extra pressure on the handle to press the razor against my face.</li>
            <li>The construction is high-quality, rest assured this razor will likely outlive you under normal use and abuse.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would give this a solid four out of five simply because I think that it should ship with a few more courtesy blades given the cost; otherwise I would have given it five stars.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would give this a solid four out of five simply because I think that it should ship with a few more courtesy blades given the cost; otherwise I would have given it five stars.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected from Merkur:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time wet shaver</li>
            <li>I did my first wet shave today</li>
            <li>This razor is my first attempt/return to wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>I guess this is the razor I would recommend to a friend who was interested in taking up wet shaving.</li>
            <li>so for those of you who want to make sure the inner works of this thing get dried out, it does come apart into 3 (actually 4) parts...</li>
            <li>However, while I think it is a good idea to try various products (and certainly with various brands of replacement blades) I don&#x27;t feel that this razor is necessarily one you leave behind simply because you started with it.  </li>
            <li>However, while I think it is a good idea to try various products (and certainly with various brands of replacement blades) I don&#x27;t feel that this razor is necessarily one you leave behind simply because you started with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little shorter in handle than I&#x27;m used to from the pro disposable head razors, but you get used to that quickly.</li>
            <li>This razor wins hands down.  </li>
            <li>I was torn between them but now having owned both the EJ89 for me wins hands down.</li>
            <li>It motors through a week&#x27;s worth of stubble without slowing down.</li>
            <li>One note is that the handle is a short one, so if you have large hands you should look for a razor with a regular sized handle.</li>
            <li>He was impressed by the quality of the product, as well as how much less expensive shaving would be in the long run.</li>
            <li>but I expected a little more.</li>
            <li>Should&#x27;ve spent a little more on a mergress.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper in the long run than the major brand disposables.</li>
            <li>The 34C will hardly wear out and is easy to care for.</li>
            <li>I did my first DE shave on a lazy Sunday morning after a nice long shower, and I encourage other newbies to do similarly.</li>
            <li>In the long run it will save me money and in the short run it&#x27;s very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>After only ever using cartridge razors with the standard long handle, I was worried this would be too short to use comfortable.</li>
            <li>It may sound like you&#x27;re spending more money on razors, but you definitely save in the long run... and when I say long run, I mean a month or two you probably get it back.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to learn the art of wet shaving with this razor due to</li>
            <li>Merkur 34C must be a more aggressive blade angle and blade tolerance than the other 3 because it gave a smoother shave with less passes.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable Merkur razor isn&#x27;t recommended for anyone new to double edge shaving since it is easier to cut yourself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and the only thing I can compare it to is the cartridge style razor which is going in the trash.</li>
            <li>NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]]and 1</li>
            <li>/&gt;Started looking to buy a new electric razor for another $200.&lt;br /&gt;Happened upon the Merkur #34C&lt;br /&gt;It was intruiguing.&lt;br /&gt;Bought it cause wanted something different.  </li>
            <li>I will never go back to the new school shaving again.</li>
            <li>you are new to the double edge world; buy this!</li>
            <li>After reading numerous reviews the Merkur #34 HD kept popping up as the One to buy for new shavers.</li>
            <li>The only suggestion I would have for someone new to safety razors is to buy a sample pack of blades and see which brand works for you.</li>
            <li>It provides a close save and, after you get used to the new technique required to shave with a double edge razor</li>
            <li>and as I thought it was just the change in shaving, or possibly the blade, but after a couple days of this new shaving I had no irritation.  </li>
            <li>After shaving the 10-day old wild growth off of my face I can assuredly say that this is the razor I&#x27;ve been looking my entire life.    </li>
            <li>The bottom of the razor unscrews so that the blade can be changed, and the stainless steel gives it a very solid feel that makes you think that this razor will be the last one I will every need to buy.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I recommend the use of Proraso Ultra Sensitive Saving Soap with a badger brush, an alum block, and witch haze after shave (I use the type that is mixed with aloe).</li>
            <li>No way the Feather razor is worth even half that price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the angle of the blade is different or not as much blade is exposed , but I can say, it&#x27;s definitely not too aggressive.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of use the handle size is no longer and issue and it feels plenty comfortable to hold, especially since safety razors aren&#x27;t meant to be pressed against the skin, just glided across with the shaving cream of your choice.</li>
            <li>Works very well on African American skin/beard types with almost no ingrown hairs to worry about.</li>
            <li>If you want a solid razor with quality construction at a reasonable price look no further.</li>
            <li>so much I bought a 2nd one as a christmas present for my brother.</li>
            <li>Well, I shave my whole head and have been using cartridge razors for years, they keep making them more expensive to use.  </li>
            <li>At first i was a little skeptical even after reading all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>This will give a much closer shave then new conventional razors.</li>
            <li>Moving to the single edge blade really reduced the amount of ingrown hairs too.</li>
            <li>If you need to clean it because soap scum or other gunk starts to build up, I&#x27;ve left it soaking overnight in vinegar and baking soda and it was clean as new the next morning.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never had a major cut.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I read everything I could from every source I could find, and finally decided on the Merkur 34C, all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>These blades are incredibly sharp so you do need to put a little more care into your shaves.</li>
            <li>No Regrets!</li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other shavers out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is small enough and easy with a protective shield to lessen the ability to accidentally cut yourself.</li>
            <li>Took me a few weeks to achieve nick free shaves, so if you are new to the safety razor wet shave, buy a styptic pencil with it.</li>
            <li>I have a couple of razors that have thinner smooth handles and they are difficult to control when wet and easily results in nicking my neck.</li>
            <li>The blades never felt smooth over my face and left me raw no matter what angle</li>
            <li>It was not very hard to learn how to use properly.</li>
            <li>Rough surfaces are harder to keep clean.</li>
            <li>small nice little shaver</li>
            <li>Showed up exactly as expected and is very high quality.</li>
            <li>I have to shave twice, one right after the other, on a daily basis</li>
            <li>Double edge razors set the bar for close shaving luxury and whichever razor you choose to use will be highly dependent on your personal preference(s).  </li>
            <li>Solid construction, feels like I could fight my way out of a corner with it and not only still have a clean shave afterward, but I could pass this down to someone 40 years from now</li>
            <li>That is the beauty of owning a safety razor, though, you can now buy ten different razor blades for less than the cost of one cartridge and each one will give you a unique shave till you find what suits you.</li>
            <li>After researching the web for hours, I decided on this model due to the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>So I generally just shaved with multi blade cartridge.  </li>
            <li>I am starting to get over my fear of cutting my throat and am finding that this is incredibly smooth and shaves close even with the light touch that is required.</li>
            <li>clog nearly as fast as a cartridge and clears faster allowing for long passes through even several days of growth.&lt;br /&gt;Allows</li>
            <li>The textured handle is really nice on this product and makes it very stable to hold: it would be difficult to accidentally drop this razor even with wet, soapy hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My razor completely fell apart after one month of moderate use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it with the merkur platnium razor blade that came with it so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of different ones -- including adjustable and fixed head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m in the middle of the sensitive skin and whisker coarseness camp.  </li>
            <li>I once had an old DE razor that belonged to my grandfather, but eventually followed the big razor companies as they added 2 and 3 blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the trick is to use as soft a pressure as possible.  </li>
            <li>For the record, I have eczema (not on my face, but the sensitivity of my face is clearly apparent), and I don&#x27;t have a water softener.  </li>
            <li>I have a 30 year old Gillete used in the same water.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy another one of these when my two boys get old enough to start shaving.</li>
            <li>I want something that will look old school and last just like those without the tacky upgrades.s to allow any metal to stress and break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I want something that will look old school and last just like those without the tacky upgrades.</li>
            <li>The razor is heavier than I expected and very well made.  </li>
            <li>However, if you find that you like wet shaving, you may very well end up buying this razor (and others) anyway.</li>
            <li>I can remember my dad shaving with an old Gillette double edge razor and always cut himself</li>
            <li>This is a solid razor with old school craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>Husband has always had really sensitive skin, so he couldn&#x27;t shave with a regular razor.</li>
            <li>Apparently EJ&#x27;s have this problem because they use cast steel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the same blades (Astra Platinum) and shave cream (Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood)</li>
            <li>I just barely touched it to my face and it sliced through the hair like butter.</li>
            <li>No regrets.  </li>

            <li>1st DE razor but fantastic product, short handle but heavy enough to do the job</li>
            <li>I was concerned that the handle would be too short, but now that I have used it for month, I like the maneuverability it offers.</li>
            <li>Back to my roots: cultural and shaving.</li>
            <li>He wanted this because he wanted to go back to the old way of shaving.</li>
            <li>Sometime in the 70&#x27;s I switched from my trusty old Gillette double edge razor to the Schick Injector Razor and others as they were advertised and released.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an old Gillette red handle for years and thought I&#x27;d try the Merkur.  </li>
            <li>One is that I expected it to be made out of stainless steel because that is what the description says.</li>
            <li>I have never used any double edge safety razor before, as far as I can remember.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why I ever trashed my old double edge years ago.  </li>
            <li>Was never a big fan of shaving, but decided to try the old fashioned way of shaving to see what the fuss was about.</li>
            <li>and I am welcoming back an old friend.</li>
            <li>So I decided to go old school and never looked back.</li>
            <li>I am back old school:  </li>
            <li>it reminds me of my Dad&#x27;s old Gillette safety razor that I would occasionally sneak a shave with!</li>
            <li>Only used it a couple of times so far, but it seems like a well made razor.  </li>
            <li>I use this razor, an Astra blade, and regular old sunflower cooking oil to shave.</li>
            <li>I have so far tried Derby, Personna (Red), Crystal, Merkur and Astra.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I can&#x27;t describe the feeling of shaving with the Merkur Duty Double Edge razor.</li>
            <li>The short handle threw me off at first since I have big hands, but now I understand that following the contour of your face dictates the smaller handle.</li>
            <li>Just let the weight of the razor do the work or barely touch your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as money goes, I bought 1 10 pack of razors for 7.99, I shave every day, and I still have 1 razor left after 7 months!  </li>
            <li>Electric, double blade, triple and even four blade razors; and none of those come close to this \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; safety razor.  </li>
            <li>Apparently you can dislodge it if so inclined, as I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Art of Manliness and became interested in the art of a proper wet shave.  </li>
            <li>I was finding that the more blades a system had, the worse the irritation.</li>
            <li>so you get the under the nose/upper moustache area better without having to contort your poor nose.  </li>
            <li>the way, did I mention that the cost of a DE blade is approximately 15 % of the cost of a Gillette cartridge and gives you twice as many shaves?</li>
            <li>I thought I would only go straight down for my first few shaves to get the hang of it, but by the end of my first pass I felt likeI could go crosswise on the next pass.</li>
            <li>I find that the Merkur blades are not very sharp and recommend getting something else.</li>
            <li>The blade cover is shaped like a regular razor so the shave isn&#x27;t as aggressive, easy to use, and hard to get cut (unless you are not cleaning it).  </li>
            <li>My first shave with this razor was like a dream compared to my other razor!</li>
            <li>While the cut bled pretty badly, overall I cut myself much less frequently than I did with a multi-blade plastic razor.</li>
            <li>This is a fixed head razor and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, including those new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>Overall I like the shaver, but I am so new to saving with a double edged razor</li>
            <li>Had the handle for my replaceable cartridge blade break on my just after buying a new one, so I finally made the plunge into double edge razors.</li>
            <li>Once you  get used to shaving with a double edge razor, you will never go back to all the new fangled razors on the mkt.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that I can add anything new here that hasn&#x27;t already been said, but I will say that between switching to this type of razor and watching You Tube videos on shaving, I feel like I am learning how to shave correctly after shaving for many years the wrong way.  </li>
            <li>I do think that getting the larger handle version is what I will do next time I am in the market for a new safety razor.</li>
            <li>After that, my shave time cut in half, and I now get a smooth shave with no cuts and minimal fuss.  </li>
            <li>Having never had a wet shave before, I youtubed a couple of helpful videos, and after a rough shave or two, I quickly learned how to work the razor.</li>
            <li>In fact, there are weeks I only shave once or twice, and this razor effortlessly mows right through a weeks stubble without slowing down.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling that if it had a long handle new users like myself just switching to a DE razor would tend to grip it in their plams and nick the heck out of their faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cost of this razor was about the same as a large package of blades for my former razor at Sams, but will last for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li>The Merkur Heavy Duty is a high precision beauty of classic technology.  </li>
            <li>The first week, I had a slight amount of irritation during the day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if other men have more room between their nose and</li>
            <li>main thing when starting to use a double edge razor, or any older/traditional shaving methods, is the process and overall experience.</li>
            <li>The handle is small, and I know that bothers some people due to the &#x27;size&#x27; of their hands, but you shouldn&#x27;t be gripping this thing like a pipe wrench.  </li>
            <li>only possible negative thing I can report (which is most likely my fault) is the irritation I got when I shaved against the grain around my mouth.</li>
            <li>I still do not think it is anywhere close to reasonable and decided to investigate other alternatives.</li>
            <li>After much research i chose this over other models.</li>
            <li>This razor is extremely will built and very forgiving.  </li>
            <li>The handle&#x27;s grip is extremely useful, especially if you use shaving oil and your hands get a little slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe not a super sharp as Feathers, but I like how smooth they are.  </li>
            <li>It exposes enough blade for a great cut, but enough guard to make it hard to make any serious cuts.  </li>
            <li>This razor does not have that problem, as it comes apart into two pieces - the handle, with a non-removable threaded nut at the bottom, and the highly-polished top part which secures and angles the blade, attached to a long bolt that fits down into the handle to be screwed down.    </li>
            <li>The included Merkur blade fits so snug that it took a little maneuvering just to get the blade past the threads (which is a good thing considering the reviews I&#x27;ve seen for other safety razors).</li>
            <li>half way think that I got a bad razor, because I can&#x27;t believe that so many people are satisfied with this junk.  </li>
            <li>Be careful if you&#x27;ve never used a straight razor or a double edged one like the Merkur.  </li>
            <li>My beard grows fast enough that I have to shave every day(a habit from the military).  </li>
            <li>I have had trouble shaving my whole adult life.  </li>
            <li>The knurling is deep and grips very well when wet.  </li>
            <li>This one blade action on my skin gives me a close shave without having to deal with 3 or 4 blades pulling my facial hair causing them to curl back in causing severe razor bumps .</li>
            <li>For sensitive skin or moderate facial hair Personna, Astra would work well.</li>
            <li>I recently decided to go back to old school shaving.</li>
            <li>My face is not dry and flaking in the morning anymore.</li>
            <li>Like most of you, I&#x27;ve grown tired of constantly purchasing Gillette safety razors year after year.</li>
            <li>So I did bit more digging and found out the secret is to do a second pass.  </li>
            <li>Way better than my old, expensive 3-blade razors.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, although it feels different in the hand I honestly don&#x27;t tell any difference in shave quality between the 34c and my $10 utopia razor.</li>
            <li>I have been having fun using a different aftershave everyday</li>
            <li>Today I received my first safety razor, the Merkur HD 34C, put the Merkur blade in, cranked it down, and rushed off to shave like I was a kid on Christmas day that had just received a new remote control car.</li>
            <li>These blades come highly recommended on the Internet as an inexpensive middle-of-the-road blade (sharp but not excessively sharp) which is made in the USA.</li>
            <li>A nick or two you may experience the first couple of shaves, but once you get the simple technique down you&#x27;ll have no issues with cuts at all.</li>
            <li>I used this little gem this morning for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I was a little nervous at first</li>
            <li>My first was a Merkur Futur, which I felt was a little unforgiving and aggressive to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get a very high quality product that you won&#x27;t get tired of.</li>
            <li>Combine this with a little Colonel Conk shave soap, an inexpensive Parker brush, and your favorite razor,(I like the Feather and Astra blades) and you&#x27;ll never look back at those other shaving side-show throw-aways again!!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me, switching to wet shaving will mean your shaves will require more concentration and preparation.  </li>
            <li>The Merkur #34C (aka Heavy Duty DE Razor) has a short, BUT VERY THICK handle that is ideal if you have some pretty heavy hands that otherwise would make the #180 Long Handle impractical to use (something that I personally use because my fingers ARE long).  </li>
            <li>Many sites on safety-razor shaving rightly point out that alcohol-based aftershaves are bad for your skin (the Art of Shaving site has a lot to say about this).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy enough to let gravity apply just the right amount of pressure.  </li>
            <li>It may take a little more time, not much, but it&#x27;s time well spent.</li>
            <li>was becoming super painful until I started using this.</li>
            <li>While seemingly expensive at first, the money is quickly recouped in the price of the blades.</li>
            <li>The blades are super sharp and there is no pivot in the head to get around the sharp contours of my bony shins and ankles.  </li>
            <li>common observation shared by newbie safety razor users is that getting nicks is unavoidable, specially during the first few shaves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never go back to a fusion or any other over priced modern razor.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just not really long like the cartridge type razors.</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s really no excuse.</li>
            <li>So my first experience with a safety razor was with a Parker 22r that was faulty, it would not secure fully, and chewed my head up.  </li>
            <li>Things to remember: the first few shaves you will cut yourself.</li>
            <li>I first I cut myself, but after a few shaves I got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>When I first held this Merkur Heavy Duty Razor, I knew that my shaving experience was about to be upgraded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a pretty heavy razor</li>
            <li>Quality, and worth spending a few extra up front on the German Merkur.</li>
            <li>, I felt like, unless you are actually using a DE razor due to their inexpensive blade costs, the supposed advantages of DE razors were hype (which is ironic, since DE fans say that safety razors are just hype to get people to buy more expensive blades), and to me they just aren&#x27;t worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>Following advice I read, I began by only shaving down for the first two weeks.</li>
            <li>I look forward to shaving with this razor, and if you take your time and make deliberate, light and steady strokes you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s not as difficult as some make</li>
            <li>As someone who has only shaved twice since I received this, classic store bought razors (Schick, Mach 3, etc) have NOTHING on the feel of a wet shave.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little concerned about the short handle</li>
            <li>Which is really dense and thick facial hair with soft and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The blades are much cheaper than the expensive fancy heads on the big brand razors and it does at least as good a job.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll save money in the not very long run.</li>
            <li>If your new to wet shaving, this is the way to start of.</li>
            <li>I am a new wet shaver.</li>
            <li>Being new to Wet shaving I went with the one that iv&#x27;e researched as a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wet shaving</li>
            <li>I am new to the world of wet shaving, but I am getting the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>It is usually on the right side where I start.  </li>
            <li>A modern shaver like a Gillette Fusion shaves just as close as a safety razor with less risk of nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>After nearly a month of it I cannot believe I waited this long to return to the traditional shaving practice.  </li>
            <li>They are so thin the blade is easily missed</li>
            <li>I warm my badger bristle brush while brushing my teeth, then wet my face with cold water, whip up a nice thick, wet lather and cover my beard.  </li>
            <li>You want it to barely touch, if you feel too much pressure, pull off, rinse and start where you left off; if you feel it&#x27;s not even, just turn the handle a little.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, Compact&lt;br /&gt;Cons: closed blade makes it hard for head shaving.</li>
            <li>After doing research, I decided on heavy double sided razor with the safety feature and a screw down top versus butterfly (read butterfly becomes loose and unsafe).  </li>
            <li>The price appears a little pricey, but you certainly get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new to wet shaving with a double edge razor.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this for new wet shavers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades inserted is fixed and not moving like the butterfly as I do make it loose in the butterfly for making the moustache lines.</li>
            <li>There are of course cost benefits that for me show up rather quickly: cartridge razors are expensive-- a pack of 15 costs around as much as this razor itself does.</li>
            <li>I get a much better shave, less irritation, and I&#x27;m spending a lot less on blades compared to the other &#x27;systems&#x27; out there.</li>
            <li>Also if you have large hands like myself, maybe you should consider one that is a little bigger as i am</li>
            <li>So if you absolutely need a long handled razor, there are other safety razors you should look at.    </li>
            <li>I find that the Merkur blades themselves were not a good match for my skin, but that a couple of other brands I have tried worked much better than the included blades.</li>
            <li>I have black thick facial hair which tugs and pulls with most razors leaving me with burn and irritation.</li>
            <li>While it might not be as flashy or cool as the butterfly models Parker makes, it makes up for in simplicity and solid design.e is really nice on this product and makes it very stable to hold: it would be difficult to accidentally drop this razor even with wet, soapy hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re really worried about nicking yourself but want to try it, just get it, use it on the weekends and you can take your time and not worry about showing up at work with a little nick on your face.</li>
            <li>I really like this little razor.</li>
            <li>After much reading, I decided on this little beauty.</li>
            <li>Was quite apprehensive due to razor bumps, and just being totally new to the DE razor scene.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend anyone thinking about doing this to spend some serious time on some of the larger DE shaving forums because there is really a lot to learn about all of the various razors, blades, soaps, brushes, techniques, accessories, etc.  </li>
            <li>Even though hair down there is much thicker than  the beard or any other area of the body, this single blade trimmed it down quickly.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used a safety razor, the weight of this razor is really the only thing I think will take a little adjustment time.</li>
            <li>The shorter handle is a little strange at first</li>
            <li>BUT for the days i don&#x27;t have enough time to shave with the straight razor i use this little guy.</li>
            <li>I can see that if you have larger hands, this razor may seem a bit small, but for my average sized hands it is fine.  </li>
            <li>too bad we dont manufacture any safety razors as good here in America.</li>
            <li>I got one bad one, there are lots of good ones out there.</li>
            <li>The majority of my life has been spent shaving with those lovely cartridge razors that burn your skin and your wallet leaving you unhappy and with a dread of shaving; something that in today&#x27;s world is nearly a must in all professional</li>
            <li>I also think it is ironic that Gillette which invented the DE razor and sold tens of millions of them does not make one now, at least as far as I can determine.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Wife commented, unsolicited, that my skin has looked really good since i started this method.    </li>
            <li> and it works really good with my skin type.  </li>
            <li> Its a quality unit and has good weight and balance to it.</li>
            <li> I started to lose hope on finding a good shaving method.</li>
            <li> Good luck with your search.</li>
            <li> With nice blades gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> Picked this up after reading all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Good shave</li>
            <li> Definitely a good starter razor.</li>
            <li> Expecting butterfly type, but works good</li>
            <li> Well made, good weight.</li>
            <li> This is a good DE razor, meets my needs.</li>
            <li> The merkur blades are good for about 3-4 shaves.</li>
            <li> Even Noxema is a good option.  </li>
            <li> so I wanted to find a good safety razor.</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> Get a good blade, the sharpest you can find, and let it do the work.  </li>
            <li> So choose a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> some Personna and Feather blades and some good gel shaving</li>
            <li> Good blade takes hair off like it&#x27;s just wiping off a layer of</li>
            <li> Razor works good, still learning how to shave with it.</li>
            <li> I loved how protective it was but the butterfly-style blade mechanism started to seize up.  </li>
            <li> You get a good shave from these safety razors by learning how to use one, not the soap you put on your face.</li>
            <li> Good quality construction.</li>
            <li> - Don&#x27;t buy a safety razor like this Merkur, shave like you do with your Fusion, and expect a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are some tooling marks on it, but still it looks good.  </li>
            <li> I found this to not give a good shave.</li>
            <li> When you pick it up, it has good weight (almost like it has</li>
            <li> did some reason and Merkur seemed like a good choice to try as a starter.</li>
            <li> The chrome appears to be good quality as well.</li>
            <li> Good product, use a blade about three times, I don&#x27;t get any nicks</li>
            <li> Good Summary:</li>
            <li> The handle is non-slip and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> There is no way that I can call it good with one shave.  </li>
            <li> Good balance.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good value</li>
            <li> Take your time and use a good glycerin soap to work up your lather.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Merkur 34C to learn how to shave with a double-edged razor and it has been an excellent performer for fit, finish and function.</li>
            <li> My good friend told me tha</li>
            <li> seems like good quality</li>
            <li> Good for traveling.</li>
            <li> well built, feels good in my hand.</li>
            <li> quality workmanship; I&#x27;m delighted.</li>
            <li> The 34C is a good razor.</li>
            <li> This way you can a good blade that works for you.</li>
            <li> I like the size good grip</li>
            <li> it is good quality for the price.  </li>
            <li> Good razor and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s superior to the cartridge based systems in every way.  </li>
            <li> Good shave for a fair price.</li>
            <li> Its a good entry level razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good razor.</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> He recommends you look up videos on The Art of Shaving store&#x27;s website for detailed directions on the best way to use these blades(says ignore videos on YouTube) and take your time while you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Please note: that you need a good shave soap or shave cream (not that combustible stuff in a can) for this product to work efficiently as designed.</li>
            <li> I recommend Speick shave cream with this razor, a good badger brush, and whatever your choice is of aftershave.</li>
            <li> This is a really good all-rounder.  </li>
            <li> I have learned that shave oil and good lather helps avoid cuts.</li>
            <li> good quality chrome finish.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the good reviews of Merkur razors.</li>
            <li> Good razor.  </li>
            <li> If this would have been priced at 1/2 it would be a fair deal.  </li>
            <li> The Merkur 34C is a good razor.  </li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s a good razor but not the shaving panacea that some would have you believe.</li>
            <li> this is a great razor to own...</li>
            <li> this is a great razor to own.</li>
            <li> No nicks, no cuts, no irritation, just a damn good shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for a good shaving cream/soap.</li>
            <li> Good weight, good size for medium hands.</li>
            <li> Good razor</li>
            <li> I discovered that Feather brand was really good for my skin and dialer type.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product...</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Shaves good but doesn&#x27;t cut your face.</li>
            <li> Get a good cream and brush , don&#x27;t forget a stand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I recommend this, along with the Derby blades and some good face preparation.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re switching over from the radioactive-colored gel/plastic face-grater routine, it&#x27;s a good idea to take a gradual approach.</li>
            <li> You can do the with/against/cross method and lather every time, but even if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll get just as good as a cartridge, that&#x27;s the beauty.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best razor available, all categories.</li>
            <li> Product is of good quality.</li>
            <li> Hold is good.</li>
            <li> Takes a good a month or two</li>
            <li> Provides a good shave.</li>
            <li> were a good deal.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a good thing, because it lessons the chance that you&#x27;ll be tempted to push rather than</li>
            <li> With a good prep (lather, etc.), this razor will serve you well.</li>
            <li> It feels good in the hand, on my face and just performs well.</li>
            <li> Price is fair.</li>
            <li> and they all have been good razors to learn with.  </li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> Good item, as described, no troubles yet, good shipping and customer service.  </li>
            <li> It feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> Perfect blade gap for an efficient and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Good weight to it.</li>
            <li> Proud to own one.</li>
            <li> This razor is well made for the price, dont judge it by the blade they send with the razor because in my opinion it wasnt good.</li>
            <li> The blade that came with it worked really good for me</li>
            <li> This was a good beginning point, I don&#x27;t regret it.  </li>
            <li> Just as good as advertised.</li>
            <li> ANY form of shaving cream will result in a good shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, he loved it, I tried it to shave my legs, I loved it.</li>
            <li> and it was good.  </li>
            <li> a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor is a good choice for anyone wanting a good, close shave.</li>
            <li> The razor itself is the perfect size and feel comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li> The weight is good, and it glides effortlessly when you use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- good weight</li>
            <li> It gives as good a shave as Gillette 3, 4 and five blade combinations.  </li>
            <li> Best DE razor available.</li>
            <li> If everyone knew how good shaving like this is Gillette would go out of business for the mens department immediately.</li>
            <li> and now a four pack good blades can cost you anywhere 15 to 20 dollars.</li>
            <li> The quality is good, or superior but go for the longer handle.</li>
            <li> Feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s environmentally a good it.</li>
            <li> Good weight and size.</li>
            <li> Took about a week to get a hang of this type of razor and learn good technique.  </li>
            <li> I also have an electric razor that I would use in a pinch, but also received a fair helping of razor burn from that too.</li>
            <li> they may be good for you</li>
            <li> This razor is a good quality and well built product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good razor.  </li>
            <li> The grip is superior even with some lather on it.  </li>
            <li> Using an Astra razor blade (for now) from an Amazon-sold variety pack, I found that the Merkur and the blade itself are surprisingly forgiving.  </li>
            <li> You do have to use a good quality shaving cream - not just one from the drug store.</li>
            <li> good weight, works as advertised, recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also own the Muhle  R89 and that gives and very nice shave as well.</li>
            <li> wonderful clean shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful object, in a manly and minimalist aesthetic, and it&#x27;s a nice thing to own in that respect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the most beautiful thing on planet</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful piece made with outstanding craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> Feels great in the hand, very high quality finish, and just feels so damn awesome to shave with!</li>
            <li> The 34C is an exceptional performer.</li>
            <li> Paired mine with an Astra SP blade for an exceptional razor-to-blade pairing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The weight of the head is perfect and overall its a great product!.</li>
            <li> For me, the aveeno lotion works the best, although the olive oil, and only water work real good as well.</li>
            <li> It shaves great, feels good in the hand and works great whether your clean shaving, maintaining neat lines of your goatee or mustache or keeping the neckline neat on your beard..</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve heard many good reviews and the ratings on here are great for Merkur.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and seems great!</li>
            <li> the razor very smooth and great look</li>

            <li> You will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> Sure, they work, but I have been using Personna blades to great satisfaction and am looking to try others as well when these run</li>
            <li> in all very pleased.</li>
            <li> Happy shaving my friend. :)</li>

            <li> All-in-all, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> In order to get the desired level of closeness I shave twice with these razors- and am very pleased with how close a shave doing so achieves.  </li>
            <li> #34 is my favorite and its a great razor</li>
            <li> Okay moving on, this razor is great</li>
            <li> It has a good weight and feel to it, nice balance.</li>
            <li> Blade included is fair, but does a nice job.  </li>
            <li> so you get good shave and can maneuver nicely.  </li>
            <li> The razor itself looks nice and had a good weight to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite easily the best shave I&#x27;ve enjoyed.</li>
            <li> Best to shave right after a shower, use some pre-shave lotion or oil--Proraso or Art of Shaving</li>
            <li> With the right technique, this razor provides a consistently excellent, close shave, with almost no</li>
            <li> It is wonderful with the right blade</li>
            <li> I think most users will like this razor as it works well and gives very nice results once you get used to DE shaving techniques.</li>
            <li> Very nice close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Using a Van der Hagen shaving set until I get more into the art of shaving.  </li>
            <li> It took me a full week to really figure out my face and neck shape/contours, as well as the best angle of attack of the blade itself, to get the best shave.</li>
            <li> This was the best decision I have ever made for my sensitive, rarely happy and irritible face.</li>
            <li> absolutly love this!</li>
            <li> -- so many options!  </li>
            <li> I would challenge beginners not to be scared of it as I was by the reviews of more senior shavers!</li>
            <li> More lather!  </li>
            <li> First time using a safety razor, and I have to say this razor is awesome.</li>
            <li> and I still love this product!  </li>
            <li> What a refreshing thing to find these days!  </li>
            <li> I have the Merkur 38c and love it!</li>
            <li> 5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li> and I must say, I love it!</li>

            <li> This razor gives me a closer shave at a better cost to my wallet and the environment!</li>
            <li> I am really glad I did!  </li>

            <li> I love this DE razor!</li>
            <li> and it got even better!</li>
            <li> You will need to purchase a good shave soap, some alum or a styptic pen, some lotion, and aftershave if you want a great shave, but those are really required for any great shave.  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>

            <li> It arrived on time, in perfect condition, and exactly as advertised.</li>

            <li> Leave the latest cartridge razor fad on the grocery store shelves and buy this razor!</li>
            <li> After my first shave, I was TOTALLY impressed and had no issues.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it- best shave ever.</li>
            <li> but I do know that this Merkur HD gives me a pretty awesome close shave without any irritation or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> First off I lathered the shave cream real good and applied with brush to face for about 1 1/2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Then I took my time, followed these recommendations and got a perfect shave the first time with no nicks.  </li>
            <li> This was my first,  and it&#x27;s still the best shave I know of!</li>

            <li> This was a great razor to start my set, and was easy to learn with.</li>
            <li> They are both great razors and will easily shave as close as the multiblade vibrating twin overhead cam 16 valve models at a quarter of the price.  </li>

            <li> Works great, cleans easily.</li>

            <li> This razor makes the process effortless and amazing.  </li>
            <li> I figured they must have some amazing blade in it, so I put one of my feather blades in it to see the difference.</li>

            <li> My dad loves this product it gives a great smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Simply an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Great weight and a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The blade is amazing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a Badger hair brush or fancy cream and am still getting an amazingly smooth/close shave.</li>
            <li> Nice quality razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that straight castor oil works best for me, which is cheaper than buying the packaged pre-shave oil.</li>
            <li> Well balanced, nice knurled stock.</li>
            <li> I liked the weight, I feel like it made learning how to shave with a safety razor</li>
            <li> and I really liked the result...</li>
            <li> Nice razor, I like to use feather blades with mine.</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s the point of having a nice luxury car with a variety of electrical problems.</li>
            <li> Very much liked the 2-piece construction.  </li>
            <li> Seems much better built than the Edwin Jagger, and the engineering is much superior regarding the screwing mechanism.</li>
            <li> When you combine it with good blades -- you have a winning combination.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a nice bonus that, in addition to coming with a Merkur blade, it&#x27;s also packed with a box of Dorco blades to try.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a nice bonus that, in addition to coming with a Merkur blade, it&#x27;s also packed with a box of Dorco blades to try.  </li>
            <li> Nice construction.</li>
            <li> but oh well, they perform nicely anyways.</li>
            <li> I loaded it up, got nice and lathered and began shaving.</li>
            <li> you want my advice on how to get the absolute best shave?</li>
            <li> Every man should own one.</li>
            <li> Reliable, nicely weighted, does the job.</li>
            <li> There are so many good things about this razor and the quality of the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> so we got him his own for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> The shave is great, and is more of an enjoyable experience than it was with the Fusion.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a good one and almost any shave will be luxurious.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice heft to it too.</li>
            <li> This one is so good, i bought 4 more for my boys.</li>
            <li> I was going to upgrade if I liked</li>
            <li> let its own weight do the work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pick a nice shaving soap that suits your needs.</li>
            <li> You will nick sporadically and the titanium dioxide will tidy things up (but man does it</li>
            <li> Make sure you get a good quality badger brush and shaving cream/soap.  </li>
            <li> Nice weight and feel to it.</li>
            <li> + for most good safety razors).</li>
            <li> Fits in your hand nicely.</li>
            <li> effectively weighted razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The weight feels good and it helps make the shave all the better.</li>
            <li> It is a nice razor.</li>
            <li> This one is a nice medium comb.</li>
            <li> As nice as it would be to save money</li>
            <li> Best investment ever , my face thanks you.</li>
            <li> Nice weight...</li>
            <li> Nice razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor doesn’t get gummed up during the shave and dipping and shaking in a warm bowl or water or giving it a blast from the faucet</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor doesn’t get gummed up during the shave and dipping and shaking in a warm bowl or water or giving it a blast from the faucet</li>
            <li> Nice razor.  </li>
            <li> It sits nicely there</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s nice and grippy.</li>
            <li> Boar hair brushes are supposed to be good for face lathering (which seems like better and faster preparation than bowl lathering).</li>
            <li> The razor is well built and feels nice in the hand.</li>
            <li> Fits hand nicely and works well in shaving.</li>
            <li> Wonderful weight and has stayed looking good after nearly a year of use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to do that with my Edwin Jagger, vintage Gillettes, or my $15 Feather Popular.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews of this razor used with the Feather blades and since most of the reviews were really good</li>
            <li> and he really liked it.</li>
            <li> The razor itself has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li> It was, however, quite effective in that role.</li>
            <li> Nice, heavyweight razor.  </li>
            <li> One day I&#x27;ll step it up and get some nice lathering shave soap &amp; a bowl, but until then this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice looking razor.  </li>
            <li> And twenty one years ago I paid 60.00 for this razor, the prices on Amazon are more than fair.</li>
            <li> The Merkur has a nice heft to it and combined with the feather and derby blades I have tried to date</li>
            <li> This razor has a nice weight to it.  </li>
            <li> That noted, it would be quite handy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I own the 39C as well and</li>
            <li> this is the absolute best shave he has ever had.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 2016-12-05&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this razor for over three years now, and it&#x27;s still as nice as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> Its weight feels nicely balanced to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a in the pocket kind of purchase for someone like me wanting to start out with a quality razor, getting to learn the art, and not blowing the bank.</li>
            <li> Nice razor, but not for me.</li>
            <li> It provides an excellent shave and is built very well.</li>
            <li> Soak your brush in warm water while you shower.</li>
            <li> the money will own it for years to come.</li>
            <li> I liked that razor, but even though it is lined</li>
            <li> If you take the time to get used to it, and use good shaving lather you will love this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The quality of design, materials &amp; build are incredible -certainly worth the cost.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t figure out the differences between the popular ones listed</li>
            <li> so I went ahead and ordered 6 of them to do my own evaluation.</li>
            <li> It feels nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I find sharper blades like Rapira swedish stainless, Feather (the best in my opinion) and</li>
            <li> but it works very well and gives an excellent shave with the Merkur blades.</li>
            <li> I has a nice weight and balance to it.</li>
            <li> nicely balanced.</li>
            <li> This razor feels awesome and performs very well.  </li>
            <li> and I liked it.</li>
            <li> This Merkur seems kind of pricey</li>
            <li> Nice feel.</li>
            <li> I own 16  saftey razors, 6 being merkurs.</li>
            <li> Nice chrome finish.</li>
            <li> I own 8 safety razors.  </li>
            <li> I plan on contacting the manufacturer to see if the some kind of warranty.</li>
            <li> Feels nice in my hand.</li>
            <li> I just purchased it with the Merkur Platinum coated stainless blades, used this razor twice and have received the best shave yet.</li>
            <li> Nice weight and balance.</li>
            <li> Nice weight to it.  </li>
            <li> Well crafted and works nicely.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice quality product.</li>
            <li> There are dozens of blades, buying a couple of each of the ones with good reviews, should put you on the right path - happy shaving..</li>
            <li> nice razor,very comfortable, love it!!</li>
            <li> The razor is top notch, I was worried about the finish from reading other reviews, but the finish is perfect and looks great everywhere!  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product, excellent quality, built for life, easy to use, cheap to replace blades and shaves closer than anything on the market!     </li>
            <li> It has a very nice feel, not too hefty, not too light.  </li>
            <li> Happy that I made the move from the 4-blade systems to this great, classic method.  </li>
            <li> Merkur is a great brand, never disappointed.</li>
            <li> The merkur HD is more suitable for a beginner and even the more experienced shavers.</li>
            <li> Great razor - definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Others have recommended this particular Merkur as one of the best.  </li>
            <li> I clean the razor before every use, and the chrome is still in great shape.</li>
            <li> After one year the razor looks great if I clean it up and has no rust.  </li>
            <li> Gives a great clean shave.</li>
            <li> This is a great foundation for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Something that people have to remember is that your razor is only as good as the blades that you use, so please do this razor justice and get some nice blades that feel great for your skin.</li>
            <li> VERY HAPPY AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR FOR BEGINNERS AND PRO&#x27;S</li>
            <li> you want to shave like your grandpa did and get a good clean quality shave...make the transition now!</li>
            <li> The lather builds up quickly, has great cushioning and glide, and the smell is amazing on both soaps.    </li>
            <li> My first shave with this razor, with one of the included Merkur blades, was incredible.</li>
            <li> The great reviews of this razor are all true.  </li>
            <li> , you will enjoy a close, smooth shave that looks good and feels great.</li>
            <li> First time using this razor achieved an incredible close shave.  </li>
            <li> I was brand new to DE shaving when I got this razor and it has worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Best new razor on the market.</li>
            <li> I feel the shave is as good or frankly most of the time now better than my Fusion (who now resides in the bottom</li>
            <li> They shipped quick and would happily order from them again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a relatively mild razor but it&#x27;s great to learn technique.</li>
            <li> Feels super premium, looks good, great weight on the skin, cleans easily.</li>
            <li> I got some nice soap, a badger brush, Merkur 34C, and a nice stand to top it all off.</li>
            <li> You should invest in a shaving brush (preferably badger hair), a good non alcohol based shaving soap/cream, a styptic pen (if you cut yourself this will effectively sanitize the area and stop the bleeding you can get these really cheap at any drugstore for a couple of dollars).    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li> Changing the blades is very easy.</li>
            <li> bulldog handle makes the razor very easy to maneuver; and the razor&#x27;s head allows for close shaving in under one&#x27;s nose.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very easy to replace blades (you just unscrew the bottom part and the head plate comes off)</li>
            <li> I have been using #34C for almost two months, and I find it very easy to maneuver on my face.</li>
            <li> Blades are very easy to change.</li>
            <li> If you have a porcelain, steel, or tile tub, this razor can get damaged very easily.  </li>
            <li> design makes it very easy to change a blade.</li>
            <li> Very easy to handle, substantial in the hand, and takes the guesswork out of blade exposure.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to change blades.</li>
            <li> Maintenance is very easy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also cleans very easily and the blade is a breeze to change out.</li>
            <li> Very easy to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started my safety razor shaving with this razor and it was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The handle is shorter than the Parker but very easy to control.  </li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor over the $10 price point and it looks nice and feels nice and provides a great shave.</li>
            <li> Best shave of my life by far!  </li>
            <li> and finding that the more elegant and economical Harry&#x27;s cartridge razor, while excellent for what it is, didn&#x27;t shave any better than the Gillette razors.</li>
            <li> Now I do have 13 more different types of blades to try out, and find what works best for me, but as of right now I am very happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Great razor, thanks!!</li>
            <li> The Merkur is a very good razor at an extremely reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Good quality, easy to use and with the right blade, a great shave.</li>
            <li> The 34c provided a smooth, comfortable shave with no pulling of my beard, no unpleasant burn after each stroke and surprisingly it was even fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 34c is brilliantly designed and the chrome finish and heft make it a pleasure to own and to use.</li>
            <li> So far, for me, the Merkur blade is wonderful!</li>
            <li> So far, for me, the Merkur blade is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Good fit and finish for the price.  </li>
            <li> One of the most popular razors in the world.</li>
            <li> One motion with the 34C gets rid of more hair than the trendy 5 bladed junkers that I used to use.    </li>
            <li> It is by far the best shave that I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine was natural and the best for me, but was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> That being said the five free blades do good for starters, but I don&#x27;t think the blades where that grate</li>
            <li> I could shave my face to baby smooth, going with and then against the grain and have a good shave.  </li>
            <li> This thing is proof that sometimes the old ways are the best ways.</li>
            <li> Waiting on my Feather blades to arrive and hope they are worth the wait for a great shave.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades are cheap and I&#x27;m getting 20 good shaves out of a razor.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor order a sample pack and figure out what you like, not what is most popular.</li>
            <li> This model is the most popular of the safety razors according to online reading.</li>
            <li> I had a cheap Walmart DE razor and I loved it</li>
            <li> but wow,  this is the best investment you can get with shaving.  </li>
            <li> What a great shave, and so economical.</li>
            <li> The blade is held in securely and has good balance.  </li>
            <li> awesome, old school but sometimes old school was the best.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best razor</li>
            <li> Both the weight and length, in my opinion, provide a better sense of control when shaving, allowing for a closer shave and tighter lines if you&#x27;re wearing a beard or side burns of any kind.</li>
            <li> I enjoy giving myself a good shave.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t scream luxury or pricey like the Futur, but I honestly think I like it better.</li>
            <li> There are many who compare this to an Edwin Jagger DE89, which I also own (DE89LBL lined handle).</li>
            <li> Kind of a pain in the butt to change the blade case you have to unscrew the top part</li>
            <li> Best shave since I was 16 years old.</li>
            <li> If you like a good smooth shave, this and the quality blade of your choice (my choice was Personna) can deliver.</li>
            <li> Parker Badger Bristle Brush is amazingly soft and the Taylor Luxury Shaving Cream is superb...a magnificent combination to prepare your beard after showering.  </li>
            <li> Important to have a good blade with it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the most cost effective razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Today I used the feather blades and except for one or two nicks, my face was smooth and good to go.  </li>
            <li> The quality of this razor is outstanding, has a nice sturdy construction.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good, compact razor with good weight.</li>
            <li> New interesting but works great!</li>
            <li> it is a great beginner razor but still gets close with the right angle</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was nervous about using this razor at first, but it&#x27;s very easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li> Not as good as original Gillette</li>
            <li> This razor is absolutely nice, has a good solid weight to it, and beautiful finish.</li>
            <li> Good luck and have fun!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a great razor for accomplishing a great close shave.</li>
            <li> It smoothly slices off the hairs on its own, no tugging or pulling, and it feels like a nice shave after.</li>
            <li> The razor has a good weight to it, and feels way better in the hand than any cheap plastic razor.</li>
            <li> It looks great and is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is not to agressive but gets a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, good weight, good grip.</li>
            <li> This handle actually is thicker in than any razor I own and has perfect control.</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably in the hand, good weight distribution, and easy to clean, exceeds expectations!!</li>
            <li> Great beginners razor as this was my first safety razor purchase.</li>
            <li> I may eventually upgrade to the adjustable since you can get a closer shave, but for now I am pretty happy with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are interested in a closer shave, for yourself or the man in your life, I recommend this as a great gift idea.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE Safety Razor and it has been a great one to learn with.</li>
            <li> This is my first  Safety Razor and it has been a great one to learn with.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> Went to shaving101.com and read about what is a good starter razor and decided to go with the 34c because of the shorter handle and many justified outstanding reviews.</li>
            <li> Vintage Gillette razors for $10 are made of higher quality materials, but it does give a great shave.</li>
            <li> Great first purchase for those who want to try a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> Great first time razor</li>

            <li> Everything everyone else has said is true, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a good shave and is made with true craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> to clean, chrome is excellent, very durable, blade sits squarely and snug.  </li>
            <li> I now discover after shaving for 30 years with subpar results, that good preparation and using a decent safety razor &amp; good blades are a must.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use (have never cut myself), and actually is much more enjoyable to use than cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> I love the close shave it provides and how it is so easy to use!</li>
            <li> Fine tool indeed!</li>
            <li> Holds blade very securely.  </li>
            <li> I have to be very light with the pressure.</li>
            <li> It provides a very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just a very smooth razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am glade as the razor feels very comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and forgiving.</li>
            <li> Very cheap (relatively).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a beautiful razor, and with shaving oil, it&#x27;s capable of more than I&#x27;m doing with it.</li>
            <li> not a better shaver on the market - perfectly weighted, for great control and balance.</li>
            <li> It feels nice in the hand, and blades are easy to change out.</li>
            <li> You can use this thing with pressurized can shaving cream, it works good except it clogs quickly.</li>
            <li> Thing is, if I want a quick, really good shave, the cartridge is the \\&quot;no-fuss\\&quot; way to go.</li>
            <li> It has a nicely machined look to it and a knurled grip so it won&#x27;t easily slip in your hand.</li>
            <li> Nice weight, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Polsilver - Super Iridium do a good job.</li>
            <li> This Merkur razor is well balanced, fits nicely in your hands and is easy to use for newcomers to shaving with a DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to change the blades, cleans nicely.</li>
            <li> I would guess and to be honest I can get a pretty good shave with disposables.  </li>
            <li> I actually enjoy waking up and whipping up my lather and shaving; I can&#x27;t find a better way to wake up!  </li>
            <li> Conclusion, the Merkur is well built, easy to clean, nice quality - I&#x27;m very glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a first time user, it takes a while trying to find the right angle that&#x27;s going to give you the perfect shave.</li>
            <li> It offers the perfect balance and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> It has a very solid feel and good weight, and paired with a good razor blade (there are many to choose from, so find one that works for you) results in a very satisfying shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Hi: It is as I expected: beautifully crafted and gives me a very nice shave.</li>
            <li> It works great, easy to clean and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Shaves great, feels great in my hand and is easy to control due the nice hefty weight.  </li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> easier since I didn&#x27;t need to apply any more pressure than the razor already provided.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s waaay better shaving with this than cartridges...</li>
            <li> And as many people say the thing is that you don&#x27;t have to pressure it just let the weight of the shaver do its job.</li>
            <li> sure if this will work or not</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Blades are cheap!</li>
            <li> Blades are cheap!</li>
            <li> I will post more as I use it</li>
            <li> i found great reviews for this razor and decided to buy not knowing anything about straight razors.</li>
            <li> do your self a favor and get this razor and make shaving enjoyable rather than a task of the day.</li>
            <li> &quot; there can be no debate about which one performs better and gives you a better shave.  </li>
            <li> Feathers might be a bit risky for newbies, but are probably the most popular and perhaps sharpest blade available from what I gather.</li>
            <li> after using it for a month, I found the shaving experience much better than the Gillette fusion.</li>
            <li> He has a nice, close shave, which we both enjoy.</li>
            <li> A great alternative to the modern multi-blade methodology of shaving.  </li>
            <li> For those needing a more aggressive shave, think Merkur slant.</li>
            <li> How about paying 5 cents a week for razors and getting a better shave.</li>
            <li> The Bloc Osma alum block seemed like a good value, and it really does tighten up your skin nicely.    </li>
            <li> but once you try it, your will love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> as I&#x27;ve always viewed razors before, this is more of a premium quality tool.  </li>
            <li> There are so, so many types of skin and beards and preferences.  </li>
            <li> There are so, so many types of skin and beards and preferences.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent with a Feather double edge blade.</li>
            <li> and since I have to shave more often I wanted to invest in something that would not give me irritation.      </li>
            <li> on Youtube has excellent videos on how to shave properly.      </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a month now and let me tell you I honestly now ENJOY shaving each day -</li>
            <li> Another thing I love about DE shaving is the cost of blades.</li>
            <li> Shaving was one of those things and they had the best tool for the job, a simple and efficient razor that got the job done and did it well.</li>
            <li> Shaving was one of those things and they had the best tool for the job, a simple and efficient razor that got the job done and did it well.</li>
            <li> A nice heft that leads to a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Shaving immediately became an enjoyable experience, and I have a closer, better looking shave to boot.</li>
            <li> I used the vibrating Fusion before I switched to this, and many others before that.     </li>
            <li> Boy, am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> So glad i am no longer paying $15 for 4 blades.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.  </li>
            <li> Much better shave, no razor burn and bumps.  </li>
            <li> the cost, but  better than nothing.</li>
            <li> No tugging or yanking just a really satisfying close shave.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> I just took my time and it was actually enjoyable.    </li>
            <li> Very maneuverable, and leaves my face feeling great.</li>
            <li> i like being able to install a blade while holding the handle and not having to hold the head between my fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that most of the longer reviews are more about the experience of shaving than the product itself.  </li>
            <li> Switching is one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve made recently.</li>
            <li> I looked into different razors, but wanted to get a quality one, many sites said this was the best.</li>
            <li> but in use the Merkur just feels more in control.  </li>
            <li> It may be what people say, its slightly more aggressive.  </li>
            <li> for design I love the 2 piece approach.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased the HD.</li>
            <li> Best you can get.&lt;br /&gt;All German...</li>
            <li> Most educated opinions pointed to a Merkur safety razor as one of the finest razors money can buy, so I took a chance and ordered the 34C.    </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll get a better shave.</li>
            <li> quite possibly the best</li>
            <li> quite possibly the best</li>
            <li> I love the portability this size provides.    </li>
            <li> Overall, one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> I would give it a couple more stars if I were able.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too many blades does nothing more than drive up your monthly expenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Merkur safety razor is an excellent razor for anyone wanting to get started with more traditional shaving.</li>
            <li> My razor was over machined, and the top part isn&#x27;t square and curves toward the edge.</li>
            <li> So, just pick the one with the cheaper price and buy from a reputable seller.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite DE razor.</li>
            <li> The blade that comes with it is ok</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Because it is double-edged you get twice as many shaves as with any disposable.  </li>
            <li> The Schick gives me a lot better and smoother shave.</li>
            <li> bet it&#x27;s a much better shave with all the fancy soaps and brushes.      </li>
            <li> The Merkur&#x27;s design will last forever and never break and the shave is PERFECT.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Nice finish and fit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of durability, I think I did an okay job.</li>
            <li> I change my every 1 to 1/2 weeks, depending on how many times you shave in a week.</li>
            <li> Rinse off, use an alum bar or apply your favorite lotion or aftershave.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say I love it.  </li>
            <li> My hubby is totally satisfied with this razor.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad that I bought</li>
            <li> tried many electric razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a ok close shave to start</li>
            <li> LOVE shaving with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> Better blades keep blade from tugging.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> As soon as you master the shaving method, you will be quite pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> This 2-piece Merkur is much more dependable.  </li>
            <li> I love the design of this razor.</li>
            <li> Getting the razor has changed shaving all together for me, and I think of it as more of a relaxing and enjoyable experience than before.</li>
            <li> It has a longer handle and a bit more heft to it.</li>
            <li> Okay, it&#x27;s been awhile now.  </li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> He said his ingrown hairs have reduced a bit and his skin feels better.</li>
            <li> One hundred blades will last me two years and it is the best deal.</li>
            <li> Merkur and like it better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a bit worried about switching to a safety razor as I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d end up with all kinds of nicks.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t shave but during the work week) just to keep them healthy.</li>
            <li> Save you some cash and just stick with your favorite canned cream.</li>
            <li> The Gillette twin blade pivot gives me a better shave and that includes the multi blade razors.</li>
            <li> I thought each update of their razor would bring a better shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Glad I ordered refills along with it.</li>
            <li> The short handle doesn&#x27;t bother me at all since it fits me perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this razor one week ago and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I picked this up on the advice of the Badger and Blade forms and am quite pleased with the product as a hole, the razor is well built and after using it for three months</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor several years ago from Amazon and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the close shave.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> bought this when I decided to start using a safety razor again(I started on one and then switched to a gillette, many years ago) to see if I still like it.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.  </li>
            <li> A lot more enjoyable with soap and a badger brush than canned cream and your fingers.</li>
            <li> It makes for a better cut.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> As for blades, I went with the Amazon top reviewed and bought the Feathers.</li>
            <li> but when you get used to it, you will love it because you can swing the razor in all positions easily.&lt;br /&gt;9)</li>
            <li> I purchased this after many days of research.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this one and not the longer version.</li>
            <li> and it was a good shave and the free ones ihad received look cheap</li>
            <li> The Feather blades were noticeably better than the Astra and Derby blades, in all 3 razors.  </li>
            <li> Outstanding value for the price too.  </li>
            <li> It feels ok.  </li>
            <li> While I did not care for the blades that came with the razor, I absolutely love the razor itself.  </li>
            <li> magic shave, mach 3, Fusion (or</li>
            <li> Using Art of Shaving products and Merkur blades, I&#x27;m able to get a close shave with no razor burn/bumps.  </li>
            <li> This was a return to an earlier time and it still works great!  </li>
            <li> sure why but a DE sided razor came to mind</li>
            <li> but I think alot more people should use.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a great compromise between straight razor shaving and cost.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Lasted 5 years until the top broke off.</li>
            <li> Also, on a side note - the handle unscrews from the bottom of the razor, not the top.  </li>
            <li> Which translates to sharper blades and better shaves on the cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice and light in my hand.  </li>
            <li> better personally.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , make sure to use soap or else it won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> i am satisfied from product</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> Fantastic razor!  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> it more and more wih every use. ^_^</li>
            <li> But faster or a better shave?</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> Take the plunge, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> My Fiance&#x27; said, Best present ever!</li>
            <li> I love this razor and the blade that came with it.</li>
            <li> This straight razor is really, really great.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a great razor that didn&#x27;t cost a whole lot.</li>
            <li> more than 3 shaves</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> so I am learning, but I am extremely pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.</li>
            <li> They give a great, close shave, and are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> it cause more break outs?</li>
            <li> you are on the fence and have the time and money, I recommend adding 2 to 5 minutes to your shave time for a better, cheaper</li>
            <li> and I find it more enjoyable shave experience.  </li>
            <li> could have been better.  </li>
            <li> This is a FANTASTIC razor!</li>
            <li> This will probably be my most used and favorite razor.</li>
            <li> The blade that came with it is okay</li>
            <li> but the Persona Blades seem to work better in it.</li>
            <li> Words cannot describe how pleased I am with this razor.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving a much more rewarding activity; more relaxing as well.  </li>
            <li> cost of blades is much more acceptable as well.  </li>
            <li> I used Feather razor and I love how it shaves.</li>
            <li> I purchased a variety pack of blades and have decided the best for me is the Derby DE blades, although many others worked well too, only a couple I didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> The biggest difference in the quality of your shave with this razor will be from the blade, because the razor itself is tip top.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There had to be a better way.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using a EJ 89LBL for a bit now because most reviews said the Merkur 34C HD was too aggressive of a shaver.</li>
            <li> I love the way it shaves.</li>
            <li> and have been completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> no matter how many whiskers we had on our face,</li>
            <li> Then I re-lather and slide the razor against the grain, once again allowing the weight of the razor do the work and I have a nice comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> #34;it was the best shave of my life&amp;#34;, but my cheeks aren&#x27;t sophisticated enough to know the difference...</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many better razors to learn with.</li>
            <li> Double Edge Razor #34C because of the excellent feedback after doing a lot of research.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the better purchases I&#x27;ve made.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, the cost savings I&#x27;m experiencing using this razor instead of the Gillette line is astonishing.  </li>
            <li> my wife and I agree that the Merkur gives me a much better shave than the Gillette Mach 5 system.  </li>
            <li> This one is recommended by most sites I&#x27;ve read</li>
            <li> Solid design and quality blades have resulted in my best shaves ever.</li>
            <li> After the many reviews I decided to take a shot</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> That has dissipated, so either I&#x27;m getting better at it or</li>
            <li> I am really glad that I decided to buy the Merkur 34c.</li>
            <li> and I now realize that it was a more aggresive razor.</li>
            <li> I love the quality</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading reviews on many razors, I decided to splurge on this one.</li>
            <li> a simple but elegant look and a perfectly knurled handle</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m also completely satisfied with the Merkur 34C HD.</li>
            <li> My plan is to shower and shave at night this week to get more practice.</li>
            <li> The Merkur HD is a safe bet for all beggining DE razor shavers out there.</li>
            <li> and I have not gotten many nicks.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> I had m 4th shave with it tonight and each time it&#x27;s getting better and better.</li>
            <li> The more you use it, the better you&#x27;ll become.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am completely pleased with my purchase and have since been trying to my friends to also purchase this razor.</li>
            <li> The top unscrews and comes off.</li>
            <li> I wish more stuff was made like this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Order more with the razor.</li>
            <li> He shaves a lot more often than he used to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better for the environment than disposables, too.</li>
            <li> Ordered after reading reviews for many razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I went with this.  </li>
            <li> I still utilize my Gillette multiblade razor for a better shave.</li>
            <li> Its not too aggressive nor too safe.</li>
            <li> After two months of shaving with this I haven&#x27;t nicked or cut myself once, and I love the shave.  </li>
            <li> Been using for about 8 months and love it.</li>
            <li> Are you ready for a great shave?</li>
            <li> In fact, you&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
            <li> I could not be more satasfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I am trying different blades to find the perfect match.  </li>
            <li> I am now using a Weber and it is much better made and gives smoother shaves.</li>
            <li> It is a two piece design with the handle and comb guard as one piece and the top of the head removes to change out blades.</li>
            <li> The Merkur blade that comes with this razor is not the sharpest or most forgiving blade on the market.</li>
            <li> So glad I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I love the shave.</li>
            <li> and it sure did.</li>
            <li> Over all its ok a littlesmaller than im used to</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s actual shaving qualities, but it looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting a better shave with a cheaper razor.</li>
            <li> and I get a much better shave than with a multi edge.</li>
            <li> It sits on my granite counter-top without touching the blade to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for a month and love it.</li>
            <li> Much better shave than a disposable or electric razor</li>
            <li> The balance, weight, ease of shave transforms the shaving chore to an enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li> This razor works much better for me and my face.  </li>
            <li> Outstanding razor.</li>
            <li> I used to use this type of shavers many years ago as a teenager, then moved on to gillette excel (two blades) and then 3 blades.  </li>
            <li> but now I get them a lot more.)  </li>
            <li> Safe to say though it was all hype.</li>
            <li> The weight and size is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> This truly is a durable razor that will last a lifetime of flawless shaves if you maintain it.</li>
            <li> Despite what the ads say, women don&#x27;t want it, and it just provides more things for your body chemistry to reject.</li>
            <li> That by itself will give you a MUCH better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not using an axe anymore, it&#x27;s more like a trusty knife.</li>
            <li> You MAY have to pay a bit more attention to what you&#x27;re doing, but if you&#x27;re a guy like me who has had to deal with bumps/irritation for years, you already were.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Construction of the Merkur 34C is top notch.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.  </li>
            <li> So much better than disposables.  </li>
            <li> Love this razor.  </li>
            <li> Shaves as well as your favorite 17 blade cartridge.</li>
            <li> Much better.</li>
            <li> After my son read many reviews and about razors.</li>
            <li> Thank you for offering such a great product!</li>
            <li> Much better than my multi-blade disposable.</li>
            <li> This used to be THE razor, and many articles still point to it.</li>
            <li> I switched from cartridges as they were not giving a close shave any more.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I&#x27;ve thoroughly enjoyed - and frankly look forward to - shaving with this product.</li>
            <li> This Merkur razor shaves more deliberately than a proglide.  </li>
            <li> With the shorter handle, I feel there is more control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more for my sons.</li>
            <li> the shaver works but after almost 9 months of trying out many blades I gave up.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s okay, though.</li>
            <li> Great weight, really allows you to avoid applying pressure.</li>
            <li> Top notch.</li>
            <li> and I have never gotten a better shave.</li>
            <li> Both are great products and are very forgiving on my face.  </li>
            <li> Once you find a brand of blade that works best for your facial hair/skin, you will notice the difference.  </li>
            <li> I love the thought of saving money on razor blades.  </li>
            <li> Sure it&#x27;s not the 5 blade razor that I was</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> The screw in the handle loosens the top of the razor which is removed</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Have had this blade for a couple months now, and love the transition from the Mach 3 to this blade.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> the 34 is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use for a beginner and looks great.</li>
            <li> But I view this as investing in a skill that helps me know myself better, take better care of my skin, and feel more manly and confident.  </li>
            <li> Overall very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I chose the shorter handle as it also allows better control.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go to razor amongst many.</li>
            <li> and I love mine.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Shaving doesn&#x27;t take any more time than it did before.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.</li>
            <li> Will spur more razor purchases</li>
            <li> That may be why I use it more.  </li>
            <li> make sure you try it with a diff blade</li>
            <li> I ended up giving this to a buddy and buying the 38 hd which was much, much better</li>
            <li> Not going to lie, but it gets that baby smooth feel!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quite pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I plan on holding onto it for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Quality that should last a lifetime...add a feather blade and experience an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to use the rasor yet because the blade had a nit</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t as for more from a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I looked into the best bang for my buck with shaving and kept coming back to safety razors.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> This razor is okay not my favorite, but i will still leave it in my rotation.</li>
            <li> I used the Feather butterfly for more than 2 years.</li>
            <li> but it got the touches started to change and thus after reading so many reviews, I have decided to choose this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> my &#x27;grandpa&#x27; used to use, because as things go on they are supposed to get better</li>
            <li> and it is so much better than those fancy disposable blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Be ready to bleed at frist lol</li>
            <li> Much better shave than when I have to use a disposable head system.</li>
            <li> I find that the Persona blades work the best for me; but the safety blade itself is a personal choice.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I went with the Merkur 34C and have been nothing but pleased.  </li>
            <li> Dip the ends in a bit of water if you need more.</li>
            <li> :) I</li>
            <li> And the razor is good quality and worth</li>
            <li> Some much better than those multi-bladed razors.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get use to this.</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy shaving now!</li>
            <li> I get a much better shave with this than a fusion.  </li>
            <li> When using an Astra or 7 o&#x27;clock I get a nice smooth shave and the blades are cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it .</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Performance is top notch</li>
            <li> but wonder why I messed around with all those pricey shaving systems for so many years.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I love it...</li>
            <li> But I love this razor.</li>
            <li> But I use this Merkur the most.</li>
            <li> I hope they&#x27;re enjoying it</li>
            <li> But eventually, I wanted something more substantial.  </li>
            <li> The price to quality ratio of this razor is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Outstanding razor.</li>
            <li> Razor works well, however I chose a more aggressive razor.</li>
            <li> Requires more prep time and attention</li>
            <li> My technique is gradually getting better and there is a difference in blades used.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It is simply the best shaving appliance that I have ever used!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVE shaving now.</li>
            <li> Outstanding quality for price.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try a Merkur with a shorter handle to see if I could get better control and balance.</li>
            <li> but if you go and buy the cgeapest bladrs you can find youll get a better shave</li>
            <li> Love this razor.</li>
            <li> Much better than the electric i switched from.</li>
            <li> The shorter handle is supposed to be more forgiving</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> so you get a warm smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This razor is top quality.</li>
            <li> Too many ingrown hairs, razor burn,</li>
            <li> I love it for its utility, for the replacement blade cost, and its durability.</li>
            <li> So I did some online research and found many people recommending safety razors, if for nothing than for their affordability.</li>
            <li> After, the second shave, I got the feel of it and am now getting the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from any razor.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to buying bulk premium blades online and saving even more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People on forums said the 34c is more aggressive than the DE89...</li>
            <li> I Was under the impression that it would hold up better than that.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Still testing the blades out to find my favorite.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because I like it but dont love it yet.</li>
            <li> I am well pleased with the 34C.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying shaving with this razor, it takes three passes but the shave is close and does not irritate my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get an enjoyable shave</li>
            <li> A friend told me about Merkur and glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this.</li>
            <li> I also get a lot better shave while in the shower after having washed my face.</li>
            <li> sure there are better razors out there</li>
            <li> Having the screw at the bottom makes changing blades easier and faster than the top screw of the Jagger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish it had a bit more heft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably go with it in hopes of getting a greater heft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;m satisfied, pleased with it, and glad that I got it.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to get a safety razor, I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with it.</li>
            <li> A much more enjoyable shaving experience than using disposable multi-blades razors.</li>
            <li> I have not cut or nicked myself one time :).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with it :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I did, and now shaving has become almost a hobby and something I look forward to doing instead of</li>
            <li> the shaves are much better.  </li>
            <li> It is not my favorite</li>
            <li> I think the Jagger manufacturing quality is slightly better than the Merkur.</li>
            <li> The best and most used double edge razor in the market.</li>
            <li> As in most cases, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Based on the Futur, I wasn&#x27;t sure that DE shaving was for me.  </li>
            <li> It comes with one Merkur blade which was perfectly okay to me</li>
            <li> like the way that it is a 2 piece over most others are a 3 piece.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is absolutely better than the cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> Merkur is the best razor I was shaving with in my entire life.</li>
            <li> Most of my life I used Gillette razors, butterfly, adjustable and ball-end.  </li>
            <li> much better for the skin....</li>
            <li> BUT IT IS STILL VERY EFFECTIVE AND EASY TO USE WITH MY VERY LARGE HANDS.</li>
            <li> Provides a great shave and is pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> A multi-pack with an assortment of blades would be a good purchase as well so that you can try out other manufacturers and find the best fit for your skin and beard type.</li>
            <li> A multi-pack with an assortment of blades would be a good purchase as well so that you can try out other manufacturers and find the best fit for your skin and beard type.</li>
            <li> *Now, I understand, that all you need is this safety razor, the right technique and a good blade.    </li>
            <li> Item came really quick and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because I didn&#x27;t really know what I was doing, but many blogs recommended this razor as the best for a rookie, and I&#x27;m glad I went with it.  </li>
            <li> Very nice and capable razor for the money.  </li>
            <li> But very nice shave, very proffesional looking.</li>
            <li> this was my first DE razor and is still one of my favorites!!!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty cheap razor that has a great reputation for the most part.</li>
            <li> The Merkur that came with is very sharp and gives a great shave, have Persona now, and they are OK, but not that great as they could be sharper.</li>
            <li> you are thinking about getting into classic shaving, this is a great place to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Great grip, decent heft,</li>
            <li> It is a snap to clean and you just twist off the handle and run warm water over it.</li>
            <li> What a nice feeling in the hand, smooth threads inside promote easy and safe blade changes.</li>
            <li> For best results, you have to shave against the grain with it -- that&#x27;s why the shorter-handle version is better than the long handle.  </li>
            <li> But shaves are clean and nice</li>
            <li> close shave well made decent price great starter.</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s fit and finish is perfect, not a single flaw that I can find.  </li>
            <li> The whole ritual involved with the shaving is a bit more pleasant and well,</li>
            <li> I just love it, it fells good on my hand,  right size and a very close shave, price was good</li>
            <li> He has thick,curly,course hair and it gives a very clean close shave.</li>
            <li> I get a very clean shave (closer than Excel) without any irritation.</li>
            <li> It looks VERY CLEAN as WELL.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy that clean feeling from a good shave, I would strongly recommend that you give this a try.</li>
            <li> In all honesty I did take a pretty good chunk of skin off my face, but there is bound to be a learning curve.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t cut myself, but I could tell I could dice up my digits pretty good if I got in a hurry.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;d always thought my cartridge razor experience was pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is a good beginner razor, but at this price I would expect higher quality.</li>
            <li> Pretty good results.</li>
            <li> and I get just as good a shave with this as the higher end disposable cartridges (I know somebody will take issue with me not immediately saying that &amp;</li>
            <li> I wrote a review about a week after I got this, and I loved it, first de safety every had</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t buy the cheapest blades I can find, I&#x27;ve been using the feather blades which from all the reviews I could find had a pretty good rating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming that anyone who is interested in this type of product has already taken the time to pursue a good prep (i.e. soak,brush, lather, quality after-shave treatment etc.)</li>
            <li> While the Merkur may not be quite as pretty as the EJ, I find it to be functionally superior in a couple of ways.  </li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor, and seems like a good one for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used a Gillet Mach 3 and it was probably the best cartridge I have used and was smooth if I rubbed my face after shaving in one direction, but after shaving with this my face is literally \\&quot;baby bottom smooth\\&quot; in all directions, even my wife is surprised at how smooth my face is.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> and now I know why it is built well and sturdy with perfect weight if you like a long handle</li>
            <li> The first shave with a 34C, however, proved to me that I made a good move switching to a DE razor.  </li>
            <li> Well it was very easy to use and gave me the closest most comfortable shave ever-even closer and more comfortable than my Gillette Fusion Power.</li>
            <li> A fine German made razor that does a great job on my face!  </li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of weight for a great shave and is so easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my choice because this  razor is right there in the middle of the road for me on how it shaves, its amazing.</li>
            <li> new to \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaving, but this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> I used a brand new blade but didnt have a great soap</li>
            <li> Unlike twist-to-open designs, razors like this Merkur have a top cap which allows for easy navigation around the nose.</li>
            <li> Great razor, shaves very close and comfortably.</li>
            <li> Good quality good weight and will last a life time</li>
            <li> and it was comfortable and just a generally more enjoyable experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought my 21 yr old son his own and were good to go.</li>
            <li> But honestly, for the money and for ease was great and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Very well made, fit &amp; finish flawless, nice weight, very natural feel in the hand.</li>
            <li> The razor rinses clean very easily and you can just let the weight of the razor do the work.</li>
            <li> Excellent, close shave with a single blade.</li>
            <li> However, before treading into cut-throat territory I would strongly advise that you research, research, research and understand straight razor mechanics, angles, movements, maintenance and cost!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really more cosmetic than anything else as the razor works fine --</li>
            <li> Gillette Super Speed.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to clean, shines bright and holds the blade</li>
            <li> The Personnas are fine but the Feathers might be even better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Design:  I like that the design is simple and straightforward, and I appreciate its perfect balance.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely love to try any of their other products, because I&#x27;ve been so impressed with this.</li>
            <li> The Merkur 34C is the heftiest of all, it is the best manufactured of the 4, however also costs 5X more than the other 3 razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Edwin Jagger on the other hand feels elegant and flawless</li>
            <li> This razors works perfectly for removing it when I go back to a clean shaven look.  </li>
            <li> Very good product, I use it daily</li>
            <li> It is definitely not as close of a shave for me as the futur, but still very good.  </li>
            <li> Very good quality and solidly built razor.</li>
            <li> Take your time, get a good badger brush, some high quality shaving soap or shaving cream, and do something you may not have done in years -- enjoy shaving again!    </li>
            <li> This is a great razor and I enjoyed my first shave very much.  </li>
            <li> Try a DE, you will get a wonderful shave and possible develop nostalgia for those simpler times when men were proud to be men and life involved reminders of what is meant to be a man in daily life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try a DE, you will get a wonderful shave and possible develop nostalgia for those simpler times when men were proud to be men and life involved reminders of what is meant to be a man in daily life.    </li>
            <li> They say to let the weight of the razor to do most of the work, so the weight is important.  </li>
            <li> Incredible double edged razor.  </li>
            <li> So far great on all counts.</li>
            <li> This razor combined with Merkur&#x27;s double edged platinum blades is an excellent shave that is far closer and superior to anything I have ever pulled off before.</li>
            <li> + S&amp;H. For me, not only is this a financially awesome change up, but the quality is far superior as well.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that this razor has been raved as the best go to razor by wet shavers all across the board.</li>
            <li> While the Feather blades are sharper (more nicks) but the Merkur blade is fantastic and lasted me about 10 days without any issues.</li>
            <li> so I have nothing to compare it to, but so far its been great.</li>
            <li> I was becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the quality of shave</li>
            <li> I am still mastering the art of wet shaving, but this is an excellent tool for learning mastery!</li>
            <li> The razor itself is a lot shorter than the parker, but it seems to fit better in my hand.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching my face since it is so smooth after using this.</li>
            <li> My first de safety razor, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I use Nivea sensitive shave gel and get a great shave.</li>
            <li> My skin felt smooth and healthy with no irritation.</li>
            <li> And enjoy a better, closer shave while you&#x27;re at it.</li>
            <li> As perfect a shave as I expected.</li>
            <li> Fit and finish is top notch.</li>
            <li> Just remember, the most important step of ALL is applying a pre-shave oil (I use Art of Shaving Sandalwood).  </li>
            <li> This razor has a very nice heavy feel to it and with a good blade is a very comfortable shaving instrument.</li>
            <li> But so far, it works great.  </li>
            <li> This feels sturdier and works great so far.</li>
            <li> That was a much better pairing and I got a smooth shave with no nicks.</li>
            <li> I have the Feather Light also which is much more money</li>
            <li> The razor that came with it gave me the closest most comfortable shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I have a knock off because I do own a Merkur 38C safety razor and that shaves wonderfully.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The most important part is #3.</li>
            <li> check it out and enjoy your morning BBS (Baby Butt Smooth) shave!</li>
            <li> This is coming from a person who use to use a Dovo Best Quality Straight Razor; straight razors give fantastic shaves *</li>
            <li> This is coming from a person who use to use a Dovo Best Quality Straight Razor; straight razors give fantastic shaves *</li>
            <li> Thanks good razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try to move onto straight edge razors as this is as good as a shave as I could ask for.</li>
            <li> it feels really good in the hand, it has weight to it which make the shave very reassuring.</li>
            <li> It works well with either blade if I take my time, and those blades are very inexpensive, the derby&#x27;s are about a dime a piece when bought in bulk, and they are good for three or four shaves.</li>
            <li> The Derby blade provides a good shave and is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Mach 3 cartridge razor my whole life, and decided to get into DE shaving after reading a really good article, talking about the benefits.</li>
            <li> As you shave more and more, you&#x27;ll get better shaves as you&#x27;ll start to have a feel of the right angles.</li>
            <li> Just got it today and used it right away, Great shave, first time away from the multi blade type razors.</li>
            <li> While the Edwin Jagger DE89 falls more decidedly in the mild category, the Merkur 34C is more balanced in terms of aggressiveness.</li>
            <li> The razor has a real nice heft to it, and blade installment is easy (and you only have to do it once every 2-3 weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels very well-made, with a good weight to it in your hand and an easy glide.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a high quality razor that you can pass down to your son this is a good choice, if you just want a good cheap shave I would recommend the utopia or feather popular razors as they will provide an equally good shave for the non-conneseur.</li>
            <li> The shortness is kind of a plus, however, when getting the area right under your nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Merkur razor looks very nice and shiny but just like my 2 year old BMW -</li>
            <li> Honestly, the transition to Shaving The Right Way with this Merkur was easy.</li>
            <li> Besides being easy to use and giving a smooth enjoyable shave, it exudes the quality and refinement of a finely crafted tool.</li>
            <li> Other than that its a great buy!</li>
            <li> As this is my first DE razor, I love it!</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and I gotta say, I enjoy shaving!!</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I LOVE SHAVING!</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the shaving experience!  </li>
            <li> Great looking, easy to clean, easy to install new razors.  </li>
            <li> The handle is easy to manipulate around my face.</li>
            <li> I use it as my daily shaver and couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning is incredibly easy</li>
            <li> Cleaning is incredibly easy   Razor won&#x27;t clog with hair like cartridges do    </li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy, then, to recommend this.a value.  </li>
            <li> Easy, then, to recommend this.</li>
            <li> but it makes easy to maneuver in the groin area.</li>
            <li> Sharpening is just as easy as unscrew, pop off, insert, and tighten.</li>
            <li> Easy blade handling.</li>
            <li> And it is just as easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace blades.  </li>
            <li> Merkur also uses forged steel, so it shouldn&#x27;t snap as easily</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Quality build, easy maintenance &amp;  </li>
            <li> Easy to change the blade.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy control / manufacturability...</li>
            <li> Blades are easy to change, shave is close and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ......then my brother bought the Rick Harrison Micro Touch DE razor at wallmart and its 100000 times better, easier to clean, just twist and rinse.  </li>
            <li> The razor is well balanced and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> or if i have a bump on my face i can easily shave around it.</li>
            <li> So while I have close to no experience, this must be an easy to use razor.</li>
            <li> Easy to manuever around cleft and chin areas.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner using double sided razor blades but this does a great job of convincing me to switch over.</li>
            <li> 5 to 8 shaves per blade easily</li>
            <li> The heft of the razor makes shaving easier as it is easy to avoid applying pressure.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and maneuver.</li>
            <li> Have easily convinced my son this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I was suprised at how easy it is to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and heavy-duty.</li>
            <li> Easy to change blades.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with thus razor and can see why it has such a great reputation.</li>
            <li> It is easy to change the blades.</li>
            <li> so its easy to hold while using.</li>
            <li> makes it easy for me.</li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> Well built, easy to use, and just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The blade drops into the Merkur easily and tightens without issue.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning is incredibly easy</li>
            <li> the way, I chose this particular model because a lot of people have mentioned that it&#x27;s a good way to start with a &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; (or double-edge, DE) razor.  </li>
            <li> This is a great razor to start with if you want to see if this kind of shaving is for you, not very expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this product to any and every man.</li>
            <li> Overall the razor is nice and seems of good quality.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about this razor that hasn&#x27;t already been said - it&#x27;s a great introduction to the world of double-edge shaving, and DE shaving in general is a vastly more pleasant (and cost effective) alternative to cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> Its highly recommended to use good shaving soap(Proraso</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was highly regarded as a good DE razor for beginners, and it did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> It is best to shave with a double edge right after stepping out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> This razor was so outstanding right Out Of The Box!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nicely built, lives up to its HEAVY DUTY title nicely, but will more than likely handle this like porcelain just because it is a maintenance tool, and any self respecting man maintains and makes sure their tools are in the best working condition to reduce the chance of failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure to go for the full effect with a brush and shaving</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s true what most of people say:</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and I am loving this new-to-me but very-old-school style of shaving.</li>
            <li> Warm up the razor in hot water before using.</li>
            <li> Buy a styptic pencil and keep it handy at first.</li>
            <li> That is until this simple, beautiful razor landed at my door.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised,well built and nice weight</li>
            <li> but still provides a close shave for me in two passes (WTG/XTG) using an average at best blade.</li>
            <li> But first impression was nice.</li>
            <li> If you let it stay in warm to hot water it retains that temperature on the blade</li>
            <li> First shave was nice.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor, so take my review with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;It works nice mechanically.</li>
            <li> The blades that came with it are super clean and leave a nice smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> and once I glided this down my cheek,  it feel awesome.</li>
            <li> Easy to use; comfortable in the hand; easy to work around sideburns and neck.  </li>
            <li> Nice, good simple construction, solid weight, and great angle on the blade.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the razor seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> As a first time buyer of a safety razor, I looked at a lot of options, and weighed whether to get the longer handled model or not -- for me, the short handle works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> When it finally arrived I promptly fired up a scalding hot shower while visions of the perfect shave danced in my head.</li>
            <li> just fine</li>
            <li> It took me about a minute or two to get the hang of the angle and the short handle, but came away with the best and closest shave on my first try.  </li>
            <li> Shaves fine.</li>
            <li> But, my technique for a safety razor is just fine.</li>
            <li> The shave I get with a safety razor is just fine.</li>
            <li> but I still manged just fine with this one.</li>
            <li> worked fine , no problems.</li>
            <li> This is a fine, quality piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> The strokes were easy and pain free, and the result was closer than Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heavy, looks beautiful, and fits nicely in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> and it gives a fine shave.  </li>
            <li> Some may prefer the longer handle version, but this works fine for yrs trly.</li>
            <li> Razor fine.</li>
            <li> and this works fine for me.</li>
            <li> This DE razor makes it easy to get a close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Not as fine shaving as it claims to have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> That worked fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine a quality as one you&#x27;d find at the mall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 2 piece, which is fine by me.</li>
            <li> My first one was a cheap one($10) from a beauty supply store to see if I even liked it.</li>
            <li> Seeing as it is the first DE razor I have used, have two more on order, once give those a try can give a better assessment of how it stacks up.</li>
            <li> Fine online and some skin conditioners.</li>
            <li> It is not a slight improvement but a remarkably improved shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> It is super safe</li>
            <li> If it had been too mild or too aggressive on both sides, it would be OK and you could deal with it.</li>
            <li> The Merkur 34c is the way to go, smooth shave, easy to use, easy to install the blade and the short handle works great.</li>
            <li> It gives me a perfect shave and actually makes me enjoy the task - a first since I began shaving decades ago.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a perfect shave and actually makes me enjoy the task - a first since I began shaving decades ago.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives a wonderful, close shave that I certainly prefer to any of my previous cartridge razors (I used shavemob before, which I liked).</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a brush, bowl and shaving soap kit, hopefully the combination of tools will make the shaving experience more pleasant.</li>
            <li> It is mild and forgiving, great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Blades are easy to change, the styling of the razor is attractive, and so far the feel for the quality is very high (weight, finish, precision of parts fitting together).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to DE safety razor shaving, and happy to have found the right combination of razor, blade, soap, brush and after shave that works for me.</li>
            <li> Finding the correct angle was a little tricky, but once I got it, it worked awesome.</li>
            <li> I would prefer the handle to be a little longer,  but all together it is a wonderful tool.</li>
            <li> this little puppy is awesome!  </li>
            <li> I can certainly see why it is the favorite of so many.</li>
            <li> I have large hands but even though it is short it performs flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Thinking of getting a few more as gifts for my brother and my very good friends.</li>
            <li> I can tell you that some blades that got very good reviews did not turn out to be my favorites, at least not with this razor and my own conditions.</li>
            <li> The quality is excellent and it gives me a shave that is as good if not better than the high priced Mach 3&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I did really rush it tonight and got a little more irritation than I had been, but it seems to be a more forgiving learning curve than the straights, and a great way to get a better shave than disposables, at a better price point.</li>
            <li> The razor is very solidly built, feels great in your hands and performs a smooth shave without any nicks.</li>
            <li> I ended up with a huge cut on the side of my chin, and I still have the scar from it.</li>
            <li> He said it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Not that it was a huge problem before, but I would always get one or two when using the Fusion.  </li>
            <li> There is kind of an art to shaving with a double edge without getting cuts, but once you master it, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> That was a huge relief.  </li>
            <li> A huge plus.  </li>
            <li> I tried the razor with the feather blades and what a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li> gives him a smooth shave, does not cause any razor burn, and is so easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Which is a huge departure from anything I ever had before.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Definitely watch those great Youtube shaving videos.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy it</li>
            <li> the blades it came with did the job, but i will experiment with others as soon as i need them, and replacement blades are CHEAP compared to cartridges.</li>
            <li> My primary shaving method before the switch as an electric razor, and while there may be a debate about which is \\&quot;greener\\</li>
            <li> important note though:</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li> Solid built with great balance.</li>
            <li> I will enjoy this for years to come.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and works great.</li>
            <li> It delivers a smooth, comfortable, irritation-free shave.</li>
            <li> The shave is smooth as any cartridge razor and I no longer have issues with rash.</li>
            <li> It did NOT come with the 5 free advertised blades, but who cares?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this Merkur for a few years now, and just wanted to say it&#x27;s excellent!</li>
            <li> lightly-</li>
            <li> but it works great with a regular gel.</li>
            <li> But the quality of the shave was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This razor, using one double-edged blade, has greatly reduced my ingrown hairs, which I understand can happen more frequently with modern cartridge or disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave is amazing, my irritation is virtually nil, it is cheaper than cartridges, and it makes you feel like a real man.</li>
            <li> I still have a damn smooth face and neck.</li>
            <li> so I could get a comfortable shave when I was in a rush.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect everyday razor.  </li>
            <li> This razor is a great upgrade to the no name brand safety razor sold by the giant retailers.  </li>
            <li> It feels solid and balanced in the hand, and gives a great shave experience.</li>
            <li> Its easy to clean and change blades.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean</li>
            <li> amazing razor , if you use the platinum tip blades , you will get the best shave every , i had the Gillette fusion and and its incredible how expensive the razors are , you will be saving alot of money by switching to this razor , you can get 100 blades that will last you years just for 30 bucks...</li>
            <li> It has been great, especially when using a brush, Proraso shaving cream, and Feather blades.</li>
            <li> Paired with the Shark blade I get a smooth close shave with no irritation every time.</li>
            <li> The Merkur Heavy Duty (34C) is a great place to start your education and your liberation!</li>
            <li> It feels secure and well anchored in my hand.  </li>
            <li> Baby face smooth.</li>
            <li> The smooth edge can, and will cause the razor jump or skid, resulting in a knick.  </li>
            <li> One thing that I&#x27;ve learned is that the lotion is critically important.  </li>
            <li> the blade do the work.&lt;br /&gt;Secret is use a medium pressure or light</li>
            <li> use light pressure.  </li>
            <li> Just use light pressure.  </li>
            <li> Look no further, it is great.</li>
            <li> I will update later on if the chrome peeling others have experienced happens to me</li>
            <li> you only need one and this one is GREAT.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate the guys that take their time to do these reviews in a detailed manner.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much</li>
            <li> Fantastic balance</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and they all liked it because it was a Merkur not to mention the modern styling.</li>
            <li> I was even thinking of this 34C in gold plating, but I also read reviews of the gold plate chipping and fading away which will make it look cheap.</li>
            <li> I was even thinking of this 34C in gold plating, but I also read reviews of the gold plate chipping and fading away which will make it look cheap.</li>
            <li> You simply won&#x27;t believe how great it will make your face look and feel.</li>
            <li> But I figured out that my dad used the cheap store bought foam instead of a quality product like TOBS shave cream.  </li>
            <li> Blades are equally as important.  </li>
            <li> important note is that the razor blade you choose makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Just made the switch from electric to DE shaving and I have seen the light.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too cheap to want to replace cartridges as often as you&#x27;re supposed to -</li>
            <li> Get it, buy a brush and soap shaving cream as well and enjoy the art of shaving.</li>
            <li> his face is so smooth.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the weight of the handle and the durability of the Merkur blades.  </li>

            <li> I need plenty of time and not be in a rush to enjoy using this razor.</li>
            <li> However I couldn&#x27;t not ever get a comfortable shave.</li>

            <li> When I want a GREAT close shave, I have MY Merkur 34C, and Japanese blades.</li>
            <li> I decided to try shaving with a DE safety razor after being repulsed by the cost and styling of the Gillette cartridge razors (what kind of man wants to shave with something that looks like a character from a Transformers movie?)</li>
            <li> A couple strokes on my cheek is all it took to find the angle and get just as comfortable shaving in this</li>
            <li> There is no part or detail on this razor which feels cheap or disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cut smoothly and did not cause any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush is cheap and huge.</li>
            <li> It has plenty of weight to provide a comfortable shave too.</li>
            <li> The Merkur 34C fit the bill.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, blades are ridiculously cheap.</li>
            <li> Amazingly smooth goodness your partner will appreciate.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, maintain.</li>
            <li> My wife has also noticed that my face has been exceptionally smooth on some occasions (still in the learning</li>
            <li> Fantastic razor.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s best when used everyday or with stubble.  </li>
            <li> Great price because this razor is offered at The Art of Shaving for double what you pay on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even bought a few as gifts and everyone has been equaly as impressed with the product.</li>
            <li> The shave was exceptionally smooth.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it will save me tons of money since replacement razor blades are so cheap compared to cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> I used the feather type blades and will admit that I have had the best few shaves with this item that I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I shave my head as well and there is no place I can&#x27;t get to for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Razor too course for light beards.  </li>
            <li> The handle looks cheaply made to me.</li>
            <li> Smooth razor.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of the razor in my hand.  </li>
            <li> comfortably shave with and against the grain with this razor.</li>
            <li> Fantastic razor.</li>
            <li> After having a 5 O&#x27;Clock shadow at 2:00 PM, this give a smooth close shave that lasts the day.</li>
            <li> It feels like a TOOL, not some cheap plastic &amp;#34;beauty product&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> And the blades are cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happily using an Edwin Jagger DE razor for several months now.  </li>
            <li> The blades are dirt cheap.</li>
            <li> Besides it would never have given me a close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to load blade and clean.</li>
            <li> Razor also repel water and becomes easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The extra razors that come are DORCO blades and they are great.</li>
            <li> The quality of this razor is great and made of solid metal.</li>

            <li> Comfortable shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and to use.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need the adjustability this thing works fantastic.</li>
            <li> My face has never been so baby smooth.  </li>
            <li> The razor is easy to handle and clean.</li>
            <li> This was primarily done to offset the cost of replacement disposable blades.  </li>
            <li> The result has been fantastic.  </li>
            <li> CAN say that as a beginner, I felt comfortable using this from the get-go.  </li>
            <li> And they may not be as close and smooth as you&#x27;re used to.  </li>
            <li> I primarily use electric</li>
            <li> You get a nice looking razor that performs very well.</li>
            <li> If I were going to own just one quality razor, it would be the Merkur 34C which will provide a lifetime of use with reasonable care.</li>
            <li> Fantastic intro razor.</li>
            <li> The short handle also allows for great control and maneuverability.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Side note on 5 blade offer: I contacted the seller because I didn&#x27;t receive 5 free blades.</li>
            <li> The free blades were so-so.. prefer feather or shark blades.  </li>
            <li> Very well weighted, nice to use.</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy shaving again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the packaging to be so cheap looking, though we don&#x27;t shave with the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise the same Paraso will work great.</li>
            <li> If you’re looking for economy, value, a green product, and an awesome shave</li>
            <li> This handle is short, but my husband says he thinks it&#x27;s great that way.</li>
            <li> The Merkur cut the whiskers like butter using a light touch and letting the weight of the razor do the work.  </li>
            <li> It is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Enjoy shaving.</li>
            <li> The blades are cheap.</li>
            <li> Blades fit perfectly securely without any guess work.  </li>
            <li> with this and was amazed at how smooth my shave went.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my face and nether regions and smooth as a veal cutlet</li>
            <li> recommend this razor for beginners or advanced users as I don&#x27;t see how you can get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> , if you are looking for a light handle this is not for you.</li>
            <li> This is just a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so happy not only are they cheeper</li>
            <li> I am razor bump free.</li>
            <li> Easy to load/unload and clean.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and change blades.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic razor.</li>
            <li> Too light.</li>
            <li> or how lightly it touched my face (never hade problems with it on my head though).</li>
            <li> Smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Build quality is terrific and the balance will leave you with a great shave provided you&#x27;ve done your part.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy shaving every morning now and receive a close, quality shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic service.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the type of shaving again that I once started with.  </li>
            <li> this mighty staff of</li>
            <li> I enjoy walking pas</li>
            <li> : I read somewhere that it&#x27;s easier to perform advanced techniques like buffing and j-hooks with a shorter handle.</li>
            <li> and I am still amazed at how smooth my face is and for how long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At this point, my shaves are just about smooth as glass with no nicks or irritation.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a free razor, but throw that away (or recycle it rather) and buy yourself a supply of Feather razors to get a close shave that doesn&#x27;t cut your face.</li>
            <li> Great for a coarse beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Blades are cheap</li>
            <li> This razor although kind&#x27;ve short has a really nice weight and feel.  </li>
            <li> Pair it up with a nice badger hair brush and some Taylor of Old Shaving cream and you will be shaving like your grand dad.</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for Christmas and I am absolutely blown away by how much more enjoyable shaving has become.</li>
            <li> Good razor, heavy and good quality.</li>
            <li> I rarely skip a day shaving now because I enjoy it much more.</li>
            <li> My face feels much better and shaving is actually enjoyable to me thanks to this razor.</li>
            <li> This razor was listed in many forums as a good overall razor, so I decided to order it and tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I also recently invested in a Boker straight razor and find the Merkur to compliment it perfectly for when I need to save time in the morning.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a way to be able to carry more \\&quot;shaving-days\\&quot; in my camp pack, without all of the bulky blades offered by the modern razors.  </li>
            <li> The blade was easy to install, cleaning is super easy.  </li>
            <li> It kind of forces you to use your fingers to lightly hold the handle so that the non floating head can gently follow the contours of your face.</li>
            <li> so far so good.  </li>
            <li> The Merkue #34C is far superior.  </li>
            <li> But if you like old school razors, this is a good one, which is why I gave it three stars</li>
            <li> The stainless steel cleans very easily and the weight of the handle makes it easy to control.</li>
            <li> Great balance, no trouble finding the right angle.  </li>
            <li> The handle is small but it fits perfectly in both of our hands and is easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> Would I be able to find the right angle?</li>
            <li> Finding the right blade has taken more time than learning how to use this razor.</li>
            <li> A short handle gives very nice control.  </li>
            <li> No longer will I pay more for ridiculously overpriced cartridges that give me incredible razor burn!    </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and you enjoy a clean, comfortable shave, do yourself a favor and give this a try.</li>
            <li> The blade you choose is also important, but it is unique to each user.  </li>
            <li> This is a great razor that will keep you happy past the intermediate level of razors, if not your whole life.</li>
            <li> For those entering the double-edge razor arena, the Merkur is a solid piece of equipment and is good for a beginning and advanced shaver (according to those who are advanced double-edge shavers on the forums), and not nearly as brutal as I thought.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s nice not to have to brave the accusing eyes of a store clerk so they&#x27;ll open a locked cabinet just to get me a new razor head not made of gold but made to fit my off-the-shelf twin blade POS.  </li>
            <li> the right weight, glides easily over the face and cleans up easy.</li>
            <li> This product does what its supposed to - give a clean, smooth, old-fashioned shave every time.  </li>
            <li> I like the smooth clean shave this provides.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Merkur and Feather blades and can attest that they both fit and provide a clean, close</li>
            <li> It glides effortlessly through stubble and beard, leaving a smooth, clean path in its wake.</li>
            <li> It is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and is super durable.</li>
            <li> It has a nice natural weight that helps to make shaving easy and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The angle on the blade isn&#x27;t super aggressive, and it can be easily used for body shaving as well as face shaving.</li>
            <li> I require an exceptional razor with quality razor blades to achieve the professional look.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say exactly why, but the Merkur cuts more smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Proper technique with a good lather and safety razor has given me consistently smooth, clean shaves (my wife approves greatly of them) without the constant irritation and shaving bumps.</li>
            <li> I have always had a liking for things a bit more old school because, well, many older tools seem to provide with better results, albeit with more associated risk or effort involved.</li>
            <li> this razor still is super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great construction, upper mild shave.</li>
            <li> Just finished my first DE Safety Razor shave with the 34C, very gentle on the skin, didn&#x27;t get any cuts but was left with an awesome shave after two passes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid simple razor, nicely weighted, grips beautifully, and almost as easy as using a disposable.</li>
            <li> Not only is it more cost affective, but I get a much better shave, and feel much better afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The 34C is small in stature (3 and 1/4 inches long and weighs 80.5 grams) but don&#x27;t let that deter you, this razor is well balanced and perfect for beginners like me or experienced shavers.</li>
            <li> Have fun!</li>
            <li> and you will be golden for like 2 years!     </li>
            <li> My first DE razor, so I cannot compare it to others, however I really do love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit it does take a bit of a learning curve to use this razor, but despite the first week of nicks, I love it.  </li>
            <li> Shaving with a traditional safety razor requires more time and practice than the latest Gillette cartridge gimmick design, but you get more control over the process.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reasons for switching:&lt;br /&gt;1) Environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> Economically friendly.</li>
            <li> This razor and Merkur blades has made shaving enjoyable for the first time in my life</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m tremendously satisfied with my first DE shave.</li>
            <li> This razor is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It make take longer to shave,but the results are better and the refills much much cheaper!</li>
            <li> the provided Merkur blade my first shave was better than that of the disposable razors (with just a hint of burn).</li>
            <li> There is a bit of a learning curve (carved up my face pretty good the first time) but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> As for skin irritation, I find that I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference between both types.  </li>
            <li> razor is fairly short which is good because it forces you to focus on the angles and gives you done play as far as good aggressive a agave you want.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most enjoyable and comfortable way of shaving I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> The return/exchange process was straightforward and without hassle.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this in the mail.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed how the head retains heat when run through hot water while I rinse it off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still experimenting with different DE blades but so far every brand has fit perfectly in my Merkur razor.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth twice the price!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not aggressive and budget friendly.</li>
            <li> For the new wet shavers, practice makes perfect, make sure you have a good lather applied prior to shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weight and balance make it ideal for gliding down my face with no pressure needed from me.</li>
            <li> So, overall, fairly happy with my first shaving experience with safety razors!</li>
            <li> After drying off, I splash on some aftershave (little more stinging) and by the time the aftershave dries, all irritation is gone, I smell great, my face is incredibly smooth and I am good until the following morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have a few other brands that are great, but the balance of the Merkur is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Like everyone mentions the Feather blade is amazing, but if you are new to this type of shaving I would not start off with that one.  </li>
            <li> I own one and bought this as a gift for someone new to shaving.</li>
            <li> I am new to this kind of shaving and the recommendations regarding this product are spot on.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to be able to use the same type of blade for both razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love my DE razor a thousand times more than my old razor.</li>
            <li> much more clean shaven meant having to having to suffer through it even more frequently, which was something I was not looking forward to.    </li>
            <li> Going back to the old fashioned safety razor has been the best decision I have made.</li>
            <li> This razor can give you a squeaky clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Moist, squeaky clean skin can become tacky.  </li>
            <li> The combed edge will not adhere to squeaky clean skin.  </li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t need to have a clean shaven face for work, I&#x27;ve been shaving about 4-5 times per month, and changing the blade at the end of each month.</li>
            <li> I shave in the shower and its a snap to rinse and clean.</li>
            <li> No balancing of the blades or mis-alignment as the blade will sit securely on the top part and you can just drop the whole handle on it with the centre guide.</li>
            <li> Clean shave with no razor burn.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves the clean lines the razor provides</li>
            <li> Upon first use I found the razor to be easy load, and the handle length fine.</li>
            <li> You just feel the blade slicing cleanly and effortlessly through the stubble.</li>
            <li> It is definitely shorterf than most disposables but its actually nice to use.</li>
            <li> Overall great product and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Close, smooth, quick (i didnt have to keep going over and over and area to get the shave i was wanting)</li>
            <li> Both are terrific products on their own, but together, they are fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I decided to exchange this for the long-handle version, which I am much happier and more comfortable with.</li>
            <li> Also a lot friendlier when attempting to cut a clean sideburn line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> to clean and change blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Out of the safety razors that I own, the Merkur HD 34c is one of my favorites that I keep going back to as I&#x27;ve yet to find anything that gives a better shave at any cost.</li>
            <li> I use this occasionally when I want a closer shave than electric and honestly it doesn&#x27;t take much more time.</li>
            <li> After spending some $$$ on that all you need are the razors which are super cheap here on amazon.</li>
            <li> As many have already stated, this is a great everyday,</li>
            <li> Such a smooth shave when you use a good cream and brush.</li>
            <li> I disassemble mine after each use and clean it off to prevent build up.</li>
            <li> My experience with saftey razors is limited, but it is a great razor.  </li>
            <li> After the shave, cleaning the razor is simple as most of the time a good run-through of hot water will suffice.  </li>
            <li> After the shave, cleaning the razor is simple as most of the time a good run-through of hot water will suffice.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this razor and it not only feels right while getting a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;The two-piece design makes blade changes a snap, and the razor holds the blades evenly and securely, giving you a consistent easily repeatable shave every time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t say this lightly but do yourself a favorite a try &amp;#34;any&amp;#34; double edge razor and see for yourself that it provides the closest and most comfortable shave that you had had.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does sideburns with ease and the hair right under your nose is easy to get as well.</li>
            <li> This is a special razor.  </li>
            <li> Certainly the fastest I&#x27;m able to shave with this</li>
            <li> The razor is more aggressive than the one that I had been using and the blade that came with it certainly made me feel it so into the blade bank</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to pay Gillette $$$ for their proprietary cartridges, many people can get a quick, good enough shaves from them.</li>
            <li> However, the Merkur 34c shaves better than the EJ and is perhaps a little more aggressive which is a good thing, albeit, still a mild smooth consistent shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to put a new blade in, and to clean after shaving.</li>
            <li> I have short, broad fingers, so the size and weight are perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> Like its predecessor this one gives an excellent shave and it does seem sturdier justifying the higher price for the Heavy Duty model.</li>
            <li> And the plating is smooth, even and consistent, lending to a comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor and I must say I am happy with it overall.     </li>
            <li> Great razor for beginners not very aggressive, but will give you a gret shave.</li>
            <li> Great DE razor to introduce oneself to wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> It works great as expected.</li>
            <li> Most of us today shave without a thought to how much of shaving is tradition as well as necessity.</li>
            <li> Most of us today shave without a thought to how much of shaving is tradition as well as necessity.</li>
            <li> Though perhaps not as cool as using an adjustable razor, or one with a butterfly opening to load blades, this razor does everything you could ask.    </li>
            <li> It may not be as cool to load as a &#x27;butterfly&#x27; DE razor, and it is not adjustable as some DE razors are.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Price:  For something that may well shave multiple generations of faces, I&#x27;d say this is a fair ripper of a value.  </li>
            <li> I also find that I will nick myself more if I&#x27;m going too fast.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably because there really isn&#x27;t that much you can say about something as simple and perfect as this.  </li>
            <li> Find yourself good blades and never look back</li>
            <li> Heavy weight in the handle has a real nice feel to it.  </li>
            <li> Although it is not adjustable this &#x27;feature&#x27; actually promotes good technique.</li>
            <li> it is soooo true.     </li>
            <li> Thanks for reading :)</li>
            <li> If you are looking at buying this model you have probably read or watched a handful of reviews about how grand this safety razor is and I agree, albeit I have nothing but modern razors for comparison.</li>
            <li> but it is definitely not ugly.</li>
            <li> Any razor can only be as good as the lotion.  </li>
            <li> Good weight, and simple design.</li>
            <li> good overall Blade.</li>
            <li> The knurling on the handle is good for keeping a solid grip on the razor.</li>
            <li> One of the true classics.</li>
            <li> Finally, treat yourself to a good shaving brush and soap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know finite just me, but a read all the reviews and really wanted to believe in a better shave, but it didn&#x27;t happen with me.</li>
            <li> This means when you are taking it apart you don&#x27;t need to have your fingers anywhere near the blade which is a nice safety feature.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, much cheaper than five blade devices and works better.  </li>
            <li> This was a highly-rated DE razor, so I decided to try it because there seem to be many people who claim that DE razors are superior to the more common safety razors (e.g., Sensor Excel, Mach 3, etc.).</li>
            <li> I could make my life easier and save money by ising this razor and a good double edge razor blade.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> Paying so much for the cartridges I knew there had to be a better alternative.  </li>
            <li> Gave me razor bumps and many cuts even when shaving much slower than with disposable razor.</li>
            <li> Great razor, year old no problems, German made , need I say more?</li>
            <li> I really thought that a Merkur would be better constucted.  </li>
            <li> This Shaver with Japanese blades have made shaving a good experience.</li>
            <li> Not as cool,</li>
            <li> That is certainly true of DE razors, but your grooming ritual won&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re playing with a toy, either.</li>
            <li> did a very conservative cleanup pass after that and wound up with a categorically smoother shave on most of my face than I&#x27;ve ever had with a cartridge razor.</li>
            <li> It has a good short grip to it.</li>
            <li> The razors that are included are good and last about 3-4 shaves (I have medium stubble).</li>
            <li> Basically it does everything I hoped it would do, and it looks good enough to keep on my kitchen sink!</li>
            <li> needed something that would be faster and hopefully provide as good as a shave as the disposable, I turned to the double edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get a brush and shaving soap for the full experience.</li>
            <li> Please buy some good Japanese razor blades.</li>
            <li> the grain&amp;#34; to get a really good shave just as I did with the injector razor and by doing that I get about the same results as I did before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like being wasteful, and this is much cheaper, &amp;#34;greener&amp;#34;, and just a better shave than what I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that i cant make it through a full shave without my hand cramping.</li>
            <li> I was surprised as I watched some videos and was told to expect it to take months to learn this kind of shaving.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much lighter and built of a better quality</li>
            <li> This was the best idea I have had lately and</li>
            <li> I love this razor, I really do.</li>
            <li> Overall good product but wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> If you like a good shave and can spend an extra minute shaving, I recommend trying it.  </li>
            <li> When it came, it was actually a tad shorter than I imagined it would be, but this turned out to be a good thing.</li>
            <li> It really gives you a better and closer shave than disposables.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor from the art of shaving, i use a straight razor and love it.</li>
            <li> I really like this better then</li>
            <li> Solid feel and good weight.  </li>
            <li> Bought one last week and after the 1st shave, i can say its really good.</li>
            <li> I recommend you do some research online and make the leap to the tried and true method of shaving.</li>
            <li> I wish that I could say the same for the blade, but I hear that what&#x27;s good for one may not be good for another because our hair and skin combinations can dramatically affect the result that we get with the different blades out there.</li>
            <li> Good simple gear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but I really like the 43C Merkur.</li>
            <li> Astra is my favorite blade with this razor, very close shave, no pulling or tugging, and no irritation.  </li>
            <li> The price on this is still very affordable but does worlds better than the one I had before.</li>
            <li> Good DE Razor for basic shaving.  </li>
            <li> Anything is better than paying that much..</li>
            <li> I am able to shave very close to the nasal area; something my cumbersome multi-edge couldn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> and I get a super clean shave.</li>
            <li> It has good sturdy weight to it and therefore has a very solid feel in the hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they just don&#x27;t do a good job for me, and they don&#x27;t seem to have improved since last time</li>
            <li> The Merkur feels solid and has a good weight.  </li>
            <li> Whereas today&#x27;s modern disposable razors are nimble like a sports car, this is more like a truck but the comfort and smoothness cannot be beat.  </li>
            <li> As a brand new DE user, this was very easy to learn on.</li>
            <li> I liked the Jagger, but thought I would try a different model and selected this one (Merkur) based largely on the positive ratings, and have been pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have normal hands (I think) and the handle is more than adequate and quite comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Being new to wet shaving, I did a lot of research to determine what would be the best starter razor, and everywhere I looked</li>
            <li> Cartridge razors are costly and clog easily and never seem able to clear all the hair off my face without a lot of pressure and struggling.</li>
            <li> Well balanced, good weight, easy to use, and works as expected.</li>
            <li> Myriad elements like skin sensitivity and beard pattern combine to make your face unique, so, while one user may have a fantastic first shave with a safety razor, another may need to reach for a styptic pencil.</li>
            <li> as long as you take your time, listen to some good music as you shave, it makes the moment of shaving unique.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor and I am so glad that I made the change to wet shaving and getting very far away from the cartridge gimmick!</li>
            <li> The variety of high end shaving creams is great and a big part of what I enjoy as well</li>
            <li> It has really aggressive knurling, it&#x27;s easy to hold, nicely weighted, holds any standard safety razor blade, and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to set up, short heavy handle feels great and makes it easy to control, blades come off easily.</li>
            <li> Use the other to shave your pits and legs; your man will be happy.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a great razor.</li>
            <li> Great weight and extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> This gives an excellent shave (with a little practice) and the blades are so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> When you first use it, you&#x27;ll get a great shave but not as close as you would with a straight razor; I honestly thought that my product was defective as I got closer shaves by slightly loosening the head</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying a nice, weighty one like this, as the heft really allows you to stop raking the blade across your skin and let the razor&#x27;s weight do the job for you, resulting in a very smooth and gentle</li>
            <li> This is a great starter item that will last you forever if you take care of it (which is really easy, just make sure its dry at the end of each use).</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first DE razor and it suits my needs fine.</li>
            <li> The alum bar is far superior to alcohol-based aftershaves, so you should really consider upgrading to an alum bar.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and shaves well.  </li>
            <li> quick changeover - it takes about 15 seconds to change blades  </li>
            <li> I can tell you that the short feels better in my hand as I have more control</li>
            <li> Luckily a co-worker happened to inquire about what shaving method I used.</li>
            <li> Gives a mild but close shave.</li>
            <li> Edwin Jagger 1ej947sds Traditional English Best Badger Hair Shaving Brush Faux Ivory Medium</li>
            <li> I can say with confidence that this razor is perfect for me, but shaving is such an individual thing:  </li>
            <li> I can say with confidence that this razor is perfect for me, but shaving is such an individual thing:  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something about lathering up a nice bowl of soap and brushing it on the face, following by the smooth strokes that the Merkur provides.  </li>
            <li> So I made a second pass, more hairs removed but many still remained.</li>
            <li> Why did we leave shaving with these, when they are a far superior shave to modern razors?</li>
            <li> Cleans up quickly.</li>
            <li> Just a super razor, gets the job done with style and ease.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy weight (balanced, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap) and fits great in my hand.</li>
            <li> Luckily I had the foresight to buy a 10 pack of Merkur blades along with it.</li>
            <li> The experience of prepping, shaving, and post-shave rituals creates satisfaction that is absent from today&#x27;s more contemporary methods.</li>
            <li> did a quick look on Amazon and found a 15 pack of just Mach3 blades for $34 and a handle with handle with 2 blades for $18.  </li>
            <li> The wet shaving method is clearly more effective.</li>
            <li> With practice it takes only five to ten minutes to get an excellent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It easier, smoother, and more enjoyable than I anticipated, and I look forward to my next shave.</li>
            <li> Now I get a quick close shave, no nicks, no pulling, no burning.</li>
            <li> The texture on the shaft is unobtrusive and effective, keeping my grip sure even when my hands are wet and/or soapy.  </li>
            <li> you want a great shave, this is the razor for; and don&#x27;t forget to buy the Feather stainless double edge blades for a Razor and blade combination that can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> the cost savings is tremendous.</li>
            <li> I have used many razors since, most recently electric razors.  </li>
            <li> One of the reasons I chose this razor was that it was not flimsy and that it had only two separating parts:the top blade holder section and the bottom holder section with attached handle that screws into the top</li>
            <li> So shaving choices which include which shaving soap or cream, soap brush or can cream, and  personal choice of a DE blade brand that works best are items each user needs to decide on for themselves based on their personal conditions.</li>
            <li> which no need to press while shave and let you feel that you are handling something worthy.</li>
            <li> Tremendous shave quality, I like the Merkur blade that came installed in the handle as well as the Feather blades everyone has suggested.</li>
            <li> and I also very much better understand the comments about better control with the short handle.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the short handle fool you, it works exceptionally.</li>
            <li> Shaves very similarly, and I LOVE that the top piece screws in via the knob on the bottom to make this a 2pc razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are more expensive razors out there, but this one is awesome.</li>
            <li> This is a nice tool to hold in your hand - nice and heavy, well made, etc.  </li>
            <li> Gives him a super close shave without all irritation.</li>
            <li> It feels like a higher quality razor though I am sure the quality of the other Merkur products is just as good.</li>
            <li> This system of shaving is much more high quality than anything that the disposable companies could ever produce and is just a quick.</li>
            <li> But now I enjoy shaving very much.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend theis razor to any one I love the quality and craftsmanship of this razor</li>
            <li> Love the razor highly recommend</li>
            <li> sure enough,  all the good reviews about it are true as far as I can tell you.</li>
            <li> I think my time with the straights, and my respect (fear) of the blade lent to such a good shave right out of the box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pleasant and refreshing experience.in the past month if that gives you an idea.</li>
            <li> It is short, but holds its own it weight, making it perfect for a new wet shaver trying to learn the skill.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously, there is more potential for nicks with these, but I was surprised how easy and effective</li>
            <li> This razor is weighted so nicely, which is why I picked it over the many other options out there.</li>
            <li> very first shave was closer than any I&#x27;ve ever had before</li>
            <li> My attitude on shaving is that you need to shave both with and against the grain in a hot, steamy environment, because the goal is a shave so close that you have completely smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I just went with Persona since they were pretty cheap</li>
            <li> Very pleased overall.</li>
            <li> , if the $40 is not a concern, then it is a fantastic first safety razor.</li>
            <li> I find a safety shaves better that way than with canned cream – plus you get the full old time experience!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied both with my decision to change to using a double edge razor and the quality of this</li>
            <li> This is based on my very first shave with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor, and so far I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> The 39 is sweet looking and fun to use</li>
            <li> Although the old GEM model was a good introduction, the quality of the Merkur was is of a solid quality that marks my commitment to every purchasing over priced multiblade refills and polluting the planet more than needed.</li>
            <li> This razor clears cut hair easily as there is an unimpeeded chamber beneath the blade which is large and diverts everything</li>
            <li> The old one I could hold perfectly when shaving, even with very wet soapy hands and it would never slip</li>
            <li> This is a great classic safety razor that is built to last.</li>
            <li> i wish i amazon would allow me to choose the length of my own reviews, sometimes there isn&#x27;t much to say, particularly if there are lots of reviews already</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and very forgiving</li>
            <li> The product is \\&quot;cool\\&quot;, it is better on the budget and the environment over a long run, but the shaving experience is not as good as with a new 3-blade Gillette.</li>
            <li> Much classier and closer-cutting than a modern cartridge razor, and very easy to adapt to.  </li>
            <li> Awsome razor very well built heavy duty works great with feather blades easy to replace blades and clean</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the great thing about this razor: When you you run it over your face (without much pressure applied due to the comfortable weight of the razor)</li>
            <li> the shave is not as aggressive as other models available making it perfect for someone starting out.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite razor</li>
            <li> I was like the many folks out there dulling up mach 3s and then dreading having to pay for new cartridges.  </li>
            <li> Shaving becomes a new thing for you - much better.</li>
            <li> I can use a new blade every time I shave and still save a ton of money and get a better shave.</li>
            <li> sure it&#x27;s because of my new shaving method).</li>
            <li> The fit is good however the finish is average.  </li>
            <li> This is a great starter razor for someone interested in wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Sample packs with a variety of different brands are available on Amazon to help you decide which razor blade is suitable for your skin and beard.</li>
            <li> Great razor for first time wet shavers.</li>
            <li> razor is very well made, and easy to load.</li>
            <li> However, when you consider that it&#x27;s all metal, the blades are easily changeable, easily recyclable, much cheaper, you&#x27;ll be getting a straight razor close shave without the headache of stropping, servicing, oiling, and honing.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> Open-blade razors are best used for shaving long facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t get better results and it seems as though the first pass going with the grain really doesn&#x27;t do anything for</li>
            <li> The day after the first shave left me with no nicks, a good feeling and the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t tried many DE razors, and this one was my first one.</li>
            <li> It is a very well built razor it doesn&#x27;t break easy.</li>
            <li> Overall very well constructed, and gives a nice close shave!</li>
            <li> The design of the head doesn&#x27;t really allow for hair to get stuck inside the razor, but can be easily cleaned once taken apart.</li>
            <li> It is very responsive and easy to control.</li>
            <li> This makes it easy to gently snug up the head without having to handle it.</li>
            <li> My favorite razor so far!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> but this is a high quality product!!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still on the first blade!</li>
            <li> The results are pretty close to it though!</li>
            <li> Choosing the right blade for yourself is pretty important.</li>
            <li> Like many men, I get ingrown hairs on my face when shaving with the typical 2-10 blade trendy razors you see on commercials.  </li>
            <li> fixing of blades is vey easy as it is only two peaces but for sure not like the butterfly ones.</li>
            <li> There is nothing better than getting a close shave with a single blade instead of getting hair stuck in the triple blade and more razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mine daily for over a year now and the fit and finish remain good as new.  </li>
            <li> Often this 34hd and the EJ89 are compared to each other as a great first razor.</li>
            <li> * Public service announcement: Your preshave preparation is very important to a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> It looks great on its stand in my little man corner on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Great quality but just a little too aggressive for my skin.</li>
            <li> This cream got some great reviews along the lines of &amp;#34;I&#x27;m astonished that a cheap cream from a big global brand is my new favorite cream&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> High quality metal, easy to open, easy to replace the blade, easy to clean, etc.</li>
            <li> Good weight, looks slick, and the blades are super easy to change out.</li>
            <li> Very good weight will never go back to a standard razor.</li>
            <li> The razor looks good, has a good finish, but for a big guy, it would be nice if the handle were a little longer and larger diameter.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing razor and my purchase of it completes a journey back to using a DE razor.</li>
            <li> great razor it will take a few times to get use to it</li>
            <li> This thing is great quality and is heavy so a lot of pressure is not needed when shaving.</li>
            <li> Biggest problem with this razor is the fact that it only leaves a .5-1mm blade showing, so if you intend to get an amazingly close shave, you will not get that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaves very close and smooth for me with a feather blade.  </li>
            <li> The razor is heavy and feels great in your hand.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the old-school feel and knowing I&#x27;m not throwing as much trash into the landfills.</li>
            <li> Never would have guessed that I would enjoy the experience of shaving with a safety razor as much as I have.</li>
            <li> I got it from Simply Beautiful/Amazon at the amazing price of $26.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect Merkur to produce cheap products because this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Recently made the switch to wet shaving and chose the Merkur 34#C because many of the reviews described it as a great place to start for newbies.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I will never go back to those razors again.</li>
            <li> Worth the price, even if it holds together a couple of years.</li>
            <li> while the listing only promises 5 free DE razor blades, many people in the reviews seem to have gotten feather blades with their product.</li>
            <li> buy this product, but just assume the free blades are a total loss and buy one of the more well regarded blade brands.</li>
            <li> The handle is fairly short, but the weight is nice.  </li>
            <li> Nice heavy duty , easy to use &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> Great and fast service even though it was free shipping was here in a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I have to shave more frequently, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like the shaver is tearing off a layer of skin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a success in both areas.  </li>
            <li> Going with an OLD SCHOOL razor is my latest step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying how the razor gives such a smooth shave, however, I haven&#x27;t settled on a razor brand yet</li>
            <li> Anyone who is thinking of making the switch, it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m only doing it for novelty sake to be frankly honest.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m only doing it for novelty sake to be frankly honest.</li>
            <li> The shave is better and the blades last longer and are dirt cheap to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have both this and the Edwin Jagger DE89, which I rarely use anymore.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> And worth paying the money for.</li>
            <li> Def your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> The perforated handle provides good grip even when your hands are wet and soapy from the shaving</li>
            <li> I own this and multiple razors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad bit slower going as I&#x27;m being more careful than I would be with a cartridge razor, but the results are much better</li>
            <li> Did research and this always popped up near the top.</li>
            <li> Now I use Sharks and rarely get cut at all.</li>
            <li> This is a well made razor that is simple to use and has a nice finish.</li>
            <li> Slightly more aggressive than most starting razors, but still gentle.  </li>
            <li> but nothing worth throwing this out for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never use s double edged razor before but after research and reviews, I found this to be a great razor to buy and use so far.</li>
            <li> Or safer (not cutting yourself during shaving)?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed DE shaving so far.</li>
            <li> If you can beat that with a multi blade system and have a fresh blade every week.  </li>
            <li> For the full year it will cost you $120ish the first year and then about $100 a year every year after that if you throw the blade away every week.  </li>
            <li> This razor is much better than those I used in the early sixties.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price paid.</li>
            <li> This is a good safety razor, but it is not stainless steel.</li>
            <li> the angle is not very aggressive so good for beginners.</li>
            <li> well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I rarely cut myself on those.  </li>
            <li> Worth the $43</li>
            <li> and I feel a bit more confident with it [also because of the grippy rough diamond texture on the handle].</li>
            <li> totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Something about it is just fun, and the shave feels a million times</li>
            <li> The handle is a bit of an expense but the blades are economical.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need some practice but it&#x27;ll be worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> I have used it now for several weeks and it does a nice job.</li>
            <li> and for me it is The last razor i will ever own.</li>
            <li> My skin is quite sensitive, so I should&#x27;ve known better.</li>
            <li> Love the old school razor.  </li>
            <li> end trying to think of something nice for me for the big day at the family gathering on Christmas Eve.</li>
            <li> Well worth the $$.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco 5601X for most of my adult life.  </li>
            <li> Really good entry level safety razor for the curious.</li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> In this case it is, well worth it.</li>
            <li> If you pick up a bit of scuff, rinse, switch sides, fresh blade.</li>
            <li> The quality makes it worth the price.</li>
            <li> I started out with the Feather Popular, but always felt like it wasnt aggressive enough as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> The razor is a true gem -- when loaded with a feather blade, it cuts my &#x27;Homer Simpson&#x27; beard like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li> and I rarely cut my face with them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and the crosshatch pattern on the handle provides good grip, even when wet with water and</li>
            <li> DE shaving is much better than cartridge shaving by far.</li>
            <li> My styptic pencil is used rarely.  </li>
            <li> I rarely cut my face.</li>
            <li> Nice double edge razor.  </li>
            <li> Nice heaft to the razor, solid build.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, yet simple.  </li>
            <li> Far better than any cartridge razor I ever used.</li>
            <li> It has a short handle and is nicely weighted so you do not have to press against your skin to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Good product as expected.</li>
            <li> The best DE shaver you can for the money from beginner to advanced users you can never go wrong with this Merkur its a must have.</li>
            <li> A lot of useful info, insight and recommendations that has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this razor and would recommend it to anyone who does not need a long handle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth your money and your face to try these out.</li>
            <li> A wet shave is definitely the best shave you can get.</li>
            <li> This Merkur is nicely weighted, reminding you to simply glide the razor along your skin.</li>
            <li> but well worth the work.</li>
            <li> Some of the old timers like Old Spice, Aqua Velva blue ice and Clubman are still great aftershaves and I love them.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this razor after reading multiple reviews that this was a good all-around double-edge razor.  </li>
            <li> well worth the money</li>
            <li> I find that the shorter handle is a nice advantage, providing enough balance and weight while also allowing me to shave around my neck without being cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> I used it last night for the first time and could not believe how smooth and easy this thing shaves!</li>
            <li> One side of the blade (the included blade) stuck out slightly more than the other, which made that side shave more aggressively than the other side, which shaved too mild to get a good cut.    </li>
            <li> In general, these will give a close shave, at an incredible price (pennies for a blade replacement if you buy the \\&quot;Sharp\\&quot; brand - my favorite), and precision typically found in the straight razor.    </li>
            <li> in all, I love this razor and strongly recommend it either as a first safety razor or for users who want something a bit different to try.</li>
            <li> The razor itself here is nice and weighty, and the short handle just seems to be the right length.</li>
            <li> The is very nice - I just miss the butterfly open action instead of removing head to change blade</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice to go back to old school shaving.</li>
            <li> Due to Amazon&#x27;s commendable return policy, one can try several razors and return those which don&#x27;t perform the best.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very small, however for me this is for the best - it helps not to put too much pressure when shaving.</li>
            <li> That being said, probably most people would be ok with it, as the other reviews tend to indicate.</li>
            <li> Ergonomics are better due to the knurling and the increase in diameter at the end of the handle--both facilitate a better grip and thus control during the shave.  </li>
            <li> For a super close shave, I have used a shaving oil first and then applied the shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> Very nice, heavy duty construction.  </li>
            <li> feels great , solid, smooth  well engineered, can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to stop the insanity of overpriced disposables and ineffective electrics</li>
            <li> investment is good because razors are not as pricey as Gilette and other competing brands.</li>
            <li> As long as you treat this razor like gold, it&#x27;ll treat you even better!</li>
            <li> Very we&#x27;ll built worth the money!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is perfect (at least as good, if not better than, cartridges)&lt;br /&gt;Excellent,</li>
            <li> recommend this razor to ANYONE who wants to get a high quality razor without dishing out a huge wad of cash!</li>
            <li> you are on the right track.</li>
            <li> With Drip Stand, Ivory, Medium]] was right around $100.</li>
            <li> Yes that&#x27;s right - 10 cents.</li>
            <li> right.    </li>
            <li> Enter safety razors, stage right.  </li>
            <li> So now I am looking for the right soap again.  </li>
            <li> It puts just the right amount of curve onto the blade.</li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> The Merkur was just right.  </li>
            <li> imposes on blades seems just right.</li>
            <li> weight is just right</li>
            <li> and it does aid in applying the right amount of pressure so that I don&#x27;t cut myself (that often).</li>
            <li> so it seemed like the right move at the time.</li>
            <li> I could IMMEDIATELY tell that I made the right choice in this razor.</li>
            <li> I like both right now.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s at the right angle, it shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably try out the variety pack of razors to find the right brand.</li>
            <li> These razors are the just the right weight and hold the blade just right for a close shave with out razor burn.</li>
            <li> is about 3-4 minutes, as opposed to 30 seconds or so with a Mach 3 right out of the shower with my trusty [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The balance just doesn&#x27;t feel right</li>
            <li> and if you KNOW HOW TO SHAVE right</li>
            <li> you take your time and do it right</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just right for me since my hands are a medium size.</li>
            <li> I thought it would take me a while to get used to it, as some say, but I got the hang of it right away.</li>
            <li> , right?  </li>
            <li> and they are right about it being</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working on technique and trying to find just the right blade.  </li>
            <li> The razor has the right heft</li>
            <li> nicks or cuts after finding the right blade for my beard.  </li>
            <li> I was right.  </li>
            <li> If you want a razor that gets the job done for the right price, buy this razor.</li>
            <li> Fits my hand just right.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to all of this I would strongly suggest getting a variety pack of DE razor blades so you can find one that works well for you.</li>
            <li> Also, my face feels great after a shave with this, where a Mach-3 would leave my face so raw</li>
            <li> As a completely new user of double edge razors, I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Although someday I might get a model that provides a more aggressive shave (after I develop more skill using it), this razor is fine for me right now - and likely for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> and I make short light strokes without applying too much pressure, as it really is nice and heavy duty with good weight to it.</li>
            <li> It is amazing that this is how it has been done for so many decades in the past, and somehow we were all duped into thinking cartridge-based safety razors</li>
            <li> Just a steady guiding of the razor across the face with an accurate touch.  </li>
            <li> One note on this particular vendor: the razor came with 10 free blades (not 5),</li>
            <li> I have found that my irritation is substantially reduced and I actually enjoy shaving now and the blades are so cheap that you will quickly recoup your initial investment in cost savings compared to using a Gilette.    </li>
            <li> That nut at the bottom is what makes this one stand out among some of the others - it allows for easy disassembly, safe removal/replacement of the blade and maintains a solid feel to the whole razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Mach 3 Turbo for many years, but was really interested in trying the old school method.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that getting a clean edge is much easier with the broader DE blade.</li>
            <li> Just as applying with a brush is superior to using your fingers, Having a single blade, which you can control, is much better than scraping multiple blades across your skin.</li>
            <li> short length makes it very easy to control &amp; use.</li>
            <li> No other razor I have found works better for me.  </li>
            <li> No other razor I have found works better for me.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor for beginners or advanced users as I don&#x27;t see how you can get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend a badger brush and it does make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This razor is my new go to razor, great feel and plenty of control with when wet.</li>
            <li> it just takes to much care and time to get the job done right for me!</li>
            <li> I must start out by saying I am one of those men with a beard that seems to be made of wire and skin that is incredibly sensitive - shaving has never been fun, easy or without issues since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> The weight, blade angle, and aggressiveness were different than my previous razor, but I&#x27;m very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> Even compared to the DSC, I can get more shaves -- better shaves -- for half the cost on blades.  </li>
            <li> Wanted to try a double edge razor, the razor is very well constructed, &amp;#34;worried that I would slice my face to bits&amp;#34;, hasn&#x27;t happened, easy to use, Taylor of Bond street cream , great close shave, went from shaving twice a week to almost daily,, love the scent and feeling, only reason not to get five stars, the length, should have bought the longer razor</li>
            <li> The razor case is great because you can just slide the used blade into the underside of the small case that the blades came in</li>
            <li> Weird how cheap and not getting cut was the way, in my mind to a good safe shave using the multi blade</li>
            <li> This first week I have cut my self 4 out 5 times but the shave is so close it is worth the pain of the learning curve.</li>
            <li> Okay, one gripe is it doesn&#x27;t do that cool butterfly open on top like I&#x27;ve seen some other razors do, instead the whole top just unscrews by twisting the bottom of the handle.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it, but it seems I can only occasionally get as good a shave as my disposable razors</li>
            <li> Great razor if you have small hands.</li>
            <li> The handle is short but very balanced and offers great feedback while shaving.  </li>
            <li> This was my first razor since stepping off the Gilette/Schick merry go round, and it was a great first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found you can go as cheap or expensive as you would want to and still be able to find a good quality razor that meets your needs.</li>
            <li> So far to early to give a full honest review I will update later once I have a lot more shaves.</li>
            <li> I felt that was high but with the high grade steal, I can&#x27;t see wearing this out for many years.  </li>
            <li> So far, the Merkur has proved very easy to get started with and the blades that came with it are excellent and last at least 1 week.  </li>
            <li> of the extremely helpful wet shaving celebrities on YouTube recommend the Merkur 34C HD as the ideal safety razor for novices, and after my first shave, it&#x27;s easy to see why.</li>
            <li> The short handle is perfect to rest on my little finger.  </li>
            <li> The shorter handle seems to be precise for me, I also have a long handle but prefer the smaller more agile 34c.</li>
            <li> : quick disassemble/assemble, easy to clean, fits nicely in large hands, solid construction</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as easy as the butterfly opening of other razors, but the two piece construction allows the blade to be grasped and changed safely.</li>
            <li> and I am kind of excited to be back to the old ways.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting the new model of Norelco (fantastic electric razor)  each year for hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> I used this razor yesterday for the first time right after getting it.</li>
            <li> B002MUAP2E Razorba Back Hair Shaver]] which gives me a comfortable, safe, close, diy, and easy reachable back hair shaving.</li>
            <li> Overall, this razor is more than worth the money.</li>
            <li> The knurled handle offers plenty of grip, loading the razor is incredibly easy and it feels sturdy and stable in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shave prep is more extensive but worth it</li>
            <li> Shave prep is more extensive but worth it  </li>
            <li> However, if you properly learn proper shaving habits, you will greatly reduce the odds of this.  </li>
            <li> when I get done, my face and throat are completely smooth and stay that way for 2-3 days, which even considering my slow beard growth is a good shave.</li>
            <li> it is very sturdy with a nice finish, something that looks like it will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> with somewhat sensitive skin, this provided a very quick shave.</li>
            <li> If you are remotely considering making the switch to wet-shaving, or are already a wet shaver looking for an excellent razor, do yourself a favor and order this razor.</li>
            <li> Simple to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Although sturdy with a great grip, the razor felt really small in my hand at first.</li>
            <li> The Feather was a mild shave, but didn&#x27;t cut the hair very well.  </li>
            <li> Along with some great German or Japanese blades like Wilkinson or Feather, this thing is a pleasure to use with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> The time to shave and clean the razor is a bit longer, but using this razor and the Personna Prep Double Edge Razor Blades (100 pack at 35 cents each) gets me a much closer shave at a much better price.  </li>
            <li> But if you use a lighter touch this is perfect because it is heavy enough to compensate.</li>
            <li> The construction is very solid and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Its back to the good old days of shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I forgot what a good shave the old Double Edge razors give, plus all the money that I save not buying razors every month or so.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price - should last a lifetime with proper care.</li>
            <li> The blades are hilariously inexpensive compared to disposable or cartridge razors, even the ones made of German-made medical grade steel, meaning you can change them out as often as you like, even every shave, and still be economical.  </li>
            <li> it has been super smooth and enjoyable to use, with less razor burn than the Fusion.</li>
            <li> Being a gluten, I decided I needed another safety razor, even though a Merkur will last a lot longer than a human LOL.  </li>
            <li> Get good cream, I like Taylors Old Bond, get a mid price badger brush and a stand and a blade sample pack.</li>
            <li> I went for the Merkur 34C after reading about the strong grip it offers because of its weight (it does) and, well, because its Merkur.</li>
            <li> I get generic blades from a local pharmacy for now, and still get a great shave.</li>
            <li> I use shaving soap and was very pleasantly surprised about how easy the transition was.  </li>
            <li> so I primarily use this razor to keep my neck and upper cheeks trim and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I think I may have fallen in love with my new baby soft face!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp and I nicked myself pretty good.</li>
            <li> Wet shaving is the way to go, plus I get a better shave!</li>
            <li> Changing the razor and giving it a full cleaning is simple: just twist the bolt at the bottom of the razor, hold the top piece of the head and the side of the razor and pull apart gently.</li>
            <li> Changing the razor and giving it a full cleaning is simple: just twist the bolt at the bottom of the razor, hold the top piece of the head and the side of the razor and pull apart gently.</li>
            <li> Overall,  I am happy with the purchase as it is a higher quality tool than cheaper razors and should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> It takes only a little more time than I used to spend gnawing at my face with my electric razor and is much more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> I love well made tools that serve their intended purpose, so this German made beauty is right up my alley.  </li>
            <li> can fit easily in the palm of my hand--which I see as a benefit for travelling, but that might make some want to get the long handled version.  </li>
            <li> and I find the short handle very comfortable maneuver around your face and jawline.  </li>
            <li> I was kind of expecting to be able to jump into shaving with a double edged razor without much fuss, but it really is very different from cartridge razor shaving.  </li>
            <li> Feather became very very gentle...</li>
            <li> A great starter razor, the Merkur blade is also a very forgiving blade and allows you to learn if you are new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many Merkur razors, including the 37C (Slant), Progress, and Futur (extremely aggressive); and the 34C outperforms these razors at delivering a comfortably close shave.</li>
            <li> No cuts, smooth finish or extremely efficient and safe.</li>
            <li> I always grip the razor near the head so the shorter handle is fine for me.  </li>
            <li> Finally I have a real razor that can easily and smoothly cut my Barb Wire Wiskers.</li>
            <li> you want to try wet shaving on the cheap, the Lord L6 is a mild but acceptable $10 alternative available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> A true classic.</li>
            <li> Nice to get back to the older style!👍🏾</li>
            <li> If you enjoy shaving, this razor is balanced to give a decent close shave without applying much pressure to the razor.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The razor leaves a large space open between the blade and the guard bar so that this razor never gets clogged and is always easy to clean by just running water over it or shaking it under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great high quality heavy razor.  </li>
            <li> Though I am enjoying the shave very much and I have only done it twice with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Superior build quality (actually I feel a little better than my Futur at twice the price).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been amazingly reliable and gets the job done with minimal irritation.  </li>
            <li> This one has a smaller blade gap but more aggressive angle than the kelvin.  </li>
            <li> The more knowledge you have prior to face shaving</li>
            <li> I really, really like this razor!</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first safety razor.</li>
            <li> realize that the short handle was better for me...</li>
            <li> be sure you are buying the Japanese brand and not the knockoff Thailand blades.</li>
            <li> this is your first DE razor</li>
            <li> There is no pivot-head which means you must be aware of and account for the organic curvature of your face and neck.</li>
            <li> and it will take you about 20 minutes the first time</li>
            <li> ;)  -Rene N.</li>
            <li> glad I gave safety razors a second chance.  </li>
            <li> But since it s the first safety razor I ve used in 25 years, i can t tell you how it compares to others.</li>
            <li> Fast service too!</li>
            <li> I finally made the switch from the cartridge to the DE razor, and glad I did.  </li>
            <li> This razor is exactly what was described and is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> This is a \\&quot;no frills\\&quot; DE Razor and does exactly what it should do.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> First time in my life I now look forward to shaving AND with the Merkur</li>
            <li> This is my first DE safety razor.</li>
            <li> This seems obvious, but coming from a Mach 3, I was used to haphazardly touching up stubble without applying additional shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a hot idea with a DE razor.</li>
            <li> Therefore I settled for a electric trimmer because it was the only thing safe for me to use.    </li>
            <li> Pay extra attention to how your hairs grow on your neck area, where it matters the most how you cut it.)</li>
            <li> So first couple shaves with this</li>
            <li> This is my first double-edge blade razor.  </li>
            <li> This razor is supporting my wanton shaving laziness</li>
            <li> My favorite double edge safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I still remember the first time that I used it, it shaved closer than the Gillette Mach whatever I was using at the time.</li>
            <li> Better buy a StipTick at the same time.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor after years with a \\&quot;modern\\&quot; multi-trac.  </li>
            <li> Then several years ago my lovely wife purchased a shaving brush, mug and upscale razor.  </li>
            <li> First off this is my first safety razor</li>
            <li> You will never get a better safety razor than Merkur, this is the second one I have had</li>
            <li> Also, for the first time I didn&#x27;t bleed at all after shaving against the grain.</li>
            <li> As many have noted, you shouldn&#x27;t grip it, so I would imagine a longer handle might actually be detrimental.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> If it your first time using the razor, I recommend watching a \\&quot;how do use\\&quot; video online.</li>
            <li> I first</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The first time I shaved with a cartridge razor</li>
            <li> First time buying and using a DE Razor.  </li>
            <li> Which is exactly what I was looking for when I started DE shaving 4 months ago.</li>
            <li> only is it a cheaper method, but the shaves come out a lot better and closer.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to try different blades.</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s that consistent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my first DE razor</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor and it works well for me.</li>
            <li> , that was my first mistake.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor.  </li>
            <li> You realize that when you first pick it up.</li>
            <li> Your savings might be higher or lower depending on how often you change your blades.</li>
            <li> Worked from the first time.</li>
            <li> This one is exactly what I was wanting.</li>
            <li> I suggest coupling it with a higher quality shave cream.</li>
            <li> My first was a Weishi razor purchased on eBay.  </li>
            <li> I prefer Derby Extra, mostly for the price in comparison to the others.  </li>
            <li> The Dorco that came with my first razor also seemed rather forgiving, but I haven&#x27;t tried another one since.  </li>
            <li> Love the short handle.</li>
            <li> then I decided to invest more money after reading the reviews here on amazon and let me say &amp;#34;Guys the Razor matters&amp;#34; This razor is like the gold standard in safety razor shaving!</li>
            <li> So I decided it might be worthwhile to go back to the old-school &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The short handle for beginners like myself allow greater control over the razor.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> No complicated adjustments to allow any metal to stress and break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if I&#x27;d seen it first hand I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
            <li> My first safety razor.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> First off let’s not kid ourselves.</li>
            <li> It was my first time to shave with a DE razor</li>
            <li> My daily shave has become an enjoyable meditation time, instead of a chore!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> At first, I used the Merkur blade and cut my face a lot.</li>
            <li> The Jagger never failed to cut me to pieces.  </li>
            <li> First time using a DE razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first double edge razor and it works ok.  </li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor.  </li>
            <li> Merkur HD is my first razor.  </li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor.</li>
            <li> The last one I drop in my tub and the top broke off.  </li>
            <li> My favorite double edge safety razor.</li>
            <li> People recommend the short handle for greater control</li>
            <li> : it is the first thing people see when they look at you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(my first DE safety razor, so theres a learning curve for me)&lt;br /&gt;liking</li>
            <li> First, let me put this in context: I had never used a double-edged (DE) razor before.</li>
            <li> This was his first type of razor like the Merkur.  </li>
            <li> I dove into the wetshaving world eyes open and this was the most recommended razor for wetshaving virgins.  </li>
            <li> I remember this type of razors as the first I learned to shave with as my father used them.</li>
            <li> My first DER.  </li>
            <li> some irritation after the first use.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using a safety razor</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it will last me for year and years to come.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me disclose that I&#x27;m a woman and that I use this razor for body shaving.</li>
            <li> Although I will say that it&#x27;s easier to get an occasional nick, mostly on the front part of my shin if I put pressure on the blade.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor</li>
            <li> I was worried about the short handle and just about went for the longer but am glad I got this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since this is my first razor; I like the fact that the safety bar is fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My initial impression is happily satisfied.</li>
            <li> This razor reminds me of the razor I cut my first beard on, my dad&#x27;s Gillette Fat Boy.  </li>
            <li> The 34C is a no-frills razor that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> Again, not that big of a deal, but anyone who has a problem safely handling double-edge blades needs to just grow a beard.  </li>
            <li> Actually buying two more, one for travel and one for my 19 y/o son.  </li>
            <li> Ok, if you are still with me, so for one year of shaving changing the blade every week and only shaving 6 times a week.  </li>
            <li> That adds up to about $55 dollars in the first year.  </li>
            <li> First off, let me say, that I have never written a review of any product.</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing more of the blades when I run out, which will be months away, since the blades last a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Its pretty well documented then plating issues and customer service problems with merkur.</li>
            <li> I gained confidence in the first couple of strokes as it was easier on my face than the cartridge&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> My first shave</li>
            <li> Should last a life time and even more .</li>
            <li> but I like my Edwin Jagger Faux Ebony Double Edge Safety Razor better.</li>
            <li> absolutely love it and will never go back.</li>
            <li> It is well made, and holds the blade exactly where it should giving an even cut on both sides.</li>
            <li> The short handle works for most, but does not work for me.  </li>
            <li> After a year now I purchased my first Merker 34C HD.</li>
            <li> Since this was my first shaving experience I just kept on using Gillette razors, from the atra to the sensor and eventually the mach 3.  </li>
            <li> I tried many different ways to shave with it, stick with Gillette razors, nobody comes close to them.</li>
            <li> shaving is all setup now to be affordable, fun, and very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> big win - blades are sooooo much cheaper and last much longer!</li>
            <li> My first time using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Having to shave a lot with the fire department, I wanted something more efficient while being close at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first DE safety razor.</li>
            <li> This was the first razor I bought when I switched off cartridge razors.  </li>
            <li> You may not be able to get a Porsche but the Merkur gives you affordable German craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only owned this razor for a couple days, but I already love it.</li>
            <li> My first razor was the Parker 99r</li>
            <li> I was timid on the first shave but for ONE blade it had a WAYY smoother stroke without yanking than any razor i have ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t realize the handle was so short, but eventually I was able to adjust</li>
            <li> it is waayyy much better than all them regular multiblade cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> (okay, well, the occasional nick, still).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly</li>
            <li> Would I be able to use short strokes without any pressure, overcoming my cartridge razor habits?</li>
            <li> These are some of the unknowns facing the first-time DE shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the first stroke with the 34C put my concerns to rest.</li>
            <li> It can only get better from here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being the first blade I&#x27;ve tried, all I can say is that I had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> My first DE Razor.</li>
            <li> smaller and thicker body looks much better in chrome.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this razor and have enjoyed the change to this shaving</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting back to DE shaving after many years away.</li>
            <li> This thing will last more than my life time.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> You plop the blade on and screw the top back on.</li>
            <li> The razor blade seats pretty consistently,so  </li>
            <li> I just tried this razor for the first time.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried the Merkur, I thought it wasn&#x27;t working because there was no resistance at all -- but it was working fantastically.  </li>
            <li> First time DE shaver, and</li>
            <li> this is my first ever DE razor.  </li>
            <li> Used with your favorite double-edged blades (I prefer Israeli-made Personna Red)</li>
            <li> All those new-fangled over-marketed modern B.S. razors with their balls and lubricating strips and what-not aren&#x27;t worth doodly-squat.</li>
            <li> I tried switching from creams to gels to hot foam, it made no difference.</li>
            <li> I used the Merkur HD for the first time tonight; this was the first time ever using a DE safety razor.</li>
            <li> This was the first safety razor i have ever owned.</li>
            <li> This is my first doube edge razor so have nothing to compare it to</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and it is virtually fool proof.</li>
            <li> this is my first razor like this.</li>
            <li> This is my first attempt at using safety razor and wish I would have done it once I started shaving years ago.</li>
            <li> Two sections of this review - looks / first impressions, and function.    </li>
            <li> Now to the shaving: I used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> I had a cheaper brand that i bought locally and this functions much better.  </li>
            <li> I especially like how I can better maneuver shaving under my nose and</li>
            <li> I recommend getting a sample pack to try many different kinds of blades.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I really do love the shave but the only thing I haven&#x27;t figured out is how to shave close under my nose.  </li>
            <li> This razor will last more than a lifetime.</li>
            <li> The short handle allows me to have more control while shaving.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too much razor for me!  </li>
            <li> First off, as I would tell anyone, a quality shave is the product of a lot of factors.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pick up a DE razor for the first time when you have to catch a train in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> but WOW, talk about a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my nephew wanted for his birthday.  </li>
            <li> Like many others, I browsed the numerous forums and reviews online before deciding which razor to get.</li>
            <li> The short handle makes it more maneuverable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a bit of a learning curve though, I cut may face for the first month or so.</li>
            <li> My first one still looks like the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love it and haven&#x27;t looked back!</li>
            <li> This is my first de razor.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> It is not difficult to get a BBS (baby bottom smooth&amp;#34; shave from this razor.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this razor as my first safety razor.</li>
            <li> The first razor I ever shaved with was a safety razor that was my dad&#x27;s during WWII, government issued.  </li>
            <li> This is my first D.E. razor.</li>
            <li> This was my first DE razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the blade that came with it, not the higher quality blades I purchased, so I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s giving me a closer shave than a cartridge razor.  </li>
            <li> The first thing you will notice is the weight and how well made the razor is.</li>
            <li> The weight is crucial because it allows better manipulation and control.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> My first DE razor.</li>
            <li> ; Well, in this case, they make them EXACTLY like they used to.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my first quality razor and I was tossed between this and the 1904.</li>
            <li> This was must first safety razor.</li>
            <li> It is my first DE razor.</li>
            <li> The most you could possibly spend on blades</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor.</li>
            <li> Just shaved with it for the first time Not difficult.</li>
            <li> Just received this razor today and I have had my first shave with it already</li>
            <li> while in this; it is only one fix and make sure it is tighten will</li>
            <li> Used mine for the first time on Christmas morning.</li>
            <li> First of all this is a very well made razor!</li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s very inexpensive!</li>
            <li> First DE used.</li>
            <li> just used it for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li> My first foray into safety razors.</li>
            <li> I will admit you need to be more cautious and not rush when using a double edge razor, but that&#x27;s not a problem.  </li>
            <li> It is rounded enough to prevent that, but is a bit more pointy.  </li>
            <li> I did use the included blade for the first three (3) shaves and am now trying out blades from a sample set.</li>
            <li> my first every DE purchase</li>
            <li> This razor has absolutely changed my outlook on shaving!</li>
            <li> First shave and</li>
            <li> At first you will get a bunch of cuts and there is about a month learning period.</li>
            <li> It does everything that my former Gillette multi-edge razor did and more.</li>
            <li> When looking to buy a double edge razor most reviewers recommended Merkur.</li>
            <li> I bought this a my first DE razor and could not be happier.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> at least four great three pass shaves per blade (WTG, XTG, ATG).  </li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor.  </li>
            <li> The bottom part spins to release the safety guide, as opposed to having to spin the entire top off.</li>
            <li> Excellent Shaver and would buy another one if this one fails for whatever reason.  </li>
            <li> Love it and will never go back!</li>
            <li> I spoke to the sellers, and they issued me a replacement blade for the one that had been bent, at no charge and first class priority.</li>
            <li> Solid as a rock and rust free!</li>
            <li> My first safety razor was the Edwin Jagger chrome plated razor.  </li>
            <li> First and foremost-</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I decided to pay extra for this razor.</li>
            <li> My first safety razor.</li>
            <li> The difference is this will last for 30 years or more.</li>
            <li> Heavy in the hand, good shave.</li>
            <li> After watching a few YouTube videos on how to prepare a good lather I was off.</li>
            <li> I also find that i can be much more precise with the Merkur and get those little bits of hair right under my nose</li>
            <li> I had to order a new one right away!</li>
            <li> The process of opening a jar of shaving cream (mine is sandalwood, which is quite pleasant), brushing it on and creating a lather, then letting the blade do all the work cutting my beard is just a nice way to start the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I own a few super speeds that I don&#x27;t use as often anymore.</li>
            <li> The shave was the smoothest I&#x27;d ever experienced, and I was worried the Merkur razor would not live up to the hype, just because the shave soap and scrub made such a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will likely invest in these other shaving tools to get an even better shave down the road, but my point is that you don&#x27;t need all the extras to get an awesome shave with</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, to sum up: amazing quality, very low price (compared to other products), better shave.</li>
            <li> Also, the checkered grip on the shaft is extremely grippy; I find that most of this checkering is just for show, but this grip really works and is comfortable.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the longer handled ones are fine too, but I like the appearance of this little gem.</li>
            <li> It feels just right in the hand, it is very well made, and it gets the job done well.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do as well right up under my nose, and I was gentle on my lower neck</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend to anyone who wants to shave the right way.</li>
            <li> But the plate flexes the blade to just the right angle for a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Get a few different blades up front (shipping will be free now vs. later) and find the one that works best for you.</li>
            <li> The shave is very nice, I have thick beard hair and this razor cuts through it with no problem.</li>
            <li> I recently did my first shave with this beauty and was not disappointed at all!  </li>
            <li> a little practice the razor provides the closest, most comfortable shave you will find.</li>
            <li> The Derby blades that came with it are also nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> The blade itself is quite sharp and effective, but shaving around the neck caused a bit of skipping.  </li>
            <li> EVEN IF YOU HAV SENSITIVE SKIN!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razor and worth the money!</li>
            <li> It is a very good razor for the price and the ATT razor is expensive, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor, it is high quality!!!</li>
            <li> This razor is rated very high and for good reason, it&#x27;s always a risk purchasing something that you have never tried and that&#x27;s why I rely heavily on my fellow reviewers</li>
            <li> point is that the blades are very high quality and you don&#x27;t have to use a new one for each shave, though they&#x27;re just about cheap enough and easy to find that you probably could.</li>
            <li> Either I&#x27;ve got a super wimpy face, or somebody stuffed the ballot box, or the emperor has new clothes, or lemmings are jumping of a cliff.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor to get your strokes down and comfortable with but after two uses i feel im ready for the single blade.</li>
            <li> If you are new to wet shaving and looking for a razor , this razor is is an exceptional choice.</li>
            <li> It took a few practice runs on my legs before I hit the bikini zone and wow what a great shave.</li>
            <li> I would and have recommended this razor to friends, and if you are looking for a great wet shave look no further.  </li>
            <li> I would and have recommended this razor to friends, and if you are looking for a great wet shave look no further.  </li>
            <li> The affordability of wet shaving is such a great saving.  </li>
            <li> wet shaving with a brush, soap, and DE razor is the only way to fly.</li>
            <li> It will almost certainly last my lifetime and is nice enough to be worthy of passing on to a child or grandchild.</li>
            <li> The chrome is substantial and it&#x27;s generally just a fine product.</li>
            <li> I also have larger hands and still find this short handled model easy to use, because shaving with this style razor is done more with your finger tips.</li>
            <li> Finally, any razor is only as good as it&#x27;s blade.</li>
            <li> The tighter you twist, the more likely you can break the handle (just like when you put too much force to tighten a screw, and it screws up the thread).</li>
            <li> Love the short handle...makes it much easier to maneuver across the face.</li>
            <li> Great shave, but you really nee to shave slowly and with the grain or you will cut the hell out of yourself.</li>
            <li> It was my second attempt at this type double edge razor to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> As a first time DE safety razor user I was apprehensive to use this razor, but from the first use I wonder why I was wasting so much money on plastic junk.  </li>
            <li> Also much much cheaper to use over time that the current better quality cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> and I love how much money I save with the double edge razor.</li>
            <li> It has practically eliminated the razor bumps I&#x27;ve had on my neck for my entire adult life (and to be honest, I expect it will --</li>
            <li> Really good razor for starting or if you&#x27;re just looking for something different.</li>
            <li> This German razor cost $15 more but is so much nicer.  </li>
            <li> , so it should resist nicks, dents, and mechanical wear better than the more common brass razors with chrome plate.  </li>
            <li> I still give it 4/5 because I don&#x27;t really understand why this DE has a short handle compared to most others.</li>
            <li> After sampling different blades, I have settled in on Astra Superior Platinum blades as they seem to be the sharpest and longer lasting blades for me.  </li>
            <li> Though there was a short adjustment period where I had nicks and cuts, I appreciated the greater control (and the cost savings) compared to cartridge razors.  </li>
            <li> Simply,it doesn&#x27;t have as much blade exposure as the 38C,and this problem had a great negative impact on my shaves with it.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised on how much better this &#x27;old style&#x27; razor performed compared to modern razors in terms of shave comfort and closeness.  </li>
            <li> Just the right size and weight to get a good shave in the hard to hit neck areas.</li>
            <li> Finally, the razor head can&#x27;t fit into the spot right under my nostrils-</li>
            <li> Good weight, very little pull , let&lt;br /&gt;the blade do the work.</li>
            <li> For anyone, like me, with less than fond memories of the old gillettes, this razor is a remarkable improvement.</li>
            <li> , this one specifically is perfect sized, only have problems in tight spaces by having a large head (Directly under the nose).</li>
            <li> And, the other thing that is just as good as the better shave is the fact that the blades cost less than 50 cents apiece</li>
            <li> handle is not very long, but I find that it is easy to grip and maneuver.</li>
            <li> This works great for that as well, just be careful when you do it as these blades are much sharper than anything from big name companies.</li>
            <li> The short overall length is something you might have to get used to, but is perfectly balanced to allow you to shave with minimal pressure.  </li>
            <li> I made the switch to &#x27;real&#x27; razors ;-) and could not be happier.</li>
            <li> So as far as cost, you at getting something that is more than 2X as cheap the first year and something nearly 20X cheaper the next.  </li>
            <li> This is a replacement for a Merkur long handle which lasted about 8 years before being dropped one too many times.  </li>
            <li> razor is one of the most recommended razors for beginners and long time users.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> Other reviews on this site have been great in learning how to use a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much the finest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Love it, wish I didnt wait so long to get it.</li>
            <li> I cannot shave against the grain, never have been able to, not surprised</li>
            <li> It has taken me this long to start to feel confident with the Merkur.</li>
            <li> The weight of the razor when I first pulled it out of the box was very pleasing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the long handle version.</li>
            <li> First time I used it, I applied too much pressure (</li>
            <li> Better than the long handle for my face.</li>
            <li> Much research led me to this as my first DE razor</li>
            <li> I usually have to go against the grain on my chin and cheeks to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li> the end result is no better than a good safety razor.</li>
            <li> Sometimes in grown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually used Gillette Fusion line of razors which were good.</li>
            <li> This razor is small and has some good weight to it.</li>
            <li> The shave is as good and long lasting as the time you&#x27;re willing to put in.</li>
            <li> Though i have been using de razors for the past 15years which are farely good, wanted to try merkur 34 c for all the comments its receiving the popularity it has.</li>
            <li> After a month and half, this Merkur blade is as good as new.</li>
            <li> The only thing you should be doing right now is ask yourself why you haven&#x27;t bought this yet!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend fits the hand just right</li>
            <li> I am using it with my regular shaving Gel after a hot shower and it works fine</li>
            <li> I just lined up the safety bar with my side burn, held the razor at angle that felt balanced in the hand, and let the razor glide down my cheek under its own weight for an inch.</li>
            <li> but if you have large hands the long handle is the better choice.</li>
            <li> No other way to shave for me than an old school &amp;#34;Hot Shave&amp;#34;.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the modern 2-5 blade disposable razors for years and they are just so much better (faster, less maintenance, and safer-you can easily cut your finger when loading a new blade).</li>
            <li> This razor is of high quality and love the smaller handle and weight.</li>
            <li> After watching several how to videos on YouTube and reading many reviews on Amazon I decided on and highly recommend this razor, feather blades, Escali badger brush, and Proraso shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Very heavy duty, price is fair.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just as good if not better than most cartridge type razors and much cheaper in the long run...</li>
            <li> I simply take a little more time to make sure I get everything right at the jaw line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (In other words, shaving with the Merkur 34C is very easy.)</li>
            <li> This handle makes shaving &#x27;Fun&#x27;  If you are new to this type of shaving handle, take your time while shaving to reduce nics and cuts.  </li>
            <li> Sick of paying crazy amount of money for today&#x27;s razor blades (4 blade) Using the Merkur #34 C works excellent, a better shave and the money I will save is incredible.</li>
            <li> I hope this review helps someone out there that thinks that his skin is super sensitive, because it is probably not.</li>
            <li> This thing is smaller than I thought but still easy to use.</li>
            <li> The short handle was easy to convert to.</li>
            <li> The handle is short and easy to control.  </li>
            <li> It had a learning curve after the milder shave from the old super speeds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> My advice is not to try a dry shave and do not go against the grain of your hairs until you have a better feel for the razor.</li>
            <li> Thirty bucks got me 12 cartridges before, now i can easily get 200+ blades for the same price.</li>
            <li> After his first shave with the Merkur HD double edged razor he was amazed at how smooth and close his shave was.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to take apart and the blade adjustment is very simple.  </li>
            <li> and I have used Wilkinson blades exclusively for the same consistent smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I simply guide the razor as it seems so easy to have a feather touch (no pun intended).</li>
            <li> The Art of Shaving told me to use the blade only 10 times, but i have easily gone over that with the 1 blade</li>
            <li> Simple to use and easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li> As an added bonus, it also allows easily loosening of the head to open it up a bit for rinsing.</li>
            <li> This razor is straight old school cool</li>
            <li> Strong 2nd place to 1954 Gillette</li>
            <li> /&gt;People who favor DE razors claim everything from them providing a better shave, to being faster, to being much cheaper (in the long run).</li>
            <li> The handle provides enough weight for good balance without being too long or unwieldy.</li>
            <li> Brand new razor in original package and came with one new Merkur blade.</li>
            <li> a Parker 100% Pure Badger Bristle Black Handle Shaving Brush, and an Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> ultimately decided to try this from Merkur, and have enjoyed using it very much thus far.</li>
            <li> It is considered a very gentle razor and therefor very easy to use for somebody new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> The heft of the razor allows for a nice glide down your face without applying to much force.</li>
            <li> I have fairly large hands and the \\&quot;small\\</li>
            <li> have large hands, while I have not tried one of the longer handled razors</li>
            <li> People with large hands may want to consider a longer-handled model by Merkur.</li>
            <li> I use it with a pure badger brush and William mug soap.  </li>
            <li> I have large hands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on purchasing one as a gift for my old-school father and am certain he&#x27;ll appreciate the quality.</li>
            <li> have* taken off large amounts of skin from using shaving techniques picked up with cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the learning curve involved in changing the way I shave, I just had some surgery which will leave a fairly large raised scar on my neck.</li>
            <li> You will certainly take pride in your shave with this.</li>
            <li> If you have large hands purchase the 38C, this felt like it was baby sized when I picked it up.</li>
            <li> If this is your first double edge razor it might take you 3-4 shaves before you get use to the smaller/heavy razor compared to your old one, but i now love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 100 Astra razors and also a blade sampler.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, its kinda fun shaving with an old timber type one too!</li>
            <li> overall this razor is easy to use, and not irritating.</li>
            <li> To put this into a bit better perspective, the Merkur razor along with 100 blades cost me less than 6 months worth of Gillette Mach 5 heads alone (which is to say, not including the price of their razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an excellent safety razor, at least based on my limited experience.</li>
            <li> If you only hold the razor with 3 fingers (picture chop stix) then you should be fine.</li>
            <li> In terms of blade quality, the standard ones that came with the razor work fine for me.</li>
            <li> Toss in a couple extra packs of razors or anything else with this fine razor bag.  </li>
            <li> In the end the shave is closer as I go with and against the grain, and there is no irritation as the blades are always sharp - because I am willing  to replace them more often.</li>
            <li> However, when I used the Big Ben blades, I was fine.</li>
            <li> it should work fine with big hands.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten what it is like, after shaving with the less than satisfying mass market safety razor and multiple blade nonsense for more years</li>
            <li> This razor is a short handled razor which is fine with me</li>
            <li> I had been pretty public about me switching from cartridge shaving to DE shaving originally for cost savings, despite the upfront investment.  </li>
            <li> Of course the savings is huge, but I never expected such a great shave from such a simple blade.</li>
            <li> If you are still interested, then why should you buy this particular razor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> The design is pretty classic</li>
            <li> It is easy to grip, aggressive enough for a very close shave, but not so much as to slice up my face.  </li>
            <li> first DE razor was a decent Edwin Jagger.  </li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t like it at all for the first week, mainly because I was overly worried about getting cut.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re interested in a classic shaving experience</li>
            <li> A classic razor in all regards!</li>
            <li> This is a nice little razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Modern cartridge style razors are more expensive but so much more convenient!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a nice little companion that offer</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend this to anyone trying DE shaving for the first time.</li>
            <li> When I first received the razor, I had really high hopes after reading all of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> The Merkur HD is of high quality, and affordable blades make it the logical choice for all men suffering from five o&#x27;clock shadows out there.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this razor for first time buyers which is what I am.</li>
            <li> There is also some discussion out there about how it might fit into your hands if you&#x27;re a large person with bigger hands and all of that.</li>
            <li> Handle is a little on the short side-making it great for travel.</li>
            <li> Allows for a good grip and ease of hitting the hard spots on my chin.</li>
            <li> If you want a razor that will last about a year or two then this is for you; otherwise, there are better quality razors out there for a little more money.</li>
            <li> I like using sharp blades and that they are super cheap.</li>
            <li> You will not get as good a shave and will dull the blade much faster.</li>
            <li> This razor is easy to use, with the proper technique, and much more pleasing than other forms of shaving that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Provides a heavy feel, is easy to clean and replace blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Blades are much cheaper and available at your local CVS, Walgreens etc.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve really started to enjoy the ritual of preparing shaving cream and taking my time with multiple passes etc.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s this good with the cheap ones, I can&#x27;t wait to buy some expensive ones, for like $5.00!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> most shaving websites recommend, I use HeadBlade&#x27;s HeadSlick shaving lotion, touch up with a styptic pencil when needed (not very often, unless I rush or apply too much pressure) and finish up with Gilette Aftershave Gel.    </li>
            <li> Mercur heavy duty is by far the most comfortable smooth daily shave.</li>
            <li> I was using an old vintage Gillette razor that was 80 years old, and when I changed to this, I noticed a huge difference in the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li> I got a sample pack of replacement blades and was much happier with some others.</li>
            <li> I transitioned to wet shaving with this product after using Mach 3 for many years.</li>
            <li> so much money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m much happier with the quality if shaves I&#x27;m getting now than I have ever been.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Shaving is really a skill</li>
            <li> All I can tell is that I have a much, MUCH closer shave</li>
            <li> It really made me almost regret jumping on the safety razor train.  </li>
            <li> On another note they listed it with 5 free blades, mine came with 1 merkur blade and 10 extra korean made blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have gotten no blades for free; I could have ordered some along with my initial order for a couple dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave is much closer than the disposable cartridge razor.  </li>
            <li> Since I was hesitant about buying a safety razor after years of using modern razors with multi blade disposables, I am commenting on that aspect.</li>
            <li> It is high quality!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to apply much pressure.  </li>
            <li> Now, I feel like my shave is cleaner for about a day longer, and much smoother on day 1.  </li>
            <li> crafted design, functional, and a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Solid and comfortable design.</li>
            <li> After my second shave I was blown away at how smooth silky</li>
            <li> Handling of spent blades can be kind of a pain, but overall it is definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Be forewarned though, make sure your face is wet or it WILL CUT YOU.  </li>
            <li> Regardless of which razor you choose, once you&#x27;ve purchased it, you&#x27;ll be ready to start saving money on shaving for the rest of your life.</li>
            <li> I really like the chrome finish and weight of the razor.</li>
            <li> but I actually really like it.</li>
            <li> I have smaller hands but can still grip it securely using two or three fingers.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready for the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleased with them; prices for DE blades can vary widely, and the Dorco&#x27;s are on the cheaper end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using too much pressure on.</li>
            <li> I really like this company.    </li>
            <li> I can reasonably expect my razor to outlast me...</li>
            <li> The Merkur 34c really stood out with</li>
            <li> The Merkur 34c is very well made.</li>
            <li> (How much are those cartridge blades now, $2 apiece?</li>
            <li> Unlike a modern razor it dles</li>
            <li> I started shaving with Save Secret shave oil with this razor and it makes for great combination.</li>
            <li> But, if you can take a moment to spoil yourself and to enjoy the necessary ritual of manhood.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.</li>
            <li> You REALLY have to know what you&#x27;re doing to use a safety razor.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really review them.</li>
            <li> what i really like about this razor is the knurled handle and the 2 piece design.</li>
            <li> the razor holds the blades straight with an even blade exposure on both sides.</li>
            <li> and this blade really does let you get things done</li>
            <li> To my surprise they were already smooth after a cross grain pass.  </li>
            <li> I got a very close shave with no nicks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Tips: use the weight of the the Merkur razor to cut your hair - don&#x27;t apply much force, stretch your skin while shaving, shower or wash your face with warm water prior to shaving (open pores), don&#x27;t use any chemicals after a shave,</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this should be the modern way to shave., and tighten.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this should be the modern way to shave.</li>
            <li> Get a straight razor and learn to use it.</li>
            <li> Overall a fantastic razor, if you like using safety razors.</li>
            <li> and i really like it.</li>
            <li> Unless of course your using a straight razor.</li>
            <li> I like the fact it is Stainless Steel</li>
            <li> Very close shave.  </li>
            <li> It also uses much cheaper blades.</li>
            <li> One pass with the grain and a second against gives me a shave as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Much closer shave.  </li>
            <li> My husband has this razor and really likes it.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy and well built.</li>
            <li> Thanks to everyone who had already posted reviews on this.</li>
            <li> I received mine this week and thanks to the videos on YouTube, have shaved twice with not one nick.</li>
            <li> There were actually 10 blades included in my order, even though it said 5 free blades.</li>
            <li> It was much easier than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> So, I wouldn&#x27;t shave very often to try to save</li>
            <li> Last year I was given a free Proglide Flexball.</li>
            <li> I just expected more for the price.    </li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve seen the process, then you can make a more informed decision about whether wet shaving is for you.</li>
            <li> but this razor is very forgiving.</li>
            <li> but I enjoy it now that I am trying different blades.</li>
            <li> Much closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> So, after much research I decided to try wet-shaving.  </li>
            <li> I was not expecting to have to shave twice to get anything approaching a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> This is a very well made and balanced razor.</li>
            <li> I like it as much as my 1958</li>
            <li> the advancement isn&#x27;t really need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a straight razor shaver.</li>
            <li> The product shaves very well.</li>
            <li> The blade changing mechanism is also very convenient.</li>
            <li> This razor has all the weight you need to get a close, comfortable shave with all types of double edge blades.</li>
            <li> I may switch to a straight razor one day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I used to use \\&quot;fast food\\&quot; razors.  </li>
            <li> There are also those who just like the experience of using a DE razor (I can&#x27;t say much about that, to each his own).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like all modern razors except stainless steel ones, it is made of nickel plated pot metal.</li>
            <li> You will throw out all of those Machs and track cartridges and get a real shave.</li>
            <li> unlike multi-blade razors, you really don&#x27;t need to use pressure for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very weighty and balanced and handles very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t found that too be much of a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He really likes the close shave</li>
            <li> Very well built.</li>
            <li> he knew what real shaving is about.</li>
            <li> If you do I notice it lifts one side of the blade too much.</li>
            <li> I really like the weight of this razor as well as the knurled handle.</li>
            <li> The two piece design is really convenient I find.</li>
            <li> I expected this razor to be better constructed than my Parkers.  </li>
            <li> I upgraded to the 38C and enjoy having the added weight and extra</li>
            <li> So I really don&#x27;t need the leverage of a longer handle the way I needed it with a cartridge razor</li>
            <li> I really like the weight and quality of this product, but I wish the handle was about an inch longer.</li>
            <li> I really feel like I am pampering my face.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Much.</li>
            <li> and I find this razor not to be very aggressive.</li>
            <li> This razor along with a brick of Feather blades, Proraso shaving cream and badger brush causes me to wonder how modern cartridge razors ever took hold to begin with.</li>
            <li> I shave my whole head except a goatee.</li>
            <li> does the modern man have hair on our face.</li>
            <li> razor itself is very well weighted and balanced.  </li>
            <li> it was doing its job very well.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> (going fast).  </li>
            <li> I like using this razor so much I shave every day now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very reassuring sensation.</li>
            <li> This razor has been very forgiving</li>
            <li> there is a longer-handled version if you really need it.</li>
            <li> Shaving is not as much of a chore now as it was.</li>
            <li> i really like the personna blades, which you can find on amazon for about $10 for 100</li>
            <li> LOVE this razor,but now I&#x27;m curious about the Seki/Feather AS-D2.....</li>
            <li> No adjustments to the razor are necessary (or possible.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are cheaper &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; razors available.</li>
            <li> and I really like</li>
            <li> The included blade was junk, didn&#x27;t cut my face but didn&#x27;t really cut my beard either, Immediately bought a pack of ASTRA brand blades.</li>
            <li> The finish on the Edwin Jagger is also much nicer.  </li>
            <li> they are only 19 bucks plus 10 free razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything from disposable razors to straight razors.</li>
            <li> (I even tried with just watter) all with the same results, completly pain free and close shave.</li>
            <li> He complains of razor burn and skin sensitivity after using these modern razors.</li>
            <li> but it seems very well built</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> And thanks for delivering it on time for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to those cheap plastic razors.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and simple design.</li>
            <li> I have also found this provides a much closer shave than any of the newer razors I tried.  </li>
            <li> If you are trying to find a cheap option, go with this razor and you will only have to buy a razor once.</li>
            <li> What I do appreciate is that I haven&#x27;t nicked myself that much using the DE razor.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I&#x27;ll continue using the DE razor and hope to improve over time and find it a much better solution for wet shaving.</li>
            <li> This works really well</li>
            <li> they really do differ and I recommend the sampler you can buy online.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to nick myself and I get a much smoother shave than disposables or cartridges.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see myself ever buying another one of these, unless it gets really worn out in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> ;, you can do so with the confidence that this razor will not carve your face into a work of modern art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t complain I just decided to take responsibly for it.</li>
            <li> The highlight is the stainless steel design.</li>
            <li> This is ALL stainless.</li>
            <li> Not even comparable to this really.  </li>
            <li> I received the item very promptly.  </li>
            <li> It has been very seldom though, so thats why I gave it a four star.</li>
            <li> Fast forward three years</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Just got into wet shaving and have been in enjoying it from the beginning.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m getting used to it, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Where it really becomes an issue is shaving around your jawbone close to your ears.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy it immensely.</li>
            <li> There really is no reason to spend more unless you are collecting these type of razors.  </li>
            <li> The sample pack i purchased came with 50 blades wish i bought 25 feathers, because i will be getting a straight blade with disposable razors.</li>
            <li> They sent me the feather blades, which I greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> Thanks for taking care of me, will buy from seller again.</li>
            <li> , I think the build quality is much nicer.</li>
            <li> so I approached it very cautiously.  </li>
            <li> Semogue boar brushes rival silvertip badger brushes and are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> and you will get a close, comfortable shave that will cost you next to nothing.  </li>
            <li> I also use Clinique shave cream which stays very close to your face and doesn&#x27;t foam.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave and solid feel.</li>
            <li> so it will be ready for shaving again</li>
            <li> Much heavier.</li>
            <li> The razor replacement cartridges are very inexpensive compared to the name brand Gilette brands.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the weight and balance</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> and i really like it.</li>
            <li> Each razor has something I really like but the Merkur is my go to safest of the safety razor quiver I have.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> It makes maneuvering the blade along the curves and contours of your neck and face much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like it so much</li>
            <li> Much easier to replace razors on this one.</li>
            <li> As many others say, try a few different blades in it...bought a sample pack and glad I did because did not dig the Feathers, they irritate my skin...</li>
            <li> they only sent me 3 of the 5 free Razor blades...</li>
            <li> A video I found very helpful on how to use a safety razor was http://youtu.be/2IuA8HGacJw</li>
            <li> Was a Mach 3 razor guy, but they price of their razor blades became too much for me.</li>
            <li> Did much research and settled on this razor.</li>
            <li> Zues haha,</li>
            <li> but really, it&#x27;s a razor that&#x27;ll make me pitch a sale for it.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> I could only shave comfortably with a cartridge razor about once a week.</li>
            <li> The quality of this razor really assists in the transition.  </li>
            <li> I change my blade every monday morning although I think I could run them much longer.  </li>
            <li> Works very well (Although I would have prefered one a bit longer).&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I gave wet shaving a try after not being able to stomach the disposable cartridge price at Costco.  </li>
            <li> The weight feels really well in my hand.</li>
            <li> Settled on this safety razor after much searching.</li>
            <li> Taking your time to get a smooth shave is essential to getting a shave as close as the multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> My aged sun-damaged skin is in better shape than it has been in years.</li>
            <li> Nice and heavy</li>
            <li> The Merkur is a more aggressive razor then the old Gillette razors you might purchase on eBay or elsewhere -- but not one that needs to scare someone just starting out.</li>
            <li> (Fair Warning: unless you&#x27;re a regular wet shaver, don&#x27;t start out with Feather blades -- work up to them.)    </li>
            <li> This is going to be the last razor I own, and I&#x27;ll be passing it along to my younger generations.  </li>
            <li> Yours may or may not have this specific brand of blade packed with it, but it is nice to start off with a couple different brands of blades for you to try on your skin; blades do matter, and I would recommend trying</li>
            <li> Since this was kind of a trial I decided not to order a traditional kit and opted to continue using canned cream with extra moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I did purchase a badger brush to lather my face, and I make sure to shave after I shower so the hair is as soft as possible.</li>
            <li> Sometimes going back to the old days isn&#x27;t better.</li>
            <li> So far my favorite pairing with this is the Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Silver Blue</li>
            <li> In the winter there’s just something comforting about the feel of warm heavy metal on your face</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I feel the blade has at least as much to do with a good shave as the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a rounder face and was worried the short blade wold make it harder to shave but on the contrary it allows for good control of the blade.</li>
            <li> This razor is by far, my favorite razor, it&#x27;s my second Safety Razor</li>
            <li> I love this razor and it is a definite improvement over my old mach 3, plus replacement blades are a hell of a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> So before you run out and buy more cartridges for your old standby, pick a double edge razor and give it a shot.</li>
            <li> razor has a good weight to it and the shorter handle makes it easier (at least for me) to shave.  </li>
            <li> Nice and heavy.</li>
            <li> Far better than the USMC issue safety razor I remember from Parris Island back in 83.</li>
            <li> and I will likely purchase a badger hair brush, good shaving cream and change to a sharper blade from my variety pack (probably Feather) in the near future to assist the process.  </li>
            <li> Nice, heavy feel razor.  </li>
            <li> You have to be willing to slow down, learn, and experiment to get the best results.</li>
            <li> Be sure to try out various blades to see which one is right for you as they are not all created equal</li>
            <li> I see it in the same way that a groundskeeper might handle a big area: you use the tractor mower to do the large acreages, the little riding mower to do the intermediate work, and the hand-held weed whip to do the detail work: no one machine is perfect for the entire job, but in combination you get the job done quickly and cheaply.     </li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> Try using plain old shaving soap &amp; a brush, &amp; get a good lather.</li>
            <li> It takes about the same amount of time and I very rarely nick myself.</li>
            <li> It was a much bigger investment but for me it was very worth it.</li>
            <li> The heft is perfect and the short handle is just right for shaving down across the jaw bone as a longer handle could require me to bend my neck back to less comfortable angles to give clearance.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin or are not familiar with this type of razor and know exactly how to use it, then perhaps a different type of razor would be more appropriate for you.  </li>
            <li> My problem area is under the nose, and although the Merkur doesn&#x27;t shave that spot as economically as the Fusion precision blade, it works far better than any other solution I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> The first time you use that soap with your new razor you will think you came out of a barber shop with that smell and close shave    </li>
            <li> This was the first I bought new</li>
            <li> Yea it might cost a little bit more in the beginning, but this razor gives me a better shave and it is going to save so much money in the long run.  </li>
            <li> Part of it is technique, but the other part is absolutely the lack of better shaving tools and lotions that I now have.</li>
            <li> So I originally started shaving with a safety razor using the flawed Edwin Jagger DE89 because I heard good things about it as well</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted a razor with a short or long handle, but am glad I went with this one with a short handle.</li>
            <li> when compared to holding most modern cartridge razors it feels like there just isn&#x27;t enough space available for my average sized hands.</li>
            <li> I chose Derby blades (rated a 1) because my whiskers are fine, and because blades rated 1 are more forgiving (less likely to cut yourself).  </li>
            <li> Much better than any other razors with double/triple/quad edges.  </li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve shaved with the Gillette Fusion something or other and figured I&#x27;d never find a better shave.</li>
            <li> Despite having all those other razors, more often than not, I use this one.</li>
            <li> Outstanding razor and exceptionally sharp.</li>
            <li> After the first pass I actually checked the mirror to make sure it&#x27;d actually shaved me.</li>
            <li> Better than the other aggressive slant.</li>
            <li> have no experience with other Safety razors, but this is hands-down better than the 4-blade cartridge I was using before.</li>
            <li> see other reviews for more details.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the first blade more than five times (I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s advisable, but it&#x27;s my first safety razor, so what</li>
            <li> and I find I am using more pressure then on other safety razors I use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this to many of my other friends, some of whom are considering trying it too.</li>
            <li> but I am pretty sure this is going to be a permanent change and never look back at cartridge shaving again, especially once you consider the continuing costs involved with both.  </li>
            <li> was looking for a better alternative to shaving due to razor</li>
            <li> Takes me an extra 30 seconds over a disposable safety razor (a hair slower under the nose) but totally worth what I save not having to buy fusion pro glide blades!</li>
            <li> The single blades are super economical.  </li>
            <li> I am shave daily because I work in a professional environment, and it&#x27;s important how comfortable the shaves are because I certainly feel it, and razor burn and nicks affect the following</li>
            <li> bought for my husband who is an experienced shaver with the old style razors-he loved the weight of it, but after using it a while said a longer one would be better, and it is a little difficult to use due to the length of it..</li>
            <li> But since it is somewhat larger and clumsier than a disposable, I still keep my disposable at hand to clean up in and around my lips, nose, ears, and adam s apple.</li>
            <li> With the Merkur a 3rd pass is just for clean up.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> but you do need to be more careful compared to the normal cartridge razors to not nick yourself.</li>
            <li> it shaves great, far less irritation than the slant bar but equally as close.</li>
            <li> Clean shaves are a must daily</li>
            <li> I was scared that I would be carving up my face with a saftey razor, but as long as you&#x27;re patient you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Overall great razor though be warned it is quite small in size.</li>
            <li> The one razor was decent, but I really had to work to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I found this razor simple to use and to clean</li>
            <li> Quick and professional service, I&#x27;m excited to do business with these people again in the near future.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to make the switch to single blades, this razor will go easy on you while delivering a world-class shave.</li>
            <li> There definitely is a bit of a learning curve, but the whole process was surprisingly intuitive, especially if you read a blog or two about proper shaving technique.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried Dollar Shave Club, Henry&#x27;s, a straight razor (for the high maintenance shaver), and then on a whim decided to try a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will take less time with practice, and will save money on blades in the long term, so the investment was very worthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful, seriously substantial feeling in your hand, and the blades are very inexpensive, especially when bought in a pack of 100.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, this is a great razor to get you into the game.  </li>
            <li> You can get outstanding help if you are new to wet shaving on YouTube at &amp;#34;Paulshaves&amp;#34; too.</li>
            <li> Once I got the skills right and with combination of this cute small well built DE razor and blades ( I use both Personna and Feather) - shaving is not a chore.</li>
            <li> I definitely made the right choice in razor selection!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Takes up very little space and looks nice sitting on counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes up very little space and looks nice sitting on counter.    </li>
            <li> using one of these takes a little longer than more modern cartridge razors, but the shave is smoother...and so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> The three inch short handle really enhances my shaving experience tremendously.</li>
            <li> After that, apply something like Aveeno or a natural cream that doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance or alcohol(I just used Lubriderm daily moisture) and let that soak in(if you have a non-alcoholic after shave,its the time to use it).Finally,put something on that&#x27;s loose(boxers,soft panties) and made of cotton to prevent</li>
            <li> BUT the razor is only half of the battle, if you combine this razor with a good brush and shaving soap you will notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Why had men switched from such a sensible, elegant, and ultimately cheaper method of shaving towards ever more gimmicky and increasingly less effective disposable razors?</li>
            <li> This new, made to look classic, looks great but works poorly.</li>
            <li> At 24 cents a blade, that translates to huge long term savings.</li>
            <li> I bought the long handle, which I enjoy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a short razor, and I think it would be easier to follow old angles learned from disposables with a long handled razor, but being that this is a double edge, it may be good to start fresh.</li>
            <li> Wet shaving gives me fantastic shaves, and the variety of soaps available only add to the pleasure.</li>
            <li> and I find the blade loading/unloading simple although not as cool as the \\&quot;butterfly\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s short but has a good solid grip handle with a solid end grip.</li>
            <li> One video had the instructor shaving a five (5) day old beard, which by the way came off like a hot knife through butter.&lt;br /&gt;I summoned my courage and tried the DX razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it short and sweet.</li>
            <li> I have some pretty sensitive areas on my neck, but using this razor has been a blessing.  </li>
            <li> After realizing that it wasn&#x27;t that hard to do and gave me a good shave without the razor bumps, ingrown hairs, and irritation of modern razors I decided it was time start fresh with a new razor that would last me years.</li>
            <li> Jumped head in first and no regrets!!!</li>
            <li> I normally use a Norelco rotary and then clean up with a disposable blade or possibly a cartridge like a Mach 3.</li>
            <li> I imainge I&#x27;ll be able to pass this razor down to my great-grandson 60 years from now.</li>
            <li> Most debate seemed to come down to this product and another from Edwin Jagger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I still have a pack of Feather blades to try but wanted to make sure my technique was down before trying those.  </li>
            <li> my favorite, hands down</li>
            <li> I will say this is a very early review as today was the first time I shaved using my new Merkur 34C HD DE razor.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it is a perfect little handle that shall last you for ages.</li>
            <li> Quality razor that gives a great shave in less time than my old Gillette and I will save $ in the long run.  </li>
            <li> The short handle takes a little adjustment, but the weight feel good.</li>
            <li> B01JB4UQ7C NEW!</li>
            <li> Incidentally, I have large hands and long fingers, the 34C was fine as the weight and non-slip knurled grip gave the feel of old world craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> I first got onto the single blade safety razor from an old cheap hand</li>
            <li> B002RJC1HC 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle &amp; Free Stand from Parker Safety Razor]]  -A mug to mix your lather  -And a few minutes of your time each morning    </li>
            <li> I tried all the \\&quot;new age\\&quot; razors that have very pricey replacement blades.</li>
            <li> I think alot of the modern and new razors are just to line the pockets of companies</li>
            <li> You want to take as much time as you need to pay attention to all the new sensations that guide the shaving process.</li>
            <li> Very forgiving for anyone new to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> As stated, I am new to this type of shaving, and I very seldom get cut.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind, I used to shave with straight razors, so I was somewhat familiar with shaving with a single blade.</li>
            <li> The shave it provides strikes me as middle-of-the-road with regard to aggressiveness, with some being more and some less.  </li>
            <li> The shave it provides strikes me as middle-of-the-road with regard to aggressiveness, with some being more and some less.  </li>
            <li> This shaves better, gives less no razor burn</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use with a careful technique.</li>
            <li> Better than what I previously used.</li>
            <li> I used my favorite brush and Jack Black Supreme Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would give me a better shave, with less irritation.</li>
            <li> Cheaper, less irritation, better for your skin and for the environment...</li>
            <li> less is more.</li>
            <li> Seems to cut better if I loosen the blade slightly.</li>
            <li> But there are better options for less.</li>
            <li> I felt a lot better with this product then my previous razor.</li>
            <li> The Merkur seems to be less aggressive which is better for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To spending less time in the shower and more time in front of the mirror.</li>
            <li> Not as many nix as the week/s previous.</li>
            <li> Super solid, heavier than I expected, and easy to grip with that gnarled handle.</li>
            <li> buying this razor my main concern was which style should I get?</li>
            <li> In Conclusion,  You will not go wrong with this razor; I am sure that you will be glad you purchased</li>
            <li> The quality is such that it will last for many years if not forever.  </li>
            <li> - I used the Personna - Red from Israel - these are better than the Astra blades and double the price.   </li>
            <li> Get the 100 Shark Super Chrome Double Edge Safety Razor Blades to go along with it</li>
            <li> The classic.</li>
            <li> Classic.</li>
            <li> but I mainly now use Derby blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally bought one and stopped using regular shavers you buy in stores.</li>
            <li> Having purchased it on a whim as an alternative to the Gillette Super speed I&#x27;ve been using before now, I have gotten the chance to finally try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again be patient and it will soon be second nature like using the old, cheap multi blade</li>
            <li> This will give you a decent shave</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s built very solid, it has a good heavy feel in the hand.  </li>
            <li> and I have probably owned them all from the classic twin razor to the Mach 5 with a lubricating strip and vibrator</li>
            <li> For a fellow that shaves his head I went through cartridge razors fairly quickly, and while I replace these razors with the same regularity, they&#x27;re tons</li>
            <li> For a fellow that shaves his head I went through cartridge razors fairly quickly, and while I replace these razors with the same regularity, they&#x27;re tons</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble producing good lathers, but in hindsight I think I would be happier with a smaller brush.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviewers and you tubers love this razor, even when compared to much more expensive options.</li>
            <li> curve).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a pack of 25 different blade types, so it is highly possible I will find a blade that I get even better shaves</li>
            <li> Unlike a traditional razor like the Mach 3, a safety razor is designed for more than one pass in different directions.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only marginally better than the injector razor that I formerly used.</li>
            <li> I found that Gillette Silver Blue blades work especially well with it - better than the blade that comes with it.</li>
            <li> But the electric shaver just can&#x27;t handle stubble older than 2 to 3 days</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re probably here because you&#x27;ve got some interest in trying a classic shave.</li>
            <li> The shorter handle actually allows for better control and movement (because there isn&#x27;t a lot of extra handle to deal&lt;br</li>
            <li> Classic look and feel.  </li>
            <li> several YouTube videos on how to use a DE razor and luckily haven&#x27;t nicked myself yet.  </li>
            <li> This was the main reason why I bought the Merkur 34C.</li>
            <li> I thought to myself, this is a proper and well-made tool and worthy of respect.  </li>
            <li> The gap is bigger and open comb is better.</li>
            <li> I wish that I had known about this particular brand of razor 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> Feels like it will last forever, just the opposite of most things in our disposable society.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s main competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor is heralded as a classic for a reason.</li>
            <li> I was initially concerned about the length of the handle, but those worries went away quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to any other form of shaving, using a safety razor is one of the most relaxing things I&#x27;ve been able to do in a long time.</li>
            <li> The blades drop onto the pegs with alacrity and when the head is screwed down it lines up precisely and consistently every time.</li>
            <li> Single edge razors are really cheap.  </li>
            <li> After sampling a few of the brands I found that Derby suits me well and is a perfect combination of not being too dull where you will get resistance shaving and not being too sharp where you will cut yourself easily.  </li>
            <li> Overall, double edge shaving takes a little more time than cartridges but it&#x27;s cheaper and better for the environment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go splurging like I normally do for a more expensive model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go splurging like I normally do for a more expensive model.</li>
            <li> Due to the vagaries of shipping times, I actually received all my shave accessories before the razor arrived, so I had a chance to experience wet shaving with a Gillette Mach 3, good shave soap, and adequate face preparation before my Merkur razor arrived, and then compare the two.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a lot of other razors that I use from time to time -- including super speeds, adjustables, fat boys and tiny Gillette travel razors -- some more than 50 years old.</li>
            <li> Best shaves only require a single sharp blade and proper preparation.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to go from the typical double/triple blade razors sold at CVS etc to this Merkur.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the switch from cartridges.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> also highly recommend using an alum bar after you shave.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t fault the seller (no promises having been made), the Dorco blades have been highly unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s high marks and praise from users.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> watched videos, done some reading, bought some high quality products......  </li>

            <li> I would highly recommend it, but I would also warn that shaving with a DE razor can be tricky.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product for a beginner.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind a shorter handle razor, I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest trying anything else and seeing how it works for you.  </li>

            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Merkur.</li>
            <li> Blades are about $10ish dollars for a high quality 100 pack.  </li>
            <li> However I would highly recommend this to someone who is unsure of how to shave with a DE.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> what I&#x27;ve inspected of the build quality and everything, it isn&#x27;t over-priced, you are getting a high quality Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Unlike Feather, Merkur blades do not come highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product quite highly.</li>
            <li> so I started looking into buying a cartridge razor, but found the price of replacement cartridges rather high.  </li>
            <li> It is a high quality, durable, long-lasting razor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this razor to anyone wishing to enter the art of shaving.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this if you are thinking of the switch.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for beginners.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for learning how to shave with a DE.</li>
            <li> So I bought this highly crafted razor like my Father used.</li>
            <li> Our fathers and grandfathers and further back passed tradition on as well and many of them shaved with a DE or a straight edge but with the advent of the cartridge razor the tradition has nearly died out.</li>
            <li> Our fathers and grandfathers and further back passed tradition on as well and many of them shaved with a DE or a straight edge but with the advent of the cartridge razor the tradition has nearly died out.</li>
            <li> Same great Merkur razor for a lot less than our local retailers were offering.</li>
            <li> Second, this razor is heavy, which admittedly provides a more aggressive shave than the super speed I used to use, but newer users should be cautious of applying pressure to this</li>
            <li> Its a razor blade guys, just be careful and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> Many passes needed.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes one little hair would have to be passed over 10 times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which makes it a little more aggressive than the 34c.</li>
            <li> However, unlike the cartridge razor, the wet shaver can try a different brand of razor blade (you might be surprised to see how many are out there!)</li>
            <li> Also, being a two-piece, a little more care needs to be taken when handling/changing blades.  </li>
            <li> It forces you to take a little more time but</li>
            <li> Look around a little while and you&#x27;ll learn that this Merkur is top notch in the world of DE shaving.</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave could be a little better.</li>
            <li> It does take a little more time shaving but it is a pleasure to do so.</li>
            <li> I find you need to spend a little more time</li>
            <li> You have to use a little more technique with any DE razor</li>
            <li> Though I admit it is a little more work</li>
            <li> This is a professional instrument and makes my 16-blade plastic-clad supermarket razor look like a toy (although it most certainly is not a toy; kids, don&#x27;t play with razors!).</li>
            <li> /&gt;DE technique is easy to learn due to the design</li>
            <li> offer a effortless shave  DE technique is easy to learn due to the design  </li>
            <li> The handle and weight make it easy to spin to use the other side.</li>
            <li> My first round has been with Merkur blades, and I&#x27;m about to experiment with other brands, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have a goof here and there, but overall I love the feel of the razor, the quality, the look, etc.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy another razor and chose the Merkur 34C due to its strong reputation--basically being the state of the art in DE razors.  </li>
            <li> After a few strokes, it very quickly becomes intuitive, and you just know what inputs into the razor will give you that positive feedback.</li>
            <li> When you consider how cheap and easy it is to replace blades, which last for a month easy, this razor will make you feel silly for not making the move years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild and safe and the cuts I would inflict on myself were from me not being careful where I had sharply raised blemishes on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to classic shaving, but I have to say</li>
            <li> your time with learning this classic way of shaving and do a your research if you are new at it.</li>
            <li> it is a great blade but expensive.   </li>
            <li> They really should issue a Merkur razor to young men as they enter puberty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Aside from that it&#x27;s a great investment over expensive cartridge based systems</li>
            <li> By the way, I clean and dry my razor and blade after each use; it looks like the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working very well for me so far</li>
            <li> My shaves are much closer than my old Mach 5</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I came across the old school double-edge razor and the whole wet-shaving enthusiasts.  </li>
            <li> So far i really like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, I was surprised how much of a difference the pre-shave scrub and post shave lotion made.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of it, it is not slow</li>
            <li> I really had no trouble adjusting and look forward to every shave.</li>
            <li> but the razor really needed to be professionally re-plated</li>
            <li> It comes with green tea and oatmeal, and I love how it smells and how my face feels after I apply this.</li>
            <li> Yours may or may not have this specific brand of blade packed with it, but it is nice to start off with a couple different brands of blades for you to try on your skin; blades do matter, and I would recommend trying several.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now, and love it.  </li>
            <li> I considered getting the long handled version because it was more like what I was used to, but this feels really solid in my hand</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and will last you a lifetime.</li>
            <li> and that last pass will be as gentle as the first.</li>
            <li> I used normal barbasol and nothing else</li>
            <li> is normal, but for the region we are working in this will be enforced a bit more}.Saying</li>
            <li> Only on rare occasions will you need to go against the grain.  </li>
            <li> The cheapest one gives me a better shave than this was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Been using this razor for a few months now and just love it.  </li>
            <li> It will definitely save money in the long run, and it turns shaving into an enjoyable ritual instead a hassle.</li>
            <li> So my buddy who is italian and pretty much a beard afficinado recommended the Merkur 34c to</li>
            <li> No nicks, closer shave, and most importantly, no irritation.</li>
            <li> find myself shaving a bit more often than I did with the multi-blade razors I used to waste my money on, but that&#x27;s no problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but of normal sized hands i guess of someone who is 6&#x27;3.</li>
            <li> I tried the blade that came with the razor at first and didn&#x27;t really like it and actually started to doubt about my decision.  </li>
            <li> I just love how if I dont shave a few days</li>
            <li> This is such a good close shave and in my opinion it is not challenging at all.  </li>
            <li> I rarely knick myself and I do my entire head and neck.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first double edge razor so I will say that it is not as close a shave as modern multi-blade types.</li>
            <li> but if you want a normal size length razor then get the longer version of this.</li>
            <li> Not to big and not to small a good normal size</li>
            <li> what I normally use with my multi-blade) and nicked myself a a lot.</li>
            <li> love coming across products that are built to last; and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this is the last razor I ever buy.  </li>
            <li> The only good thing about the electric is it is so fast and easy, but it comes nowhere close to even a disposable blade shave and within a few hours I have a pretty serious stubble going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normal shave really takes no longer than the old disposable, is closer and way cheaper once you have the set-up.  </li>
            <li> This razor has been reviewed with very positive user experiences and my experience confirm the public reviews are correct.</li>
            <li> Other than that it does fine.</li>
            <li> , if you&#x27;re new to double edge razors, there&#x27;s a sample pack which is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny, especially for a new DE user.</li>
            <li> After a few practice shaves, my shaves are just as fast and easy, with NO razor burn at all.</li>
            <li> I have had far less cuts and razor burn when using this razor, and it produces much better</li>
            <li> 100 double edge blades for $22.00 right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> just got fed up with razor burn from cartridge razors - I would constantly break-out on the right side of my neck.</li>
            <li> but Personna Double Edge Razor Blades seem just right for my face</li>
            <li> It has enough weight that it gets through the toughest stubble and is just the right length to alter your grip when shaving on either side of your face.</li>
            <li> When you get the right lather, a blade that works for you, and a proper DE razor, you won&#x27;t even feel that you are shaving.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the high price at first, but upon seeing and feeling the quality of the product I&#x27;m sure that it was worth it.</li>
            <li> It is heavy and well-made, with a simple two-piece design that makes changing razor blades quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned that some reviews said the handle was too short, but I find I hold it with my thumb and first 2 fingers rather than gripping it in my palm.</li>
            <li> Being a multi blade cartridge guys for the first couple years of my shaving &amp;#34;career&amp;#34; I was a little worried about getting cut, shaving causing more break outs and ultimately cost.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving my back hair (yes girls hate it) with cartridge/disposables using the awesome and simple and elegant</li>
            <li> and although I use hot water to warm up my brush, I now use cold water to shave because I felt hot water was opening my pores too much which increased irritation.  </li>
            <li> Maybe people with very large hands would prefer the longer handle version, but for me this has been working quitewell for the last 6 weeks or so that I&#x27;ve had it</li>
            <li> I am a tall male (6&#x27;2&amp;#34;) with decent sized hands.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave with very little irritation.</li>
            <li> but the blades are sharp and cheap    </li>
            <li> Yes it felt smooth if I ran my hand along the grain, but go the other way</li>
            <li> I have light beard growth and have been shaving with this every other day since I received it without any irritation.</li>
            <li> What was impressive, even on the first shave there was minimal cutting and bleeding.  </li>
            <li> thing takes a bit of practice (I highly recommend short strokes the first shave or two)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the Merkur blade that came with it - it cut me up a lot (though I was new to this, so maybe it was my fault).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new with safety razors and did&#x27;nt</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a relatively new convert to shaving with a double-edge razor, having been brought up on disposable cartridges.  </li>
            <li> My new razor of choice?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to DE shaving, but I can tell you this, after having this razor,  </li>
            <li> For new people who are wanting to try this: I shave once a day, every day.</li>
            <li> My  go-to razor when I&#x27;m trying anything new (blades, creams, soaps, etc....)</li>
            <li> Moving into a new job that required me to stay</li>
            <li> and I am getting a smoother shave with a new blade every 10 day.</li>
            <li> hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Every new blade is like a new razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every new blade is like a new razor.  </li>
            <li> but this new one I cannot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving this way , I used to use Mac 3 .</li>
            <li> I bought my wife a brand new car for the summer and in return she bought me this razor.</li>
            <li> You read that right...a new multi-blade razor drags and pulls like shaving with sandpaper.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried using a new system and feared that I&#x27;d knick and cut my self to shreds.  </li>
            <li> so new shaver beware - let the weight of the razor do the work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m new to this style of razor,</li>
            <li> The Merkur still looks like it is brand new</li>
            <li> The razor still looks brand new</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably try another brand when I have to get a new one.</li>
            <li> I received this razor in new condition</li>
            <li> Live and learn I guess.</li>
            <li> I also just like putting a new blade in and going,</li>
            <li> DE razor for someone new to this style of shaving.</li>
            <li> they also promised a new blade that didn&#x27;t come with it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who whats a quality razor to start out a new shaving addiction.</li>
            <li> Rinsing it off after every use has kept it looking new.</li>
            <li> I could live with it but decided to try another Merkur as the 34c</li>
            <li> Decided I wanted a new one</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this new</li>
            <li> I needed a new razor that would not irritate my skin...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving</li>
            <li> and I do have to pay attention which I never did when I shaved with a new Gillette, but i get fewer ingrown hairs, and almost never get any razor burn like I did with that thing</li>
            <li> It could still pass for brand new.</li>
            <li> so I compared it with my new Merkur using Derby blades.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to keep a good grip on this short handle for that area.</li>
            <li> Their blades are not super sharp but this was good for me to start on and they still do well.</li>
            <li> The blade replaces easily and costs less than one-tenth of a gillette proglide replacement cartridge.</li>
            <li> In no time you will be enjoying and looking forward to your next wet shave.</li>
            <li> Maybe someday I&#x27;ll try the expensive stuff from Taylor of Old Bond Street and the like, but for now I&#x27;m happy with this Nivea cream.</li>
            <li> Shaving is not as easy, and the size of the shaving head makes it more difficult to see when near sideburns or underneath my nose.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this (unavoidably) is that it really does take time to learn how to use this properly and quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice heavy double edge handle.  </li>
            <li> I finally began to enjoy the entire process of shaving.</li>
            <li> Its weight and size encourages you to be gentle with the blade and produces a very close shave at the same time.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as smooth as the 38C , though the 34C&#x27;s blade gap should be bigger than my earlier 38C&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The single most important rule is to go slow.  </li>
            <li> Modern and new doesn&#x27;t always mean better</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of weight to it, and feels very natural.</li>
            <li> skin is also very sensitive as well, so shaving with cartridge razors would always result in razor bumps and burn.  </li>
            <li> skin is also very sensitive as well, so shaving with cartridge razors would always result in razor bumps and burn.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high in glycerin, so it holds lots of water and leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Had used high quality, multi-blade razors, the Merkur far surpasses all of these.</li>
            <li> Very professional and well built.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for people with​ sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Some say you shouldn&#x27;t buy feather blades if you are new to double edge shaving, but I used them as my first blades and haven&#x27;t cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new into DE razors, so this is my first and only DE razor</li>
            <li> It seems expensive initially, but with the amount you save on razors (including the very tangible benefit of changing your blades more regularly because they&#x27;re so cheap), I&#x27;d say the outlay is well worth it.</li>
            <li> As far as blades are concerned, I purchased a 5-pack at my local drug store for $1.00 (that&#x27;s right, $1.00).</li>
            <li> so everyone saying it doesn&#x27;t give a good shave you clearly dont know how to use a safety razor or you aren&#x27;t that smart sorry</li>
            <li> After nearly a dozen shaves, this little fella is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li> Just started shaving with a double edge, and this was my first razor.</li>
            <li> Blades I&#x27;ve used and like include Crystals, Derby Extras, and the pretty much universally recognized sharpest blades made: Feathers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first Double Edge Razor (safety razor).  </li>
            <li> how many nicks I&#x27;ve gotten in the past month if that gives you an idea.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The razor looks exactly the same as when I bought it, no rust, no signs of wear.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really small</li>
            <li> Bear in mind, however, that I go through a 20-30 minute process every time, and it involves in-shower facial exfoliation, hot towels, glycerine shaving soap, brush, pre-shave oil, three razor passes and balm</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used the razor, I knew I&#x27;d never go back.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the Merkur is how solid it is.</li>
            <li> WOW, what a difference!</li>
            <li> Surly, the only thing that disposables razors like the Mach 3 and Schick Quattro have going for them is that they&#x27;re able to automatically contour to every pivot of your face; the learning curve of shaving with the 34C or probably any other safety razor depends on the person but it may take you about 8 to 10 shaves to start getting baby faced smoothness.</li>
            <li> Having decided to go the double edge route I researched to find the best &#x27;starter&#x27; razor that would last and perform without fail.</li>
            <li> Just one thing as you shave since it has a slick top</li>
            <li> Because of this, I notice a few more nicks than the average user (or than I did with the Weishi), but when I get a chance to shave in soft water, the improvement is significant.  </li>
            <li> It is my first safety razor, and I can&#x27;t imagine switching back anytime soon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are other types of blades, and look forward to trying those out in the future.  </li>
            <li> My first double edge razor.</li>
            <li> This is my first double edge razor.</li>
            <li> For me it is about a week before needing a change - but it is significantly cheaper than any of the other disposable or multi-blade options.  </li>
            <li> If this is your first and only razor that you have used.  </li>
            <li> It is my first experience using a double edge razor</li>
            <li> First, this razor is relatively short, so large-handed users or those who prefer a longer razor should consider the 38C instead.</li>
            <li> This Merkur is the second I&#x27;ve owned (first one from another manufacturer fell apart...</li>
            <li> My first double edged razor.</li>
            <li> Far better than shaving with cheap disposables or expensive electric razors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure plain and simple and healthy.</li>
            <li> where I know I&#x27;m sensitive, so I did about as well there as I normally do.</li>
            <li> I have been using a badger brush from frank shaving, and the taylor of old bond st sandalwood cream, what a delight!</li>
            <li> First time using a DE razor, and it has taken some adjustment, but definitely like the razor.</li>
            <li> Yes, the handle is shorter than a typical disposable, but that&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> and I said WOW!</li>
            <li> I realize that I shouldn&#x27;t go for complete removal, but compared to the cartridge razor, I have to do at least 3 passes or more to achieve a real close shave.  </li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor after using disposable blade razors my entire life.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am an African American male who, like many others, has had to deal with razor bump issues.</li>
            <li> This is my first double edge razor.  </li>
            <li> Now I know where that extra money went;)  </li>
            <li> This is my first double edge razor.</li>
            <li> This is my first double edge razor.</li>
            <li> Tell P&amp;G to stick it and go old school!</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to use a different technology at first</li>
            <li> Excellent piece of hardware, though I found the handle to be too short and uncomfortable to shave with, especially compared to the Gillette Fusion I had been using.</li>
            <li> My beard comes in pretty coarse</li>
            <li> I already use the Merkur Futur Gold (probably the most... or second most expensive Merkur).  </li>
            <li> This is my first time trying out a double edge and after a lot of online reading I decided to get the 34c.</li>
            <li> I am 6&#x27;2\\&quot; and have pretty big hands.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow!</li>
            <li> I do 2 passes, the first across the grain and the second against the grain.</li>
            <li> First time I have ever used a double edge safety razor and I am sold.</li>
            <li> The irritation of the cartridge razors is a thing of the past and to top it all off</li>
            <li> For a moment while shaving for the first time, I thought that the razor did not work; I didn&#x27;t feel a thing, i.e. there was no &amp;#34;tug or pull&amp;#34; of the DE blade on your facial hair.</li>
            <li> for the razor functioning itself, this is my first foray into double edged razors.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a double edge razor</li>
            <li> Initially I was interested because of the rising cost of easier shaves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every article on wetshaving recommends this as a first razor, and I agree entirely.  </li>
            <li> I shave with the grain first pass, against the grain second pass</li>
            <li> Once I switched to shaving with a double edge razor, my skin was clearer after first use.</li>
            <li> Had it the next day for my first shave.</li>
            <li> The handle on this model is only about 3\\&quot; from the head of the razor, but it still does exactly what is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it would make it more stable, but the lighter weight is noted and not preferred.  </li>
            <li> Try other blades if you order this razor and take the time to learn the techniques required to use this tool properly and you will be rewarded with a better shave than with one of those multi-bladed jobs.</li>
            <li> For a close shave, I will do two passes, the first with the grain and second against.  </li>
            <li> initially (being used to disposable razors), but decided the original design involved a short handle for a reason.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to any guy who&#x27;s tired of being reamed by those disposable cartridge rip-offs and who really wants a superior shave.</li>
            <li> but I never really used it full time.  </li>
            <li> This particular model has been considered a standard, and reputable for being of the highest quality and long lasting.</li>
            <li> This clears easily by dunking into the sink with little effort.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and only requires double-edge razors as replacements (which are much much cheaper than conventional 4 or 5 blade replacements).</li>
            <li> At 51 yrs old I discovered the wonder of the old classic double-edged (DE) razor.</li>
            <li> Very simple to use and clean I like it even though I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and sanitize for for those who have probems with skin infections and acne;  just disassemble and place in alcohol, or just dip the head of the razor in a small jar of alcohol, then let dry on you</li>
            <li> A little too small for my liking, nonetheless works great.</li>
            <li> Imagine my delight when I didn&#x27;t get a single nick during my first shave!</li>
            <li> I love this item, I get very harsh ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> clean the razor with a little antibacterial soap and a cheap toothbrush after every shave (being careful around the blades).</li>
            <li> I will admit I do not love it nearly as much as some others who describe their new shaving ritual as calming or therapeutic though I do enjoy it far more than I ever have shaving in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and produces a very slick lather.</li>
            <li> look forward to learning more about other old school units and further my shaving education.  </li>
            <li> This old fashion shaving is getting new life for me.  </li>
            <li> far I can get four or five shaves from a blade and change when it begins to feel like I was using a NEW multi-blade razor.  </li>
            <li> I waiting a very long time before buying this razor and it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I have never used one before, but with a few strokes it was easy to pick up.  </li>
            <li> I quickly realized that I couldn&#x27;t drag the razor like I had before with the Gillette fusion.</li>
            <li> Not near as good as the Gillette Fusion at least for me.  </li>
            <li> Once I feel confident in the process and have mastered it, I look forward to stepping it up and possible passing this one down to my son.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to get one like the Merkur where the entire head clamps down on the blade.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the older razors work fine but need a really sharp blade to totally get the job done.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the short handle dissuade you - a short handle gives better control than a long one.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a problem shaving with it, but it actually looks funny its so short.  </li>
            <li> Everything they do say about DE shaving is true though - there is zero tugging or pulling and its miles ahead other shavers.  </li>
            <li> The handle is shorter than most of todays modern multiblade-headed razors which unlike DE (double edge) razors usually also have a floating head.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you are tired of cartridge systems and are willing to spend 1 minute more every day shaving (due to the fact that you need to be more careful).</li>
            <li> I really enjoy shaving with my new Merkur Heavy Duty.</li>
            <li> In essence this was a \\&quot;last resort\\&quot; in an attempt to get that close shave that lasted more than half a day and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling</li>
            <li> above lips better than typical cartridge razors.  </li>
            <li> When I used a disposable super expensive razor like the Gillette Fusion Proglide, I would get razors burn and as a results many bumps on my neck.</li>
            <li> Also I quickly got used to the short handle and actually like it now.</li>
            <li> I had only saved with multi-blade disposable razors, but have quickly made the switch and will not be going back.</li>
            <li> , this razor is quite steep investment and at $44 it is one of the more expensive ones in its class, but once you start factoring in long-term maintenance costs -- ie, replacement blades -- this razor quickly pays off.  </li>
            <li> I just plug in a sensor excel razor, cheap, no special razors,</li>
            <li> Sadly, even a normal blade feels better and closer with the right soap.  </li>
            <li> All in all this razor works just fine on his heavy beard, but he said he misses the adjustable angle of the Futur.</li>
            <li> All parts are heavy, all metal, and finely machined.  </li>
            <li> The construction is extremely sturdy, the razor looks to be very well made and you can tell that the Germans really took their time building this thing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plain to see why this is a classic safety razor -- the perfectly-weighted handle is short enough to make it easy to control while generating enough pressure to support a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> These are my results, yours will almost certainly differ, and be equally valid.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I knew that if I ran the blades across my face, at a certain angle, I would definitely end up with ingrown</li>
            <li> I certainly recommend it if you&#x27;re just starting out.  </li>
            <li> This is largely me being very critical-</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy the little whiffs of scent throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> It is probably about a medium aggressiveness, and so it gives a smooth shave with little to no discomfort.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (oh gods does that sound naughty!).  </li>
            <li> If you are new to wet shaving (as opposed to cartridge shaving), then you have to decide if you are willing to learn a new skill.</li>
            <li> There is a slightly larger gap between the blade and safety rail, which allows the user to get a little closer but requires more precision.  </li>
            <li> Some people were saying that the longer handle Merkur was hard to maneuver while shaving the face and that it was intended more for shaving legs etcetera.</li>
            <li> I pair it with a super sharp blade, (Feather) and I get close shaves without carving my face up.</li>
            <li> If equipped with a super sharp blade like a feather, you must take your time.</li>
            <li> Outstanding safety razor that would be hard to improve upon.</li>
            <li> Hard not to be pleased...</li>
            <li> Blades are usually dirt cheap even for high quality ones.</li>
            <li> One factor that should benefit longevity is that this razor is solid stainless steel (from Solingen, Germany no less!)</li>
            <li> decided to purchase this razor after 3 weeks of research into wet shaving and in all honesty with much reluctance to try something that held a razor capable of leaving you in need of stitches.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been intentionally neglecting shaving since Amazon emailed me that it had shipped, so I had quite clear cut forest look going on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using various cartridge razors my whole adult life.</li>
            <li> For me, the Merkur with Feather blades was the clear winner.  </li>
            <li> I recently decided to give DE shaving a try while I was semi happy with &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; razor closeness and over effect the cost seemed silly to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a fairly mild razor, mild enough to shave with it daily without irritation; but open enough and with enough blade exposure and clearance to easily tackle a few days of growth.  </li>
            <li> Clearly used and returned.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and the merkur blades left my skin very irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Forget about your old style of shaving.</li>
            <li> and I smell likea barber shop (although not overpowering at all, my wife can&#x27;t tell) and shaving old school like my grandpa is just a bonus</li>
            <li> 21 year old that has been using disposable razors from Costco since I started shaving.</li>
            <li> I just used thee old shaving foam</li>
            <li> Head is as far as I can tell the same as the regular entry-level Merkur (which I also bought for comparison), so whether you buy this or stick with the $29 entry-level &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; should depend on how important (a) 2-piece vs. 3-piece is to you, and (b) whether you like the short handle or not.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Micro Touch One with the included Dorco blades before I got this one, and soon realized that although I could tell Double Edge shaving was the way to go- after blowing too much money on Fusion blades-</li>
            <li> I have a fairly coarse beard that grows fast.  </li>
            <li> (In fact, I have no doubt that it&#x27;ll work far longer than just my lifetime.)    </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be MUCH happier if you force yourself to use fingertips only; the shorter handle encourages this.    </li>
            <li> My complete shaving set consisting of this razor, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> B002JW8S6K Bloc Osma Natural Alum Block]], [[ASIN:B000RI8BZQ Proraso Shaving Cream 5.2 oz (147 g)]], and</li>
            <li> This is similar to the price of two bulk-packs of Mach 3 refills from Costco, so don&#x27;t agonize too much.</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old</li>
            <li> and I used to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; using a electric trimmer because my skin is so sensitive that I couldn&#x27;t use any blades.</li>
            <li> All Natural Shaving Oil</li>
            <li> - I used the Kai Stainless Steel Double Edge Razor Blades from Japan-</li>
            <li> Not so much a disposable personal care item,</li>
            <li> A gentle hand is clearly necessary.  </li>
            <li> I, personally, have to use the lubricant oil or this gets to be a bit much for me.</li>
            <li> I NEVER had that from the old razors.    </li>
            <li> My father had what I call an old fashion double-sided razor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably operator error, but it was getting old, man.  </li>
            <li> If your current shaving situation leaves you feeling less-than-satisfied as mine did, then you absolutely won&#x27;t regret picking one of these up.</li>
            <li> The result: nearly BBS shave with no blood or no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still go back to Straight Razor shaving</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still go back to Straight Razor shaving</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I was a sucker too.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an old expression: if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> Freakin&#x27; old school.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seems to be enough to affect the quality of the shave, but when paying this much for a razor, I think it should be built</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no school like the old school</li>
            <li> So far, it does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Solid and very well built.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I have used both the blades so far.</li>
            <li> it tends to get dried out and the blade does not flow smoothly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as using the razor, there is a learning curve to it.</li>
            <li> Then one day I thought of the old G.I. Joe razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll wait until we move to a soft water home to judge what is supposedly the sharpest blade on the market.  </li>
            <li> Much like getting a straight edge shave, the shave did not seem as close as I thought it should be, however, it seems to take longer for my facial hair to grow back.</li>
            <li> I fail to be overwhelmed by this razor and wet shaving, however, I am still using it and may become more pleased.  </li>
            <li> As far as a shaving soap or cream, some folks will say you need to buy fancy brushes and soap.</li>
            <li> I thought to myself, if I were to make the switch and since the cheap blades will pay for the actual razor over time I might as well purchase a more expensive Merkur.</li>
            <li> I am a novice at DE shaving ;I am 50 yrs old..</li>
            <li> I use a quality natural oil soap/creams that have  jojoba oil and  shea butter.</li>
            <li> Some dislike the short handle, but I found that, once I got used to it, I much preferred the shorter handle and the control it gave me over the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> and they were trying to get rid of a box of 20 year old Personna blades.</li>
            <li> Hold the razor at the very tip of the handle (opposite the head)and</li>
            <li> I used it this Merkur twice and it nearly ripped my face off.</li>
            <li> But the multi cartridge razor would leave my face so sensitive I would have to skip a day or two.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Merkur 34c and a tub of Taylor of old bond street sandalwood scent</li>
            <li> You may be surprised at what you find.</li>
            <li> It is very well built, I expect this will be the last razor I will ever have to buy as it is built</li>
            <li> I had old safety razors that worked well.  </li>
            <li> He decided to go retro and get the old school style razor for a closer shave than with disposables, and gets fewer ingrown hairs to boot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In closing dive in an try it its rather simple and not that much to get started in.</li>
            <li> A simple &amp;#34;twist &amp;#34; of the knob at the bottom of the razor will release the head for the blade change and you&#x27;re ready to shave.</li>
            <li> I am surprised about how well this works.  </li>
            <li> He says it is by far the closest shave he has ever had.</li>
            <li> and I am 50 yrs old.</li>
            <li> I decided to finally switch from the very well marketed cartridges to this safety razor.  </li>
            <li> Actual stainless steel.  </li>
            <li> Heavy, well finished, and precise blade release mechanism.</li>
            <li> but I prefer it to my old butterfly-opening razor because the blade angle at the edge provides a smoother shave.  </li>
            <li> My wife got this razor for me as an early father&#x27;s day gift.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve learned there&#x27;s a reason why the DE Safety razors where the only real choice for shaving for 100 years.  </li>
            <li> As the cost of replacement drug store brands has gone up dramatically he had been looking into the old school blades.</li>
            <li> far as the razor,my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Persona USA made blades with it (works well for my sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> : I used an Omega Professional (model 10049)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lather: I used Nivea Men Sensitive Shaving Cream, which comes in a 3.5oz tube.</li>
            <li> It often left me with lots of irritation and a reasonably close shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much heavier than your standard plastic Gillette or Schick.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have been prone to ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving with straight razors off/on for the last year or so.</li>
            <li> It has also reduced my shaving costs considerably.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for nearly 20 years.</li>
            <li> So I grew to accept that shaving would just naturally involve a bit of discomfort.</li>
            <li> Think I&#x27;ll stick with my old reliable Gillette.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with ingrown hairs and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is very well-made and will probably last for 30 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been frequently bothered by ingrown hairs with the multi-blades razors, and haven&#x27;t yet (fingers crossed)</li>
            <li> Then I came across an online discussion regarding shaving and after a few minutes of search here and there, I was surprised to see that the old school shaving method that I used to use back when, has become the trend and is probably better for my skin (explained why I never had razor bumps before</li>
            <li> So far, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the selection.</li>
            <li> You can get a Maggard&#x27;s razor or a Parker 26c for cheaper and have a better, or at least equivalent razor.</li>
            <li> I am a 41 year old novice at DE shaving</li>
            <li> I use this combined with Feather blades, The Art of Shaving Lavender cream, a Parker silver tip badger brush, and finish with Nivea sensitive skin aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin always felt a bit inflamed and sensitive to the touch after using it, even with just 2 passes.</li>
            <li> Using the 34C with Personna reds and Nivea Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li> but after a few go&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve gotten comfortable with it.  </li>
            <li> I like the handle&#x27;s feel and action.  </li>
            <li> Now, I do feel like I get a closer shave than with the old mach 3, but it comes at the expense of adding a couple of minutes to my shave.</li>
            <li> I even like the Merkur razor blade included with the purchase, but razor blades are very subjective to the specific user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started shaving old school and bought this razor along with the soap,brush and stand.  </li>
            <li> I get a much closer shave despite the fact the it seems every hair on my face grows a different direction.  </li>
            <li> He has extremely sensitive, oily skin and this razor</li>
            <li> As far as the fear factor, of hacking your face.</li>
            <li> I very seldom have any nicks or cuts, no different from using a cartridge razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 57 years old</li>
            <li> After way too much research, I decided to buy this razor and give the Double Edge Safety Razor a try.</li>
            <li> I have nicked myself several times because of to much pressure being applied.  </li>
            <li> solid feel and size... works really well</li>
            <li> This was after reading a lot if reviews and trying to find a solution to sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I shave almost every day and have sensitive skin causing razor burn and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I still have to get used to loading and unloading the blade without the butterfly action.  </li>
            <li> I was using an old Gillette razor that my father-in-law had, so I’m</li>
            <li> and I think he misses his old razor.</li>
            <li> When you compare the cost of maintenance with this as compared to the disposable razors (namely the blades and frequency of changes), this is cheaper by far.  </li>
            <li> I began using an old butterfly type Gillett</li>
            <li> I ordered the Merkur 34C along with some additional Merkur blades, some Taylor of Old Bond Street St. James Luxury Shaving Cream,  </li>
            <li> My sensitive skin needs all the help it can get .</li>
            <li> When compared to my old Mach3 this thing has some weight and doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy at all.</li>
            <li> This razor fixed what I found lacking and didn&#x27;t cost an obscene amount.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably used it 5 times since I got it last week and not so much of a hint of a nick or cut.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor after using cartridges for a long time.</li>
            <li> Plus, I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but my face feels a lot naturally lighter after the shave, when compared how it would after a shave with a Fusion.</li>
            <li> if I wanted to get anywhere near a close shave.</li>
            <li> handle is short (at his request) and very maneuverable.  </li>
            <li> After having done some considerable research, I asked for and received this razor for my birthday.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am a beginner and I had no trouble learning with this razor.</li>
            <li> WOW, the VDH is now part of my travel kit and the Merkur is the stay at home premium.</li>
            <li> I found no blemishes in the finish and it seems like it&#x27;s built to far outlive it&#x27;s owner.  </li>
            <li> But with each side having different shaving characteristics, it was too much to deal with.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to modern day multi blade cartridge systems.</li>
            <li> The merkur is solid and well made, very hefty and feels like a well built tank in your hand.</li>
            <li> Will never go back to modern technology or advertising.  </li>
            <li> Feels solid in the hand and shaves very well</li>
            <li> I love my Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s short and heavy and that&#x27;s what I love about it.</li>
            <li> Proraso green is what I went for and was pleased with the ease of shave and coolness the menthol and eucalyptus left.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also the rare thing these days which is obviously designed to last.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re moving from electric razors, you may want to learn about wet shaving before making the switch, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> And you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product, Merkur is really good, well made,</li>
            <li> Best shave I have ever had in my life, and I absolutely hate shaving before switching over.</li>
            <li> I tried a straight razor and while on my face it was ok the backside of your head with a straight razor is a bit scary</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t use shaving creams or soaps of any kind, which no matter how &#x27;natural&#x27; they may be, aren&#x27;t truly natural [always gotta be some darn chemical or refined ingredient in there or just unnecessary stuff].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To my surprise during my first shave, this cut so smoothly that i wasn&#x27;t sure if it was cutting at all!</li>
            <li> it was good, but expensive.</li>
            <li> Nice weight to the razor heavy in the hand don&#x27;t need to add any additional pressure to shave my rough bread.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although there was a little trial and error in the beginning, my routine is now pretty quick and simple.  </li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving, but this razor is solid and comes highly recommended by others.</li>
            <li> When the price of new cartridges became almost equal to the price of this highly recommended razor, I bought one, about 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One new, high quality, double edge razor handle cost $50ish dollars.  </li>
            <li> I would like a little more handle but not as much as the other one.  </li>
            <li> Shaving with a DE brings back this tradition among men and puts this time-honored right of passage back in our hands.</li>
            <li> Shaving with a DE brings back this tradition among men and puts this time-honored right of passage back in our hands.</li>
            <li> Choosing the right angles will make or break the shave, I go for a 30 degree angle, than I try to get as low of an angle as possible to perform baby face shaves.</li>
            <li> The weight allows you to apply very little pressure while shaving and the size makes it easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> other beginners - be aware!  </li>
            <li> As a newbie to wet shaving w/ safety razor, I thought I had a unique opportunity to test some different razors before I developed any opinions or biases.</li>
            <li> Just drag it along at the right angle.</li>
            <li> There is definitely a learning curve in order to get a clean shave, especially coming from regular cartridge razors and electric razors which require no effort at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s dry now, by gad....and no broken parts!</li>
            <li> textured handle means I have full control, even with slightly slippery hands</li>
            <li> Had been a Mach III/Fusion guy till now, but I found I was going through the cartridges rather quickly (around 2 months, on average).</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor, and have been using it for two weeks now, and not one single nick.</li>
            <li> Clearly this is a product that is not only built to last a lifetime, but to be passed down from father to son and maybe one more time after that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a very solid construction and I have no doubt that I&#x27;ll be able to pass this down to my son when he gets old enough.</li>
            <li> It locks down nice and tight.</li>
            <li> One thing I really like is that the head is really flat</li>
            <li> The chrome on the top piece near the sharp edge pitted and came up allowing water to contact the metal underneath and created jagged sharp metal at the edges.</li>
            <li> the sharp part) is large in proportion to the handle, and it weighs about as much as a decent size wrench.  </li>
            <li> Easy to maneuver around my upper lip and chin and those tight areas.</li>
            <li> I also really like the fact that this razor looks and feels really weighty and high quality, and will never have the gross residue that builds up in a conventional razor that has rubber inserts.</li>
            <li> I love the short handle on this Merkur razor which makes it easy to shave in awkward places.  </li>
            <li> Outstanding quality and a serious instrument.</li>
            <li> Classic German .</li>
            <li> now it is a production, I tried with just oil in the shower to do a direct comparison and it is not a good method to try while learning it. :)</li>
            <li> the course of the past year, I have tried a number of safety razors, ranging from classic Gillette Super Speeds to designs like the RazoRock Stealth Slant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put no less than 20 dudes onto this system for shaving.</li>
            <li> I love the small handle and overall size of this razor.  </li>
            <li> It seems to cut better for longer than all the multiple place disposables I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> That will only get you through the first third of the year.  </li>
            <li> But those are becoming harder and harder to find and buy.</li>
            <li> Initially I was concerned about the handle length (which was a lot shorter than my cartridge razors), after my first shave I found that the length of handle actually helped in the balance and control.</li>
            <li> After some research I couldn&#x27;t decide whether I wanted to heavy duty (fat) handle or the long model for better control and grip.</li>
            <li> You can buy a cheaper safety razor if you just want to try it out, I think they all pretty much come with a few blades.</li>
            <li> I originally got the product, and due to a problem with my local delivery agent (it was lost by the USPS, not the sellers, and was damaged)</li>
            <li> use this after a hot shower and only apply regular shaving cream by hand.</li>
            <li> This is my first double edge safety razor, and I doubt I&#x27;ll need to ever buy a second.  </li>
            <li> Also if you have large hands, you might want to consider a long handle model.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully by next week I have this down to 15-20 minutes and be comfortable DE shaving in the morning before work.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> They were simply way to high.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this Merkur to anybody looking for a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> A high quality well balanced double edge razor made in Germany.  </li>
            <li> Less cuts, less ingrown hairs, less razor burn, great smell with Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving Cream.  </li>
            <li> After several shaves I highly recommend Merkur and their 34C.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for several reasons.</li>
            <li> Besides the small size its very easy to use basic design feels like it will last a life time.</li>
            <li> I have been frustrated with the 2 giant razor companies&#x27; prices for many years, and the continual addition of more blades seemed ridiculous to me, especially when the companies discontinued their old models, which worked as well or better than the new ones.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I have huge hands, but the razor is only half the length of my Mach 3</li>
            <li> It is important for someone just starting to do some serious research on the various razors that are available because they have different levels of aggressiveness.  </li>
            <li> After watching several online videos and reading a few \\&quot;how to&#x27;s\\&quot; the switch was fairly easy for me.  </li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this razor and it looks beautiful</li>
            <li> Long term, this is much, much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Light weight and small.</li>
            <li> I have relatively small hands and feel that the shorter handle on this razor is comfortable and controllable.</li>
            <li> It is not for the inexperienced shaver or a first time shaver.</li>
            <li> Turns out making numerous passes is normal with these types of razors, and that re-lathering &amp; re-shaving is something you&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li> As a first time \\&quot;wet shaver\\</li>
            <li> I switched from cartridges to this, it was my first foray into wet shaving and DE razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m ok with that because of its heavy head; this extra weight let&#x27;s the razor do all the work without me having to place extra pressure on the handle to press the razor against my face.</li>
            <li> The construction is high-quality, rest assured this razor will likely outlive you under normal use and abuse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would give this a solid four out of five simply because I think that it should ship with a few more courtesy blades given the cost; otherwise I would have given it five stars.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would give this a solid four out of five simply because I think that it should ship with a few more courtesy blades given the cost; otherwise I would have given it five stars.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected from Merkur:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time wet shaver</li>
            <li> I did my first wet shave today</li>
            <li> This razor is my first attempt/return to wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> I guess this is the razor I would recommend to a friend who was interested in taking up wet shaving.</li>
            <li> so for those of you who want to make sure the inner works of this thing get dried out, it does come apart into 3 (actually 4) parts...</li>
            <li> However, while I think it is a good idea to try various products (and certainly with various brands of replacement blades) I don&#x27;t feel that this razor is necessarily one you leave behind simply because you started with it.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a little shorter in handle than I&#x27;m used to from the pro disposable head razors, but you get used to that quickly.</li>
            <li> This razor wins hands down.  </li>
            <li> I was torn between them but now having owned both the EJ89 for me wins hands down.</li>
            <li> It motors through a week&#x27;s worth of stubble without slowing down.</li>
            <li> One note is that the handle is a short one, so if you have large hands you should look for a razor with a regular sized handle.</li>
            <li> He was impressed by the quality of the product, as well as how much less expensive shaving would be in the long run.</li>
            <li> but I expected a little more.</li>
            <li> Should&#x27;ve spent a little more on a mergress.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper in the long run than the major brand disposables.</li>
            <li> The 34C will hardly wear out and is easy to care for.</li>
            <li> I did my first DE shave on a lazy Sunday morning after a nice long shower, and I encourage other newbies to do similarly.</li>
            <li> In the long run it will save me money and in the short run it&#x27;s very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> After only ever using cartridge razors with the standard long handle, I was worried this would be too short to use comfortable.</li>
            <li> It may sound like you&#x27;re spending more money on razors, but you definitely save in the long run... and when I say long run, I mean a month or two you probably get it back.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to learn the art of wet shaving with this razor due to</li>
            <li> Merkur 34C must be a more aggressive blade angle and blade tolerance than the other 3 because it gave a smoother shave with less passes.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable Merkur razor isn&#x27;t recommended for anyone new to double edge shaving since it is easier to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and the only thing I can compare it to is the cartridge style razor which is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]]and 1</li>
            <li> /&gt;Started looking to buy a new electric razor for another $200.&lt;br /&gt;Happened upon the Merkur #34C&lt;br /&gt;It was intruiguing.&lt;br /&gt;Bought it cause wanted something different.  </li>
            <li> I will never go back to the new school shaving again.</li>
            <li> you are new to the double edge world; buy this!</li>
            <li> After reading numerous reviews the Merkur #34 HD kept popping up as the One to buy for new shavers.</li>
            <li> The only suggestion I would have for someone new to safety razors is to buy a sample pack of blades and see which brand works for you.</li>
            <li> It provides a close save and, after you get used to the new technique required to shave with a double edge razor</li>
            <li> and as I thought it was just the change in shaving, or possibly the blade, but after a couple days of this new shaving I had no irritation.  </li>
            <li> After shaving the 10-day old wild growth off of my face I can assuredly say that this is the razor I&#x27;ve been looking my entire life.    </li>
            <li> The bottom of the razor unscrews so that the blade can be changed, and the stainless steel gives it a very solid feel that makes you think that this razor will be the last one I will every need to buy.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I recommend the use of Proraso Ultra Sensitive Saving Soap with a badger brush, an alum block, and witch haze after shave (I use the type that is mixed with aloe).</li>
            <li> No way the Feather razor is worth even half that price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the angle of the blade is different or not as much blade is exposed , but I can say, it&#x27;s definitely not too aggressive.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use the handle size is no longer and issue and it feels plenty comfortable to hold, especially since safety razors aren&#x27;t meant to be pressed against the skin, just glided across with the shaving cream of your choice.</li>
            <li> Works very well on African American skin/beard types with almost no ingrown hairs to worry about.</li>
            <li> If you want a solid razor with quality construction at a reasonable price look no further.</li>
            <li> so much I bought a 2nd one as a christmas present for my brother.</li>
            <li> Well, I shave my whole head and have been using cartridge razors for years, they keep making them more expensive to use.  </li>
            <li> At first i was a little skeptical even after reading all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> This will give a much closer shave then new conventional razors.</li>
            <li> Moving to the single edge blade really reduced the amount of ingrown hairs too.</li>
            <li> If you need to clean it because soap scum or other gunk starts to build up, I&#x27;ve left it soaking overnight in vinegar and baking soda and it was clean as new the next morning.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had a major cut.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I read everything I could from every source I could find, and finally decided on the Merkur 34C, all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> These blades are incredibly sharp so you do need to put a little more care into your shaves.</li>
            <li> No Regrets!</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other shavers out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is small enough and easy with a protective shield to lessen the ability to accidentally cut yourself.</li>
            <li> Took me a few weeks to achieve nick free shaves, so if you are new to the safety razor wet shave, buy a styptic pencil with it.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of razors that have thinner smooth handles and they are difficult to control when wet and easily results in nicking my neck.</li>
            <li> The blades never felt smooth over my face and left me raw no matter what angle</li>
            <li> It was not very hard to learn how to use properly.</li>
            <li> Rough surfaces are harder to keep clean.</li>
            <li> small nice little shaver</li>
            <li> Showed up exactly as expected and is very high quality.</li>
            <li> I have to shave twice, one right after the other, on a daily basis</li>
            <li> Double edge razors set the bar for close shaving luxury and whichever razor you choose to use will be highly dependent on your personal preference(s).  </li>
            <li> Solid construction, feels like I could fight my way out of a corner with it and not only still have a clean shave afterward, but I could pass this down to someone 40 years from now</li>
            <li> That is the beauty of owning a safety razor, though, you can now buy ten different razor blades for less than the cost of one cartridge and each one will give you a unique shave till you find what suits you.</li>
            <li> After researching the web for hours, I decided on this model due to the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> So I generally just shaved with multi blade cartridge.  </li>
            <li> I am starting to get over my fear of cutting my throat and am finding that this is incredibly smooth and shaves close even with the light touch that is required.</li>
            <li> clog nearly as fast as a cartridge and clears faster allowing for long passes through even several days of growth.&lt;br /&gt;Allows</li>
            <li> The textured handle is really nice on this product and makes it very stable to hold: it would be difficult to accidentally drop this razor even with wet, soapy hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My razor completely fell apart after one month of moderate use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it with the merkur platnium razor blade that came with it so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different ones -- including adjustable and fixed head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m in the middle of the sensitive skin and whisker coarseness camp.  </li>
            <li> I once had an old DE razor that belonged to my grandfather, but eventually followed the big razor companies as they added 2 and 3 blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the trick is to use as soft a pressure as possible.  </li>
            <li> For the record, I have eczema (not on my face, but the sensitivity of my face is clearly apparent), and I don&#x27;t have a water softener.  </li>
            <li> I have a 30 year old Gillete used in the same water.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy another one of these when my two boys get old enough to start shaving.</li>
            <li> I want something that will look old school and last just like those without the tacky upgrades.s to allow any metal to stress and break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I want something that will look old school and last just like those without the tacky upgrades.</li>
            <li> The razor is heavier than I expected and very well made.  </li>
            <li> However, if you find that you like wet shaving, you may very well end up buying this razor (and others) anyway.</li>
            <li> I can remember my dad shaving with an old Gillette double edge razor and always cut himself</li>
            <li> This is a solid razor with old school craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> Husband has always had really sensitive skin, so he couldn&#x27;t shave with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Apparently EJ&#x27;s have this problem because they use cast steel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the same blades (Astra Platinum) and shave cream (Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood)</li>
            <li> I just barely touched it to my face and it sliced through the hair like butter.</li>
            <li> No regrets.  </li>

            <li> 1st DE razor but fantastic product, short handle but heavy enough to do the job</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the handle would be too short, but now that I have used it for month, I like the maneuverability it offers.</li>

            <li> He wanted this because he wanted to go back to the old way of shaving.</li>
            <li> Sometime in the 70&#x27;s I switched from my trusty old Gillette double edge razor to the Schick Injector Razor and others as they were advertised and released.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an old Gillette red handle for years and thought I&#x27;d try the Merkur.  </li>
            <li> One is that I expected it to be made out of stainless steel because that is what the description says.</li>
            <li> I have never used any double edge safety razor before, as far as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I ever trashed my old double edge years ago.  </li>
            <li> Was never a big fan of shaving, but decided to try the old fashioned way of shaving to see what the fuss was about.</li>
            <li> and I am welcoming back an old friend.</li>
            <li> So I decided to go old school and never looked back.</li>
            <li> I am back old school:  </li>
            <li> it reminds me of my Dad&#x27;s old Gillette safety razor that I would occasionally sneak a shave with!</li>
            <li> Only used it a couple of times so far, but it seems like a well made razor.  </li>
            <li> I use this razor, an Astra blade, and regular old sunflower cooking oil to shave.</li>
            <li> I have so far tried Derby, Personna (Red), Crystal, Merkur and Astra.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I can&#x27;t describe the feeling of shaving with the Merkur Duty Double Edge razor.</li>
            <li> The short handle threw me off at first since I have big hands, but now I understand that following the contour of your face dictates the smaller handle.</li>
            <li> Just let the weight of the razor do the work or barely touch your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as money goes, I bought 1 10 pack of razors for 7.99, I shave every day, and I still have 1 razor left after 7 months!  </li>
            <li> Electric, double blade, triple and even four blade razors; and none of those come close to this \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; safety razor.  </li>
            <li> Apparently you can dislodge it if so inclined, as I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Art of Manliness and became interested in the art of a proper wet shave.  </li>
            <li> I was finding that the more blades a system had, the worse the irritation.</li>
            <li> so you get the under the nose/upper moustache area better without having to contort your poor nose.  </li>
            <li> the way, did I mention that the cost of a DE blade is approximately 15 % of the cost of a Gillette cartridge and gives you twice as many shaves?</li>
            <li> I thought I would only go straight down for my first few shaves to get the hang of it, but by the end of my first pass I felt likeI could go crosswise on the next pass.</li>
            <li> I find that the Merkur blades are not very sharp and recommend getting something else.</li>
            <li> The blade cover is shaped like a regular razor so the shave isn&#x27;t as aggressive, easy to use, and hard to get cut (unless you are not cleaning it).  </li>
            <li> My first shave with this razor was like a dream compared to my other razor!</li>
            <li> While the cut bled pretty badly, overall I cut myself much less frequently than I did with a multi-blade plastic razor.</li>
            <li> This is a fixed head razor and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, including those new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Overall I like the shaver, but I am so new to saving with a double edged razor</li>
            <li> Had the handle for my replaceable cartridge blade break on my just after buying a new one, so I finally made the plunge into double edge razors.</li>
            <li> Once you  get used to shaving with a double edge razor, you will never go back to all the new fangled razors on the mkt.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that I can add anything new here that hasn&#x27;t already been said, but I will say that between switching to this type of razor and watching You Tube videos on shaving, I feel like I am learning how to shave correctly after shaving for many years the wrong way.  </li>
            <li> I do think that getting the larger handle version is what I will do next time I am in the market for a new safety razor.</li>
            <li> After that, my shave time cut in half, and I now get a smooth shave with no cuts and minimal fuss.  </li>
            <li> Having never had a wet shave before, I youtubed a couple of helpful videos, and after a rough shave or two, I quickly learned how to work the razor.</li>
            <li> In fact, there are weeks I only shave once or twice, and this razor effortlessly mows right through a weeks stubble without slowing down.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling that if it had a long handle new users like myself just switching to a DE razor would tend to grip it in their plams and nick the heck out of their faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cost of this razor was about the same as a large package of blades for my former razor at Sams, but will last for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> The Merkur Heavy Duty is a high precision beauty of classic technology.  </li>
            <li> The first week, I had a slight amount of irritation during the day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if other men have more room between their nose and</li>
            <li> main thing when starting to use a double edge razor, or any older/traditional shaving methods, is the process and overall experience.</li>
            <li> The handle is small, and I know that bothers some people due to the &#x27;size&#x27; of their hands, but you shouldn&#x27;t be gripping this thing like a pipe wrench.  </li>
            <li> only possible negative thing I can report (which is most likely my fault) is the irritation I got when I shaved against the grain around my mouth.</li>
            <li> I still do not think it is anywhere close to reasonable and decided to investigate other alternatives.</li>
            <li> After much research i chose this over other models.</li>
            <li> This razor is extremely will built and very forgiving.  </li>
            <li> The handle&#x27;s grip is extremely useful, especially if you use shaving oil and your hands get a little slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe not a super sharp as Feathers, but I like how smooth they are.  </li>
            <li> It exposes enough blade for a great cut, but enough guard to make it hard to make any serious cuts.  </li>
            <li> This razor does not have that problem, as it comes apart into two pieces - the handle, with a non-removable threaded nut at the bottom, and the highly-polished top part which secures and angles the blade, attached to a long bolt that fits down into the handle to be screwed down.    </li>
            <li> The included Merkur blade fits so snug that it took a little maneuvering just to get the blade past the threads (which is a good thing considering the reviews I&#x27;ve seen for other safety razors).</li>
            <li> half way think that I got a bad razor, because I can&#x27;t believe that so many people are satisfied with this junk.  </li>
            <li> Be careful if you&#x27;ve never used a straight razor or a double edged one like the Merkur.  </li>
            <li> My beard grows fast enough that I have to shave every day(a habit from the military).  </li>
            <li> I have had trouble shaving my whole adult life.  </li>
            <li> The knurling is deep and grips very well when wet.  </li>
            <li> This one blade action on my skin gives me a close shave without having to deal with 3 or 4 blades pulling my facial hair causing them to curl back in causing severe razor bumps .</li>
            <li> For sensitive skin or moderate facial hair Personna, Astra would work well.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to go back to old school shaving.</li>
            <li> My face is not dry and flaking in the morning anymore.</li>
            <li> Like most of you, I&#x27;ve grown tired of constantly purchasing Gillette safety razors year after year.</li>
            <li> So I did bit more digging and found out the secret is to do a second pass.  </li>
            <li> Way better than my old, expensive 3-blade razors.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, although it feels different in the hand I honestly don&#x27;t tell any difference in shave quality between the 34c and my $10 utopia razor.</li>
            <li> I have been having fun using a different aftershave everyday</li>
            <li> Today I received my first safety razor, the Merkur HD 34C, put the Merkur blade in, cranked it down, and rushed off to shave like I was a kid on Christmas day that had just received a new remote control car.</li>
            <li> These blades come highly recommended on the Internet as an inexpensive middle-of-the-road blade (sharp but not excessively sharp) which is made in the USA.</li>
            <li> A nick or two you may experience the first couple of shaves, but once you get the simple technique down you&#x27;ll have no issues with cuts at all.</li>
            <li> I used this little gem this morning for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous at first</li>
            <li> My first was a Merkur Futur, which I felt was a little unforgiving and aggressive to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get a very high quality product that you won&#x27;t get tired of.</li>
            <li> Combine this with a little Colonel Conk shave soap, an inexpensive Parker brush, and your favorite razor,(I like the Feather and Astra blades) and you&#x27;ll never look back at those other shaving side-show throw-aways again!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, switching to wet shaving will mean your shaves will require more concentration and preparation.  </li>
            <li> The Merkur #34C (aka Heavy Duty DE Razor) has a short, BUT VERY THICK handle that is ideal if you have some pretty heavy hands that otherwise would make the #180 Long Handle impractical to use (something that I personally use because my fingers ARE long).  </li>
            <li> Many sites on safety-razor shaving rightly point out that alcohol-based aftershaves are bad for your skin (the Art of Shaving site has a lot to say about this).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy enough to let gravity apply just the right amount of pressure.  </li>
            <li> It may take a little more time, not much, but it&#x27;s time well spent.</li>
            <li> was becoming super painful until I started using this.</li>
            <li> While seemingly expensive at first, the money is quickly recouped in the price of the blades.</li>
            <li> The blades are super sharp and there is no pivot in the head to get around the sharp contours of my bony shins and ankles.  </li>
            <li> common observation shared by newbie safety razor users is that getting nicks is unavoidable, specially during the first few shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to a fusion or any other over priced modern razor.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not really long like the cartridge type razors.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s really no excuse.</li>
            <li> So my first experience with a safety razor was with a Parker 22r that was faulty, it would not secure fully, and chewed my head up.  </li>
            <li> Things to remember: the first few shaves you will cut yourself.</li>
            <li> I first I cut myself, but after a few shaves I got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> When I first held this Merkur Heavy Duty Razor, I knew that my shaving experience was about to be upgraded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a pretty heavy razor</li>
            <li> Quality, and worth spending a few extra up front on the German Merkur.</li>
            <li> , I felt like, unless you are actually using a DE razor due to their inexpensive blade costs, the supposed advantages of DE razors were hype (which is ironic, since DE fans say that safety razors are just hype to get people to buy more expensive blades), and to me they just aren&#x27;t worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> Following advice I read, I began by only shaving down for the first two weeks.</li>
            <li> I look forward to shaving with this razor, and if you take your time and make deliberate, light and steady strokes you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s not as difficult as some make</li>
            <li> As someone who has only shaved twice since I received this, classic store bought razors (Schick, Mach 3, etc) have NOTHING on the feel of a wet shave.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little concerned about the short handle</li>
            <li> Which is really dense and thick facial hair with soft and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The blades are much cheaper than the expensive fancy heads on the big brand razors and it does at least as good a job.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll save money in the not very long run.</li>
            <li> If your new to wet shaving, this is the way to start of.</li>
            <li> I am a new wet shaver.</li>
            <li> Being new to Wet shaving I went with the one that iv&#x27;e researched as a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving</li>
            <li> I am new to the world of wet shaving, but I am getting the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> It is usually on the right side where I start.  </li>
            <li> A modern shaver like a Gillette Fusion shaves just as close as a safety razor with less risk of nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> After nearly a month of it I cannot believe I waited this long to return to the traditional shaving practice.  </li>
            <li> They are so thin the blade is easily missed</li>
            <li> I warm my badger bristle brush while brushing my teeth, then wet my face with cold water, whip up a nice thick, wet lather and cover my beard.  </li>
            <li> You want it to barely touch, if you feel too much pressure, pull off, rinse and start where you left off; if you feel it&#x27;s not even, just turn the handle a little.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, Compact&lt;br /&gt;Cons: closed blade makes it hard for head shaving.</li>
            <li> After doing research, I decided on heavy double sided razor with the safety feature and a screw down top versus butterfly (read butterfly becomes loose and unsafe).  </li>
            <li> The price appears a little pricey, but you certainly get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to wet shaving with a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this for new wet shavers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades inserted is fixed and not moving like the butterfly as I do make it loose in the butterfly for making the moustache lines.</li>
            <li> There are of course cost benefits that for me show up rather quickly: cartridge razors are expensive-- a pack of 15 costs around as much as this razor itself does.</li>
            <li> I get a much better shave, less irritation, and I&#x27;m spending a lot less on blades compared to the other &#x27;systems&#x27; out there.</li>
            <li> Also if you have large hands like myself, maybe you should consider one that is a little bigger as i am</li>
            <li> So if you absolutely need a long handled razor, there are other safety razors you should look at.    </li>
            <li> I find that the Merkur blades themselves were not a good match for my skin, but that a couple of other brands I have tried worked much better than the included blades.</li>
            <li> I have black thick facial hair which tugs and pulls with most razors leaving me with burn and irritation.</li>
            <li> While it might not be as flashy or cool as the butterfly models Parker makes, it makes up for in simplicity and solid design.e is really nice on this product and makes it very stable to hold: it would be difficult to accidentally drop this razor even with wet, soapy hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re really worried about nicking yourself but want to try it, just get it, use it on the weekends and you can take your time and not worry about showing up at work with a little nick on your face.</li>
            <li> I really like this little razor.</li>
            <li> After much reading, I decided on this little beauty.</li>
            <li> Was quite apprehensive due to razor bumps, and just being totally new to the DE razor scene.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend anyone thinking about doing this to spend some serious time on some of the larger DE shaving forums because there is really a lot to learn about all of the various razors, blades, soaps, brushes, techniques, accessories, etc.  </li>
            <li> Even though hair down there is much thicker than  the beard or any other area of the body, this single blade trimmed it down quickly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a safety razor, the weight of this razor is really the only thing I think will take a little adjustment time.</li>
            <li> The shorter handle is a little strange at first</li>
            <li> BUT for the days i don&#x27;t have enough time to shave with the straight razor i use this little guy.</li>
            <li> I can see that if you have larger hands, this razor may seem a bit small, but for my average sized hands it is fine.  </li>
            <li> too bad we dont manufacture any safety razors as good here in America.</li>
            <li> I got one bad one, there are lots of good ones out there.</li>
            <li> The majority of my life has been spent shaving with those lovely cartridge razors that burn your skin and your wallet leaving you unhappy and with a dread of shaving; something that in today&#x27;s world is nearly a must in all professional</li>
            <li> I also think it is ironic that Gillette which invented the DE razor and sold tens of millions of them does not make one now, at least as far as I can determine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It definitely takes a little bit longer to shave due to only using one pass and then reapplying shaving cream again to shave again, but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> Hard to get hairs right under the nose, otherwise I would have given this razor a 5 star.  </li>
            <li> Loading the blade is easy and the razor seems to rinse well with very little loading under the blade with heavy creams.</li>
            <li> Why mess with a classic?</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve of a few shaves to get your technique down, but you&#x27;ll get it fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try the long handle, but after using other narrow handle razors I would strongly recommend a model with a wide handle.</li>
            <li> I have only nicked myself once so far after using daily for the past weeks, and that was completely my fault.  </li>
            <li> although Feather&#x27;s clearly are samurai sword sharp.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical in using a double edge razor, but this makes shaving so much easier.</li>
            <li> Razor blades are rated 1 - 5, where 1 is least sharp and 5 is most sharp.</li>
            <li> Wow, the other reviews weren&#x27;t kidding about this.</li>
            <li> Pair this with the 1904 open, which gives me a closer shave than the HD, and you have 2 similar razors that feel a bit different and will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I am heavy into swimming and used to wrestle in high school, so I shave my head (twice a week actually).</li>
            <li> These razors may be a little high to start with</li>
            <li> Especially since this is a \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; safety razor, I have a hard time recommending a product that isnt consistent.</li>
            <li> I purposely didn&#x27;t shave for a week and a half and sported the \\&quot;bum\\&quot; look while awaiting my new razor.</li>
            <li> I bought the new gillette swivel fusion last year and generally liked it except that I would still get razor burn and the cost of the blades is annoying.  </li>
            <li> used this way, the Mach 3 s blade will last a very long time, since they are only doing final touch up.      </li>
            <li> After about a year and a half with wet shaving, I finally moved up to the much praised Merkur</li>
            <li> I get a very close shave usually with one or two passes only.</li>
            <li> As someone who has big hands, I kept going back and forth between this razor and one with a long handle.  </li>
            <li> Short, slow, light strokes cause much less irritation.    </li>
            <li> It is solid and heavy (as expected from the name) and is definitely shorter than a standard modern razor.</li>
            <li> Even after a few beers I didnt cut myself as others suggested would happen your first time wet shaving.</li>
            <li> My first shave was a bit slow and only nicked myself once (on my mole) after that it got faster and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as what angle to use, simply start at a 90 degree angle and work your way down (30-45 works for me).</li>
            <li> (I normally do this with a little Miles Davis or Coltrane).</li>
            <li> When I bought this razor a few months ago I was new to double edge shaving.</li>
            <li> I currently filter the hard water before use, which is a less than stellar substitute for soft water.  </li>
            <li> It definitely seemed like a far less traumatic experience for my face than the cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My shave time is definitely longer while I adjust to this razor, but my skin is far less irritated than it was with my 5-blade razor.</li>
            <li> Believe everything you read about this razor and wet shaving in general, shaving will become something you look forward to rather than dread.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll get much faster.&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li> Should I get the short or long handle?   </li>
            <li> After reading multiple reviews on the 34C and the long handled version I chose the 34C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only regret is that I got the short-handle one instead of the long handle.</li>
            <li> No big deal, I still may get the long handle and give the shorty to a friend.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I wish is that I had switched over to DE shaving a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Blades last a long time and wife says it&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> and I would guess it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The quality of the engineering of this is built to last a lifetime and work just as long.</li>
            <li> , think back to the razor your grandfather used, and you may remember one like this, even long after those pitiful disposables and cartridge razors from Bic, Gillette, and the like were in fashion.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s short, and I wish I had opted for the long handled version.</li>
            <li> As a long time user of disposable razors, I never thought of using a safety razor until I saw the commercial for the Micro Touch</li>
            <li> I told myself for a long time that the extra money wouldn&#x27;t buy me anything.</li>
            <li> Men with larger hands will definitely want one of the long handled models, and all sizes may want to consider the long handle.  </li>
            <li> A tad bit too short for my taste, the long handle was out-of-stock when I purchased this one.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had this long enough to address the plating issues that some have had</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical that I really liked this shorter handle.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thick stubble, and this makes shaving a breeze.</li>
            <li> I did get a sample pack, but found it very difficult to remember which blades I liked or didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about trying something new on my face</li>
            <li> Problem with the Parker is that the knob used to open the butterfly kept getting loose while shaving which occasionally led to nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li> The razor itself holds the blade such that it&#x27;s not very aggressive, so that allows you to use sharper blades without getting all sliced up by them (I&#x27;m experimenting with feathers, wilkinsons, and personas right now, after having used astras for a few months and finding them not as aggressively sharp as I&#x27;d like).</li>
            <li> Very heavy for it&#x27;s looks, it gives the feel of a very well built and well engineered product.</li>
            <li> Or the fact that I purchased 50 blades (which seem to last me a little over a week i.e. the same as any major brand blade) for all of $32.50</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t cut myself with this heavy duty one yet, but since the adjustable cuts closer I can see that as being an issue for someone new to this type of shaving.</li>
            <li> It did, of course, take a few days to adjust to the new razor.  </li>
            <li> I recommend watching a few YouTube tutorials if your new to safety razor shaving .</li>
            <li> My only complaint with this system is I do have a small mole on my face that I used to just shave over with no issues with cartridges, but I struck oil the first time shaving with my new Merkur, so I have to take carearound that area.</li>
            <li> From a cost perspective, I stand to save money because the blade refills are bout $5 for 10; far less than what I was using before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never going back to the cheap (but expensive) shave of a cartridge.</li>
            <li> My beard grows in really awkward directions on my neck, so I&#x27;ve never really gotten the kind of close</li>
            <li> After shaving, I disassemble it, pat everything dry, reassemble it and dip the head in alcohol before putting it into a case I cobbled together from a travel soap case, a kitchen sponge and a couple of desiccant capsules out of pill bottles (total cost: about 2 bucks).    </li>
            <li> It also takes up far less room when you get the stand that holds it.  </li>
            <li> Product is as advertised and works really well with Personna Red and Gillette Razor blades (at least for me).</li>
            <li> So far I have not had as close a shave as promised, but it is closer than the Gillette I previously used, and I have to continue to work on my method</li>
            <li> Let me repeat that last part, TECHNIQUE, is essential in wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve spent the last 17 years of my life shaving with whatever the local supermarket had to offer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and a military officer.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fact that the handle is not smooth and will not twist in your hand when wet like another one I have.  </li>
            <li> I recently got back into wet shaving using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Having said that, I think I&#x27;ll try a 2 or maybe a 3 next time, but considering I only spent $5 for 25 blades, it might be awhile.  </li>
            <li> Coming from years of cartridge scraping, added pressure was necessary to drag the multiple blades through one&#x27;s beard.</li>
            <li> I would imagine this will last a long time as long as I keep up with the cleaning process.</li>
            <li> I started slow with short strokes with the grain and really had no problems.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of spending a lot of money on the super duper 20 blade 50 horse power blades that just irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I have what I would consider above average facial hair thickness (in terms of actually hair thickness, density, and in growth speed).</li>
            <li> After getting tired of spending a fortune on cartridge razors which give sub-par shaves I decided to get a safety razor, and this decision was based on numerous reviews that these things will give you the best shave of your life with little risk of cutting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have small hands, and the standard handle length on this razor surprised me with how short it is.  </li>
            <li> I barely nicked myself in a few different spots but since it only happened on the across and against passes, I figured I&#x27;d just have to change up my routine.</li>
            <li> A little irritation but expected since it is a new way of shaving, similar to if you have switched from cartridge to electric or vice-versa.  </li>
            <li> A completely new person to double edge shaving might not realize why they keep burning their face some strokes and hardly getting off hair with the next.    </li>
            <li> This relatively minor disadvantage is far outweighed by less irritation for me.</li>
            <li> The first time I shaved, the blade did cut over the tips of some of my previous bumps from the DSC razor, but a few hours after the shave I couldn’t tell.  </li>
            <li> The first time I shaved, the blade did cut over the tips of some of my previous bumps from the DSC razor, but a few hours after the shave I couldn’t tell.  </li>
            <li> The one complaint that I have is the handle is on the small side, but it was easy to adjust to it.</li>
            <li> With the cheap double edge blades, I don&#x27;t feel bad switching to new blades after 2 or 3 shaves with each edge of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have tried a couple other brands, they are just built to last and the shave is second to none.</li>
            <li> I remember men in my past using one of these classic safety razors.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much more I can write about a Classic.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it takes me a a few minutes long to shave but its a closer shave and worth the extra few minutes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s naturally balances between the thumb and index finger and the butt rests comfortably on my little finger.</li>
            <li> It seems a little confusing at first, and the prices seem a little high, especially if you decide you don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> was a little tender after the first few shaves.</li>
            <li> [of course, as long as you only go with the grain and do it slow and steady].</li>
            <li> I was worried that shaving with a single blade would be difficult, but it turned out to be just as easy as my Fusion.</li>
            <li> Lather up with a badger brush and some nice cream and shave with this bad boy for 2-3 passes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the futur for a few years and although that is a great razor, I found it bulky and couldn&#x27;t keep from cutting myself a few times every week.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I was able to use this without cutting myself.</li>
            <li> More than 1 day between shaves resulted in snagging and cutting.  </li>
            <li> Instead of buying chemicals in a can and expensive cartridge blades, I have this investment, cheap blades, and spend my money on pre-shave oil and aftershaves.  </li>
            <li> The length of the handle, compared to several different disposables I have, is 1.5\\&quot; shorter on average.</li>
            <li> I definitely like the razor and am surprised at how small it is.  </li>
            <li> How long does it take?  </li>
            <li> Purchased this as part of my switch to the traditional wet shave.  </li>
            <li> the MicroTouch  wasn&#x27;t a long term keeper.  </li>
            <li> For those accustomed to a long handle, you may want to consider the Merkur long handle razor.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with disposable razor heads for over twenty years and they are closer in length to the long handle version.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because I have suffered a long time with ingrown hairs and irritation after shaving.  </li>
            <li> but it won&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> I will probably end up buying another long handled one for home use and keep this one for traveling.</li>
            <li> Wish I bought a long time ago to save money on razor blades.</li>
            <li> I would buy the long handled one if I bought again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In trouble areas like under the nose or the sensitive sides of the chin the angles just seem to lock in.  </li>
            <li> Enter the traditional wet shave.</li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor]].</li>
            <li> As long as you let the weight of the razor do the shaving, then you should have any issues.</li>
            <li> Considering blades are something like 10 cents, I don&#x27;t think it will take that long to realize the savings of ditching cartridges.</li>
            <li> However, I have the long handle &amp;#34;barber pole&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I use this as a backup to my Merkur 180 long handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried top-end electric razors and the multiple bladed wet razors.</li>
            <li> Never a burn, very rarely a minor cut.  </li>
            <li> , I find that this one is plenty long.  </li>
            <li> Any who the razor itself feels very heavy to the hand and feels of high quality.</li>
            <li> and I still get long spots all over my face and NONE of the shave</li>
            <li> and he says he will be using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Plus or minus 10X on the second year for the engineers now checking my math.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason this model has been around for so long.</li>
            <li> Before I joined the military I would only shave maybe once or twice a month.</li>
            <li> four shaves per blade.&lt;br /&gt;Takes twice as long to shave</li>
            <li> A long handle would have gotten in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;For around 50 bucks you should be set for over a year of shaving, as one side of each blade can easily last 3-4 shaves, meaning 6-8 shaves per blade, meaning roughly 52 blades per year.</li>
            <li> This means a 2 year cost of shaving is a total of roughly 60 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spent some time looking at differant ones and reading reviews and forum posts, and they all said the same thing...</li>
            <li> I just started wet shaving last month.  </li>
            <li> German quality as expected.</li>
            <li> Once you do (and it doesn&#x27;t take long)</li>
            <li> Also the thread for the head goes almost the length of the handle, as opposed to 1/2in long chrome plated plastic.</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought the long handle</li>
            <li> If you have long piano player fingers, you may want a longer handle.  </li>
            <li> I used to shave everyday with my old razor and gunk in a can.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with cartridges as long as I can remember, until now.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that it took this long to purchase this.</li>
            <li> If wet shaving is your thing you should definitely try this one.</li>
            <li> I debated over whether or not to get the long handle version.</li>
            <li> This DE razor&#x27;s handle is about 3 inches long.</li>
            <li> I managed to break my long handled version of this.</li>
            <li> I prefer this over the long handle.  </li>
            <li> I should have changed to the Merker DE razor a long time ago; you should too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to switch to this.  </li>
            <li> The grip on the handle helps prevent any possible slipping in your hand.  </li>
            <li> 100 Astra or Derby blades cost around $11 and can also give around 3 shaves but not near as close.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have gotten the long handle model</li>
            <li> I did one minor deviation from the suggestions.  </li>
            <li> month in I now have the following:&lt;br /&gt;Mercur 34c&lt;br /&gt;Kinbar, long handle</li>
            <li> I was always having trouble with irritation and razor burn near my adams apple where the grain of hair changes.</li>
            <li> Although I like the feel of using this razor, I&#x27;d have preferred the long handle version.</li>
            <li> I can see sticking with this razor for a long time</li>
            <li> used to the shorty handle after using long handled Mach and Fusions</li>
            <li> I already have a Merkur 23c 180 long handle but didn&#x27;t like the weight of it.</li>
            <li> you should probably get the long handle version.  </li>
            <li> I am adjusting, but I might recommend buying the long handle model if you have not used one before</li>
            <li> I opted for this model as opposed to the long handle model.</li>
            <li> I should have switched to a DE razor long ago.</li>
            <li> The 34 C is a standard beginner&#x27;s razor for getting your feet wet in double-edge razor shaving.  </li>
            <li> I was so impatient I didn&#x27;t even want to wait to lather up the soap, I just put a hot towel on my face for a few seconds and then off and shaving</li>
            <li> The included blade was pretty poor, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> While it might not be as flashy or cool as the butterfly models Parker makes, it makes up for in simplicity and solid design.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;heavy duty&#x27; was supposed to be pretty heavy, and though it is substantial</li>
            <li> Heavy enough for newbies to really get the wet shaving thing down Out of the gate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Next year that total goes down to $0.57.  </li>
            <li> The only down side for me is i have big hands and</li>
            <li> After reading and pondering on safety razors and blades for a few weeks I decided to plop down the money and buy myself the whole kit.</li>
            <li> So... either my DE89 sucks and EJ should send me a new one or people haven&#x27;t actually used a 34c.</li>
            <li> I was only worried because I bought into the safety of cartridges too much, and had too vivid an imagination of cutting myself to shreds and bleeding everywhere with an seemingly open blade.</li>
            <li> It might seem a little awkward because the handle is so short, but it&#x27;s very easy to control.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how often to change the blades, but I remembered reading somewhere that if the blade feels like it is skipping over your skin or getting caught on hairs, it is probably time to put a new blade in.</li>
            <li> Even when shaving my moustache I got very little irritation, which usually is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> The only only real down side to this item is the handle is a bit short for me</li>
            <li> Only giving this one star for visibility, because I want others like me to know what they&#x27;re buying when they get a safety razor, especially those with thick coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li> And that single blade lasted a LONG time.</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving with very little investment and was using an old Gillette adjustable double edge razor.  </li>
            <li> Ok for starters I was really shocked how small it really is.  </li>
            <li> This razor has given me a closer shave than anything I imagined from your standard Gillette or other &amp;#34;commercial&amp;#34; razors.</li>
            <li> A quality shave that will save money in the long run!</li>
            <li> I am going to be trying next the Stirling Sharp</li>
            <li> I will use this thing for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> The razor itself is a little more expensive up front, plus you&#x27;ll need a bush, and you&#x27;ll want a stand.  </li>
            <li> but it was a big dissapointment due</li>
            <li> This is the standard by which I will; and have judged all other razors.</li>
            <li> I shave my head every day and I have been spending hundreds of dollars on other commercial razors.</li>
            <li> I used to shave with cartridge razors every other day or every third day depending on how I felt.</li>
            <li> Leaving the other 50 for the following year.  </li>
            <li> Before I used to shave every other day with the regular double-blade razor because of irritation and would change the blade every week.  </li>
            <li> That could be due to my technique, but after getting this one, I never went back to the longer handle.</li>
            <li> The short handle makes shaving a breeze and this razor is extremely sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> The handle is a little short for me, but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> My only other DE razor is an Ikon 102 slant.</li>
            <li> I started off with a low-end twist to open safety razor I bought at a foreign food store while in Seoul&#x27;s Itaewon district.  </li>
            <li> He had been using various disposables or other razor/blade combos for years....</li>
            <li> I started to do a little research online and to my amazement discovered DE shaving is making a big come back.  </li>
            <li> I bought Astra replacement blades because the Merkur blades that were included weren&#x27;t quite sharp enough for my heavy-ish beard.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t cut myself yet the main risk seems to be if you try to reuse your blades until they&#x27;re dull or lose their coating.     </li>
            <li> 1)it is very heavy 2)It is pretty short and small</li>
            <li> This was&#x27;t a very expensive product, aside from the packaging, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t seem very cheap as well.  </li>
            <li> A slight learning curve and a little practice will free you from the outrageous expense of disposables, and with better results!</li>
            <li> No more cuts or nicks on the first shave waiting for the new blade to be broken in.</li>
            <li> I started out very timid since I really wanted to avoid cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin on and around my nose, combined with dry, easy-to-cut skin on my throat and chin.</li>
            <li> I always take the blade out after shave, and place both the blade and the razor handle on a folded paper towel, That way, you can keep your razor handle and blades dry, preventing razor from getting rusty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just rinse it well when your done with and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to suffering through mild but painful razor burn from the middle to end of the week when using old cartridge standbys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> dry / polish everything with a dry towel and re-assemble</li>
            <li> Prior to the razors arrival I went on you tube to check out a few videos on how to use it properly.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Merkur heavy duty double edge razor (34C).  </li>
            <li> The appearance is in stark contrast to similarly priced razors such as the Jagger 89.</li>
            <li> I was tired of cartridge razors that were too expensive and still didn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li> For the genre, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Merkur - solid construction, exact-fitting parts that keep a tight fit throughout its life.  </li>
            <li> I bought 3 razors, the Murkur 34C HD, the Murkur Futur and the Edwin Jagger DE89L because they are so highly rated for beginners and the least aggressive.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a shave with a single edge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with this razor for a month now and haven&#x27;t had a single nick yet.</li>
            <li> Merkur razors come with a single, double-edged Merkur blade.  </li>
            <li> A single stroke was all it took</li>
            <li> I have gone from shaving a couple times a week to shaving every single morning now.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about a single blade razor but to my surprise</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting used to a single bladed razor again.</li>
            <li> Anyone who uses this razor will probably never go back to conventional razors.</li>
            <li> Clearly it&#x27;s not a razor for a quick careless shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;DE razors are cheaper in the long run, that&#x27;s a fact given the relative blade costs (less than a dollar for a DE blade compared to $2-$3</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that it is sometimes hard to find double edge blades locally, but the internet mitigates that to almost nil.</li>
            <li> I expected this razor to be like my original Gillette that I have  had  for 52 years, It wasn&#x27;t, you have to unscrew the handle to replace the blade, the angle of the blade is wrong, so</li>
            <li> My brother bought a similar razor from a local store and returned it in a week because of the same complaint.</li>
            <li> Smaller handle than the average razor blade but easier to maneuver after a couple swipes.</li>
            <li> I have above average size hands and can work well with the razor.</li>
            <li> Learning the correct amount of pressure (almost none) is key, DE blades are so sharp minimal pressure is needed.  </li>
            <li> I just for some reason have a difficult time giving it the full 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> With decent technique, even a novice to DE wet shaving, it is hard to cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bigger than I expected and does not fit in standard brush stands.</li>
            <li> Some buyers have complained about either its weight or its short length, but I believe this buyers failed to appropriately check the item out before purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Shaving the next time was like cutting through butter and left me with a baby smooth face, though there is a little bit of stubble around the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaving the next time was like cutting through butter and left me with a baby smooth face, though there is a little bit of stubble around the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always had a hard time buying new blades for the Fusion.</li>
            <li> Toss the 5 blade junk thats over priced &amp; shoved down the throats of American males by marketing pros.</li>
            <li> Get a styptic pencil (which stings like a son of a gun but stops the bleeding on contact) and build in some extra time in your routine until you get this down.</li>
            <li> Short handle helps a lot moving up and down the neck.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I need a longer handled version, but that will come down to personal preference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now that I have been using the Double Edge razor, I find that a little patients in the beginning goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark skin black male and guys in my shoes notoriously get razor bumps from a lot of different shavers .</li>
            <li> I finally got fed up with the poor shave that I received from the electric razor (despite the high price tag) and the discomfort of the cartridge.  </li>
            <li> so that I could OPEN up the blade angle slightly without the  loosened knob then moving to a completely loose position.  </li>
            <li> The dimensions of this razor are altogether different from your typical Mach X:  </li>
            <li> with the Feather blades (which are insanely sharp - so sharp that I actually don&#x27;t like them because you don&#x27;t get any feedback - they just slice through the hair and you don&#x27;t even feel it)</li>
            <li> I use this Merkur #34C with Feather blades; previously I had only used Gillette cartridge</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with this razor for the past few weeks now and have not given myself so much as a nick.  </li>
            <li> I started with a double edged safety razor and have tried various shaving methods for the past 30 years.</li>
            <li> biggest advantage I received by switching to this razor from a Gillette MACH3 is that I experience significantly less skin irritation, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li> Even after my stubble grows longer, she says that it feels different and less prickly.  </li>
            <li> I have a relatively simple shave kit; razor, spare featherweight blades, and your typical gel shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Will pay for itsef in less than three months low cost of blades.  </li>
            <li> Incredibly sharp: perhaps too sharp for the recently converted.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much money I&#x27;ve wasted on the safety razors over the years - no more.  </li>
            <li> and I mentioned above about some slight irritation</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m not getting the blades as sharp as I need to, and it is a long learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Came in envelope the box was crushed and the razor was loose in the envelope.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> I bought this bad boy several years ago, it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Dry off, leave your face wet, if it dries shake out your brush and wet your face.</li>
            <li> Far less waste.</li>
            <li> I did a little research and found out this is the one, especially for beginners.</li>
            <li> So I have to get another razor out to get that last little bit of whiskers under the nostrils.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it takes a little longer to shave and change blades versus mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It costs a little bit to get started, but after the initial investment, you&#x27;ll get plenty of return with the cost of razors.</li>
            <li> I bought this Merkur razor based on my research and now I can buy 100 double edge blades for as little as $10.</li>
            <li> Some folks may find the length a little off putting, but after shaving with this for a year I would never go back to a disposable razor again.</li>
            <li> I will occasionally put put a little oil on the threads over the weekend</li>
            <li> Handle is a little short for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently moved to shaving with a safety razor and bought this little beauty.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about going back to a DE razor after 40+ years of throwaways.  </li>
            <li> The handle is a little smaller than I anticipated, but no complaints.</li>
            <li> Only down-side is that I wish the handle were a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> If you have never used a double edge, it takes a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> and I was just starting to notice a little dullness.  </li>
            <li> I shave every day and there is hardly any irritation whether I use Cremo Cream or Taylor of Old Bond Street.  </li>
            <li> These shave way better &amp; my dermatologist advised that multiblades are actually bad for your skin.</li>
            <li> Also, use shaving oil - much better than shaving cream (which is bad for the skin).</li>
            <li> The shave is so smooth it did not think I was actually cutting the hair/stubble from my face.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m having trouble without that impediment, I&#x27;m just going to chalk this up to a bad purchase and go back to the more forgiving cartridge shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an infinitely better way to shave that begs to question why we ever got duped into paying for 5 blade cartridges that offer an inferior and painful shave.</li>
            <li> Going with the grain was basically pointless, which made me wonder if it has to do with the blade (the Merkur blade) than with safety razors in general.</li>
            <li> YES.........it&#x27;s going to happen regardless of how careful you are.......</li>
            <li> After shaving with this shorter one I would have to agree that some areas on the face would be harder to shave with a longer handle.</li>
            <li> Spent $80.00 on a quality shave brush and another $50.00 on Proraso products.</li>
            <li> This razor is heavy enough to do the work for you.  </li>
            <li> and I dare to try the Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor #34C after watching a video on youtube about \\&quot;the art of shaving\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I switched from a Gillette Fusion because I got tired of buying the refill cartridges and how much they costed.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago I heard a commercial ref these DE razors and was intrigued.</li>
            <li> I have switched to the wet shave (shave soap, oil, and badger hair brush)</li>
            <li> With my Astra blades there was no need to center the blade</li>
            <li> Ever since switching a few years ago, I cringe at the thought of going back.  </li>
            <li> Killer price for a razor that should be in any wet shavers arsenal.</li>
            <li> The handle is shorter than i expected.  </li>
            <li> Get a variety pack and try out a few different blades.</li>
            <li> I, personally, did not enjoy the Merkur blade included, and I have not yet tried the Feather blades that came with it.  </li>
            <li> I have a rough beard.</li>
            <li> Wet shavers continually cite the expression of &amp;#34;YMMV,&amp;#34; your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with the Merkur blade that comes with the razor.</li>
            <li> Not much pressure is needed to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> I am in the military</li>
            <li> Not some flimsy lite plastic or lite mental.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to the manly art of wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> After a few days of using this razor, I wish I had never left.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not much of an issue</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for about two years now.  </li>
            <li> Ive been shaving with this razor for roughly 3 months now</li>
            <li> which never really gave me a close shave.  </li>
            <li> It is as expected in the mid-range--on one side that is.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Merkur heavy duty double edge 34C for my husband.</li>
            <li> I wanted to enter the manly world of wet shaving.</li>
            <li> The knurled handle keeps me in control, even with wet hands.</li>
            <li> To think I almost spent $80 on one at The Art of Shaving store.</li>
            <li> Does what I expected.</li>
            <li> I settled upon the Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor as it consistantly had some of the highest reviews.</li>
            <li> So ya, spent almost 20 years suffering through shaving untill</li>
            <li> The handle is heavy enough that you don&#x27;t have to work the blade at all.</li>
            <li> Money well spent and money</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving with a longer handle and found it to be somewhat cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> I constantly have a few nicks along my shin bone and trying to navigate this around my ankle bones was a nightmare.  </li>
            <li> shaving is spent trying to get the hair free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did take me a few minutes to get used to the smaller handle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the military and have to shave every weekday.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow-- for anyone thinking about wet shaving.....</li>
            <li> but I have to be incredibly careful with it.</li>
            <li> When I do is when I am in a rush, which is expected with any razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Curious how it will be with a feather.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on a TON of reviews on lots of different websites and forums, and a few youtube videos.  </li>
            <li> My only problem was that it was too harsh for my beard/skin.  </li>
            <li> and I carefully checked the packaging.</li>
            <li> I was shaving with a Quatro and was having so much irritation with it that I was tired of them.  </li>
            <li> so I gave wet shaving a try.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> I was DE curious but scared, turns out my fears were over nothing.</li>
            <li> No real exertion on the users part is required.  </li>
            <li> I was referred to this razor by a friend who had been into DE wet shaving for a while</li>
            <li> After researching on-line the 34C was recommended for a beginner to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> The handle was shorter than I expected, but that&#x27;s not a problem.  </li>
            <li> You have to push harder to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Very solid heavy design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning to wet shaving after years with an electric.  </li>
            <li> After observing the razor I found 1 rough spot on the underside of the bar.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone that is looking to get into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor everyday for several months and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I think in only a few years the plating will start to peel.</li>
            <li> but this razor is decidedly safer (harder to cut yourself with) than the Jagger.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to return to a wet shave.  </li>
            <li> Also bought a blade sampler pack, various other small packs of blades, a brush, soap, alum bar, razor/brush stand, brush bowl and countless other accessories, etc.  </li>
            <li> , I know I&#x27;m a bit partial towards the Edwin Jagger</li>
            <li> As I had used disposable razors (as opposed to an electric) there was not much adjustment.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shave time increased for me but only by a few minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just spent a few extra bucks and got 100 Feather blades for $25.95 to cut per-blade-costs and what a combo!</li>
            <li> The thick head, however, prevents me from getting at the hairs that grow directly underneath my nose.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of how you have to open it.</li>
            <li> I also have thick hair which is why i was surprised as how close the save was.</li>
            <li> I started with the 3pc Shaveology razor (gift from my Father in Law), and while it worked, I wanted something with more &amp;#34;heft&amp;#34;, a shaft with textured grip, and I didn&#x27;t like that the comb was entirely separate from the base.  </li>
            <li> The price of razor blades for those lightweight pieces of crap is astounding these days.</li>
            <li> For the cost of this razor + or - $40 and I buy packs of 10 dbl edge safety razors for it for about a 1$. The blades are double edged and extremely sharp, so sharp that you don&#x27;t press down while shaving.</li>
            <li> shower first or apply a hot, wet towel to face for a few minutes, lather up, shave, rinse with hot water, rinse with cold water, use the alum block, splash again with cold water, dry off, and use a cotton pad to pat on / apply the witch hazel after shave.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than the same exact thing from The Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li> If you shave quickly and carelessly, you do have a slightly higher likehood of nicking your nose, but again, that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re careless.  </li>
            <li> I found out that my whiskers actually reverse direction half way down the shaving area of my neck.</li>
            <li> Be careful because the double edge blade that goes in it is sharp as hell!!!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t realize that it came in a long handled version; I think for use on the body, the longer handle might be a bit easier to use -</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended if your tired of the extremely high cost of those plastic refill types.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with this one especially if you are new to DE RAZOR shaving like me.</li>
            <li> Relatively new to the wet shaving game</li>
            <li> I got used to it after a few shaves, but would still prefer a longer handle as shaving the back of my head becomes a bit difficult in certain spots.</li>
            <li> Never owned or used one of these types of razors before [heck, never even heard of one until lately], and I thought it would be a little short to work with by the looks of it on Amazon, but once it comes in, just play around with it without the blade and get a feel for it, position your fingers in various ways.</li>
            <li> The two-piece design is solid and changing blades requires very little effort.</li>
            <li> I previously used an electric, so I didn&#x27;t have too many bad habits to unlearn like with cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> If you are going to purchase this and stop giving in to the Gilette rip-off I highly recommend investing in a styptic pencil to take care of the inevitable nicks and small cuts (esp.</li>
            <li> just cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, use feather razors, but they&#x27;re super sharp, so be careful.</li>
            <li> Another tip: Using a stroke of NO MORE THAN AN INCH AT A TIME, rinse the blade after each stroke, and alternate blades each time.</li>
            <li> I use Feather blades, insanely sharp, in mine and keep it in an almond oil bath between shavings.  </li>
            <li> I cant wait to try the other blades and the badger brush.  </li>
            <li> and I also use Stirling Sharp Dressed Man scent -</li>
            <li> IT IS SHARP.  </li>
            <li> The dimensions and weight of it complement proper double-edge razor shaving technique as, unlike a Mach X which you rather drag across your face, the weight of the razor provides the oomph behind the actual blade, rather than the force of your stroke.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in there, but not on either extreme side.  </li>
            <li> was the nickle was wearing  off due to age.</li>
            <li> I would load my brush and never thought of hitting the soap again in later passes resulting in weak watery lather in the touch up 3rd pass.</li>
            <li> I experimented with other cartridge brands to no avail.</li>
            <li> No nicks or cuts, just take your time and apply less pound-force (Telling people to apply less &#x27;pressure&#x27; is a misnomer: the pressure is the same, but we are working with less blade area, so it is the force that matters as Pressure&#x3D;Force/Area)</li>
            <li> After buying this razor, a beaver brush, and shave soap, I can&#x27;t believe we&#x27;ve become so lazy as a society to ever switch to something different.</li>
            <li> so use the other side of the blade as well.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It took me 5 minutes to shave electric.&lt;br /&gt;Frustrating due to missed hairs.</li>
            <li> use a sharp blade.&lt;br /&gt;Better blades keep blade from tugging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also use a sharp blade.  </li>
            <li> Extremely inexpensive, unless you are destitute</li>
            <li> He said he loves the weight and quality of it and went from shaving once a week to every other day.</li>
            <li> I still consider the 34C my go-to razor, and it is the basis from which I compare other</li>
            <li> I use one side to go with the grain, the other to go against the grain.  </li>
            <li> but i will not use any other razor</li>
            <li> Google searches will provide plenty of sites for teaching how to use this and other safety razors.</li>
            <li> Shave was never on par with the other two.</li>
            <li> I shave my face and head ever other day and was going through razor blades like water.</li>
            <li> I dropped it the other day in shower and it damaged the metal around the area which touches my face.  </li>
            <li> (compare the price to other Merkur Razors).</li>
            <li> So, this review is not comparing this DE razor to other DE razors, but rather comparing the experience</li>
            <li> Went back to what dad used as razors are so unbelievably overpriced.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is wunderbar.</li>
            <li> Other then profit</li>
            <li> I have shaved with other razors which seem easier to nick yourself with.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no more pulling through the resulting 3 day shadow when it&#x27;s time to go back to work.</li>
            <li> It still tugs and rips at the hairs, inviting razor burn and ingrown hairs, just like every other cartridge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After over a month of use, I see no rust or any other points to complain about.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is extremely cost-effective compared to Gilette.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this model specifically based on recommendations made by a company through which I purchase other shaving products.  </li>
            <li> due to unforeseen circumstances, I ended up using it to scrape burnt plastic off an electric range.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The stock razor that Merkur includes is pretty lousy though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still healing from the damage I didn&#x27;t know the other razors had been doing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid razor, the handle IS small but it isn&#x27;t a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> and it is still sharp.  </li>
            <li> All my other razors are in a box and out of sight.</li>
            <li> This also generated some interest in looking at other shaving options and after looking at all of the reviews about this razor I decided to give it a try and also buy feather blades based on reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will try this with other blades before it goes in the drawer.</li>
            <li> Like any other tool, you can judge the quality by holding it in your hand.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m 6&#x27; 2&amp;#34;, over 250 pounds, and I definitely don&#x27;t have small hands ...</li>
            <li> other guys are talking about.</li>
            <li> But other than that, I like it and don&#x27;t miss shaving with the name-brand disposable cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> I purchased it after reading reviews on Amazon &amp; other sites.</li>
            <li> Please note that I have not tried any other safety blades...</li>
            <li> I got a extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The other DE razors have design grips that slip and just feel bulky.</li>
            <li> Compared to my other two razors this did not give a close shave.  </li>
            <li> The corners are sharp and pointed.</li>
            <li> I have seen other DEs with longer handles online, and while I have never held a DE with a longer handle, I feel like I would benefit from one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this razor I can shave every other day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely close.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have any other razors to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> This was my first foray into the use of a double-edge razor and I have found it is not as scary and death</li>
            <li> I have not used any other DE razor</li>
            <li> but I have no reason to try any other after using this.</li>
            <li> You shave with this razor as if it were sharp...</li>
            <li> Gillette and other foolishness never again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I shave I wipe everything down including the blade with a wet towel and</li>
            <li> After becoming increasingly frustrated with the cost of the name-brand \\&quot;Super Ultra 16-Blade\\&quot; razor cartridges, the speed with which said razors seem to dull, and the questionable shave quality that even those new razors provide, I decided to do some serious research into finding a \\&quot;proper\\&quot; shaving tool.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to a single blade after using Gillette&#x27;s perverse multi-bladed abominations, bur</li>
            <li> I warn people just to be VERY careful while changing the blade.</li>
            <li> After shaving for years with a conventional \\&quot;multi-blade\\&quot; razor, I was becoming increasingly frustrated.</li>
            <li> My facial hair grows slow (very slow) and my skin is dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Bad Summary: If you drop it, it can be damaged easily.  </li>
            <li> Holy cow..</li>
            <li> Tired of the monopoly of the current razor industry so decided to go back in history.  </li>
            <li> I found that with this razor and blade, I can be a lot less careful than I thought I needed to be, and I have not had to dramatically change my shaving method from when I used a Gillette Fusion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless of people saying they got horrible nicks and cuts, I began shaving first try no cuts(small whiskers on beard), and really got the hang of it the second time in the \\&quot;bikini area\\&quot; without loosing a golf ball.</li>
            <li> the short hndle makes it slightly awkward to get used to at first, but after a few shaves it feel</li>
            <li> After reading reviews on several other razors, it was hard to pass this one up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointing as I really enjoyed the razor while it was still functional.  </li>
            <li> unless you are a little person with little hands, buy the long handle one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind you will want to at least upgrade your shave cream to a proper cream if you are using Barbersol or other aerosol</li>
            <li> I have a really tough beard and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This Merkur is not as sharp as the typical Schick razors sold in department stores.</li>
            <li> Now, I shave every other day (sometimes less) and people don&#x27;t even notice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m subject to severe ingrown hairs due to my wire-like curly beard.</li>
            <li> It is a bit odd due to handle length</li>
            <li> i have been using the usual mach 3 type razors but wanted something a little different this time.</li>
            <li> I also found it hard to believe that it would actually make shaving a pleasure.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to go back to disposables.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it leaves my face feeling a little tight and dry until I apply my home made aftershave lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to get into the cost savings of using a double edge versus conventional disposable razors, as others have already done that and your common sense should tell you that as well.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind though that you do not need to press down on the razor as you do with conventional razors.  </li>
            <li> I can grow a full beard with sideburns, and the weight of the blade alone can shave off hairs with no tugging or any unpleasant feelings.</li>
            <li> Merkur is not  worth  </li>
            <li> The second time using this, I went with two with the grain passes (even on the second it was still cutting some whiskers), and then one across the grain on only my face.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it was supposed to come with a blade already included.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the lack of dimension info on the page.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m expecting 50 to last me at least 6 months, if not a year.  </li>
            <li> This razor is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I shave my head twice a week and find that a bit scary with my straight razor but didn&#x27;t have any worry or knicks with the Merkur.</li>
            <li> I use it 3-4 times a week and can get a closer shave with this than I ever got with an expensive modern razor.</li>
            <li> I sure hate it.    </li>
            <li> I have to shave everyday, because I&#x27;m Reserve Military and LEO.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend Feather platinum blades for a non irritating shave for guys with sensitive and/or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I personally love the astra&#x27;s and hate the feathers, derby&#x27;s and merkur blades.</li>
            <li> razor is a two piece that unscrews at the base of the handle, which to me makes it way better than the three piece handles.</li>
            <li> I personally rank the Merkur 34C and the 180(23C) as my favorite razors.</li>
            <li> I used this razor for 2 weeks shaving in every angle/direction until one day I shaved half of my face with this Merkur and the other half with a Schick Xtreme 3 razor.</li>
            <li> Even as I&#x27;m learning to use it properly, I find that razor burn and ingrown hairs have become less common.</li>
            <li> I can shave up and down, accross, and even against the grain without razor burn.</li>
            <li> I shave it down with the grain, but the lower part of my neck - I have to shave it up with the grain.</li>
            <li> and you shave down your neck all the way down -</li>
            <li> Instead of bearing down like you would with a cartridge, rinse this thing out.</li>
            <li> Whatever you do don&#x27;t push down on the blade.</li>
            <li> My cartridge cost has gone down from $4.00 a month to $1.50 a month</li>
            <li> and I notice the quality has gone down in the product.</li>
            <li> I will have to file it down or purchase another one.</li>
            <li> Do Not Press down on the razor.</li>
            <li> I just lather up my face, hold the razor against my face and control it as it slides down, allowing the weight of the razor do the work.  </li>
            <li> If you were expecting an heirloom object that you can pass down to your son as I was, this is not it.    </li>
            <li> I had it down.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s no need to push down like with others.  </li>
            <li> So breaking down my shaves by week including blades, razor and soap, I&#x27;m paying about $1.42 per week to shave.  </li>
            <li> It took me 2 strokes to get the technique down</li>
            <li> I also purchased the 100 personna DE pack bring the cost per blade down to about .12 cents.  </li>
            <li> me down my grandfather still had.</li>
            <li> Been using a butterfly gellette that was handed down.</li>
            <li> But, if you don&#x27;t want to pay $$$ for a few measly cartridges, or if your face and beard don&#x27;t jive well with their design, then the safety razor is worth a look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (common due to water and dripping shaving cream after a pass, etc), and the weight helps me minimize the pressure I&#x27;m tempted to apply (you should apply as little pressure as possible, idealy NONE) and thus get a less irritated face.</li>
            <li> The Persona blades are sharp so watch out!</li>
            <li> But be forewarned: if no one has ever told you before, RAZOR BLADES ARE SHARP!  </li>
            <li> LIKE WAY TOO SHARP FOR BABIES AND KITTENS AND STUFF!</li>
            <li> The razor does take a little getting used to and the blades are sharp</li>
            <li> Not even worried about cutting myself with this razor, still trying to find the right blade.</li>
            <li> But i was sick of paying nearly $20 for a four pack of blades or new razors.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, and I can&#x27;t believe I was on those mega chain store, three bladed, expensive disposable pieces of pure s**t for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got a job where I needed to shave everyday or every other day for work</li>
            <li> The Merkur&#x27;s double-edged razors are extremely sharp and the 34C clamps them firmly in place.</li>
            <li> A sharp blade and a heavy razor do all the work for you.</li>
            <li> This is a very small (short handled) razor.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to rain on everyone parade, but I tried to like this and after 4 or 5 months of use, I have switched back to my old razor.  </li>
            <li> Very Sharp when used with FEATHER brand blades in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I used it once and then swapped it for a personna coated blade(American made) very sharp but not like a feather.</li>
            <li> Quality is less than par of the jagger.  </li>
            <li> the less likely you are sustain serious injury.</li>
            <li> A safety razor will do that, and with much less expense in blades.       </li>
            <li> You can purchase this for less than the price of the newest cartridge gadget and five cartridge blades.</li>
            <li> After receiving the razor (and ignoring mantic&#x27;s video advice), I grabbed the razor in my fist and promptly removed half of my jaw.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;After less than 18 months of use, the cap that pulls the razor blade against the body broke off form its stem.</li>
            <li> It takes slightly longer to shave.  </li>
            <li> Ingrown hairs are fading away also (remnants of my previous shaving method - an electric</li>
            <li> About half that of the Gillette Fusion or Mach3.</li>
            <li> safety razor blades cost much less than any cartridge razors-</li>
            <li> Be patient and in no time you will have as close as a shave as a Mach 3 for less money.  </li>
            <li> It may look intimidating but you most likely will not get cut, at the very worst, you&#x27;ll get razor burn.</li>
            <li> While the actual price is about the same as the price of a moderately expensive drink @</li>
            <li> Less than 1 day between shaves resulted in razor rash that would not go away for about 3 days.  </li>
            <li> NOT MILD BUT NOT AGGRESSIVE,</li>
            <li> My skin feels healthier and I get less pimples.</li>
            <li> I have even less nicks and irritation than with my previous vintage razor.</li>
            <li> I have had this one less than 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Less irritation, smoother shave, and cheaper blades.</li>
            <li> so I could get slightly closer shave</li>
            <li> When I purchased it it was almost $20 less.</li>
            <li> If you are starting out with DE blades I&#x27;d recommend starting off with a less expensive razor with a longer handle to see what you like.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit shorter than my previous safety razor.  </li>
            <li> but I still prefer a slightly longer handle in my hands.</li>
            <li> There is nothing out there for less than 43$ that will give you quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wetshaving for a year and a half now.</li>
            <li> Less so with the DSC blades</li>
            <li> For $44.00, it&#x27;ll pay for itself in less than 3 Fusion 4-pack cartridge refills.</li>
            <li> and it was $10 less.</li>
            <li> My Fusion always gets clogged with my hair and half the time</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s like less than a dollar per.  </li>
            <li> The Merkur with Personna blades gives me drastically less irritation.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Micro touch for several weeks and prior to that it was expensive multiblade razors, preceded by electric.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a closer shave with less irritation.</li>
            <li> Typically the Mach 5 or Fusions.</li>
            <li> I converted to using a safety razor and I will Never go back to expensive double, triple, quad or whatever again!!</li>
            <li> Just my two sense, but one must be drunk or highly uncoordinated to cut yourself with one of these.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Merkur Heavy Duty #34C Razor after having used a single blade injector razor for the past 30 years.</li>
            <li> Something you will not need do with a DE/safety razor; in fact, too much pressure will cause nicks, razor burn and other issues which will make your face unhappy.</li>
            <li> My first was a Parker that kept cutting my neck and chin.  </li>
            <li> REALLY sharp blades that will slice you up if you dont shave slowly and carefully.  </li>
            <li> Feathers tug a little bit less, maybe.  </li>
            <li> It works just like my Merkur 38C, but with a little less heft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was driven by the need to spend less on blades, and contribute less into the waste stream, but I didn</li>
            <li> Afterwards,take a shower and pat dry, apply a thin layer of neosporin/triple antibiotic and let it adsorb meanwhile you dry everything else.</li>
            <li> I decided to go back to the old double edge razor and help reduce the outrageous prices being charger for the multiple blade injector blades.</li>
            <li> do use this razor for my neck and head (no face, the beard will always be there), and while it takes a little getting used to in just a few weeks I&#x27;ve got the pattern down and can shave my neck in seconds and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little heavy and shaves itself, you have to just guide and correct angles as it glides down on the face.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to WS, you won&#x27;t go wrong with the 34C, just remember to keep the pressure off and let the weight of the razor do the work.</li>
            <li> As long as you are not applying extra force, it is unlikely that you will cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it now for a few months, and don&#x27;t think it is any less close of a shave.  </li>
            <li> I have been learning how to use this without cutting myself, and I&#x27;ve really gotten it down within a handful of tries.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a little adjustment to use shorter strokes, but that was the toughest part for me.</li>
            <li> He did have to do a little googling to figure out how to use it, however.</li>
            <li> I had always gotten a little irritation in the area mentioned.</li>
            <li> You can find razor blades for as little as 10 cents here or on ebay.  </li>
            <li> I used to shave in the shower with a little oil and be done in 5 mins or so...</li>
            <li> nicked myself twice, little, like poked with a pencil.  </li>
            <li> Please note, if you are not familiar with safety razors, you need to take your time and excercise caution.</li>
            <li> I just have to review it for those that are thinking about picking this little razor up.</li>
            <li> Well built little powerhouse but there was no blade included in the box as indicated.</li>
            <li> This sounds time consuming, but after a little practice, it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> so I went to you tube and did a little research.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Mach 3&#x27;s since I started shaving as a teenager - but a little internet research led me to saftey razors.</li>
            <li> At times wish it was a little heavier</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about getting cut</li>
            <li> You will get nicks, cuts, and little mishaps here and there.</li>
            <li> For the past 6 years I have switched to the double edged razors with the same result, still uncomfortable, but the blades are cheaper.</li>
            <li> Those people getting a lot of cuts must either have a face with lots of curves and bumps or they are just being a little reckless with the blade.      </li>
            <li> Could never do that with my Mach 5 even with the little \\&quot;grooming\\&quot; blade on the front end of it.     </li>
            <li> ..wish the handle was a little longer.</li>
            <li> Little to no razor burn--still a bit of a learning curve, but I&#x27;m getting there.  </li>
            <li> I use this razor, with Feather blades, to shave both face and head, with little difficulty.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re as inpatient as I am, prepare to lose a little blood all over your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a little bit of time to get used to the razor itself and the correct angle.</li>
            <li> would prefer it to be a little longer</li>
            <li> It took me a little time to&lt;br /&gt;get</li>
            <li> A little shorter than I would have preferred but feels well balanced.</li>
            <li> (there is a little stinging) and jump in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Now that I have been using the Merkur for a little over a week, I wish I pulled the trigger sooner.  </li>
            <li> The razor is robust and sturdy, it has a little heft to it ....</li>
            <li> I noticed that Schick gave me a closer and less irritating shave (using the same number of passes and angles).</li>
            <li> Razor bumps is much less with the DE razor since you don&#x27;t have multiple blades irritating</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a few things to keep in mind about this razor; a lot of which has been mentioned in previous reviews, so I won&#x27;t waste your time, but a lot of them are spot on.  </li>
            <li> The screw bottom ( which tightens and loosens the blade housing ) secures tightly and firmly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not trying to go back to the past and spend 20 minutes shaving with badger brush and serious lather.</li>
            <li> HANDS DOWN!</li>
            <li> he has very thick facial hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick facial hair and there was pain associated with every product I tried.</li>
            <li> Because the of the cost of disposable razors, that&#x27;s a total sham!!!  </li>
            <li> After buying this and shaving every other day my skin has been restored!!</li>
            <li> It can be hard making the transition to wet shaving and to safety razors.  </li>
            <li> Only 1 bad nick so far, and that was my fault.  </li>
            <li> I think the cutting &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; with the Feather blades is really overblown.</li>
            <li> Lil heavy and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Well after a bit of research I chose this shorter heavy duty razor.</li>
            <li> steel - well constructed and feels heavy  </li>
            <li> Buy a 10 pack for a few bucks and see if it works for you.     </li>
            <li> I use the proraso green shaving soap and a badger brush</li>
            <li> So I got the Merkur 34C Heavy Duty and</li>
            <li> Well constructed and heavy.  </li>
            <li> I can offer a few suggestions to those considering taking the leap:    1)</li>
            <li> The Merkur Heavy Duty</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had to buy them since I got this razor a few years ago).</li>
            <li> The one thing missing was a higher-end razor to go with it, which her godmother corrected by purchasing me this Merkur razor for Christmas.</li>
            <li> As one of those sensitive skin guys with random hair growth south of the Adams apple</li>
            <li> Hopefully this will help a few others out there.  </li>
            <li> few notes:</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday with a 3 pass shave.</li>
            <li> Then I realized there&#x27;s a reason the multi-blade cartridge razors were invented, because men got tired of having to make several passes to shave their faces</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy.</li>
            <li> The weight is substantial without being heavy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I&#x27;d go many days because I hated</li>
            <li> When I got tired of using a pliers to open my razor, I decided to switch to a trusted brand.  </li>
            <li> Too harsh for my taste.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how I ended up with the Merkur Heavy Duty</li>
            <li> I used to use a “butterfly” type of safety, but they don’t hold the blade firmly and you get some vibration.</li>
            <li> Makes a difference if you have gone a few days sans manscaping.</li>
            <li> After researching I decided to go with the Merkur Heavy Duty #34C.</li>
            <li> With my EJ I could easily go a few days without shaving, shave once</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for a few months.</li>
            <li> It is not a razor for the impatient.</li>
            <li> They are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> few considerations.</li>
            <li> If you have not tried  this razor you do not know what you are missing.</li>
            <li> Go over a few times to get the closet shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really heavy weight and well made</li>
            <li> This razor is heavy and well-made.</li>
            <li> but the 34C is well-balanced so after a few shaves that became a moot issue.  </li>
            <li> B000QYEK88 Merkur Heavy Duty</li>
            <li> I have used it to shave my legs a few times...</li>
            <li> I bought psoraso green soap.</li>
            <li> The razor is somewhat heavy but handles well.</li>
            <li> I heavily debated on getting the shorter or longer handle, but after a lot of research I went with the shorter handle.</li>
            <li> I ordered Merkur Heavy Duty</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews and listened to a few friends and man</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone, whether you&#x27;re just getting started in DE shaving, adding to your collection, or replacing a broken daily shaver.</li>
            <li> Blade gap uneven,</li>
            <li> Blade can be moved around inside the head which can leave uneven blade exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started using this brush with my Harry&#x27;s cartridge razor a few times before using the 34C.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever get the big name rip-off razors again.</li>
            <li> people get tired reading the same thing over and over, looking for usable information.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be throwing away my fusion and the few remaining cartridges for it.</li>
            <li> I purchased Merkur 34C and have been using it for a few months now</li>
            <li> But I haven&#x27;t noted it is any worse than I occasionally got with the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will update this posting in a few months and rate the longevity of the razor.</li>
            <li> The razor appears to be made with Teutonic rigor that oozes a quality feel.</li>
            <li> Had cuts and bleeds few times.</li>
            <li> You cannot be impatient about it and just have to put the effort into it.</li>
            <li> The razor is, as the name implies, heavy.</li>
            <li> A tad on the heavy side, but a quality razor.</li>
            <li> A few nicks,</li>
            <li> razor is well built, heavy and sturdy.</li>
            <li> They take quite a few passes and leave me with some irritation.  </li>
            <li> Heavy.</li>
            <li> This razor is heavy, so it took me a while to get use to it.  </li>
            <li> This is not a cheap plastic thing - it&#x27;s a quality</li>
            <li> Weight is heavy</li>
            <li> I was tired of getting poorer and poorer shaves with these multiple blade disposable razors</li>
            <li> its heavy, which helps with a close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Merkur Heavy Duty for a couple months now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this style razor for a few years now</li>
            <li> I went to YouTube and found a few videos demonstrating &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; shave using a DE.</li>
            <li> I simply got tired of getting robbed buying MachIII replacements.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and feels substantial in your hand which is also a plus.</li>
            <li> Heavy and well built.</li>
            <li> I used it for about 5 months everyday, head and face, to get used to it.</li>
            <li> This razor is a bit on the heavy side but works like a dream.  </li>
            <li> that 15-30 bucks for few blades depending on what style you have.</li>
            <li> Heavy, so if you like that</li>
            <li> I work in law enforcement so having to shave everyday</li>
            <li> have used disposables all my life and started using a Braun electric a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I have both this Merkur Heavy Duty #34 and the Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl.  </li>
            <li> Really heavy duty shaving razor.</li>
            <li> I am not actually a huge fan of the Merkur blade that came with</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;for years, but not a huge adustment.</li>
            <li> I found Feather was way too sharp and Merkur was a little dull.  </li>
            <li> Personally, the short handle was not comfortable or convenient for me, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there is anything intrinsically wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> VERY, VERY SHARP!  </li>
            <li> Blade is not too sharp or dull but I will probably by sharper blades online.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of shaving I have had a little razor burn here and there, but nothing as bad as when I was learning to shave at 15, or when I first got the straights.</li>
            <li> Before this Merkur, I had to wait at least two days before I could shave again due to razor burn.</li>
            <li> They are extremely sharp and perform beautifully on thick hair (reviews matched my experience).</li>
            <li> have a very thick coarse beard and dull out the expensive 3 blade disposables after three shaves and often had cuts and nicks and a sensitive area on the neck</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and was a little concerned about cutting myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little dab of a styptic pen and no more blood.  </li>
            <li> little small for my hand.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a classic razor set for a long time, but was not impressed with the Gillette razor sets, with the expensive replacement blades.</li>
            <li> It took only 3 mornings to master it, and I&#x27;ve never had closer, cleaner, less gory shaves.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s less expensive then constantly buying cartridges.</li>
            <li> It is a fairly mild shaver which means it is unlikely you will cut yourself (unless you are truly careless).  </li>
            <li> Too small and heavy.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am not satisfied with the looks for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> After just a few weeks, my face is noticeably clearer - no more razor burn or bumps.</li>
            <li> , I also ordered the long handle as well due to Amazon having the wrong description</li>
            <li> FINALLY no more money wasted on overpriced disposable cartridges.</li>
            <li> 3) Slow down.</li>
            <li> Slow down.</li>
            <li> Slow down.</li>
            <li> you have to be patient for at least two passes, and attempting to hurry by pressing down will shred your face.</li>
            <li> You will need to slow down, slow down, slow down.</li>
            <li> , my main brand of razors was the Gillette Fusion razors, which are expensive!</li>
            <li> When my safety razor dulled up due to poor stropping technique, I used a Dovo Shavette with interchangeable straight razor blades, it gave baby face shaves but it was dangerous and made shaving feel like a deliberate chore; changing blades was also cumbersome.</li>
            <li> When my safety razor dulled up due to poor stropping technique, I used a Dovo Shavette with interchangeable straight razor blades, it gave baby face shaves but it was dangerous and made shaving feel like a deliberate chore; changing blades was also cumbersome.</li>
            <li> After that, my face was usually burned pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> It has been impossible to get a really close shave with them.</li>
            <li> time spent running the razor over the same spot on my face without it cutting.</li>
            <li> but if you can devote a few extra minutes to your morning shave you won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
            <li> the less expensive long handle razor.</li>
            <li> Some say it&#x27;s hard not to cut yourself with this blade, so i was a little concerned.</li>
            <li> Shave soap will leave a residue on the razor and make it appear dull and not shiny without a little cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i certainly can navigate this bad boy with the handle given.</li>
            <li> I would recommend anyone to purchase this razor, if the size is too small for you (probably around 3 1/2\\&quot; tall) they do make a longer handled version.  </li>
            <li> i usually dont write reviews</li>
            <li> No more 5 0&#x27;clock shadow at 10am.  </li>
            <li> Blades cost just pennies each and within a short time you&#x27;ll make up the purchase price of your Merkur razor in savings from buying disposable razors or expensive blades.</li>
            <li> * Double Edge Safety Razor Blades: (you need to experiment with different blades until you find what works for you)   -</li>
            <li> For me this is usually around 10 minutes or so instead of 5 minutes with the Gilette fusion that I used to use.    </li>
            <li> One with and one across plus a small touch up on chin and sideburns</li>
            <li> I will say, if you&#x27;re worried about it being too small</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if it is the razor</li>
            <li> you got time, do 5) reapply soap and then begin shaving with a small stream of water</li>
            <li> HANDLE IS SMALL</li>
            <li> The change from cartridges (Fusion) to double edge razor has not been as difficult as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I want to pass this on to my son not for being a cheapskate, but for sentimental value.</li>
            <li> A small learning curve.</li>
            <li> I usually clog cartridges (between the blades) and have to run them under pressure (faucet/shower head) to get them cleared.</li>
            <li> usually when I&#x27;m in a rush).  </li>
            <li> Small and compact to take on trips.</li>
            <li> I usually go for with the Merkur sample blade, but didn&#x27;t notice it detracting from this razor&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Also, some blogs that compare this razor vs Edwing Jagger 89BL show pictures with a lot of small flaws in the finishing of the 34C. Mine does not have any of those flaws.</li>
            <li> I usually get 4-5 shaves per blade.</li>
            <li> and I have been wary about going all in with the double edge razors.  </li>
            <li> No more so than I would have using a multi blade cartridge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never look back to the expensive cartridges ever again.  </li>
            <li> and I was in trouble!</li>
            <li> However, I bought this one because I have fairly small hands for a guy</li>
            <li> I never enjoyed or looked forward to shaving until I switched to the DE razor.  </li>
            <li> Have we not evolved past that</li>
            <li> I just upgraded from a \\&quot;Feather Popular\\&quot; razor with feather blades, and the difference is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> you are wavering and not sure about trying this razor - go for it.</li>
            <li> so I cut a section off a leaf, scratch up the inside with a small knife, and rub the gooey gel all over my face.</li>
            <li> this is small</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost too small for my hand.</li>
            <li> All that said,whether beginner or veteran I do not think you can go wrong with this razor.</li>
            <li> My wife used to complain about my stubble when it touched her face, but after using the Merkur, no more complaints.</li>
            <li> Will take some getting use to as for the small handle.</li>
            <li> Now I start saving money on blades and no more disposable razor cartridges.</li>
            <li> I am still not sure I like this.  </li>
            <li> Should have bought this 20 years ago and skipped spending that small fortune on Mach 3 and Fusion cartridges given that six months of blades for this cost almost nothing in comparison.</li>
            <li> and I would buy again although I am not sure that I ever will have to.</li>
            <li> Not sure I like the Dorco blades it came with, though.  </li>
            <li> Unfair to deduct a star because the blades didn&#x27;t suit me personally?  </li>
            <li> This is way above and beyond the feel and use of those silly marketing designed 5 blade razors you see at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about the blade it comes with, though.</li>
            <li> It is small but it is designed that way</li>
            <li> This purchase has paid for itself several times over with the amount of money I saved from not purchasing expensive razor blades.</li>
            <li> Also, I followed past reviews which suggested that I let the weight of the razor take over.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> The 34C won as i don&#x27;t have a thick beard and shave nearly everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oops... Found the blade in the small paper instructions - look there to find it.</li>
            <li> No more gimmiky overpriced cartridge Mach III BS for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I didn&#x27;t go the safety razor route sooner.</li>
            <li> no more 5 razor nonsense for me ever again.</li>
            <li> In the past I attributed it to the razor but it was my shaving method.</li>
            <li> I still get an ingrown hair now and then, but not nearly as many as I did beforehand.</li>
            <li> The short handle was weird but seems to work well around the neck area.</li>
            <li> Maybe one or two small nicks.</li>
            <li> No more disposables for me.</li>
            <li> you really can&#x27;t go wrong with it, the handle is a bit short for me</li>
            <li> Very heavy but well balanced.</li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard but even when doing three pass shaves, I have yet to cut myself with this Merkur.  </li>
            <li> and this is a very heavy duty</li>
            <li> Even with Feather blades, very few nicks.</li>
            <li> This razor is very heavy duty</li>
            <li> I have had very few cuts or nicks at all</li>
            <li> Plus the electric left rough stubble nearly as bad as a five o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ingrown hairs, red rash on my neck, etc from these modern multi-blade razors made it miserable.</li>
            <li> After years of wet shaving with the modern multi-blade razors, I hated shaving.  </li>
            <li> the end, when compared to shaving with Norelco, I hate to admit it, but my electric razor outperforms in terms of time, convenience and performance (again, only for short stubble).  </li>
            <li> I will say that the Merkur blades are not very good.</li>
            <li> I very much like that the head is secured by twisting the knob at the base of the handle.</li>
            <li> It is a small handle and thus hard to ease through the shave, maybe in time I will get accustomed.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing to go wrong here, nothing to break, nothing to fail, unless you really whack it with a hammer or drop it repeatedly from a height onto a hard surface.  </li>
            <li> This razor may be a bit expensive but the investment will pay off in the long run because you won&#x27;t be buying razor cartridges or shave heads for electric</li>
            <li> these are less expensive and less wasteful.</li>
            <li> I was worried that I would be driving to work with little pieces of bloody tissue on my face every morning, but it is actually easier to shave with this heavy yet tiny razor than the expensive disposables I used to use.</li>
            <li> For my wife&#x27;s sake i would sometimes shave against the grain, but that would frequently result in small cuts and always bad razor burn, but with the Merkur going against the grain is painless.  </li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t want to dry my face with soap, or get sucked into buying expensive products for a cost efficient razor).</li>
            <li> and it is small enough to be awkward to hold.</li>
            <li> Those are several dollars a piece while a high-quality German-made blade like the Wilkinson Sword or Japanese-made Feather are a measly 25-35 CENTS.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s enough to dock it because now it doesn&#x27;t have an ugly split down the center.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The short handle on this bad boy basically prevents you from leveraging the handle and pushing down to hard.</li>
            <li> Every other blade I&#x27;ve tried, Merkur, Bolzano, PolSilver, and Personna Lab Blues, have really left me raw, bloody, and sore.  </li>
            <li> No more spending ridiculous amounts on blades.</li>
            <li> but there is a lot of play and hard to line up the razor blade.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t hard at all to get &amp;#34;BBS&amp;#34; with it.</li>
            <li> It will take a couple times to get used to, but is hard to cut yourself with (I haven&#x27;t got cut yet).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell from the picture when yoou are looking at it</li>
            <li> My alcohol based aftershave does not burn (unless I let the blade get too dull).   </li>
            <li> Hard to tell</li>
            <li> I pressed way too hard cause habit shaving with electric.&lt;br /&gt;Secret to not getting nicked is don&#x27;t press hard.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> of passes hardly matters.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> happy.t to not getting nicked is don&#x27;t press hard.  </li>
            <li> Number of passes hardly matters.  </li>
            <li> But still the razor blades would dull faster than you can afford to replace.</li>
            <li> I find it a bit dull and I will be looking for something sharper, but still for beginners like myself.</li>
            <li> I find it a bit dull and I will be looking for something sharper, but still for beginners like myself.</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to not get razor burn with this blade.</li>
            <li> Its just hard to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Also the shortish handle is hard to hold on to if I&#x27;m in the shower.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to imagine what can be improved on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait to try the Feather blades I purchased with this razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, hard to knock off a star for this razor because the couple of sample blades didn&#x27;t satisfy my needs.</li>
            <li> this razor, you let the weight do the hard work for you.</li>
            <li> There will ALWAY be times when you need to shave against the direction of the beard or when you have to stretch the skin, but you should NEVER press too hard.</li>
            <li> My problem is that I am very bony and have very thick black leg hair (very sad for a woman!).  </li>
            <li> A little disappointed in that stem is not as long as I would prefer, but well built and has a little heft to it as I prefer this type of razor.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed about this, but the blade itself is decent, however, I am going to upgrade to Feather blades because I have a rather course and thick beard which means I need a sharper blade.  </li>
            <li> It looks a little expensive, but I want to try a few brands and see what I like</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; shave as far as razors of this sort go, so you need not worry about bad cuts.</li>
            <li> I have a bad combination as far as shaving is concerned.</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old and have been using the Mach 3 razor for YEARS and last week I was done with the outrageous prices on cartridges and looked into Safety Razor system and bought the Merkur 34C!</li>
            <li> I never liked shaving.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using a Mach 3, Quattro, Fusion, you&#x27;re probably a sucker.</li>
            <li> This product not only does not provide a shave, it is dangerous.</li>
            <li> But there was a short learning curve I had to get over (and a week or so of cutting my face up).  </li>
            <li> But at least I found my razor.  </li>
            <li> I probably actually nicked myself worse with the Fusion blades as I&#x27;d use the blades probably longer than I should because they were so expensive.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of buying expensive, disposable, cartridges for my daily shave.</li>
            <li> I use to get at least one nick a week with my EJ.  </li>
            <li> , at least for me, the Merkur blades don&#x27;t seem to be as well engineered as the handle itself.</li>
            <li> I cannot say that I shave often lately</li>
            <li> Closest shave with the least irritation I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> The least $.10.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when shaving late in the day on a Sunday Monday morning I may use the 34c.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for at least 17 years and tried all types of shaving tools.  </li>
            <li> I have never liked Merkur blades</li>
            <li> Go slow and let the weight of the razor do the job.  </li>
            <li> but you have to go really slow.  </li>
            <li> Even when I went really slow</li>
            <li> I used to hate shaving completely, electric razors, prior to that cartridge razors with the fake compressed can shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this razor because I was tired of paying $20 for Mach 3 refills every few months.</li>
            <li> Thick hair?</li>
            <li> Need something with a thick Handle</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard with steel wire growing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped mine a few times and is still in tact were others have broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sick and tired of spending so much on shick and oyjer name brand razors , When I was 16 my dad bought me a safty razor</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in the overall quality.</li>
            <li> I mean, it works.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t mean that in the sense of a aggressive razor.</li>
            <li> I mean, sometime like $30 for 8 blades is simply ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Shaving has always been unpleasant and I avoided it when ever possible.</li>
            <li> was initially nervous about getting a DE razor because of the negative reviews where users claimed to have cut themselves badly.</li>
            <li> My husband has had a Merkur Futur razor for years and wanted a less expensive razor to travel with.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback to this unit (and to this type of shaving) is that you need about a 30 degree angle on the blade and its impossible to get that under your nose.</li>
            <li> Buy one and you will probably pass it on to your son one day, seriously.</li>
            <li> I have since seen some less expensive alternatives, like the butterfly opening style.</li>
            <li> No nicks or cuts and seriously the closest shave</li>
            <li> but it is about half as expensive as my Weber.</li>
            <li> After getting sick and tired of buying razors at the grocery store and paying $8 for 4 blades, I opted to go old school.</li>
            <li> Merkur blades are very thin and very sharp providing a close shave.</li>
            <li> Just shave until it is a little uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> but nothing bad at all, a very short learnkng curve.</li>
            <li> It took about a week or two to learn the how to shave properly as the disposables gave me lots of bad habits.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad, especially when I paired it with some</li>
            <li> and I remember cutting myself with it as a curious kid</li>
            <li> I hated spending so much money on mach razors just to have them feel like they were ripping my hair out.</li>
            <li> the handle is just shy of 3&amp;#34; but heavy.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that were concerned about cutting, and this thing will cut the daylights out of you if you don&#x27;t properly wet the soap and push the razor like you do with disposables.  </li>
            <li> This was not a good razor.  </li>
            <li> My razor is either defective or it&#x27;s just not good for me.</li>
            <li> The posts that attach the head to the base are just a little loose requiring me to check and adjust alignment whenever I load a blade.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to really nick myself very badly with this Merkur.</li>
            <li> , if you purchase this razor, start off with the Merkur blade but don&#x27;t be afraid to try other blades.</li>
            <li> Also, if you purchase this razor, start off with the Merkur blade but don&#x27;t be afraid to try other blades.</li>
            <li> have had some that the blade can get a little off center, with bloody consequences.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as I was tired of paying the ridiculous prices for Gillette blades etc.</li>
            <li> How could I have been so dumb as to be using disposables and cartridge razors all these years?    </li>
            <li> No more paying for expensive blades for the razor I did use.</li>
            <li> He usually shaves with expensive 3 blade razors with replaceable blade heads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shaving, way nicer shaving, but no more difficult than that.</li>
            <li> Tried the included Merkur blade and did horrible the first time.</li>
            <li> Give it a shot, slowly!</li>
            <li> it is tough to beat this razor</li>
            <li> have a tough beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still a bit tough to get under the nose</li>
            <li> If you have a tough beard and are on the fence of whether to give up your Gillett multi-blade razor...</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard and shave every day.</li>
            <li> With the 34C however, I&#x27;m so eager to shave everyday!!!</li>
            <li> With the 34C however, I&#x27;m so eager to shave everyday!!!</li>
            <li> and it found it a little awkward using the shorter handle again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why anyone would continue to pay exorbitant prices, and wait for some clerk to find a key to unlock a case, just to purchase a stupid razor.  </li>
            <li> It was always frustrating getting the hair on my chin and under my nose.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of wasting your money on 4 razors for $15-17, you should give the Merkur 34C a try.</li>
            <li> A couple of weeks ago, I got tired of the way my face look</li>
            <li> I have to use a thin Gillette blade for that.  </li>
            <li> Merkur 34c plus personna blades makes against the grain passed unnecessary.</li>
            <li> What it does leave behind is ultra-smooth, unmolested skin.</li>
            <li> I found it irritating without getting close.</li>
            <li> It cut those whiskers off like butter without irritating my face like the cartridge or the electric razor.</li>
            <li> Like you could go wrong with the benchmark of DE razors (in my book at least).</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of the throw away razors</li>
            <li> I was tired of spending a ton of money on cartridge blades and decided to try a safety razor.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s poor quality.  </li>
            <li> I cant find a thing wrong with this sucker.  </li>
            <li> decided to up my game.</li>
            <li> The blades are surprisingly thin.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to step up my game.</li>
            <li> I use Merkur blades for my thin hairded beard</li>
            <li> I contacted the company and sent them a photo, and received no response - poor customer service.</li>
            <li> I find the short handle annoying.</li>
            <li> But unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Should have dropped multiple blade cartridge crap yrs ago.</li>
            <li> then the big name brands can give you with there 5 blade crap.</li>
            <li> I got tired of spending $20.00 for 4 razor blades.</li>
            <li> worse razor burn.  </li>
            <li> It is tough to go wrong with this razor.</li>
            <li> There have been a few nicks here and there, but nothing too bad.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not as forgiving as a disposable and with this product I am bleeding and cutting myself at least twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I was tired of paying for expensive cartridges and wanted to move to a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit afraid of cutting myself with it --</li>
            <li> A look at the underside of the cap shows the base metal is very rough under the plating.</li>
            <li> In addition, it doesn&#x27;t leave your face a bloody, burned mess.</li>
            <li> I was so wrong in thinking this way.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;m returning everything.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my order came with 10 Dorco blades.</li>
            <li> The newer &#x27;Mach 3&#x27; style has gotten so expensive in blade replacement and this solves that problem.</li>
            <li> it is wrong and it might get irritated.    </li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the 3 piece razors</li>
            <li> (I shave both head and face) but they are getting to expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking at this point that something is wrong with the razor, my technique, the blade itself.</li>
            <li> After all was said and done there remained random hairs sticking out where I had just shaved with this thing, so I googled tutorials on how you&#x27;re supposed to shave with this thing.</li>
            <li> and the razor was useless.</li>
            <li> if you are careless or try to shave in a hurry)</li>

            <li> It is now useless.</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong getting this Razor by Merkur.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to the disposable crap!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t know if I somehow got a wrongly manufactured razor or what.  </li>
            <li> In a mere 2 passes, this razor gets my face smoother than any jet fighter razor (e.g. Gilette Mach 3) on the market.</li>
            <li> But I was wrong there too.</li>
            <li> I just switched from those multi-bladed, expensive razors to using &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; double-edge razors.</li>
            <li> Silly</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I missed the deadline for returns by 4 days.  </li>
            <li> My husband started the family revolt against the expensive plastic disposables.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong:</li>
            <li> The Merkur blades are really lousy compared to others in sample kit.  </li>
            <li> I was doing it all wrong.</li>
            <li> I was holding the stroke angles wrong and irritated the stubs.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to start with DE shaving you could not go wrong picking this up as a learning razor.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this razor.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> but I think it is wrong.</li>
            <li> With the insane prices of razors, I was looking at dollar shave club, but you only get cheapo disposables for $1 there</li>
            <li> WRONG.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor to eliminate the need for the expensive multiblades that still seem to cause razor burn and wear out after a week.</li>
            <li> I was completely wrong.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with a Merkur razor.</li>
            <li> After a year of shaving with the Jagger, however, screw which seated into the stem became corroded and did was difficult to thread and screw on-</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just flat out terrible, trust me</li>
            <li> Close shave, and über forgiving (even with a Feather in it) in case you get a like sloppy, or rushed!</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m not sure how people are ending up bloody messes.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t go crazy on expensive shaving creams or soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For some odd reason my hand cramps terribly.  </li>

            <li> There is no question that I can shave faster with a safety razor, since I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so desperately craved.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was afraid of shaving with the D/E razor but talked with friends who are using them and decided to buy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to use D/E.</li>
            <li> Would I feel like I was always on the verge of cutting myself?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid of ingrown</li>
            <li> It arrived today and I had grown a two day beard to see if I could still shave with one without nicking or cutting myself.</li>
            <li> I had no issues of cutting myself during my change.</li>
            <li> If you miss spots lather up again, wash the brush, rinse your face in cold water.</li>
            <li> However, I was initially afraid about going against the grain with a safety razor, but realised it was a must</li>

            <li> Shaving used to be an expensive chore, now it is something I look forward to!</li>
            <li> This razor just feels wrong!  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just careless or unskilled at shaving, but I can&#x27;t handle this baby!  </li>
            <li> expensive multi blade cartridges!</li>
            <li> For some reason I was afraid of the DE razor; it looked as if one could cut oneself badly.  </li>
            <li> Blessed Jesus, I&#x27;ll never use those expensive store bought pieces of crap again.</li>
            <li> it was a very expensive habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with ingrown hairs and in-shave bleeding, as well as bad razor burn thereafter.  </li>
            <li> But with practice aggressive isnt a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as I</li>
            <li> (pushing is bad)</li>
            <li> Not that it was a bad thing.  </li>

            <li> Just pair up the razor with:  -[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t wash my car or make me a batch of Julienne fries, so I was sort-of disappointed about that, but what are you going to do.    </li>
            <li> Buy one and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t shave a bit closer.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhay disappointed with this razor.</li>
            <li> Coming to that part will say am disappointed with seller (DE razor)...</li>
            <li> Since I hate wasting money and using plastic products, I had to find an alternative to the disposable razor or disposable razor head.</li>
            <li> The Merkur head just balances on a towel ya drop the blade bring over the handle and tighen the base and its done.  </li>
            <li> If you are accostomed to the convenience of the moder razor it is highly doubtful that you will like the experience.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades were crap after I tried out a variety pack, though.</li>
            <li> Get all that chemical crap off your face.</li>

            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> *Bad Idea!!!</li>
            <li> Started out using the &amp;#34;Pawn Stars&amp;#34; razor it was terrible.</li>
            <li> $200 is utterly outrageous for a razor.  </li>
            <li> Stop throwing away your money on the disposable crap, I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
            <li> The shipping time was awful, shouldn&#x27;t say you are gonna recieve it between dates and then not make it happen.</li>
            <li> am knocking off one star because the finish on this razor is the worst I&#x27;ve seen on a razor from a respected manufacturer.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice quality razor.  Gives me a good shave with Astra blades.  I recommend this razor</li>
            <li> There is nothing better than getting a close shave with a single blade instead of getting hair stuck in the triple blade and more razors. This is small enough and easy with a protective shield to lessen the ability to accidentally cut yourself. Make sure to go for the full effect with a brush and shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;The investment is good because razors are not as pricey as Gilette and other competing brands.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and I have no complaints.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and I&#x27;m now getting the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This razor is well crafted and a joy to use.</li>
            <li> My razor completely fell apart after one month of moderate use.  And of course it happened a week after the exchange window ran out.  Very disappointing as I really enjoyed the razor while it was still functional.  Would recommend going with another brand.</li>
            <li> Lil heavy and sturdy. Good one.</li>
            <li> Good weight, I should have got the longer handle model.</li>
            <li> I was brand new to DE shaving when I got this razor and it has worked perfectly.  I started out very timid since I really wanted to avoid cutting myself.  I&#x27;ve used this razor exclusively for the last 4 months and I&#x27;ve never had a major cut.  There have been a few nicks here and there, but nothing too bad.  I highly recommend the switch from cartridges.</li>
            <li> Just started shaving with a double edge, and this was my first razor. Less expensive than the same exact thing from The Art of Shaving. This razor is weighted so nicely, which is why I picked it over the many other options out there. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the Merkur blade that came with it - it cut me up a lot (though I was new to this, so maybe it was my fault). I got a sample pack of replacement blades and was much happier with some others. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Good razor.  A hair below in smoothness as the edwin jagger kelvin.  Quality is less than par of the jagger.  Two piece but there is a lot of play and hard to line up the razor blade.  I prefer the kelvin.  This one has a smaller blade gap but more aggressive angle than the kelvin.  Doesn&#x27;t do it for my face.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  Has a quality feel to it.  Holds blade very securely.  Easy to clean.  The handle is easy to manipulate around my face.</li>
            <li> This razor has given me a closer shave than anything I imagined from your standard Gillette or other &amp;#34;commercial&amp;#34; razors. I can honestly say I will never go back to those razors again. As someone who is prone to razor burns, I am yet to get ONE with this razor and it has been 4+ weeks. I would reccommend this razor to anybody!</li>
            <li> Merkur has a well-deserved reputation as producing one of the best shavers in the business. I transitioned to wet shaving with this product after using Mach 3 for many years. It takes a little adjustment to use shorter strokes, but that was the toughest part for me. (In other words, shaving with the Merkur 34C is very easy.) Another tip: Using a stroke of NO MORE THAN AN INCH AT A TIME, rinse the blade after each stroke, and alternate blades each time. Works like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll also want to use some good pre-shave oil before you lather, so that the blade glides across your face. I&#x27;ve found that straight castor oil works best for me, which is cheaper than buying the packaged pre-shave oil. Olive oil also works well if you want something lighter. I add some essential oil (sage oil, for instance) for fragrance, but it&#x27;s not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also highly recommend using an alum bar after you shave. Many sites on safety-razor shaving rightly point out that alcohol-based aftershaves are bad for your skin (the Art of Shaving site has a lot to say about this). The alum bar is far superior to alcohol-based aftershaves, so you should really consider upgrading to an alum bar. You&#x27;ll thank me.</li>
            <li> Well balanced, nice knurled stock. The blade is half way decent to get you through a day or two. Worth the price, even if it holds together a couple of years.</li>
            <li> Luv it!!!!!  Shaves great, feels great in my hand and is easy to control due the nice hefty weight.  I use Feather blades, insanely sharp, in mine and keep it in an almond oil bath between shavings.  I must admit that I don&#x27;t use it as often as I use to because I&#x27;m a recent convert to cut-throat shaving.  Nothing shaves closer then a straight razor, period!!!!!  However, before treading into cut-throat territory I would strongly advise that you research, research, research and understand straight razor mechanics, angles, movements, maintenance and cost!!!! Practice on something that doesn&#x27;t bleed, like a melon, prior to face.  Definitely watch those great Youtube shaving videos.  Will you cut yourself????  In one word......YES.........it&#x27;s going to happen regardless of how careful you are.......so don&#x27;t sweat it.  The more knowledge you have prior to face shaving the less likely you are sustain serious injury.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this razor! Super solid, heavier than I expected, and easy to grip with that gnarled handle. The handle (just above the twist piece at the bottom) actually has the Merkur logo etched into it. A great attention to detail with this razor. Overall, this razor is more than worth the money. As long as you treat this razor like gold, it&#x27;ll treat you even better!</li>
            <li> I plan on buying this same razor for by boys when they turn 18. Love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor.  Saves so you so much money.</li>
            <li> Great beginners razor as this was my first safety razor purchase. I&#x27;m much happier with the quality if shaves I&#x27;m getting now than I have ever been. I&#x27;d recommend using this with the Feather brand of blades, especially if you suffer from ingrown hairs like me. This combo buy comes with said razors.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and shaves well.  It arrived with a chip in the handle and one on the handle cap. I&#x27;ve only owned this product for a week and it&#x27;s already rusting where the plating chipped off.  Very disappointed that a $40 razor is rusting in a week.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first safety razor. I liked the weight, I feel like it made learning how to shave with a safety razor easier since I didn&#x27;t need to apply any more pressure than the razor already provided. No complaints regarding the razor!</li>
            <li> good shaver, i use it a lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new with safety razors and did&#x27;nt realize that the short handle was better for me...The longer handle razors are not for me...</li>
            <li> My husband has had a Merkur Futur razor for years and wanted a less expensive razor to travel with.  All in all this razor works just fine on his heavy beard, but he said he misses the adjustable angle of the Futur.</li>
            <li> Bye bye Gillette cartridges...I was a but sckeptical about this type of shaving but it&#x27;s true what most of people say: it&#x27;s waaay better shaving with this than cartridges...absolutly love this! And you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product, Merkur is really good, well made, no cuts, only cut myself in the finger while putting the blade on. Used it with the Merkur blade that comes with the razor and I really liked the result...there&#x27;s no going back! And as many people say the thing is that you don&#x27;t have to pressure it just let the weight of the shaver do its job.</li>
            <li> This has been a great purchase. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Works as advertized.  Much better than any other razors with double/triple/quad edges.  A quality shave that will save money in the long run!</li>
            <li> I imainge I&#x27;ll be able to pass this razor down to my great-grandson 60 years from now. These razors are that well made. I use it as my daily shaver and couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li> Nice razor, I like to use feather blades with mine. I just recently switched from a Mach 5 to this Merkur and a shavette. It is nice to be able to use the same type of blade for both razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When buying this razor my main concern was which style should I get? The longer handle, the adjustable one or this shorter heavier razor. Well after a bit of research I chose this shorter heavy duty razor. Some people were saying that the longer handle Merkur was hard to maneuver while shaving the face and that it was intended more for shaving legs etcetera. After shaving with this shorter one I would have to agree that some areas on the face would be harder to shave with a longer handle. Such as from the jaw to the neck. This is because of the shaving angle you have to use with this type of razor. The adjustable Merkur razor isn&#x27;t recommended for anyone new to double edge shaving since it is easier to cut yourself. I would have to agree with this too. I haven&#x27;t cut myself with this heavy duty one yet, but since the adjustable cuts closer I can see that as being an issue for someone new to this type of shaving. I may eventually upgrade to the adjustable since you can get a closer shave, but for now I am pretty happy with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to buy feather blades be sure you are buying the Japanese brand and not the knockoff Thailand blades. With the feather blades you just let the razor weight apply the pressure. Some say you shouldn&#x27;t buy feather blades if you are new to double edge shaving, but I used them as my first blades and haven&#x27;t cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this will work or not but here is the link to the blades I buy for my Merkur and shavette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B004RWTQTS</li>
            <li> Very well made, fit &amp; finish flawless, nice weight, very natural feel in the hand. Could not be happier.</li>
            <li> Razor works as advertised. No problems.</li>
            <li> Awsome. Quality, nuff. Said</li>
            <li> Why would anyone  buy anything else.  Blades are cheap and it gives a great shave</li>
            <li> I must start out by saying I am one of those men with a beard that seems to be made of wire and skin that is incredibly sensitive - shaving has never been fun, easy or without issues since I was a teenager. The majority of my life has been spent shaving with those lovely cartridge razors that burn your skin and your wallet leaving you unhappy and with a dread of shaving; something that in today&#x27;s world is nearly a must in all professional circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to purchase this razor after 3 weeks of research into wet shaving and in all honesty with much reluctance to try something that held a razor capable of leaving you in need of stitches. In essence this was a \\&quot;last resort\\&quot; in an attempt to get that close shave that lasted more than half a day and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my razor arrived, I inserted the Merkur blade that comes with the razor, lathered up and began to shave after taking a deep breath and resigning myself to potential nicks and scrapes...I was so wrong in thinking this way. The 34c provided a smooth, comfortable shave with no pulling of my beard, no unpleasant burn after each stroke and surprisingly it was even fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 34c is brilliantly designed and the chrome finish and heft make it a pleasure to own and to use. The knurled handle offers plenty of grip, loading the razor is incredibly easy and it feels sturdy and stable in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My very first shave was closer than any I&#x27;ve ever had before and so much more pleasant. My wife is amazed and incredibly happy with my shaves now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first DE razor you are on the right track. I must offer a bit of advice though: Do not think that the short handle is going to be a burden, this design actually makes it easier to use and to apply the proper technique. Let me repeat that last part, TECHNIQUE, is essential in wet shaving. There is no pivot-head which means you must be aware of and account for the organic curvature of your face and neck. A longer handled razor will only impede your learning, your technique and ultimately affect your shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you purchase this razor, start off with the Merkur blade but don&#x27;t be afraid to try other blades. A multi-pack with an assortment of blades would be a good purchase as well so that you can try out other manufacturers and find the best fit for your skin and beard type. So far, for me, the Merkur blade is wonderful! Don&#x27;t forget to get a good soap (I use Art of Shaving cream for ease of use) and a good badger brush to lather with. These are essentials to a good wet-shave! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something to be said for shaving with a DE razor. Most of us today shave without a thought to how much of shaving is tradition as well as necessity. Our fathers and grandfathers and further back passed tradition on as well and many of them shaved with a DE or a straight edge but with the advent of the cartridge razor the tradition has nearly died out. Cartidges take out the need for learning, technique and patience. Shaving with a DE brings back this tradition among men and puts this time-honored right of passage back in our hands. Try a DE, you will get a wonderful shave and possible develop nostalgia for those simpler times when men were proud to be men and life involved reminders of what is meant to be a man in daily life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Excellent, sturdy design&lt;br /&gt;Heft and weight offer a effortless shave&lt;br /&gt;DE technique is easy to learn due to the design&lt;br /&gt;Blades are cheap!

            <li> I cannot find any flaw with this razor!  I really enjoy it and I find the short handle very comfortable maneuver around your face and jawline.  I actually enjoy waking up and whipping up my lather and shaving; I can&#x27;t find a better way to wake up!  The product&#x27;s fit and finish is perfect, not a single flaw that I can find.  Also, the checkered grip on the shaft is extremely grippy; I find that most of this checkering is just for show, but this grip really works and is comfortable.      Just pair up the razor with:  -[[ASIN:B000RI8BZQ Proraso Shaving Cream 5.2 oz (147 g)]]  -[[ASIN:B002RJC1HC 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle &amp; Free Stand from Parker Safety Razor]]  -A mug to mix your lather  -And a few minutes of your time each morning    In Conclusion,  You will not go wrong with this razor; I am sure that you will be glad you purchased it.[[ASIN:B000RI8BZQ</li>
            <li> I got a amazon gift card during a Christmas work party so I bought this razor and which came with a merkur blade.  I also got a 30 count of astra blades.  I also ordered a kingsley badger shave brush from walgreens for 35 dollars and derby, persona, merkur and Wilkinson sword blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the razor.  Best shave I ever had.  I cant wait to try the other blades and the badger brush.  I used van der hagen shave soap.  What do others use and what blades do you like.  I know what works for you may not for me.  And this razor beat the mirco touch one by a landslide.  I will post more as I use it</li>
            <li> I was very excited to go from the typical double/triple blade razors sold at CVS etc to this Merkur. Spent $80.00 on a quality shave brush and another $50.00 on Proraso products. Sadly, I&#x27;m returning everything. This Merkur is not as sharp as the typical Schick razors sold in department stores. I even purchased the blades by Feather which are suppose to be one of the sharpest. I used this razor for 2 weeks shaving in every angle/direction until one day I shaved half of my face with this Merkur and the other half with a Schick Xtreme 3 razor. I noticed that Schick gave me a closer and less irritating shave (using the same number of passes and angles). The Merkur razor looks very nice and shiny but just like my 2 year old BMW - what&#x27;s the point of having a nice luxury car with a variety of electrical problems. And Proraso products are overrated. Stick menthol into anything and put it on your face and you&#x27;ll get that same \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; sensation. Point being, I&#x27;ll stick with what has and still works best for me...Edge can gel and department store razors.</li>
            <li> Background  I have used everything from the twin blades, 4 blades, disposables, and electrics. I have used foam, gels, and on some occasions just water.     Benefits  * quick changeover - it takes about 15 seconds to change blades  * double sided - that means two shaving passes before hitting the bowl of water  * steel - well constructed and feels heavy  * cost - upfront cost but the blades are sharp and cheap    Should I get the short or long handle?   I can tell you that the short feels better in my hand as I have more control and I hold it in the middle. However this is personal preference. If you currently use a quattro, fusion, or disposable, try to remember where the end of the shaft is. If you only hold the razor with 3 fingers (picture chop stix) then you should be fine. If the end of the razor is somehow in you palm when shaving then you may notice the difference.     Is it more difficult to use?  Just different. Forget about your old style of shaving. Simply let the weight of the razor do the trick. As far as what angle to use, simply start at a 90 degree angle and work your way down (30-45 works for me). It does sideburns with ease and the hair right under your nose is easy to get as well. Rinse after every pass and shave with the grain.    What blade do I use?  Experiment. Don&#x27;t just buy the 200 pack and call it a day. Buy a 10 pack for a few bucks and see if it works for you.     Do I buy shaving soap and a badger brush?  I use the proraso green shaving soap and a badger brush and i haven&#x27;t even put a dent in it. You should buy both though. The first time you use that soap with your new razor you will think you came out of a barber shop with that smell and close shave    How long does it take?  Shaving is really a skill and it will take you about 20 minutes the first time and you should be close to your current shave in no time.    I&#x27;m still undecided, is there even a difference?  All I can tell is that I have a much, MUCH closer shave and I smell likea barber shop (although not overpowering at all, my wife can&#x27;t tell) and shaving old school like my grandpa is just a bonus ;)  -Rene N.</li>
            <li> 21 year old that has been using disposable razors from Costco since I started shaving. It was always frustrating getting the hair on my chin and under my nose. I saw this as the #1 choice on Lifehacker and ordered it. I just used thee old shaving foam and once I glided this down my cheek,  it feel awesome. NO TRACE OF BREAD AT ALL TO THE NAKED EYE!</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve Ever Used!</li>
            <li> Good fit and finish for the price.  Very much liked the 2-piece construction.  Head is as far as I can tell the same as the regular entry-level Merkur (which I also bought for comparison), so whether you buy this or stick with the $29 entry-level &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; should depend on how important (a) 2-piece vs. 3-piece is to you, and (b) whether you like the short handle or not.  Personally, the short handle was not comfortable or convenient for me, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there is anything intrinsically wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> Great item great seller</li>
            <li> Well, I shave my whole head and have been using cartridge razors for years, they keep making them more expensive to use.  At almost $4 per cartridge, it was costing me about a dollar everytime I shaved my head.  Someone told me about safety razors, so figured I&#x27;d try them. So my first experience with a safety razor was with a Parker 22r that was faulty, it would not secure fully, and chewed my head up.  It really made me almost regret jumping on the safety razor train.  I returned it and purchased the Merkur 34c, glad I gave safety razors a second chance.  This razor although kind&#x27;ve short has a really nice weight and feel.  I&#x27;ve only used it with the merkur platnium razor blade that came with it so far.  But I didn&#x27;t even nick my head once, although I did get my neck once or twice.  What a great razor (maybe it has something to do with the blade) it doesn&#x27;t pull when used against the grain. Even when shaving my moustache I got very little irritation, which usually is very sensitive.  Now I do have 13 more different types of blades to try out, and find what works best for me, but as of right now I am very happy with my purchase.  I would recommend anyone to purchase this razor, if the size is too small for you (probably around 3 1/2\\&quot; tall) they do make a longer handled version.  On another note they listed it with 5 free blades, mine came with 1 merkur blade and 10 extra korean made blades.</li>
            <li> i usually dont write reviews but i had to for this  razor. i have been using the usual mach 3 type razors but wanted something a little different this time. i found great reviews for this razor and decided to buy not knowing anything about straight razors. the trick is to just not put any pressure like we are all used to but to use the weight of the razor to shave. its the closest shave i have ever gotten. i used the provoso soap. the blades it came with did the job, but i will experiment with others as soon as i need them, and replacement blades are CHEAP compared to cartridges. do your self a favor and get this razor and make shaving enjoyable rather than a task of the day.</li>
            <li> Hair removal -- so many options!  Nair? Waxing? Burn it off? One blade, two, three, four, or five face filleting blades?  No  Shave like your grandfather.  The fact that you&#x27;re reading these words is a testament to how successful that man was at meeting women.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve shaved with the Gillette Fusion something or other and figured I&#x27;d never find a better shave. Luckily a co-worker happened to inquire about what shaving method I used. He went on to suggest that I use the Merkur 34C. It arrived today and I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. It turned out to be the shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Prior to the razors arrival I went on you tube to check out a few videos on how to use it properly. I also ordered 10 additional Merkur blades for $7.  If you&#x27;re tired of wasting your money on 4 razors for $15-17, you should give the Merkur 34C a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Seems much better built than the Edwin Jagger, and the engineering is much superior regarding the screwing mechanism.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as part of my switch to the traditional wet shave.  After watching several online videos and reading a few \\&quot;how to&#x27;s\\&quot; the switch was fairly easy for me.  This razor is easy to use, with the proper technique, and much more pleasing than other forms of shaving that I have tried.  The end result is also great.  My primary shaving method before the switch as an electric razor, and while there may be a debate about which is \\&quot;greener\\&quot; there can be no debate about which one performs better and gives you a better shave.  This razor wins hands down.  It may take a little more time, not much, but it&#x27;s time well spent.</li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving, but this razor is solid and comes highly recommended by others. Seems solid so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An important note though: while the listing only promises 5 free DE razor blades, many people in the reviews seem to have gotten feather blades with their product. Feathers might be a bit risky for newbies, but are probably the most popular and perhaps sharpest blade available from what I gather. Unfortunately, my order came with 10 Dorco blades. While I can&#x27;t fault the seller (no promises having been made), the Dorco blades have been highly unsatisfactory. It has been impossible to get a really close shave with them. I&#x27;d rather have gotten no blades for free; I could have ordered some along with my initial order for a couple dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So buy this product, but just assume the free blades are a total loss and buy one of the more well regarded blade brands.</li>
            <li> As everybody else who loves this thing has already said, its an awesome shaver! I just spent a few extra bucks and got 100 Feather blades for $25.95 to cut per-blade-costs and what a combo! They go great with the Merkur! I tried the Micro Touch One with the included Dorco blades before I got this one, and soon realized that although I could tell Double Edge shaving was the way to go- after blowing too much money on Fusion blades- the MicroTouch  wasn&#x27;t a long term keeper.  So I got the Merkur 34C Heavy Duty and sure enough,  all the good reviews about it are true as far as I can tell you. Nice, good simple construction, solid weight, and great angle on the blade. It wasn&#x27;t hard at all to get &amp;#34;BBS&amp;#34; with it. I&#x27;m using the Van Der Hagen Boar&#x27;s Hair Brush, bowl, and soap KIT for $8.99 with it. Works great!</li>
            <li> This razor is simple, but it seems to be a standard.  The handle is fairly short, but the weight is nice.  They say to let the weight of the razor to do most of the work, so the weight is important.  I have no complaints about this razor, and I&#x27;m just a beginner.  It will be a joy learning with this razor.</li>
            <li> We have been so brainwashed into buying cartridges for razors. At four to five dollars a pop, this was getting out of hand. After researching the web for hours, I decided on this model due to the positive reviews. I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and was a little concerned about cutting myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the razor arrived, I inserted a blade and proceeded  to try it out. I used the canned shaving gel I had and found the shaving experience very nice. I quickly realized that I couldn&#x27;t drag the razor like I had before with the Gillette fusion. I have to be very light with the pressure. I did cut myself once on the chin when I pressed too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after using it for a month, I found the shaving experience much better than the Gillette fusion. I can shave up and down, accross, and even against the grain without razor burn. The shave is much closer than the disposable cartridge razor.  My face is not dry and flaking in the morning anymore. Razor bumps is much less with the DE razor since you don&#x27;t have multiple blades irritating the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a hundred feather blades.  For the price of 20 Gillette fusion cartridges, I can shave with this DE razor for years to come.</li>
            <li> I have this razor and like it. But since it s the first safety razor I ve used in 25 years, i can t tell you how it compares to others. Since I was hesitant about buying a safety razor after years of using modern razors with multi blade disposables, I am commenting on that aspect. I was driven by the need to spend less on blades, and contribute less into the waste stream, but I didn t know if I d find shaving with it equivalent to my Mach 3.    My attitude on shaving is that you need to shave both with and against the grain in a hot, steamy environment, because the goal is a shave so close that you have completely smooth skin. A safety razor will do that, and with much less expense in blades.       But since it is somewhat larger and clumsier than a disposable, I still keep my disposable at hand to clean up in and around my lips, nose, ears, and adam s apple. used this way, the Mach 3 s blade will last a very long time, since they are only doing final touch up.      I see it in the same way that a groundskeeper might handle a big area: you use the tractor mower to do the large acreages, the little riding mower to do the intermediate work, and the hand-held weed whip to do the detail work: no one machine is perfect for the entire job, but in combination you get the job done quickly and cheaply.     I found Wilkinson blades to be sharper than the Merkur blades offered with this razor, and I d like a way to have a friction lock on the knurled know so that I could OPEN up the blade angle slightly without the  loosened knob then moving to a completely loose position.  Otherwise, the razor seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband as an anniversary gift. He was impressed by the quality of the product, as well as how much less expensive shaving would be in the long run. I could hear him exclaiming over and over \\&quot;THIS IS AWESOME\\&quot; from the bathroom. He has a nice, close shave, which we both enjoy. He did have to do a little googling to figure out how to use it, however.</li>
            <li> All I can say is go to Hellllll Gillette! I actually enjoy shaving with this razor. It is high quality! No more spending ridiculous amounts on blades. The Persona blades are sharp so watch out! j/k</li>
            <li> Nice heavy duty , easy to use &amp; clean. No rust A++ &amp; its not made I china lol</li>
            <li> works great!  Fast service too! Thanks</li>
            <li> I finally made the switch from the cartridge to the DE razor, and glad I did.  Not only is it more cost affective, but I get a much better shave, and feel much better afterwards.  I was hesitant at first because I didn&#x27;t really know what I was doing, but many blogs recommended this razor as the best for a rookie, and I&#x27;m glad I went with it.  Easy to use.  Nice and heavy so you don&#x27;t have to apply much pressure.  The blades that came with it are super clean and leave a nice smooth finish.  I have a fairly coarse beard that grows fast.  Now, I feel like my shave is cleaner for about a day longer, and much smoother on day 1.  No more 5 0&#x27;clock shadow at 10am.  Good buy.  Once I feel confident in the process and have mastered it, I look forward to stepping it up and possible passing this one down to my son.  Yes, it&#x27;s that sturdy.</li>
            <li> This razor is exactly what was described and is exactly what I wanted.  This is a \\&quot;no frills\\&quot; DE Razor and does exactly what it should do.  The quality is such that it will last for many years if not forever.  It is heavier than I thought it would be and that is good.  If you have sensitive skin or are not familiar with this type of razor and know exactly how to use it, then perhaps a different type of razor would be more appropriate for you.  It is not for the inexperienced shaver or a first time shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a great classic safety razor that is built to last. I use it everyday, and I can&#x27;t believe I was on those mega chain store, three bladed, expensive disposable pieces of pure s**t for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a fool I was...not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exceptional shave, built to last, and is already saving me razor blade money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the derby double edged razors with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about getting into classic shaving, this is a great place to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well crafted design, functional, and a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will never buy a Mach whatever or Sens....again.</li>
            <li> Incredible double edged razor.  Solid and comfortable design. Very high quality and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Solid built with great balance.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my merkur 34c. Great product, delivered on time as promised.</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old and have been using the Mach 3 razor for YEARS and last week I was done with the outrageous prices on cartridges and looked into Safety Razor system and bought the Merkur 34C! After my second shave I was blown away at how smooth silky my skin was after using the Merkur 34C! I didn&#x27;t have any razor burn, no nicks anywhere! First time in my life I now look forward to shaving AND with the Merkur 34C. The 34C is small in stature (3 and 1/4 inches long and weighs 80.5 grams) but don&#x27;t let that deter you, this razor is well balanced and perfect for beginners like me or experienced shavers.</li>
            <li> Great and fast service even though it was free shipping was here in a few days&lt;br /&gt;Love the razor very smooth and great look</li>
            <li> One shave with a Merkur razor and you&#x27;ll wonder how you ever got by with those crappy plastic ones. The razor is very solidly built, feels great in your hands and performs a smooth shave without any nicks. I&#x27;ve only cut myself once with this razor after about 6 months of use. While the cut bled pretty badly, overall I cut myself much less frequently than I did with a multi-blade plastic razor. Handling of spent blades can be kind of a pain, but overall it is definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Great Razor.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to Gillette Razors.  This razor does what it says.  Be forewarned though, make sure your face is wet or it WILL CUT YOU.  After several uses, you learn to judge the feel of the razor over your face.  Keep in mind though that you do not need to press down on the razor as you do with conventional razors.  This razor is heavy enough to do the work for you.  Excellent product.  I will enjoy this for years to come.</li>
            <li> Well constructed and heavy.  I wished it had a longer handle however.  Overall however it works well.</li>
            <li> feels great , solid, smooth  well engineered, can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to stop the insanity of overpriced disposables and ineffective electrics</li>
            <li> A great alternative to the modern multi-blade methodology of shaving.  This old fashion shaving is getting new life for me.  The newer &#x27;Mach 3&#x27; style has gotten so expensive in blade replacement and this solves that problem.</li>
            <li> Fits the plastic Merkur travel case and gives a great shave with Astra blades.  Great shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for a couple of years now. I&#x27;ve tried lots of different ones -- including adjustable and fixed head. This is a fixed head razor and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, including those new to wet shaving. Though perhaps not as cool as using an adjustable razor, or one with a butterfly opening to load blades, this razor does everything you could ask.    I have a lot of other razors that I use from time to time -- including super speeds, adjustables, fat boys and tiny Gillette travel razors -- some more than 50 years old. In my opinion, the older razors work fine but need a really sharp blade to totally get the job done. Despite having all those other razors, more often than not, I use this one. The reason? It&#x27;s simple and works great. I also know that this razor will work flawlessly for years to come just as it does today. (In fact, I have no doubt that it&#x27;ll work far longer than just my lifetime.)    The Merkur is a more aggressive razor then the old Gillette razors you might purchase on eBay or elsewhere -- but not one that needs to scare someone just starting out. Take your time, get a good badger brush, some high quality shaving soap or shaving cream, and do something you may not have done in years -- enjoy shaving again!    Finally, any razor is only as good as it&#x27;s blade. The Merkur is a very good razor at an extremely reasonable price. When you combine it with good blades -- you have a winning combination. Blades I&#x27;ve used and like include Crystals, Derby Extras, and the pretty much universally recognized sharpest blades made: Feathers. (Fair Warning: unless you&#x27;re a regular wet shaver, don&#x27;t start out with Feather blades -- work up to them.)    For those accustomed to a long handle, you may want to consider the Merkur long handle razor. For those needing a more aggressive shave, think Merkur slant. Regardless of which razor you choose, once you&#x27;ve purchased it, you&#x27;ll be ready to start saving money on shaving for the rest of your life. Blades cost just pennies each and within a short time you&#x27;ll make up the purchase price of your Merkur razor in savings from buying disposable razors or expensive blades. So ditch those disposables and look forward once again to that morning ritual of a close shave. You&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE safety razor. I really like the chrome finish and weight of the razor. Changing the blades is very easy. At first I was a little concerned about the short handle but I actually really like it. I have smaller hands but can still grip it securely using two or three fingers.</li>
            <li> After about a year and a half with wet shaving, I finally moved up to the much praised Merkur 34C. Although happy with Feather, Parker 22, and Utopia, I now have fallen in love with my Merkur!!  The three inch short handle really enhances my shaving experience tremendously. I can certainly see why it is the favorite of so many. I would challenge beginners not to be scared of it as I was by the reviews of more senior shavers! Why not begin with this one? You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This may be the best double-edge razor I&#x27;ve used in more than five decades of DE shaving. Smooth and efficient, and has excellent in-hand feel. The 34C is an exceptional performer. It delivers a smooth, comfortable, irritation-free shave. Paired mine with an Astra SP blade for an exceptional razor-to-blade pairing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bulldog handle makes the razor very easy to maneuver; and the razor&#x27;s head allows for close shaving in under one&#x27;s nose. I&#x27;ve used many Merkur razors, including the 37C (Slant), Progress, and Futur (extremely aggressive); and the 34C outperforms these razors at delivering a comfortably close shave. One pass and pickups and I&#x27;m ready for the day.</li>
            <li> One of the most popular razors in the world. Gives a mild but close shave. Well designed and well made. You can purchase this for less than the price of the newest cartridge gadget and five cartridge blades. How about paying 5 cents a week for razors and getting a better shave. You will be handing this to your grandchildren while that cartridge thing will be a shaming a local landfill. Great product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about this razor that hasn&#x27;t already been said - it&#x27;s a great introduction to the world of double-edge shaving, and DE shaving in general is a vastly more pleasant (and cost effective) alternative to cartridge razors. One note on this particular vendor: the razor came with 10 free blades (not 5), Dorco ST-301&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve been pleased with them; prices for DE blades can vary widely, and the Dorco&#x27;s are on the cheaper end. I probably would not have tried them if they weren&#x27;t included with the razor.    I can offer a few suggestions to those considering taking the leap:    1) Watch mantic59&#x27;s videos on youtube.    2) If you&#x27;re considering a longer razor - the Merkur 180 or barber pole, for example - remember that you shouldn&#x27;t treat the handle as a \\&quot;handle\\&quot;. After receiving the razor (and ignoring mantic&#x27;s video advice), I grabbed the razor in my fist and promptly removed half of my jaw. You&#x27;ll be MUCH happier if you force yourself to use fingertips only; the shorter handle encourages this.    3) Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Short, slow, light strokes cause much less irritation.    4) Never shave any part of your face that hasn&#x27;t been lathered. This seems obvious, but coming from a Mach 3, I was used to haphazardly touching up stubble without applying additional shaving cream. This isn&#x27;t a hot idea with a DE razor. Take the extra 10 seconds to re-lather.    5) Consider purchasing an alum block to use after shaving. I&#x27;m not sold on the stinging sensation, but it&#x27;s been a great help in determining which parts of my face I&#x27;m using too much pressure on. The Bloc Osma alum block seemed like a good value, and it really does tighten up your skin nicely.    Have fun! My complete shaving set consisting of this razor, [[ASIN:B002JW8S6K Bloc Osma Natural Alum Block]], [[ASIN:B000RI8BZQ Proraso Shaving Cream 5.2 oz (147 g)]], and [[ASIN:B002QI45Z0 Edwin Jagger 1ej947sds Traditional English Best Badger Hair Shaving Brush Faux Ivory Medium With Drip Stand, Ivory, Medium]] was right around $100. This is similar to the price of two bulk-packs of Mach 3 refills from Costco, so don&#x27;t agonize too much. DE is the way to go, and the 34C is a great razor.</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old and I used to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; using a electric trimmer because my skin is so sensitive that I couldn&#x27;t use any blades. When I used a disposable super expensive razor like the Gillette Fusion Proglide, I would get razors burn and as a results many bumps on my neck.Therefore I settled for a electric trimmer because it was the only thing safe for me to use.    A couple of weeks ago, I got tired of the way my face look and I dare to try the Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor #34C after watching a video on youtube about \\&quot;the art of shaving\\&quot;. It is truly an art. At first I thought the handle was too small for me but once you try it, your will love it. I was afraid to cut my face but once I tried it, all fears vanished. It is super easy to use. I use it at about 30 degree angle, and I let the weight of the razor to its job. I do three pass on my face (with the grain, against the grain, and side ways) Pay extra attention to how your hairs grow on your neck area, where it matters the most how you cut it.) The upper part of my neck - I shave it down with the grain, but the lower part of my neck - I have to shave it up with the grain. Therefore, if you have the same condition I have and you shave down your neck all the way down - it is wrong and it might get irritated.    **Now, I shave every two days, I get no irritation, no razor burns, no bumps on my neck.    **Now, I understand, that all you need is this safety razor, the right technique and a good blade.    **Products I use:    * Shaving oil - Pacific Shaving Company All Natural Shaving Oil: I love this product, I don&#x27;t know if there are better ones out there, but this product is great, and made in the great U.S.A. Get the 2 oz bottle.    * Brush - Escali Badger shaving brush: I like it, it is a good brush for the price.    * Shaving Soap - WSP Rustic Shaving Soap 4.2 oz and I also use Stirling Sharp Dressed Man scent - I started with Proraso, but these two brands are amazing. These are made in the U.S.A. The lather builds up quickly, has great cushioning and glide, and the smell is amazing on both soaps.    * After Shave - Proraso liquid after shave cream: and this one I do like. It comes with green tea and oatmeal, and I love how it smells and how my face feels after I apply this. I am going to be trying next the Stirling Sharp Dressed Man Aftershave. I really like this company.    * Double Edge Safety Razor Blades: (you need to experiment with different blades until you find what works for you)   - I used the Astra Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades from Russia- it is a good blade and inexpensive.   - I used the Kai Stainless Steel Double Edge Razor Blades from Japan- it is a great blade but expensive.   - I used the Personna - Red from Israel - these are better than the Astra blades and double the price.   - I am planning to use the Feather Razor Blades Hi-Stainless Double Edge from Japan next and hopefully they will be as good as the reviews claim it to be in order for me to justify its price. I will choose one blade once I try these, regardless of its price.    * Stand - I use the Burleigh Chrome Razor and Brush Stand: it cost me $20, and I am supper impressed with this product quality and presentation (the packaging is fantastic)    I hope this review helps someone out there that thinks that his skin is super sensitive, because it is probably not.</li>
            <li> After reading multiple reviews on the 34C and the long handled version I chose the 34C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first Double Edge Razor (safety razor).  I have been shaving with disposable razor heads for over twenty years and they are closer in length to the long handle version.  So first couple shaves with this I was very skeptical that I really liked this shorter handle.  I watched a couple videos on how to shave with one of these razors and now I am hooked on the shorter/heavy 34C and using double edge blades over disposable head Gillette/Schick ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is outstanding.  If this is your first double edge razor it might take you 3-4 shaves before you get use to the smaller/heavy razor compared to your old one, but i now love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 100 Astra razors and also a blade sampler.  Like everyone mentions the Feather blade is amazing, but if you are new to this type of shaving I would not start off with that one.  IT IS SHARP.  I started off using the Merkur blade that came with the razor, used some Astra&#x27;s then tried out the Feather blade once I knew what I was doing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a relatively new convert to shaving with a double-edge razor, having been brought up on disposable cartridges.  My new razor of choice?  The Merkur Heavy Duty #34C.  This is going to be the last razor I own, and I&#x27;ll be passing it along to my younger generations.  The quality is that good.  Not so much a disposable personal care item, as I&#x27;ve always viewed razors before, this is more of a premium quality tool.  The details based on my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size:  The dimensions of this razor are altogether different from your typical Mach X:  The handle is short, the working end (you know, the sharp part) is large in proportion to the handle, and it weighs about as much as a decent size wrench.  The dimensions and weight of it complement proper double-edge razor shaving technique as, unlike a Mach X which you rather drag across your face, the weight of the razor provides the oomph behind the actual blade, rather than the force of your stroke.  I prefer the shorter handle of this one to longer ones because it allows me to concentrate on proper technique and helps to removes the urge to use a longer handle to lever my way through the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality:  All parts are heavy, all metal, and finely machined.  The top of the shaving head that comes off to accommodate the razor blade fits perfectly in its receiver so that the blade maintains the desired profile each and every time you change blades.  There is nothing to go wrong here, nothing to break, nothing to fail, unless you really whack it with a hammer or drop it repeatedly from a height onto a hard surface.  I can reasonably expect my razor to outlast me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design:  I like that the design is simple and straightforward, and I appreciate its perfect balance.  It may not be as cool to load as a &#x27;butterfly&#x27; DE razor, and it is not adjustable as some DE razors are.  Fewer moving parts should add to durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:  For something that may well shave multiple generations of faces, I&#x27;d say this is a fair ripper of a value.  It&#x27;s also a nice bonus that, in addition to coming with a Merkur blade, it&#x27;s also packed with a box of Dorco blades to try.  Yours may or may not have this specific brand of blade packed with it, but it is nice to start off with a couple different brands of blades for you to try on your skin; blades do matter, and I would recommend trying several.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasting Impression:  Is this the razor for you?  I can say with confidence that this razor is perfect for me, but shaving is such an individual thing:  There are so, so many types of skin and beards and preferences.  I&#x27;ve heard from many that this is an excellent &#x27;starter&#x27; razor for those who make the jump from cartridges and I&#x27;d have to agree with that.  However, while I think it is a good idea to try various products (and certainly with various brands of replacement blades) I don&#x27;t feel that this razor is necessarily one you leave behind simply because you started with it.  The shave it provides strikes me as middle-of-the-road with regard to aggressiveness, with some being more and some less.  It gives me a perfect shave and actually makes me enjoy the task - a first since I began shaving decades ago.  No other razor I have found works better for me.  Easy, then, to recommend this.a value.  It&#x27;s also a nice bonus that, in addition to coming with a Merkur blade, it&#x27;s also packed with a box of Dorco blades to try.

            <li> Outstanding razor and exceptionally sharp. The Feather blades a bargain - about a tenth of the cost I&#x27;ve paid for the three-blade Mach refills.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking of switching from a cartridge razor system to a safety razor, do it. Just buy this one and the Feather blades. You&#x27;ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;After less than 18 months of use, the cap that pulls the razor blade against the body broke off form its stem. I bought this razor because I wanted something durable. It&#x27;s proven to be anything but.</li>
            <li> Excellent with a Feather double edge blade.</li>
            <li> This is my first double-edge blade razor.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now, and love it.  I switched from a Gillette Fusion because I got tired of buying the refill cartridges and how much they costed.  I&#x27;ve found that I have to shave more frequently, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like the shaver is tearing off a layer of skin.  I also find that I will nick myself more if I&#x27;m going too fast.  A little dab of a styptic pen and no more blood.  I&#x27;m glad I made the switch and feel that this razor does a great job.  Would recommend it to somebody else.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I have suffered a long time with ingrown hairs and irritation after shaving.  I have curly hair that is somewhat coarse, so I am predisposed to having difficulty at times with shaving.  I got a job where I needed to shave everyday or every other day for work and since I have to shave more often I wanted to invest in something that would not give me irritation.      There are some things that everyone should know about shaving with a safety razor:    1)  You can cut yourself easier with this than a disposable razor.  However, if you properly learn proper shaving habits, you will greatly reduce the odds of this.  Mantic59 on Youtube has excellent videos on how to shave properly.      2)  It takes slightly longer to shave.  For me this is usually around 10 minutes or so instead of 5 minutes with the Gilette fusion that I used to use.    3)  You should invest in a shaving brush (preferably badger hair), a good non alcohol based shaving soap/cream, a styptic pen (if you cut yourself this will effectively sanitize the area and stop the bleeding you can get these really cheap at any drugstore for a couple of dollars).    4)  I&#x27;d also recommend purchasing a sample pack of double edged blades.  After sampling a few of the brands I found that Derby suits me well and is a perfect combination of not being too dull where you will get resistance shaving and not being too sharp where you will cut yourself easily.  I found Feather was way too sharp and Merkur was a little dull.  Everyone has a different opinion on which to use.    When I bought this, I also purchased The Art of Shaving set that included aftershave moisturizer, preshave oil, a badger brush, and shaving cream and it was an excellent shaving set.  I have since moved on to using Proraso shaving soap because it is substantially cheaper and has similar results.  I still use the moisturizer and preshave oil though, they are both excellent products.      I have found that my irritation is substantially reduced and I actually enjoy shaving now and the blades are so cheap that you will quickly recoup your initial investment in cost savings compared to using a Gilette.    Good luck!</li>
            <li> At 51 yrs old I discovered the wonder of the old classic double-edged (DE) razor. Why did we ever go away from these?? I&#x27;ve always hated shaving. It was always a drudgery and only when absolutely necessary. Ingrown hairs, red rash on my neck, etc from these modern multi-blade razors made it miserable. I tried electric razors for years and that helped quite a bit ref rash and ingrown hairs, I still did get some ingrowns now and then. Plus the electric left rough stubble nearly as bad as a five o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;  A few months ago I heard a commercial ref these DE razors and was intrigued. I looked here on Amazon and read hundreds of reviews on these razors. The Merkur 34c really stood out with it&#x27;s high marks and praise from users. I thought about it awhile and finally decided to try it. I also ordered a $10 boar brush and some shaving soap...&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s been about a month now and let me tell you I honestly now ENJOY shaving each day - I look forward to it! This is something I&#x27;d never would have thought could be possible, but it is. The shave is smooth as any cartridge razor and I no longer have issues with rash. Ingrown hairs are fading away also (remnants of my previous shaving method - an electric I&#x27;d used the last several years).&lt;br /&gt;  Another thing I love about DE shaving is the cost of blades. If bought in bulk packs of 100, they&#x27;re around 10 cents each!! Yes that&#x27;s right - 10 cents. Compared to what? $3-$5 each for the 16-blade wonders of today? Forget it. You&#x27;ll never see me touch another multi-blade disposable or cartridge razor again.&lt;br /&gt;  The Merkur 34c is very well made. The fit and finish are excellent. It&#x27;s hefty and exudes quality when you feel it in hand. It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; shave as far as razors of this sort go, so you need not worry about bad cuts. A nick or two you may experience the first couple of shaves, but once you get the simple technique down you&#x27;ll have no issues with cuts at all. I can count on one hand how many nicks I&#x27;ve gotten in the past month if that gives you an idea. They were all minor.&lt;br /&gt;  Shaving with a retro DE razor like the 34c is a thrill. It takes you back several decades to a simpler time. When men were men and did manly things! Shaving was one of those things and they had the best tool for the job, a simple and efficient razor that got the job done and did it well. The ritual of whipping up a lather with your shaving brush and applying it to your face. The deliberate strokes of the razor. The splash of cold water to rinse. Then the splash of aftershave... Ahhh yes! It&#x27;s a pleasant and refreshing experience.in the past month if that gives you an idea. They were all minor.&lt;br /&gt;  Shaving with a retro DE razor like the 34c is a thrill.

            <li> Quality piece of shaving equipment. Handle is a little on the short side-making it great for travel. A nice heft that leads to a smooth shave. The only way to go. Toss the 5 blade junk thats over priced &amp; shoved down the throats of American males by marketing pros. These shave way better &amp; my dermatologist advised that multiblades are actually bad for your skin. It will actually pay for itself. (By not spending $25.00 on 4 cartridge packs of the multiblades.)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. I have tried all the cartage based systems except the one with 6 blades. I was finding that the more blades a system had, the worse the irritation. So, I tried this product, because of it&#x27;s simplicity.  Wow! what a difference! Shaving immediately became an enjoyable experience, and I have a closer, better looking shave to boot. I highly recommend. The only issue I have is that it is sometimes hard to find double edge blades locally, but the internet mitigates that to almost nil.</li>
            <li> Happy that I made the move from the 4-blade systems to this great, classic method.  It&#x27;s much easier than I expected.  I also started using with quality shave cream/soap (not from an aerosol can), blades and pre-post shave product and I now look forward to shaving.  Wife commented, unsolicited, that my skin has looked really good since i started this method.    My only regret is that i think I might prefer a longer handle on the razor.  But that&#x27;s just a matter of preference.</li>
            <li> ...yeah. It&#x27;s like a class in excellence through simplicity.  The shorter handle and hefty weight give it the perfect balance of stability/flexibility.  It took only 3 mornings to master it, and I&#x27;ve never had closer, cleaner, less gory shaves.  I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m in the middle of the sensitive skin and whisker coarseness camp.  I&#x27;m in there, but not on either extreme side.  This razor is supporting my wanton shaving laziness, it gets it so close I can skip a day and no one can tell the difference.  The construction of this thing is off the chart, it&#x27;ll be the only thing left intact at my house when the coming robot wars hit.  And it&#x27;s nice not to have to brave the accusing eyes of a store clerk so they&#x27;ll open a locked cabinet just to get me a new razor head not made of gold but made to fit my off-the-shelf twin blade POS.  I don&#x27;t mind ordering blades online compared to that.</li>
            <li> I used the vibrating Fusion before I switched to this, and many others before that.     Boy, am I glad I did. This shaves better, gives less no razor burn (although I cut myself the first few times I used this), and the blades cost pennies!    No longer will I pay more for ridiculously overpriced cartridges that give me incredible razor burn!    BUY THIS NOW.    Get the 100 Shark Super Chrome Double Edge Safety Razor Blades to go along with it and you will be golden for like 2 years!     Btw, as a side note. I am heavy into swimming and used to wrestle in high school, so I shave my head (twice a week actually). This works great for that as well, just be careful when you do it as these blades are much sharper than anything from big name companies. One motion with the 34C gets rid of more hair than the trendy 5 bladed junkers that I used to use.    There are only 2 side effects I found with this razor.  1 - It did NOT come with the 5 free advertised blades, but who cares? I bought 100 Shark blades that are simply awesome and cost pennies.  2 - The handle on this thing is short, really short. About half that of the Gillette Fusion or Mach3. So be warned. I got used to it after a few shaves, but would still prefer a longer handle as shaving the back of my head becomes a bit difficult in certain spots.</li>
            <li> My favorite double edge safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;I have a few other brands that are great, but the balance of the Merkur is perfect for me. The handle&#x27;s grip is extremely useful, especially if you use shaving oil and your hands get a little slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this Merkur for a few years now, and just wanted to say it&#x27;s excellent! I still remember the first time that I used it, it shaved closer than the Gillette Mach whatever I was using at the time. And, the other thing that is just as good as the better shave is the fact that the blades cost less than 50 cents apiece (How much are those cartridge blades now, $2 apiece? I&#x27;m just guessing, haven&#x27;t had to buy them since I got this razor a few years ago). The razor looks exactly the same as when I bought it, no rust, no signs of wear. My only regret is that I got the short-handle one instead of the long handle. No big deal, I still may get the long handle and give the shorty to a friend.  If you&#x27;re worried about nicking yourself, remember, this razor is a different design and you have to re-learn how to shave but it won&#x27;t take long. The best tip I can give you is to hold it lightly- don&#x27;t use a lot of pressure when you shave with this razor. If you&#x27;re really worried about nicking yourself but want to try it, just get it, use it on the weekends and you can take your time and not worry about showing up at work with a little nick on your face.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I was able to use this without cutting myself.</li>
            <li> So i bought this razor to see if it helped with razor bumps at the same time being cheaper than my gillette. So far great on all counts. I had a nick here or there but nothing bad at all, a very short learnkng curve. Unlike a modern razor it dles slmetimes require a second shave. I have yet to invest in a brush or shave soap but it works great with a regular gel. So glad i am no longer paying $15 for 4 blades.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.  This is a great high quality heavy razor.  It definitely makes a difference as to which razor blade you use with it.  I have tried several different blades, including the Merkur one that comes with it and it works really good with my skin type.  But you will need to find the blades that work best for your type of skin and beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that I would have switched from disposable razors 30 years ago!  Much better shave, no razor burn and bumps.  I started shaving with Save Secret shave oil with this razor and it makes for great combination.</li>
            <li> I expected this razor to be like my original Gillette that I have  had  for 52 years, It wasn&#x27;t, you have to unscrew the handle to replace the blade, the angle of the blade is wrong, so it doesn&#x27;t shave as close, it nicks a lot, and scrapes. Only  reason  I was  trying to replace the  Gillette was the nickle was wearing  off due to age. Merkur is not  worth  the cost, but  better than nothing. Better buy a StipTick at the same time.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor after years with a \\&quot;modern\\&quot; multi-trac.  Made the switch in order to address an irritation problem on my neck as well as the crazy multi-trac blade prices.  Happy tosay it&#x27;s a success in both areas.  Razor is well made,</li>
            <li> This is a special razor.  Excellent for a beginner or experienced DE shaver.  This is my new favorite razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to DE shaving, but I can tell you this, after having this razor,  there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going back to cartridge shaving!&lt;br /&gt;Super close shave, no razor burn, no irritated skin, and I haven&#x27;t even nicked myself one time with this razor.</li>
            <li> Great razor, But it...</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow! This thing is built like a tank and handles like a dream. No tugging or yanking just a really satisfying close shave. I have fairly large hands and the \\&quot;small\\&quot; handle fits great. It&#x27;s not really small it&#x27;s just not really long like the cartridge type razors. Shaving will now be a treat for me instead of a chore.</li>
            <li> I never liked shaving.  Then several years ago my lovely wife purchased a shaving brush, mug and upscale razor.  I decided to put some time into getting to understand the best way to get a great shave and enjoy  doing it.  I&#x27;ve gone to shaving sites (who would have thunk it), watched videos, done some reading, bought some high quality products......  Going with an OLD SCHOOL razor is my latest step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used this little gem this morning for the first time.  In all honesty I did take a pretty good chunk of skin off my face, but there is bound to be a learning curve.  A gentle hand is clearly necessary.  But the quality of the shave was fantastic.  Clearly it&#x27;s not a razor for a quick careless shave.  But, if you can take a moment to spoil yourself and to enjoy the necessary ritual of manhood.  This is a nice little razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to learning more about other old school units and further my shaving education.  Give it a shot, slowly!</li>
            <li> Quality safety razor.</li>
            <li> First off this is my first safety razor so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to. This thing is smaller than I thought but still easy to use. I will probably end up buying another long handled one for home use and keep this one for traveling. Besides the small size its very easy to use basic design feels like it will last a life time. The weight of the head is perfect and overall its a great product!.</li>
            <li> You will never get a better safety razor than Merkur, this is the second one I have had and I have tried a couple other brands, they are just built to last and the shave is second to none.</li>
            <li> You REALLY have to know what you&#x27;re doing to use a safety razor. It takes practice and patience.</li>
            <li> Very good product, I use it daily and I would highly recommend this to anyone trying DE shaving for the first time.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and the only thing I can compare it to is the cartridge style razor which is going in the trash. This gives an excellent shave (with a little practice) and the blades are so much cheaper. 100 double edge blades for $22.00 right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just over a decade ago, when an elderly friend passed away, his wife tried to give me his Gillette safety razor body. Being younger and dumber I passed on it but took the mug and brush. Since mug soap seems to last forever, I saved a fortune on shaving, or so I thought. Today I received my first safety razor, the Merkur HD 34C, put the Merkur blade in, cranked it down, and rushed off to shave like I was a kid on Christmas day that had just received a new remote control car. I&#x27;d been intentionally neglecting shaving since Amazon emailed me that it had shipped, so I had quite clear cut forest look going on. I was so impatient I didn&#x27;t even want to wait to lather up the soap, I just put a hot towel on my face for a few seconds and then off and shaving I went.    I&#x27;d read all the reviews, and knew to just let the weight of this razor do the work. After the first pass I actually checked the mirror to make sure it&#x27;d actually shaved me. I can really only describe it as effortless. Within a minute I&#x27;d cleaned up my neckline. How could I have been so dumb as to be using disposables and cartridge razors all these years?    The cons. If you&#x27;ve never used a safety razor, the weight of this razor is really the only thing I think will take a little adjustment time. I&#x27;d compare the weight to about three or four Sacagawea dollar coins. Compared to a disposable it&#x27;s a rock compared to a feather. The length of the handle, compared to several different disposables I have, is 1.5\\&quot; shorter on average. So if you absolutely need a long handled razor, there are other safety razors you should look at.    The pros. Solid construction, feels like I could fight my way out of a corner with it and not only still have a clean shave afterward, but I could pass this down to someone 40 years from now so they could barfight/shave with it as well. The included Merkur blade fits so snug that it took a little maneuvering just to get the blade past the threads (which is a good thing considering the reviews I&#x27;ve seen for other safety razors). It locks down nice and tight. The Merkur blade made shaving effortless. This one comes with 5 extra blades (made by Derby), but I currently have no experience with Derby blades so I can&#x27;t really review them. Looking around on Amazon, blades cost ~15 cents (if bought by the 100 pack) compared to a cartridge which comes in around $2 a cartridge. So it&#x27;s also a frugal shave, if that&#x27;s your thing. Plus it&#x27;s shiny, and people like shiny objects.</li>
            <li> I used this razor yesterday for the first time right after getting it. I was hesitant because of worrying about cutting myself. Well it was very easy to use and gave me the closest most comfortable shave ever-even closer and more comfortable than my Gillette Fusion Power. Also, for the first time I didn&#x27;t bleed at all after shaving against the grain. I just took my time and it was actually enjoyable.    I warn people just to be VERY careful while changing the blade. I didn&#x27;t cut myself, but I could tell I could dice up my digits pretty good if I got in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a classic razor set for a long time, but was not impressed with the Gillette razor sets, with the expensive replacement blades. This was a great razor to start my set, and was easy to learn with. Provides a heavy feel, is easy to clean and replace blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a little practice the razor provides the closest, most comfortable shave you will find.</li>
            <li> My wife has always had a not-so-subtle dislike of my facial hair, and shortly before Christmas picked up a groupon for an Art of Shaving starter kit (oil, brush, cream, balm). The one thing missing was a higher-end razor to go with it, which her godmother corrected by purchasing me this Merkur razor for Christmas. Since Christmas I have used it about a half-dozen times, shaving about twice a week.   I have oily skin on and around my nose, combined with dry, easy-to-cut skin on my throat and chin. I have always had problems with ingrown hairs and in-shave bleeding, as well as bad razor burn thereafter.  This razor, using one double-edged blade, has greatly reduced my ingrown hairs, which I understand can happen more frequently with modern cartridge or disposable razors.  CONSTRUCTION: solid steel construction. It feels nice in the hand, and blades are easy to change out. It feels like a unit that I could someday give to my son if he wished to have it.  SHAVING: when I get done, my face and throat are completely smooth and stay that way for 2-3 days, which even considering my slow beard growth is a good shave. Bear in mind, however, that I go through a 20-30 minute process every time, and it involves in-shower facial exfoliation, hot towels, glycerine shaving soap, brush, pre-shave oil, three razor passes and balm (I normally do this with a little Miles Davis or Coltrane). Also, DO NOT PRESS WITH THIS RAZOR. you have to be patient for at least two passes, and attempting to hurry by pressing down will shred your face. It takes practice and patience, since you have to lather up for each pass. Finally, the razor head can&#x27;t fit into the spot right under my nostrils- I have to use a thin Gillette blade for that.  VALUE: safety razor blades cost much less than any cartridge razors- a pack of 10 ran me $7 at CVS, while a box of fusion proglides can run $30-40.   If you are interested in a closer shave, for yourself or the man in your life, I recommend this as a great gift idea.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner with a DE razor. I did a little research and found out this is the one, especially for beginners. All I know is it&#x27;s great for me. Very maneuverable, and leaves my face feeling great. I&#x27;m now saying goodbye to razor bumps.</li>
            <li> very happy that i ordered this razor. it is very sturdy with a nice finish, something that looks like it will last a lifetime. what i really like about this razor is the knurled handle and the 2 piece design. just twist the nut on the bottom of the handle and the head releases. i like being able to install a blade while holding the handle and not having to hold the head between my fingers. the razor holds the blades straight with an even blade exposure on both sides. i ordered mine from SimplyBeautiful and i am very happy with my order. i also ordered a razor stand from them and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that most of the longer reviews are more about the experience of shaving than the product itself.  That&#x27;s probably because there really isn&#x27;t that much you can say about something as simple and perfect as this.  It feels just right in the hand, it is very well made, and it gets the job done well.  As a first time buyer of a safety razor, I looked at a lot of options, and weighed whether to get the longer handled model or not -- for me, the short handle works perfectly.  As many have noted, you shouldn&#x27;t grip it, so I would imagine a longer handle might actually be detrimental.</li>
            <li> When I bought this razor a few months ago I was new to double edge shaving. In fact, I&#x27;d always thought my cartridge razor experience was pretty good. Now I know differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is very well made, and easy to load. I considered getting the long handled version because it was more like what I was used to, but this feels really solid in my hand and I din&#x27;t want anything different. There definitely is a bit of a learning curve, but the whole process was surprisingly intuitive, especially if you read a blog or two about proper shaving technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the razor, I knew I&#x27;d never go back. The closeness of the shave is amazing, my irritation is virtually nil, it is cheaper than cartridges, and it makes you feel like a real man. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Great shaver! It says it comes with 5 blades but mine came with 11! One sample and 10 treet blades.</li>
            <li> I love my DE razor a thousand times more than my old razor. Switching is one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve made recently.</li>
            <li> Excellent intro razor into the world of DE shaving.  There&#x27;s something about lathering up a nice bowl of soap and brushing it on the face, following by the smooth strokes that the Merkur provides.  It has a very nice feel, not too hefty, not too light.  I&#x27;m really enjoying how the razor gives such a smooth shave, however, I haven&#x27;t settled on a razor brand yet (Feather&#x27;s seem to be leading the pack for now).  This product does what its supposed to - give a clean, smooth, old-fashioned shave every time.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great razor! High quality steel and finish. Wish I bought a long time ago to save money on razor blades.</li>
            <li> After getting sick and tired of buying razors at the grocery store and paying $8 for 4 blades, I opted to go old school. I had done my research, which showed Merkur products were supposed to be great. So, I took the risk and purchased. This razor combined with Merkur&#x27;s double edged platinum blades is an excellent shave that is far closer and superior to anything I have ever pulled off before. I have switched to the wet shave (shave soap, oil, and badger hair brush) and this blade really does let you get things done right.    For new people who are wanting to try this: I shave once a day, every day. I have what I would consider above average facial hair thickness (in terms of actually hair thickness, density, and in growth speed). I, personally, have to use the lubricant oil or this gets to be a bit much for me. Things to remember: the first few shaves you will cut yourself. Get a styptic pencil (which stings like a son of a gun but stops the bleeding on contact) and build in some extra time in your routine until you get this down. It took me a full week to really figure out my face and neck shape/contours, as well as the best angle of attack of the blade itself, to get the best shave. I can get so close that at 4 in the afternoon (after having shaved at 7 in the morning) I still have a damn smooth face and neck. I NEVER had that from the old razors.    If you are going back and forth, I would suggest you give this a try. I do not regret this purchase at all. Or the fact that I purchased 50 blades (which seem to last me a little over a week i.e. the same as any major brand blade) for all of $32.50 + S&amp;H. For me, not only is this a financially awesome change up, but the quality is far superior as well.    Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Exellent Safety Razor recommended</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. In the long run it will save me money and in the short run it&#x27;s very gentle on my skin. My skin always felt irritated after shaving with my Mach 3 Turbo, and has never felt like that with this. I looked up some how to videos on YouTube to get started. I shave after my shower and have tried olive oil, only water, and Aveeno lotion as shaving cream (I didn&#x27;t want to dry my face with soap, or get sucked into buying expensive products for a cost efficient razor). For me, the aveeno lotion works the best, although the olive oil, and only water work real good as well. It will take a couple times to get used to, but is hard to cut yourself with (I haven&#x27;t got cut yet). I looked into different razors, but wanted to get a quality one, many sites said this was the best. The short handle was easy to convert to.</li>
            <li> Nice construction. I would buy the long handled one if I bought again.&lt;br /&gt;It does not give you a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;I have a very thick coarse beard and dull out the expensive 3 blade disposables after three shaves and often had cuts and nicks and a sensitive area on the neck would also bleed.&lt;br /&gt;It is not as forgiving as a disposable and with this product I am bleeding and cutting myself at least twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;I am saving money though.</li>
            <li> Since I hate wasting money and using plastic products, I had to find an alternative to the disposable razor or disposable razor head. My father had what I call an old fashion double-sided razor and I remember cutting myself with it as a curious kid so I was scared to try the double edge. After doing research, I decided on heavy double sided razor with the safety feature and a screw down top versus butterfly (read butterfly becomes loose and unsafe).  It took a few practice runs on my legs before I hit the bikini zone and wow what a great shave. No cuts, smooth finish or extremely efficient and safe. If it your first time using the razor, I recommend watching a \\&quot;how do use\\&quot; video online. I first I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like the short handle but it makes easy to maneuver in the groin area. I love my Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor.</li>
            <li> I will never shave with a cartridge ever again! Worth every penny and will last you a lifetime. I picked up some Personna blades to go along with this and it certainly is a great combination. Just buy it already!</li>
            <li> I kept wondering why people were singing the praises of the Merkur 34c.  Being a Edwin Jagger DE89 kelvin user ithought i had found the perfect razor.  I had no idea what the 34c was hiding.  The blade gaps and exposure look identical to the DE 89 but in use the Merkur just feels more in control.  In trouble areas like under the nose or the sensitive sides of the chin the angles just seem to lock in.  It may be what people say, its slightly more aggressive.  But with practice aggressive isnt a bad thing.  I usually have to go against the grain on my chin and cheeks to get a good shave.  To my surprise they were already smooth after a cross grain pass.  With the Merkur a 3rd pass is just for clean up.&lt;br /&gt;As for design I love the 2 piece approach.  There is nothing wrong with the 3 piece razors but i always felt like i could use another finger or two when loading.  The Merkur head just balances on a towel ya drop the blade bring over the handle and tighen the base and its done.  With my Astra blades there was no need to center the blade it was already there.  Will try with personnas in a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Merkur!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Merkur 34c plus personna blades makes against the grain passed unnecessary. One with and one across plus a small touch up on chin and sideburns and I&#x27;m on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added thought. As one of those sensitive skin guys with random hair growth south of the Adams apple I finnaly figured out my mistake. Hopefully this will help a few others out there.  I had always gotten a little irritation in the area mentioned. The answer was simple. More lather!  I would load my brush and never thought of hitting the soap again in later passes resulting in weak watery lather in the touch up 3rd pass. Try relathering on the puck or bowl each pass and that last pass will be as gentle as the first.</li>
            <li> Great Razor!  I would definitely recommend the purchase of the razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the futur for a few years and although that is a great razor, I found it bulky and couldn&#x27;t keep from cutting myself a few times every week.  It&#x27;s probably operator error, but it was getting old, man.  I almost considered getting some cartridges so I could get a comfortable shave when I was in a rush.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased the HD. It provides a very comfortable shave. Short length is not an issue for me. I feel very confident that I will not cut myself while using it.  This is the perfect everyday razor.  It looks great on its stand in my little man corner on the bathroom counter. It is definitely not as close of a shave for me as the futur, but still very good.  Pair this with the 1904 open, which gives me a closer shave than the HD, and you have 2 similar razors that feel a bit different and will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Best you can get.&lt;br /&gt;All German...</li>
            <li> Never use a cartridge razor again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to perfect my shaving technique to allow for this safety blade. The thick head, however, prevents me from getting at the hairs that grow directly underneath my nose. Often, when trying to shave this area, I will inexplicably cut my nose—which bleeds profusely. I&#x27;m not sure if other men have more room between their nose and where their facial hair starts growing, but this razor does not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I need to decide whether to try to find a safety razor with a slimmer head or to go back to disposable razors . . . .</li>
            <li> This razor is a great upgrade to the no name brand safety razor sold by the giant retailers.  I got a very close shave with no nicks.  I think the precision machining on this razor makes the difference.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a great razor for accomplishing a great close shave.</li>
            <li> First time using a safety razor, and I have to say this razor is awesome. Works well and is well weighted. I will say, if you&#x27;re worried about it being too small I&#x27;d go with a larger razor.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I own one and bought this as a gift for someone new to shaving.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve spent the last 17 years of my life shaving with whatever the local supermarket had to offer. After becoming increasingly frustrated with the cost of the name-brand \\&quot;Super Ultra 16-Blade\\&quot; razor cartridges, the speed with which said razors seem to dull, and the questionable shave quality that even those new razors provide, I decided to do some serious research into finding a \\&quot;proper\\&quot; shaving tool. Most educated opinions pointed to a Merkur safety razor as one of the finest razors money can buy, so I took a chance and ordered the 34C.    I purposely didn&#x27;t shave for a week and a half and sported the \\&quot;bum\\&quot; look while awaiting my new razor. When it finally arrived I promptly fired up a scalding hot shower while visions of the perfect shave danced in my head. The first thing I noticed about the Merkur is how solid it is. This is a professional instrument and makes my 16-blade plastic-clad supermarket razor look like a toy (although it most certainly is not a toy; kids, don&#x27;t play with razors!). The Merkur&#x27;s double-edged razors are extremely sharp and the 34C clamps them firmly in place. After shaving the 10-day old wild growth off of my face I can assuredly say that this is the razor I&#x27;ve been looking my entire life.    Here&#x27;s the great thing about this razor: When you you run it over your face (without much pressure applied due to the comfortable weight of the razor) the hair that was once on your face is no longer on your face(!). In addition, it doesn&#x27;t leave your face a bloody, burned mess. What it does leave behind is ultra-smooth, unmolested skin. I think that is just about everything you could ever want from a razor. It didn&#x27;t wash my car or make me a batch of Julienne fries, so I was sort-of disappointed about that, but what are you going to do.    They really should issue a Merkur razor to young men as they enter puberty. This is an excellent product that is worth every penny. If your current shaving situation leaves you feeling less-than-satisfied as mine did, then you absolutely won&#x27;t regret picking one of these up.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described. Its a quality unit and has good weight and balance to it. The only drawback to this unit (and to this type of shaving) is that you need about a 30 degree angle on the blade and its impossible to get that under your nose. So I have to get another razor out to get that last little bit of whiskers under the nostrils. Other than that its a great buy!</li>
            <li> I have a bad combination as far as shaving is concerned. Which is really dense and thick facial hair with soft and sensitive skin. The first time I shaved with a cartridge razor I ended up with a huge cut on the side of my chin, and I still have the scar from it. Then when my neck line kept getting lower I realized that I was nicking myself in a line across my neck. I found out that my whiskers actually reverse direction half way down the shaving area of my neck. I tried compensating for it using the cartridge razor by flipping it along that line, and the mach 3 kept slicing me open. I experimented with other cartridge brands to no avail. So for a while I gave up on shaving and just trimmed my beard. Then I got back into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I tried an electric shaver. I found it irritating without getting close. Times it would yank my hairs out by the follicles and result in ingrowns. I started to lose hope on finding a good shaving method. Then I saw a video of DE shaving, and decided to order this Merkur razor. Since this was kind of a trial I decided not to order a traditional kit and opted to continue using canned cream with extra moisturizer. To my surprise it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loaded this thing up with a Personna (blue box) and got going. Finding the correct angle was a little tricky, but once I got it, it worked awesome. It cut those whiskers off like butter without irritating my face like the cartridge or the electric razor. I barely nicked myself in a few different spots but since it only happened on the across and against passes, I figured I&#x27;d just have to change up my routine. The second time using this, I went with two with the grain passes (even on the second it was still cutting some whiskers), and then one across the grain on only my face. The result: nearly BBS shave with no blood or no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it leaves my face feeling a little tight and dry until I apply my home made aftershave lotion. I&#x27;m going to switch to traditional shaving soap or cream with the brush and mug which will improve the experience a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes: You can use this thing with pressurized can shaving cream, it works good except it clogs quickly. Instead of bearing down like you would with a cartridge, rinse this thing out. You have to go slower than a cartridge blade, and feel the blade. You want it to barely touch, if you feel too much pressure, pull off, rinse and start where you left off; if you feel it&#x27;s not even, just turn the handle a little. Whatever you do don&#x27;t push down on the blade.</li>
            <li> First time buying and using a DE Razor.  Others have recommended this particular Merkur as one of the best.  My experience with saftey razors is limited, but it is a great razor.  I used to use Mach 3 (I shave both head and face) but they are getting to expensive.  Long term, this is much, much cheaper.  You can find razor blades for as little as 10 cents here or on ebay.  This does a great job, but there is a learning curve.  Go slow and let the weight of the razor do the job.  Be patient and in no time you will have as close as a shave as a Mach 3 for less money.  Also, use shaving oil - much better than shaving cream (which is bad for the skin).</li>
            <li> This is a non aggressive razor. Which is exactly what I was looking for when I started DE shaving 4 months ago. I pair it with a super sharp blade, (Feather) and I get close shaves without carving my face up. The razor is well made and has a simple 2 piece design. Changing a blade is a snap, This is just a great razor and I use it everyday with a 3 pass shave.</li>
            <li> this was my first DE razor and is still one of my favorites!!! it is a great beginner razor but still gets close with the right angle it is tough to beat this razor</li>
            <li> Everyone online that I read or watched reviews from seemed to consider this the gold-standard. As this is my first DE razor, I love it! It feels solid and balanced in the hand, and gives a great shave experience.</li>
            <li> Happy i gave up Mach 3s.  I was like the many folks out there dulling up mach 3s and then dreading having to pay for new cartridges.  It&#x27;s not that I can&#x27;t afford them but I just don&#x27;t think a shave should cost what they want to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it a cheaper method, but the shaves come out a lot better and closer.  The only downside is that it takes a little longer to shave and change blades versus mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: use the weight of the the Merkur razor to cut your hair - don&#x27;t apply much force, stretch your skin while shaving, shower or wash your face with warm water prior to shaving (open pores), don&#x27;t use any chemicals after a shave, just cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, use feather razors, but they&#x27;re super sharp, so be careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using multi-blade razors for years. Just recently I decided to try a safety razor to save money on blades. Just received my 34c about a week ago. WOW, what a difference! I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Anyone who is thinking of making the switch, it is so worth it. Not just because it will save you money but you&#x27;ll get a better shave. Be sure to try different blades. What may work for me may not work for you. Good luck with your search.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that this razor has been raved as the best go to razor by wet shavers all across the board. It&#x27;s a solid simple razor, nicely weighted, grips beautifully, and almost as easy as using a disposable. It may look intimidating but you most likely will not get cut, at the very worst, you&#x27;ll get razor burn. When you first use it, you&#x27;ll get a great shave but not as close as you would with a straight razor; I honestly thought that my product was defective as I got closer shaves by slightly loosening the head *Bad Idea!!!* As it turns out, Shaving with a safety razor is all about beard reduction through succeeding passes, not removal. Choosing the right angles will make or break the shave, I go for a 30 degree angle, than I try to get as low of an angle as possible to perform baby face shaves. Be sure to try out various blades to see which one is right for you as they are not all created equal *I just went with Persona since they were pretty cheap but I wished that I did a variety sample blade pack but oh well, they perform nicely anyways.* As you shave more and more, you&#x27;ll get better shaves as you&#x27;ll start to have a feel of the right angles. Surly, the only thing that disposables razors like the Mach 3 and Schick Quattro have going for them is that they&#x27;re able to automatically contour to every pivot of your face; the learning curve of shaving with the 34C or probably any other safety razor depends on the person but it may take you about 8 to 10 shaves to start getting baby faced smoothness. However, when you consider that it&#x27;s all metal, the blades are easily changeable, easily recyclable, much cheaper, you&#x27;ll be getting a straight razor close shave without the headache of stropping, servicing, oiling, and honing. Blades are usually dirt cheap even for high quality ones. As I shave about three days a week, changing the blade after three shaves, a set of 100 persona blades could easily last me two yeras!!! Sharpening is just as easy as unscrew, pop off, insert, and tighten. This is a very good buy!!! It&#x27;ll save you time, hassle, and money. This is coming from a person who use to use a Dovo Best Quality Straight Razor; straight razors give fantastic shaves *quite possibly the best* but you&#x27;ll need the time, patience, and skill for maintenance and upkeep; it&#x27;s also more expensive up front as you&#x27;ll have to buy a strop, stones, oil, etc. You&#x27;ll also have to become an expert in knife sharpening, otherwise, you&#x27;ll have to send your blade to get serviced. When my safety razor dulled up due to poor stropping technique, I used a Dovo Shavette with interchangeable straight razor blades, it gave baby face shaves but it was dangerous and made shaving feel like a deliberate chore; changing blades was also cumbersome. With the 34C however, I&#x27;m so eager to shave everyday!!! I&#x27;ll still go back to Straight Razor shaving but I&#x27;m only doing it for novelty sake to be frankly honest. In my opinion, this should be the modern way to shave., and tighten. This is a very good buy!!! It&#x27;ll save you time, hassle, and money.

            <li> The Quality is there but, the handle is way too short. It&#x27;s hard to tell from the picture when yoou are looking at it but, I wish I purchased the one with the longer handle.</li>
            <li> excellent shave and easy to learn the correct form. I will never go back to using cartridges. my in grown hairs and bumps have all disappeared, and this shaves with no effort. (pushing is bad) just let the weight of this razor do its job.</li>
            <li> I get a real close shave with the Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor #34C.  I first I cut myself, but after a few shaves I got the hang of it.  Its comfortable and my skin &amp; face look great.  Its easy to clean and change blades.  The ladies notice the difference about my face.  Thank you Merkur!</li>
            <li> A little disappointed in that stem is not as long as I would prefer, but well built and has a little heft to it as I prefer this type of razor.</li>
            <li> This is NOT your grandpa&#x27;s razor - but he wishes it was.  Like many men, I get ingrown hairs on my face when shaving with the typical 2-10 blade trendy razors you see on commercials.  Sure, you get a close shave with those expensive cartridge-based deals, but you&#x27;re scraping a couple layers of skin off and getting bumps the next day, which when you shave them, bleed.  Maybe not everyone has this problem, but I sure hate it.    Enter safety razors, stage right.  Ever since switching a few years ago, I cringe at the thought of going back.  In general, these will give a close shave, at an incredible price (pennies for a blade replacement if you buy the \\&quot;Sharp\\&quot; brand - my favorite), and precision typically found in the straight razor.    For the genre, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Merkur - solid construction, exact-fitting parts that keep a tight fit throughout its life.  Some people go with the \\&quot;butterfly\\&quot; opening, but I find the mechanics of that style get gummed up with soap and hard-water sediments.  This razor does not have that problem, as it comes apart into two pieces - the handle, with a non-removable threaded nut at the bottom, and the highly-polished top part which secures and angles the blade, attached to a long bolt that fits down into the handle to be screwed down.    That nut at the bottom is what makes this one stand out among some of the others - it allows for easy disassembly, safe removal/replacement of the blade and maintains a solid feel to the whole razor.  The short overall length is something you might have to get used to, but is perfectly balanced to allow you to shave with minimal pressure.  I love the portability this size provides.    Overall, one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> Like you could go wrong with the benchmark of DE razors (in my book at least). Superior build quality (actually I feel a little better than my Futur at twice the price). Excellent razor for beginners and pros alike. Close shave, and über forgiving (even with a Feather in it) in case you get a like sloppy, or rushed! My  go-to razor when I&#x27;m trying anything new (blades, creams, soaps, etc....) because it&#x27;s that consistent. Never a variable. Killer price for a razor that should be in any wet shavers arsenal.</li>
            <li> The classic. I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough. I would give it a couple more stars if I were able.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mild shave with a great two piece design. Very heavy but well balanced.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using a Mach 3, Quattro, Fusion, you&#x27;re probably a sucker. You bought into the advertisements and price war just like they wanted you to. Are you upset? I would be. It&#x27;s ok, I was a sucker too. There&#x27;s an old expression: if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it. That goes for razors. Too many blades does nothing more than drive up your monthly expenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ponied up and invested in this Merkur. Freakin&#x27; old school. This is not a shaver, this is a tool, to be respected and cared for. Honestly, the transition to Shaving The Right Way with this Merkur was easy. No nicks or cuts, just take your time and apply less pound-force (Telling people to apply less &#x27;pressure&#x27; is a misnomer: the pressure is the same, but we are working with less blade area, so it is the force that matters as Pressure&#x3D;Force/Area) - the weight of the razor will do the work. The shave is better and the blades last longer and are dirt cheap to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note, however, that TSA isn&#x27;t quite as fond of the device as myself. They will make you dispose of the safety blades before entering an airport terminal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,</li>
            <li> An awesome razor, exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> Only giving this one star for visibility, because I want others like me to know what they&#x27;re buying when they get a safety razor, especially those with thick coarse facial hair. After getting tired of spending a fortune on cartridge razors which give sub-par shaves I decided to get a safety razor, and this decision was based on numerous reviews that these things will give you the best shave of your life with little risk of cutting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I loaded it up, got nice and lathered and began shaving. I made one pass and some hairs were shaved off, but a lot remained. So I made a second pass, more hairs removed but many still remained. I&#x27;m thinking at this point that something is wrong with the razor, my technique, the blade itself. I made several passes over the same area to remove all the hairs. After all was said and done there remained random hairs sticking out where I had just shaved with this thing, so I googled tutorials on how you&#x27;re supposed to shave with this thing. Turns out making numerous passes is normal with these types of razors, and that re-lathering &amp; re-shaving is something you&#x27;re supposed to do. It&#x27;s also recommended to go against the grain, which I never do as in-grown hairs are a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A safety razor is the same as a cartridge razor but with only one blade.Then I realized there&#x27;s a reason the multi-blade cartridge razors were invented, because men got tired of having to make several passes to shave their faces clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want my advice on how to get the absolute best shave? Get a straight razor and learn to use it. You&#x27;ll never look back, I know I haven&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note that this razor I&#x27;m reviewing was in great condition, beautiful finish, and nice and weighty. Overall a fantastic razor, if you like using safety razors.</li>
            <li> I like the smooth clean shave this provides.  The handle is shorter than i expected.  It is easy to clean and i really like it.</li>
            <li> Nice to get back to the older style!👍🏾</li>
            <li> The best razer ive ever used.no nicks!!!</li>
            <li> After shaving for years with a conventional \\&quot;multi-blade\\&quot; razor, I was becoming increasingly frustrated. Shaving has always been unpleasant and I avoided it when ever possible. Moving into a new job that required me to stay much more clean shaven meant having to having to suffer through it even more frequently, which was something I was not looking forward to.    Enter the traditional wet shave. Proper technique with a good lather and safety razor has given me consistently smooth, clean shaves (my wife approves greatly of them) without the constant irritation and shaving bumps. The Merkur safety razor is an excellent razor for anyone wanting to get started with more traditional shaving. It has a very solid feel and good weight, and paired with a good razor blade (there are many to choose from, so find one that works for you) results in a very satisfying shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday. Best piece of kit I own!  Every man should own one.</li>
            <li> amazing razor , if you use the platinum tip blades , you will get the best shave every , i had the Gillette fusion and and its incredible how expensive the razors are , you will be saving alot of money by switching to this razor , you can get 100 blades that will last you years just for 30 bucks... best purchase i ever made ,</li>
            <li> Classic German . Great For the $$. great way to shave</li>
            <li> This product not only does not provide a shave, it is dangerous.</li>
            <li> Find yourself good blades and never look back</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. Just a hunk of metal with three parts. Reliable, nicely weighted, does the job. Classic. The razor leaves a large space open between the blade and the guard bar so that this razor never gets clogged and is always easy to clean by just running water over it or shaking it under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I knock off a star? Workmanship. The design is flawless but the production is not. My razor was over machined, and the top part isn&#x27;t square and curves toward the edge. It doesn&#x27;t seems to be enough to affect the quality of the shave, but when paying this much for a razor, I think it should be built right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to watch out for: when I last looked this up on Amazon, the folks who have this listed at the #34C charge $50 but the people listing this as the 178 charge around $32, shipping inclusive! They are the same thing; #34C is Merkur&#x27;s designation, 178 is the designation by the American company that imports and distributes them. So, just pick the one with the cheaper price and buy from a reputable seller. Knock-offs abound these days and I would think a razor like this would be a ripe target.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing razor and my purchase of it completes a journey back to using a DE razor. I once had an old DE razor that belonged to my grandfather, but eventually followed the big razor companies as they added 2 and 3 blades. I have been frustrated with the 2 giant razor companies&#x27; prices for many years, and the continual addition of more blades seemed ridiculous to me, especially when the companies discontinued their old models, which worked as well or better than the new ones. When the price of new cartridges became almost equal to the price of this highly recommended razor, I bought one, about 6 months ago. It has been great, especially when using a brush, Proraso shaving cream, and Feather blades. The shave is as close as any shave I have ever had with only two tiny nicks in 6 months. Get rid of whatever 4 and 5 blade nonsense you have and buy this quality tool. There&#x27;s no school like the old school</li>
            <li> This is my favorite DE razor. I have both this and the Edwin Jagger DE89, which I rarely use anymore. The size, weight and feel of this razor is perfect. I also prefer the way you change the blade on this razor compared to the DE89. If you&#x27;re just starting out like I was about a year ago then this razor would by my choice. Paired with the Shark blade I get a smooth close shave with no irritation every time. I&#x27;ve never even nicked myself with this combo</li>
            <li> This puppy is great. The perfect weight and balance provides an incredible shave. I have large hands but even though it is short it performs flawlessly. For me just letting it rest on my face and applying just a tad of pressure gives me the perfect shave. Easy to maneuver around my upper lip and chin and those tight areas. I use this everyday except for when I am in a real hurry, then I use an electric razor, but it does not come close to the shave I get using this razor. Pair it up with a nice badger hair brush and some Taylor of Old Shaving cream and you will be shaving like your grand dad. The blade that comes with it is ok but I mainly now use Derby blades. They work best for me.</li>
            <li> Get the shave soap, badger brush, and merkur 34c shaving tool, and be prepared to feel like a total bas a$$ after you shave.  Received this as a gift from my wife, and I can&#x27;t be happier.  It costs a little bit to get started, but after the initial investment, you&#x27;ll get plenty of return with the cost of razors.</li>
            <li> So far so good it&#x27;s my first DE razor so I dont have anything to compare it to. I like it just fine I would like it to be a bit heavier thats all.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for when I travel because it&#x27;s a bit smaller than the \\&quot;Barber Pole\\&quot; one I use at home.  They are both great razors and will easily shave as close as the multiblade vibrating twin overhead cam 16 valve models at a quarter of the price.  If your not using a safety razor, your wasting your money!  Unless of course your using a straight razor.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor and it works well for me. One note is that the handle is a short one, so if you have large hands you should look for a razor with a regular sized handle.</li>
            <li> Love it. this is the second safety razor I have tried. I like the fact it is Stainless Steel so it will not rust. the last safety razor I had the end that unscrews got striped out and the razor was useless. I like the design of how the blade sits in there, the last razor I had the framework would scrape you. overall this razor is easy to use, and not irritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month with no issues. It feels solidly built!</li>
            <li> Great product, love the weight. With nice blades gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you&#x27;ve never used a straight razor or a double edged one like the Merkur.  Very close shave.  Heavy weight in the handle has a real nice feel to it.  Because it is double-edged you get twice as many shaves as with any disposable.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted a razor with a short or long handle, but am glad I went with this one with a short handle. I love the close shave it provides and how it is so easy to use!</li>
            <li> Picked this up after reading all the good reviews. So far, it does not disappoint. Good weight, looks slick, and the blades are super easy to change out.</li>
            <li> Good shave but I expected a little more. I read all of the hype, that was my first mistake. But, all in all I am happy with the purchase. Excellent quality razor. Solid and very well built.  Handles well. Feels hefty in my hand. I would make the purchase again but do not expect a &amp;#34; baby&#x27;s bottom shave&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Razor here, hair gone</li>
            <li> Used this about 5 times then bought a Schick Hydro. The Schick gives me a lot better and smoother shave.</li>
            <li> Bought this because of all the recommendations and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It took me about a minute or two to get the hang of the angle and the short handle, but came away with the best and closest shave on my first try.  I used normal barbasol and nothing else and it was great, bet it&#x27;s a much better shave with all the fancy soaps and brushes.      Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend it.  I don&#x27;t have anything else to compare it to, but it&#x27;s definitely exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Wow. I used to use a butterfly clasp DE Razor as it is faster to change blades, but it broke. The Merkur&#x27;s design will last forever and never break and the shave is PERFECT. No nicks or cuts, yet shaves close. Better than the other aggressive slant. And worth paying the money for. Don&#x27;t buy a cheaper razor.  Also I quickly got used to the short handle and actually like it now.</li>
            <li> Just finished my first DE Safety Razor shave with the 34C, very gentle on the skin, didn&#x27;t get any cuts but was left with an awesome shave after two passes. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor.  I like that it&#x27;s small, it&#x27;s very easy to replace blades (you just unscrew the bottom part and the head plate comes off), it looks very nice, and the shaves seem very good. I&#x27;ve been using it for months now. Definitely a good starter razor.</li>
            <li> This thing works every bit as well as a Fusion or Mach 3 once you know what you&#x27;re doing (pass WTG then ATG).  It also uses much cheaper blades.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I grew up in an age of electric razors and have never known anything different. After buying this razor, a beaver brush, and shave soap, I can&#x27;t believe we&#x27;ve become so lazy as a society to ever switch to something different. One pass with the grain and a second against gives me a shave as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> This is a quality razor for a very fair price. I would highly recommend this safety razor to anyone. Nice finish and fit.</li>
            <li> You realize that when you first pick it up. It&#x27;s heavy. It&#x27;s machined to hold the blade square to the rest of the razor. It has no frills, just function.     Having decided to go the double edge route I researched to find the best &#x27;starter&#x27; razor that would last and perform without fail. I found it. This razor has a substantial presence in the hand. It&#x27;s weight and balance make it ideal for gliding down my face with no pressure needed from me. It&#x27;s simple construction makes it durable and reliable. Although it is not adjustable this &#x27;feature&#x27; actually promotes good technique. Once you learn the correct angle it becomes intuitive.    I have used disposable razors for 40 years and will not go back. I get a much better shave, less irritation, and I&#x27;m spending a lot less on blades compared to the other &#x27;systems&#x27; out there. A slight learning curve and a little practice will free you from the outrageous expense of disposables, and with better results! The Merkur Heavy Duty (34C) is a great place to start your education and your liberation!</li>
            <li> Expecting butterfly type, but works good</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve read all of the reviews prior to this one, they are all correct!!!  It is by far the best shave that I&#x27;ve ever had.  I&#x27;m not really sure if it is the razor or if it is just DE shaving (Double Edge shaving).  When I first received the razor, I had really high hopes after reading all of the reviews.  I will tell you that it did not disappoint.  I wake-up in the morning and I can&#x27;t wait to shave.  I know this sounds crazy but it is soooo true.     I would not hesitate in recommending this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> My favorite razor so far!</li>
            <li> Light weight and small.</li>
            <li> Well made, good weight. no problems with it at all. Only thing I wish is that I had switched over to DE shaving a long time ago. Best shave I have ever had in my life, and I absolutely hate shaving before switching over. Now I look forward to it.</li>
            <li> I have been using #34C for almost two months, and I find it very easy to maneuver on my face. I can grow a full beard with sideburns, and the weight of the blade alone can shave off hairs with no tugging or any unpleasant feelings. As long as you are not applying extra force, it is unlikely that you will cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of durability, I think I did an okay job. I always take the blade out after shave, and place both the blade and the razor handle on a folded paper towel, That way, you can keep your razor handle and blades dry, preventing razor from getting rusty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is in two pieces. To put on the blade, you simply slide the blade under the outer cover of the razor, and then fasten the handle to its cover by twisting the bottom of the razor. The tighter you twist, the more likely you can break the handle (just like when you put too much force to tighten a screw, and it screws up the thread). Other than that, it is a perfect little handle that shall last you for ages.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my supply of Gilette Mach-3 cartridges and realized that their prices have jumped yet again. While the actual price is about the same as the price of a moderately expensive drink @ Starbucks I still do not think it is anywhere close to reasonable and decided to investigate other alternatives. This razor is very solidly made and a pleasure to use even though I personally prefer the handle to be a bit longer like [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]]. I am using it with my regular shaving Gel after a hot shower and it works fine but you do need to be more careful compared to the normal cartridge razors to not nick yourself. If you are going to purchase this and stop giving in to the Gilette rip-off I highly recommend investing in a styptic pencil to take care of the inevitable nicks and small cuts (esp. if you are careless or try to shave in a hurry) [[ASIN:B00112WRB6 Pinaud Styptic Pencil 0.25 oz pencil]]. The package says it comes with 5 blades while in reality it has 6 blades (5 [[ASIN:B001G5FOLI 10 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]]and 1 [[ASIN:B000NCMMBA Merkur Double Edge Safety Razor Blades- 3 Pack of 10 Blades]]). I have used both the blades so far. While the Feather blades are sharper (more nicks) but the Merkur blade is fantastic and lasted me about 10 days without any issues. Your mileage may vary based on personal preference and skin type. My cartridge cost has gone down from $4.00 a month to $1.50 a month and I am getting a smoother shave with a new blade every 10 day. Your savings might be higher or lower depending on how often you change your blades. I highly recommend this if you are tired of cartridge systems and are willing to spend 1 minute more every day shaving (due to the fact that you need to be more careful).</li>
            <li> This is a good DE razor, meets my needs. Just one thing as you shave since it has a slick top it tends to get dried out and the blade does not flow smoothly. Other than that it does fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for shaving in the \\&quot;bikini line\\&quot; so they call it.Being a teen(guy) with somewhat sensitive skin, this provided a very quick shave.Even though hair down there is much thicker than  the beard or any other area of the body, this single blade trimmed it down quickly.Its highly recommended to use good shaving soap(Proraso sapone)and a prep before the shave to prevent ingrown hairs/razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of people saying they got horrible nicks and cuts, I began shaving first try no cuts(small whiskers on beard), and really got the hang of it the second time in the \\&quot;bikini area\\&quot; without loosing a golf ball.One thing I will say, you need to constantly use soap/lather!Every time your cutting hair(if hair is about 1/2 inch), you WILL need to rinse your blade, which will lead to soap removal.{This is normal, but for the region we are working in this will be enforced a bit more}.Saying so, go to the shower and have about 2 hours extra of time before you do any activities.Start by trimming hair with scissors as short as possible.Apply some soap, let it sit for about a minute(if you got time, do 5) reapply soap and then begin shaving with a small stream of water turned on to remove hair from the razor.Afterwards,take a shower and pat dry, apply a thin layer of neosporin/triple antibiotic and let it adsorb meanwhile you dry everything else.After that, apply something like Aveeno or a natural cream that doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance or alcohol(I just used Lubriderm daily moisture) and let that soak in(if you have a non-alcoholic after shave,its the time to use it).Finally,put something on that&#x27;s loose(boxers,soft panties) and made of cotton to prevent irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everybody is different, but give it a try if you have tried shaving and you always end up with razor burn or just started shaving.Who knows, this strategy just might work for you.Thanks for reading :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade type: Merkur sample blade</li>
            <li> Worked from the first time. Thanks good razor.</li>
            <li> Going back to the old fashioned safety razor has been the best decision I have made. The quality is excellent and it gives me a shave that is as good if not better than the high priced Mach 3&#x27;s. I will never go back to paying $40 for razor blades!!!</li>
            <li> This is amazing! Why did we leave shaving with these, when they are a far superior shave to modern razors? If you are looking at buying this model you have probably read or watched a handful of reviews about how grand this safety razor is and I agree, albeit I have nothing but modern razors for comparison. It comes with one Merkur blade.</li>
            <li> This is my 1st DE razor so I have nothing to compare it to, but so far its been great. Bought a pack to 100 razors for about $10.</li>
            <li> Ultimate beginners razor and blade. If your new to wet shaving, this is the way to start of. Good quality and craftsmanship at an awesome deal! The art of shaving version cost $60-$80 without the blades. Def your money&#x27;s worth. The perforated handle provides good grip even when your hands are wet and soapy from the shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as using the razor, there is a learning curve to it. Shave at 30 degree angle and remember you move your arm as your wrist is locked in place. Think of your face as different planes and shave them: .5 inch to an inch of each plane. Remember it is a double edge so use the other side of the blade as well. Also you can&#x27;t shave a beard in one pass with this razor. Depending on your beard type it might take 3-4 passes. Don&#x27;t be afraid to re lather. The merkur blades are good for about 3-4 shaves. I change my every 1 to 1/2 weeks, depending on how many times you shave in a week. TAKE YOUR TIME! In no time you will be enjoying and looking forward to your next wet shave.</li>
            <li> i bought this as a gift for my hubby. he has very thick facial hair and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I fully recommend this razor for either the beginner or experienced DE razor user.  The razor is sturdy, beautifully chromed, and has a nice hefty weight.  The short handle doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  It feels secure and well anchored in my hand.  As with any DE razor, preparation is key.  Best to shave right after a shower, use some pre-shave lotion or oil--Proraso or Art of Shaving makes some great products.  Even Noxema is a good option.  Work up a lather using a bar or shave cream and apply with a boar bristle or silvertip badger brush.  Learn how to shave with the grain of the hair on your face and then across the grain.  Only on rare occasions will you need to go against the grain.  Rinse off, use an alum bar or apply your favorite lotion or aftershave.  Baby face smooth.</li>
            <li> Sturdy build,comfortable and non slip grip.perfect curves of razor plate for every corner of face. It&#x27;s not the most beautiful thing on planet but it is definitely not ugly.</li>
            <li> The weight is substantial without being heavy.  The handle is length provides balance and dexterity.  The knurling on the handle provides excellent grip.  The simplicity of the two piece design is unparalleled.    This razor can give you a squeaky clean shave.  Moist, squeaky clean skin can become tacky.  The combed edge will not adhere to squeaky clean skin.  The smooth edge can, and will cause the razor jump or skid, resulting in a knick.  To avoid this:  1...angle the razor accordingly.  2...use shaving oil, 2 fl oz will last 3-6 months (3-5 drops per application is enough).    I use tea tree oil, which doubles as an antiseptic aftershave and moisturizer.  It can be purchased&#x60; here on Amazon for about $3 (but it is not in the \\&quot;pre shaving oils\\&quot; department).    ......  I started wet-shaving after my curly beard became too coarse for my electric foil razor.  After years of wet shaving with the modern multi-blade razors, I hated shaving.  Less than 1 day between shaves resulted in razor rash that would not go away for about 3 days.  More than 1 day between shaves resulted in snagging and cutting.  I always had razor burn and some degree of razor rash.    Since switching to DE Shaving:  I no longer have razor rash.  I can shave twice every day with no skin irritation if I want to.  My alcohol based aftershave does not burn (unless I let the blade get too dull).   I no longer have ingrown hairs constantly.  I can work and sweat in the summer heat without my neck and face stinging.  ......    All DE blades are not equal, and your mileage may vary.  Get a variety pack and try out a few different blades.</li>
            <li> Handle is short, hands ache. Recommend the longer handle razor. Awesome construction and build quality.</li>
            <li> wonderful clean shave.  I like how it doesn&#x27;t catch hairs.</li>
            <li> This razor is solid!  The fit is good however the finish is average.  It shaves nice and close and with comfort!</li>
            <li> I remember men in my past using one of these classic safety razors. I was getting tired of the throw away razors so I wanted to find a good safety razor. This one is exactly what I was wanting. It has a bit of weight so it feels great using it. Cleans up quickly. Good quality product. Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Ok for starters I was really shocked how small it really is.  It comes in a box that is not much bigger than a harmonica.  Overall I like the shaver, but I am so new to saving with a double edged razor I cannot say I love it.  I was kind of expecting to be able to jump into shaving with a double edged razor without much fuss, but it really is very different from cartridge razor shaving.  I used to shave in the shower with a little oil and be done in 5 mins or so... now it is a production, I tried with just oil in the shower to do a direct comparison and it is not a good method to try while learning it. :)</li>
            <li> My hubby is totally satisfied with this razor. He said it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Shaves fine. I own this and multiple razors. Great starter razor .</li>
            <li> This razor is great!  Makes shaving a breeze and feels like a proffessiona piece of equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Excellent razor!!  Best shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Edit 9/9/2014 ... It&#x27;s been a year and I still love this product!  I can go a week without shaving and this thing will shave like it&#x27;s the next day.  The wiskers just flow behing the razor and out without clogging up.  And the thing still looks beautiful after a year, like the day I received it.  I still like the shorter handle.  I&#x27;ve found that the trick is to use as soft a pressure as possible.  Get a good blade, the sharpest you can find, and let it do the work.  A short handle gives very nice control.  There are so many good things about this razor and the quality of the manufacturer.  What a refreshing thing to find these days!  One thing that I&#x27;ve learned is that the lotion is critically important.  Any razor can only be as good as the lotion.  So choose a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s beautiful and I&#x27;m glad that I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving with electric razors for 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;I have a tough beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WITH ELECTRIC&lt;br /&gt;It took me 5 minutes to shave electric.&lt;br /&gt;Frustrating due to missed hairs. Many passes needed.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes one little hair would have to be passed over 10 times.&lt;br /&gt;My face would look red and blotchy for an hour.&lt;br /&gt;If I went a couple days without shaving it was worse.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I&#x27;d go many days because I hated shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I tried many electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;They started out mediocre and went to worse as they wore out.&lt;br /&gt;Get a ok close shave to start, a month later it is not close.&lt;br /&gt;Hairs get pulled out, ouch.  Ingrown later, ouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY STORY&lt;br /&gt;Started looking to buy a new electric razor for another $200.&lt;br /&gt;Happened upon the Merkur #34C&lt;br /&gt;It was intruiguing.&lt;br /&gt;Bought it cause wanted something different.  $50 instead of $200.  No brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE RESULT&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE shaving with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Got some Personna and Feather blades and some good gel shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;The Feathers tug a little bit less, maybe.  Hard to tell a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Have nicked myself twice, little, like poked with a pencil.  No big deal. I pressed way too hard cause habit shaving with electric.&lt;br /&gt;Secret to not getting nicked is don&#x27;t press hard.&lt;br /&gt;Also use a sharp blade.&lt;br /&gt;Better blades keep blade from tugging.&lt;br /&gt;The blade is positioned perfectly to not nick, no worries.&lt;br /&gt;Let the blade do the work.&lt;br /&gt;Secret is use a medium pressure or light pressure.&lt;br /&gt;Number of passes hardly matters.&lt;br /&gt;Just use light pressure.  Good blade takes hair off like it&#x27;s just wiping off a layer of dust!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMPARISON TO ELECTRIC&lt;br /&gt;Time to shave is still only 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;No blotchy red face, can visit client imediately.&lt;br /&gt;No pain.&lt;br /&gt;Much closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;No pulled hairs.&lt;br /&gt;No ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Every new blade is like a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely inexpensive, unless you are destitute (but you probably don&#x27;t shave anyway).&lt;br /&gt;No frustration.&lt;br /&gt;Takes up very little space and looks nice sitting on counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy.t to not getting nicked is don&#x27;t press hard.  Also use a sharp blade.  Better blades keep blade from tugging.  The blade is positioned perfectly to not nick, no worries.  Let the blade do the work.  Secret is use a medium pressure or light pressure.  Number of passes hardly matters.  Just use light pressure.  Good blade takes hair off like it&#x27;s just wiping off a layer of dust!    COMPARISON TO ELECTRIC  Time to shave is still only 5 minutes.  No blotchy red face, can visit client imediately.  No pain.  Much closer shave.  No pulled hairs.  No ingrown hairs.  Every new blade is like a new razor.  Extremely inexpensive, unless you are destitute (but you probably don&#x27;t shave anyway).  No frustration.  Takes up very little space and looks nice sitting on counter.    CONCLUSION  Love it.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> Finally I have a real razor that can easily and smoothly cut my Barb Wire Wiskers. I tried all the \\&quot;new age\\&quot; razors that have very pricey replacement blades. I gave up. Then one day I thought of the old G.I. Joe razor. I looked it up online and the rest is history.  :o)</li>
            <li> It was just what he wanted for CHRISTmas!</li>
            <li> My husband has this razor and really likes it.  So does the rest of the family.  Our son kept stealing it so we got him his own for Christmas.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I an extremely happy with this razor! This razor gave me the closest shave that I have ever had with no irritation!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and well built. Love the short handle...makes it much easier to maneuver across the face. The only issue I have is keeping residue from building up on it. Would still recommend to anyone looking to make the switch from disposable.</li>
            <li> Razor works good, still learning how to shave with it. I like using sharp blades and that they are super cheap. And, I actually get a closer shave with this than i did with cartridge style razors. I have to say, its kinda fun shaving with an old timber type one too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to cartridge razors again. Paired with Feather blades - it&#x27;s been a revolution for me.</li>
            <li> If you are remotely considering making the switch to wet-shaving, or are already a wet shaver looking for an excellent razor, do yourself a favor and order this razor. Please note, if you are not familiar with safety razors, you need to take your time and excercise caution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard about the benefits of shaving with a double edge razor; so i decided to buy this one as soon as my $30 batch of Gillette blades ran out.  From a cost perspective, I stand to save money because the blade refills are bout $5 for 10; far less than what I was using before.  The razor and shaving experience is quite different than what I had been accustomed to.  Not that it was a bad thing.  But there was a short learning curve I had to get over (and a week or so of cutting my face up).  The razor itself is shorter than the standard stuff you see at your local CVS pharmacy.  You get used to that too. As soon as you master the shaving method, you will be quite pleased with the results.  I suggest coupling it with a higher quality shave cream.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd double edge safety razor I&#x27;ve purchased.  My first was a Weishi razor purchased on eBay.  I loved how protective it was but the butterfly-style blade mechanism started to seize up.  When I got tired of using a pliers to open my razor, I decided to switch to a trusted brand.  This 2-piece Merkur is much more dependable.  It did, of course, take a few days to adjust to the new razor.  The weight, blade angle, and aggressiveness were different than my previous razor, but I&#x27;m very happy with the product.  There is a slightly larger gap between the blade and safety rail, which allows the user to get a little closer but requires more precision.  For the record, I have eczema (not on my face, but the sensitivity of my face is clearly apparent), and I don&#x27;t have a water softener.  I currently filter the hard water before use, which is a less than stellar substitute for soft water.  Because of this, I notice a few more nicks than the average user (or than I did with the Weishi), but when I get a chance to shave in soft water, the improvement is significant.  For that reason, I think this product deserves the 5-star rating.  The blade you choose is also important, but it is unique to each user.  Take recommendations with a grain of salt and shop around until you&#x27;re happy.  I, personally, did not enjoy the Merkur blade included, and I have not yet tried the Feather blades that came with it.  I&#x27;ll wait until we move to a soft water home to judge what is supposedly the sharpest blade on the market.  I prefer Derby Extra, mostly for the price in comparison to the others.  The Dorco that came with my first razor also seemed rather forgiving, but I haven&#x27;t tried another one since.  Best of luck to those of you searching for your perfect combination!</li>
            <li> Thanks to everyone who had already posted reviews on this. I received mine this week and thanks to the videos on YouTube, have shaved twice with not one nick. It is a great beginner&#x27;s razor. Look no further, it is great. I will update later on if the chrome peeling others have experienced happens to me</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT RAZOR AND VERY EFFECTIVE! NOT MILD BUT NOT AGGRESSIVE, JUST IN THE MIDDLE. HANDLE IS SMALL BUT IT IS STILL VERY EFFECTIVE AND EASY TO USE WITH MY VERY LARGE HANDS. VERY HAPPY AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR FOR BEGINNERS AND PRO&#x27;S ALIKE!</li>
            <li> I had been using a Gillette Fusion razor for about 4 years before switching to this safety razor, and I am extremely happy with the choice. It is my first safety razor, and I can&#x27;t imagine switching back anytime soon.  Razor  I love the design of this razor. It is very classic, looks great in my bathroom, and feels great in my hand when I shave. The bottom of the razor unscrews so that the blade can be changed, and the stainless steel gives it a very solid feel that makes you think that this razor will be the last one I will every need to buy. BTW, it is a pretty small razor--can fit easily in the palm of my hand--which I see as a benefit for travelling, but that might make some want to get the long handled version.  Blade  There were actually 10 blades included in my order, even though it said 5 free blades. I am not sure how often to change the blades, but I remembered reading somewhere that if the blade feels like it is skipping over your skin or getting caught on hairs, it is probably time to put a new blade in. Since I don&#x27;t need to have a clean shaven face for work, I&#x27;ve been shaving about 4-5 times per month, and changing the blade at the end of each month. The razor case is great because you can just slide the used blade into the underside of the small case that the blades came in and then you toss them out when you&#x27;re done.   In terms of blade quality, the standard ones that came with the razor work fine for me. I&#x27;m sure there are other types of blades, and look forward to trying those out in the future.  Shave  The shave was great. It was much easier than I thought it would be. As long as you let the weight of the razor do the shaving, then you should have any issues. I did purchase a badger brush to lather my face, and I make sure to shave after I shower so the hair is as soft as possible. Much like getting a straight edge shave, the shave did not seem as close as I thought it should be, however, it seems to take longer for my facial hair to grow back. Furthermore, ingrown hairs and razor burn is non-existant. Not that it was a huge problem before, but I would always get one or two when using the Fusion.  Overall  I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase. Considering blades are something like 10 cents, I don&#x27;t think it will take that long to realize the savings of ditching cartridges. The shave is great, and is more of an enjoyable experience than it was with the Fusion. Getting the razor has changed shaving all together for me, and I think of it as more of a relaxing and enjoyable experience than before. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try to move onto straight edge razors as this is as good as a shave as I could ask for. Regardless of whether or not you choose this safety razor, definitely make the switch. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy my 34c from Amazon, rather a local store that sells razors and the sort. I just have to review it for those that are thinking about picking this little razor up. I have the Merkur 38c and love it! It has a longer handle and a bit more heft to it. Which makes it a little more aggressive than the 34c. This razor is great for beginners and pros alike! It shaves great, feels good in the hand and works great whether your clean shaving, maintaining neat lines of your goatee or mustache or keeping the neckline neat on your beard..this razor does it all! Great grip, decent heft, nice feel! 5 stars for sure! The only thing you should be doing right now is ask yourself why you haven&#x27;t bought this yet!!</li>
            <li> Great razor. Very smooth shave</li>
            <li> Okay, it&#x27;s been awhile now.  Almost a year.  I have learned a few things and don&#x27;t plan on ever going back to a modern razor.  I am a safety razor guy, now.  And I like it.  I bought the long handle, which I enjoy.  I like that it feels substantial.  It came with a Merkur blade.  I then tried Feathers.  Then Derby.  I came back to using the Merkur.  Maybe not a super sharp as Feathers, but I like how smooth they are.  I never feel like I have ripped up my face.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the Derby&#x27;s.  Too harsh for my taste.  The number one thing that seems to help is the shaving soap, cream.  Make sure you have a good one and almost any shave will be luxurious.  Sadly, even a normal blade feels better and closer with the right soap.  I have tried a few.  Proraso, Tom&#x27;s of Maine, Regular.  Tom&#x27;s of Maine was natural and the best for me, but was discontinued.  Proraso stings.  Too chemically for me.   So now I am looking for the right soap again.  But at least I found my razor.  This one.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. Simple to use and easy to clean. Gental on the face. I would tell a beginner to pick one up.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and I am loving this new-to-me but very-old-school style of shaving. I was worried that I would be driving to work with little pieces of bloody tissue on my face every morning, but it is actually easier to shave with this heavy yet tiny razor than the expensive disposables I used to use. It takes about the same amount of time and I very rarely nick myself. My skin feels healthier and I get less pimples. No looking back now!</li>
            <li> multi-blades are a gimmick! you only need one and this one is GREAT. Blades last a long time and wife says it&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve had. I shave in the shower and its a snap to rinse and clean. Love the short handle. 5 stars baby!!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and the recipient has had raving reviews of it. He said he loves the weight and quality of it and went from shaving once a week to every other day. He said his ingrown hairs have reduced a bit and his skin feels better.</li>
            <li> Cuts well and is not rusting! Fits all blades and never had any mechanical issues. Great purchase and considering buying these for a friends birthday.</li>
            <li> Save your money. Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It was delivered in a timely manner and just as described. Merkur is a great brand, never disappointed. it shaves great, far less irritation than the slant bar but equally as close.</li>
            <li> Started out using the &amp;#34;Pawn Stars&amp;#34; razor it was terrible. Almost gave up on this type of shaving then I decided to invest more money after reading the reviews here on amazon and let me say &amp;#34;Guys the Razor matters&amp;#34; This razor is like the gold standard in safety razor shaving! I am really happy with this razor and I appreciate the guys that take their time to do these reviews in a detailed manner.Thanks</li>
            <li> It does the job.  I fail to be overwhelmed by this razor and wet shaving, however, I am still using it and may become more pleased.  I still use my Mach 3 sometimes and don&#x27;t feel it is inferior to this Merkur.</li>
            <li> I was becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the quality of shave I was getting from the multi-blade shavers.  And electrics never quite cut it (pardon the pun), although they could be convenient in a pinch.  So I decided it might be worthwhile to go back to the old-school &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur #34C made me very glad I did!  I find I get a closer shave with this razor, and I&#x27;ve yet to nick myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t expect is that shaving somehow seems &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; now.  The process of opening a jar of shaving cream (mine is sandalwood, which is quite pleasant), brushing it on and creating a lather, then letting the blade do all the work cutting my beard is just a nice way to start the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I chose this particular model because a lot of people have mentioned that it&#x27;s a good way to start with a &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; (or double-edge, DE) razor.  I wouldn&#x27;t disagree with them.  Although someday I might get a model that provides a more aggressive shave (after I develop more skill using it), this razor is fine for me right now - and likely for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been done with name brand razors for years and dollar shave club is great but..........this is the way to go. One hundred blades will last me two years and it is the best deal. You don&#x27;t need three, four, or five blades. One good Soligen blade does it great. This is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the Merkur double-edge razor. It has been a very enjoyable shaving experience for me.</li>
            <li> I have a Merkur razor. The finish is flaking off and the handle retainer spring fell out. Merkur would not warranty the razor. They said I had \\&quot;bad water\\&quot;.  I have a 30 year old Gillete used in the same water. Guess what? No flaking. I will never buy another Merkur product. Don&#x27;t say I did not warn you!!!  Go to the Badger and Blade forums...search for thread or topic number 135882.  You will see may with this issue.</li>
            <li> Just a super razor, gets the job done with style and ease. Recommended to everyone that shaves!</li>
            <li> My first double edge razor. I will probably buy another one of these when my two boys get old enough to start shaving. The change from cartridges (Fusion) to double edge razor has not been as difficult as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> This is a good beginner razor, but at this price I would expect higher quality. The chrome on the top piece near the sharp edge pitted and came up allowing water to contact the metal underneath and created jagged sharp metal at the edges. It is now useless. I&#x27;ve heard of others this happening to as well.  I am looking elsewhere for a replacement.</li>
            <li> A fine German made razor that does a great job on my face!  It works well under the nose as well.  I liked it so much a bought a nice custom made travel bag for it that fits it PERFECT.  Toss in a couple extra packs of razors or anything else with this fine razor bag.  I bought the &amp;#34;Grizzly Leather&amp;#34; by WaterField Designs.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.sfbags.com/products/razor-case</li>
            <li> Great shave, but you really nee to shave slowly and with the grain or you will cut the hell out of yourself.</li>
            <li> Fantastic balance x great gnurled grip</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good, compact razor with good weight. However, I have the long handle &amp;#34;barber pole&amp;#34; Merkur and like it better.</li>
            <li> My first DE razor, so I cannot compare it to others, however I really do love it. After only ever using cartridge razors with the standard long handle, I was worried this would be too short to use comfortable. I&#x27;m happy I was wrong. It has a lot of weight to it, and feels very natural. The weight helps the shave because you don&#x27;t need to add any pressure. A sharp blade and a heavy razor do all the work for you. As a brand new DE user, this was very easy to learn on. I do recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> This is my first double edge razor. I&#x27;ve been using various cartridge razors my whole adult life. My current cartridge razor was the Gillette Fusion. I always had a hard time buying new blades for the Fusion. I mean, sometime like $30 for 8 blades is simply ridiculous. So, I wouldn&#x27;t shave very often to try to save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So, I searched for a cheaper solution and discovered the world of safety razors (also known as double edge razors). I bought this Merkur razor based on my research and now I can buy 100 double edge blades for as little as $10. Whereas 100 Fusion blades would be something like $375! What a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit worried about switching to a safety razor as I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d end up with all kinds of nicks. But, I&#x27;ve been using this for a month or so now and I must say, I love it! It&#x27;s a tad bit slower going as I&#x27;m being more careful than I would be with a cartridge razor, but the results are much better and I&#x27;ve only caused two tiny nicks. I probably actually nicked myself worse with the Fusion blades as I&#x27;d use the blades probably longer than I should because they were so expensive. With the cheap double edge blades, I don&#x27;t feel bad switching to new blades after 2 or 3 shaves with each edge of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this razor and I think more men need to reconsider using cartridge razors and try a safety razor!</li>
            <li> This is a great razor to start with if you want to see if this kind of shaving is for you, not very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried different blades over a two month period and still no luck I don&#x27;t think this is for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s short and heavy and that&#x27;s what I love about it. Some folks may find the length a little off putting, but after shaving with this for a year I would never go back to a disposable razor again. Great craftsmanship, and good looks to. It looks like a tool you would keep in your tool kit. Just rinse it well when your done with and let it air dry. I will occasionally put put a little oil on the threads over the weekend (I don&#x27;t shave but during the work week) just to keep them healthy. It does take some getting used to using one of these safety razors but once you get the hang of it and find a blade you like you will wonder why you didn&#x27;t switch sooner. As far as a shaving soap or cream, some folks will say you need to buy fancy brushes and soap. Save you some cash and just stick with your favorite canned cream. You get a good shave from these safety razors by learning how to use one, not the soap you put on your face.</li>
            <li> I just started shaving with a safety razor (this one), and it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s a little shorter in handle than I&#x27;m used to from the pro disposable head razors, but you get used to that quickly. Good weight, and simple design.</li>
            <li> Good quality construction. The Gillette twin blade pivot gives me a better shave and that includes the multi blade razors. Sometimes going back to the old days isn&#x27;t better.</li>
            <li> Purchased this once before.  Keeping this one at work.  For the price, they can&#x27;t be beat. So far my favorite pairing with this is the Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Silver Blue</li>
            <li> Like most of you, I&#x27;ve grown tired of constantly purchasing Gillette safety razors year after year. I thought each update of their razor would bring a better shaving experience. Perhaps. But still the razor blades would dull faster than you can afford to replace. I&#x27;ve been a Proglide user for years. Last year I was given a free Proglide Flexball. It didn&#x27;t offer a revolutionary shaving experience. And the next catch of course is to continuously purchase the cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when my cartridges ran out I refused to purchase another set. Then I came across users of old-school razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I thought to myself, if I were to make the switch and since the cheap blades will pay for the actual razor over time I might as well purchase a more expensive Merkur. So I looked at the Merkur Vision and Futur line. Especially the gold ones. I read the reviews and they all liked it because it was a Merkur not to mention the modern styling. But the complaints looked valid. The fatigue on the metal. The ability to change blades. The question it will last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s how I ended up with the Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor 34C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Perfect weight. As the others have stated, you let the weight of the razor work for you rather than use it to press against your skin.&lt;br /&gt;2. Great size. The short handle for beginners like myself allow greater control over the razor.&lt;br /&gt;3. Awesome construction. All metal. I want to pass this on to my son not for being a cheapskate, but for sentimental value. I will teach him to shave with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;4. Easy blade handling. It&#x27;s not as easy as the butterfly opening of other razors, but the two piece construction allows the blade to be grasped and changed safely. No balancing of the blades or mis-alignment as the blade will sit securely on the top part and you can just drop the whole handle on it with the centre guide. After which you screw it back on.&lt;br /&gt;5. Simple. No complicated adjustments to allow any metal to stress and break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. The included Merkur blade to get you started isn&#x27;t something to sing about. I find it a bit dull and I will be looking for something sharper, but still for beginners like myself. Possibly the Astra blades before I move up to the Feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;2. No protective cap. I wish Merkur provides a plastic protective cap to allow me to transport while on the road. A simple one similar to toothbrush caps will be best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with this razor blade. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go splurging like I normally do for a more expensive model. I was even thinking of this 34C in gold plating, but I also read reviews of the gold plate chipping and fading away which will make it look cheap. I want something that will look old school and last just like those without the tacky upgrades.s to allow any metal to stress and break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. The included Merkur blade to get you started isn&#x27;t something to sing about. I find it a bit dull and I will be looking for something sharper, but still for beginners like myself.

            <li> Well built little powerhouse but there was no blade included in the box as indicated. Glad I ordered refills along with it. Very pleased overall.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of buying expensive, disposable, cartridges for my daily shave. This razor gives me a closer shave at a better cost to my wallet and the environment! And it is just as easy to use. Superb craftsmanship!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in the overall quality. The razor is stamped and chrome plated rather than machined. It&#x27;s really more cosmetic than anything else as the razor works fine -- I just expected more for the price.    The second gripe is the handle length. It just feels too short, and there isn&#x27;t the reassuring feeling you&#x27;d get if the end  rested on the heel of your hand. As it is, you pinch the barrel between your fingers and that&#x27;s the only contact with the razor.     It&#x27;s a very simple design, sturdily built and it will probably last forever. It has a nice heft to it too. But if I&#x27;d seen it first hand I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with Proraso Shaving Cream and Shark Razor Blades.  I&#x27;ll admit it does take a bit of a learning curve to use this razor, but despite the first week of nicks, I love it.  I did end up investing in an aftershave balm to soothe my skin, but I suspect any irritation is either from my lack of expertise in using the razor or perhaps just my skin needing to adjust to it.    The razor is heavier than I expected and very well made.  The short handle doesn&#x27;t bother me at all since it fits me perfectly.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to any guy who&#x27;s tired of being reamed by those disposable cartridge rip-offs and who really wants a superior shave.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE Safety Razor and it has been a great one to learn with. I am still mastering the art of wet shaving, but this is an excellent tool for learning mastery!</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor one week ago and absolutely love it.  I now look forward to shaving and have a close shave everytime. I will never go back to the overpriced 5 blade razors. This razor will payfor itself in savings after 2 months of the fushion.</li>
            <li> I got this razor back in January of this year and didn&#x27;t get around to writing a review about it till now. I picked this up on the advice of the Badger and Blade forms and am quite pleased with the product as a hole, the razor is well built and after using it for three months I still like the results I get form it.    The only only real down side to this item is the handle is a bit short for me and I don&#x27;t have big hand either, some might want to take that into consideration before ordering. That being said the five free blades do good for starters, but I don&#x27;t think the blades where that grate and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using them to sway your decision to get this razor over another.</li>
            <li> Just started shaving DE and this is a quality razor. havent cut myself and I shave both my head and face. I am a novice at DE shaving ;I am 50 yrs old.. I have a rough beard. I use a quality natural oil soap/creams that have  jojoba oil and  shea butter. I am looking forward to trying the Japanese feather blades. I am currently  using Israel Personna Blades called &amp;#34;Crystal&amp;#34; . good overall Blade. Cant go wrong getting this Razor by Merkur.</li>
            <li> nice razor,very comfortable, love it!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor several years ago from Amazon and was very happy with it. I just purchased another one from Amazon and I notice the quality has gone down in the product. Specifically with the handles grip. The old one I could hold perfectly when shaving, even with very wet soapy hands and it would never slip but this new one I cannot. It slips out of my hand frequently when wet. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for Christmas and I am absolutely blown away by how much more enjoyable shaving has become. I hated spending so much money on mach razors just to have them feel like they were ripping my hair out. There is kind of an art to shaving with a double edge without getting cuts, but once you master it, it is amazing. Absolutely love the close shave.</li>
            <li> If you are new to wet shaving (as opposed to cartridge shaving), then you have to decide if you are willing to learn a new skill. Shaving with a traditional safety razor requires more time and practice than the latest Gillette cartridge gimmick design, but you get more control over the process. The cartridge design is meant to be dummy proof - one-size-fits-all for the masses. If you&#x27;re willing to pay Gillette $$$ for their proprietary cartridges, many people can get a quick, good enough shaves from them. But, if you don&#x27;t want to pay $$$ for a few measly cartridges, or if your face and beard don&#x27;t jive well with their design, then the safety razor is worth a look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the catch. You have to be willing to slow down, learn, and experiment to get the best results. Wet shavers continually cite the expression of &amp;#34;YMMV,&amp;#34; your mileage may vary. Myriad elements like skin sensitivity and beard pattern combine to make your face unique, so, while one user may have a fantastic first shave with a safety razor, another may need to reach for a styptic pencil. However, unlike the cartridge razor, the wet shaver can try a different brand of razor blade (you might be surprised to see how many are out there!) that can produce dramatically improved results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on, but here&#x27;s the TL:DR - Don&#x27;t buy a safety razor like this Merkur, shave like you do with your Fusion, and expect a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, go on YouTube, watch introductory videos by users like Mantic59 and Geofatboy. Once you&#x27;ve seen the process, then you can make a more informed decision about whether wet shaving is for you. If you are still interested, then why should you buy this particular razor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, if the $40 is not a concern, then it is a fantastic first safety razor. While the Edwin Jagger DE89 falls more decidedly in the mild category, the Merkur 34C is more balanced in terms of aggressiveness. The construction is solid and I find the 2-piece design to be efficient. Unlike twist-to-open designs, razors like this Merkur have a top cap which allows for easy navigation around the nose. The knurling on the handle is good for keeping a solid grip on the razor. Some dislike the short handle, but I found that, once I got used to it, I much preferred the shorter handle and the control it gave me over the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of the past year, I have tried a number of safety razors, ranging from classic Gillette Super Speeds to designs like the RazoRock Stealth Slant. I still consider the 34C my go-to razor, and it is the basis from which I compare other models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try wet shaving on the cheap, the Lord L6 is a mild but acceptable $10 alternative available on Amazon. However, if you find that you like wet shaving, you may very well end up buying this razor (and others) anyway.</li>
            <li> this is a great razor. have had some that the blade can get a little off center, with bloody consequences. This one is so good, i bought 4 more for my boys.</li>
            <li> Bought as gift for father in law.  Did research and this always popped up near the top.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing! As a first time \\&quot;wet shaver\\&quot; I read everything I could from every source I could find, and finally decided on the Merkur 34C, all I can say is WOW! You simply won&#x27;t believe how great it will make your face look and feel. BUT the razor is only half of the battle, if you combine this razor with a good brush and shaving soap you will notice a difference. Believe everything you read about this razor and wet shaving in general, shaving will become something you look forward to rather than dread.</li>
            <li> This is my first  Safety Razor and it has been a great one to learn with.&lt;br /&gt;Use it every day and will never spend $25 for blades agin.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. Just bought this as a present for a friend. I&#x27;ve used mine for years. It puts just the right amount of curve onto the blade. It&#x27;s easy to use and is super durable. I leave mine in the shower and it doesn&#x27;t have a spot of rust or anything. Great product and great value.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this when I decided to start using a safety razor again(I started on one and then switched to a gillette, many years ago) to see if I still like it. I was going to upgrade if I liked but I never did b/c there was no reason to. This one is great!!</li>
            <li> I picked this based on the reviews and youtube videos , it&#x27;s a great safety razor . I&#x27;m new to shaving this way , I used to use Mac 3 . I had no problems learning to use it . No cuts . I recommend watching a few YouTube tutorials if your new to safety razor shaving . I do plan to pick up a larger handle to compare .</li>
            <li> My first safety razor. It looks and works great.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.  Takes the work out of shaving.  The handle is short and easy to control.  I wake up every morning feeling like I went to the spa!</li>
            <li> Excellent. Showed up exactly as expected and is very high quality.</li>
            <li> Not like a cartridge razor. A small learning curve. Great shave. I would recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I was a little nervous at first but this razor is very forgiving. I started out with the Merkur blades that came with the razor and I have just switched to a Derby. The Derby gave me the best shave yet. I have a sampler pack coming in the mail.</li>
            <li> One of the true classics. Heavy in the hand, good shave.</li>
            <li> I use this as a backup to my Merkur 180 long handle. It works well and is solid.</li>
            <li> First off let’s not kid ourselves. A modern shaver like a Gillette Fusion shaves just as close as a safety razor with less risk of nicks and cuts. That being said, why do I use a safety? In the winter there’s just something comforting about the feel of warm heavy metal on your face (in the summer I switch to a Fusion). Also, I volunteer at a local food pantry and they were trying to get rid of a box of 20 year old Personna blades. So I have enough double edge blades to last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;As to the Merkur #34C – it’s a great shaver! I used to use a “butterfly” type of safety, but they don’t hold the blade firmly and you get some vibration. Be sure to get one like the Merkur where the entire head clamps down on the blade. I was a little concerned that some reviews said the handle was too short, but I find I hold it with my thumb and first 2 fingers rather than gripping it in my palm. So for me the length is perfect. Finally, treat yourself to a good shaving brush and soap. I find a safety shaves better that way than with canned cream – plus you get the full old time experience!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend fits the hand just right, weight just right.  Just be careful with the Merkur blade that comes with the razor. It&#x27;s very sharp and I nicked myself pretty good. It was my first time to shave with a DE razor but I enjoy it now that I am trying different blades.</li>
            <li> Good razor, heavy and good quality.</li>
            <li> Great razor.  Single edge razors are really cheap.  I use one side to go with the grain, the other to go against the grain.  You can buy 100 blades for around $13 on Amazon. Don&#x27;t have to stretch out each razor - as it is 13 cents per.  Just shave until it is a little uncomfortable.  For me it is about a week before needing a change - but it is significantly cheaper than any of the other disposable or multi-blade options.  In the end the shave is closer as I go with and against the grain, and there is no irritation as the blades are always sharp - because I am willing  to replace them more often.</li>
            <li> Works great, done with disposables and razor bumps</li>
            <li> The weight feels great in my hand and I always recommend this razor when my friends ask which one to buy.</li>
            <li> Went to shaving101.com and read about what is a good starter razor and decided to go with the 34c because of the shorter handle and many justified outstanding reviews. So, if you have nothing else to do, please read on and I will attempt to summarize my experience for anyone currently on the fence about going \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot; and leaving cartridges behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons for switching:&lt;br /&gt;1) Environmentally friendly. The blades are recycleable and cartridges are not.&lt;br /&gt;2) Economically friendly. $0.30/DE blade is nicer than $2.50+/cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;3) Much closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;4) A lot more enjoyable with soap and a badger brush than canned cream and your fingers. Pampering is nice.&lt;br /&gt;5) This thing feels like a piece of machined goodness in your hand (weight, balance, finish). Get it and you will understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I have learned:&lt;br /&gt;1) Shaving is an art. You will need to slow down, slow down, slow down. Your face/neck will pay if you do not.&lt;br /&gt;2) Do not press at all when shaving. Hold the razor at the very tip of the handle (opposite the head)and let its own weight do the work.&lt;br /&gt;3) Warm up the razor in hot water before using. It makes for a better cut.&lt;br /&gt;4) Pick a nice shaving soap that suits your needs. Proraso green is what I went for and was pleased with the ease of shave and coolness the menthol and eucalyptus left. I tried it once with regular canned cream but it did not provide the same results.&lt;br /&gt;5) Buy a styptic pencil and keep it handy at first. You will nick sporadically and the titanium dioxide will tidy things up (but man does it burn).&lt;br /&gt;6) Rinse with COLD water when done.&lt;br /&gt;7) As for blades, I went with the Amazon top reviewed and bought the Feathers. They are extremely sharp and perform beautifully on thick hair (reviews matched my experience). I tried the Merkur blade that comes with the razor, Wilkinson Sword and another store brand and you can tell immediately by the \\&quot;tugging\\&quot; that the sharpness is not there on those. I recommend the Feather blades.......&lt;br /&gt;8) The shorter handle is a little strange at first but when you get used to it, you will love it because you can swing the razor in all positions easily.&lt;br /&gt;9) This razor clears cut hair easily as there is an unimpeeded chamber beneath the blade which is large and diverts everything (soap/hair)away. I usually clog cartridges (between the blades) and have to run them under pressure (faucet/shower head) to get them cleared. This clears easily by dunking into the sink with little effort. Makes a difference if you have gone a few days sans manscaping.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after many days of research. I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s heavy weight (balanced, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap) and fits great in my hand. I&#x27;m glad I got this one and not the longer version.</li>
            <li> I feel mislead by all the great reviews. Either I&#x27;ve got a super wimpy face, or somebody stuffed the ballot box, or the emperor has new clothes, or lemmings are jumping of a cliff. I used it this Merkur twice and it nearly ripped my face off.</li>
            <li> great razor it will take a few times to get use to it but i will not use any other razor and i used the merkur de and it was a good shave and the free ones ihad received look cheap but i will try them out and let you know what i think</li>
            <li> This is a really great razor! I made the switch to &#x27;real&#x27; razors ;-) and could not be happier. I definitely made the right choice in razor selection! My daily shave has become an enjoyable meditation time, instead of a chore!&lt;br /&gt;This razor fits and works perfectly. Once you learn how to use it, you will never wish to go back to the cartridge face / wallet killers! Google searches will provide plenty of sites for teaching how to use this and other safety razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried top-end electric razors and the multiple bladed wet razors. Before this Merkur, I had to wait at least two days before I could shave again due to razor burn. This razor is awesome; I have been shaving every day with no problems. However, do some research before you go to town on your face. Look at the videos online of how to shave with a safety razor and save yourself some skin. Although sturdy with a great grip, the razor felt really small in my hand at first. However, I am used to it now and have no problems with the length - it&#x27;s all about how you use it...yeah, I went there. The set came with 1 Merkur blade and 4 Big Ben blades. At first, I used the Merkur blade and cut my face a lot. However, when I used the Big Ben blades, I was fine. Now I use Sharks and rarely get cut at all. This has to do with practice, too. If you have sensitive skin, I recommend the use of Proraso Ultra Sensitive Saving Soap with a badger brush, an alum block, and witch haze after shave (I use the type that is mixed with aloe). A routine that works for me: shower first or apply a hot, wet towel to face for a few minutes, lather up, shave, rinse with hot water, rinse with cold water, use the alum block, splash again with cold water, dry off, and use a cotton pad to pat on / apply the witch hazel after shave. This sounds time consuming, but after a little practice, it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying outrageous prices for cartridges.  They were simply way to high.  I could shave my face to baby smooth, going with and then against the grain and have a good shave.  But the multi cartridge razor would leave my face so sensitive I would have to skip a day or two.  My beard grows fast enough that I have to shave every day(a habit from the military).  But I just couldn&#x27;t with multi cartridge razors.  I saw the commercial for the double edge razor on tv and it peaked my curiosity so I went to you tube and did a little research.  I am really glad I did!  I bought the Merkur 34c and a tub of Taylor of old bond street sandalwood scent and now I shave every morning with no issues whatsoever.  Best of all, I paid 6.50$ for 50 blades!  With multi blade cartridges 6.50$ wouldn&#x27;t even get the package for a multi cartridge.  I don&#x27;t know why they even started making multi cartridge razors!  I can remember my dad shaving with an old Gillette double edge razor and always cut himself so maybe that is why I was cautious about using the Merkur.  But I figured out that my dad used the cheap store bought foam instead of a quality product like TOBS shave cream.  They can keep their multi cartridge razor blades.  I am sticking with a double edge.  It is best to shave with a double edge right after stepping out of the shower.  I will never go back to the disposable crap!  Wet shaving is the way to go, plus I get a better shave!</li>
            <li> I recently ordered the Feather, E. Jagger, and Merkur 34C razors from Amazon.  Due to Amazon&#x27;s commendable return policy, one can try several razors and return those which don&#x27;t perform the best.  I rotated these 3 razors, with Feather, Astra, and Derby blades, for about the last 2 months, shaving once per day.  For me, the Merkur with Feather blades was the clear winner.  On the star scale I would rate the Merkur a 5, Feather a 3, and Jagger a 2.  The Feather blades were noticeably better than the Astra and Derby blades, in all 3 razors.  These are my results, yours will almost certainly differ, and be equally valid.  The Jagger never failed to cut me to pieces.  Shave was never on par with the other two. The Feather was a mild shave, but didn&#x27;t cut the hair very well.  The Feather&#x27;s issue was that it was not aggressive enough.  It would take 4 passes of relathering and shaving to get the job done. After that, my face was usually burned pretty bad.  $200 is utterly outrageous for a razor.  No way the Feather razor is worth even half that price. The Merkur was just right.  It gives an amazingly close shave, with just 2 passes and a neck touch up.  Never a burn, very rarely a minor cut.  Outstanding value for the price too.  What&#x27;s the best combination for you?  Order up, lather up and find out!  You may be surprised at what you find.</li>
            <li> First time using a DE razor. Used it with a Feather blade (sounds nuts). Pretty good results. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t bring myself to 5 stars this.  I mean, it works.  It feels ok.  It&#x27;s my first double edge razor and it works ok.  It&#x27;s simple.  It hasn&#x27;t started rusting or anything.  There are some tooling marks on it, but still it looks good.  I&#x27;d buy another, and I recommend it.  I just for some reason have a difficult time giving it the full 5 stars.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I feel the blade has at least as much to do with a good shave as the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, if you&#x27;re new to double edge razors, there&#x27;s a sample pack which is well worth it.  I&#x27;ve learnt a lot as I&#x27;ve been working through it.</li>
            <li> It is one of the best shaves I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I found this to not give a good shave. It was my second attempt at this type double edge razor to get a good shave. I looked at all the reviews and found this short handle razor was too short and the shave the same as the less expensive long handle razor. Amazon was great at taking the returns and refunding my money. The best shave I have had is with  the  Harrys razor. Faster shave and cleaner shave.</li>
            <li> I began my safety razor shaving with a vintage double edge razor. After realizing that it wasn&#x27;t that hard to do and gave me a good shave without the razor bumps, ingrown hairs, and irritation of modern razors I decided it was time start fresh with a new razor that would last me years. After researching I decided to go with the Merkur Heavy Duty #34C. I like the weight and feel of the razor. I have big hands and don&#x27;t mind the length of the handle at all. I have even less nicks and irritation than with my previous vintage razor. My brother has been thinking about switching over to DE Safety razor shaving and I plan on getting him a Merkur #34C for his birthday.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor.  While I did not care for the blades that came with the razor, I absolutely love the razor itself.  It is very well built, I expect this will be the last razor I will ever have to buy as it is built that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have large hands, while I have not tried one of the longer handled razors, I find that this one is plenty long.  I have not had any problems with the use of it.  When you pick it up, it has good weight (almost like it has purpose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are just getting into DE razors, you should also look at a quality shave soap and a shave brush at a minimum.</li>
            <li> I bought this bad boy several years ago, it is still going strong. I would highly recommend it, but I would also warn that shaving with a DE razor can be tricky. If you&#x27;re new to all of this I would strongly suggest getting a variety pack of DE razor blades so you can find one that works well for you.</li>
            <li> Razor: Build quality is very nice. Blades are very easy to change. Handle is a little short for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave: Subpar. I don&#x27;t know finite just me, but a read all the reviews and really wanted to believe in a better shave, but it didn&#x27;t happen with me. After 3 shaves, I have gone back to a disposable razor. The cheapest one gives me a better shave than this was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and a military officer.  Clean shaves are a must daily and I&#x27;ve tried it all...magic shave, mach 3, Fusion (or as I call it mach 5), Norelco Nivea for men shavers and clippers.  All had their positives but mixing chemicals daily became tiring and in-grown hairs were unsightly.  So, after much research I decided to try wet-shaving.  This has made a world of difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur HD is my first razor.  Using Art of Shaving products and Merkur blades, I&#x27;m able to get a close shave with no razor burn/bumps.  Occasionally I&#x27;ll get an in-grown but I blame my technique (I still cut myself every now and then...usually when I&#x27;m in a rush).  This razor definitely has some weight to it and I find the blade loading/unloading simple although not as cool as the \\&quot;butterfly\\&quot; razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for a beginner.  Blades are equally as important.  I have found Merkur blades to be the happy medium between quality and sharpness although Feather&#x27;s clearly are samurai sword sharp.  Make sure you get a good quality badger brush and shaving cream/soap.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I was expecting great things from all the glowing reviews.  I was not expecting to have to shave twice to get anything approaching a smooth shave.  I had old safety razors that worked well.  This new, made to look classic, looks great but works poorly.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made and balanced razor. I like it as much as my 1958 Gillette Super Speed.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to clean, shines bright and holds the blade true.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the to all levels of skill</li>
            <li> I was worried about getting into safety razor shaving but it all turned out ok! This is a great starter item that will last you forever if you take care of it (which is really easy, just make sure its dry at the end of each use). It fits my hand perfectly, I don&#x27;t see a need for the longer version although I have smallish hands for a guy. Get yourself some shaving soap, extra blades and a brush and you&#x27;re good to go! Cheaper to shave this way over time compared to cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important note is that the razor blade you choose makes a huge difference. Not all blades work with everyone. Some people need something like a Merkur or Derby blade (they are on the medium to low sharpness scale) while others might go for a Feather Blade. I would suggest getting a mixed kit to start so you can find the on that works for you. Save the Feather Blade till you know what you&#x27;re doing though!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shave with a single edge.  This was a return to an earlier time and it still works great!  Very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This safety razor is one of the best I&#x27;ve used. It has good balance and the perfect weight. Not much pressure is needed to get a close shave. If you don&#x27;t mind a shorter handle razor, I would highly recommend this razor. Don&#x27;t forget a good blade; the shapes aren&#x27;t always the best depending on thickness of you beard and sensitivity of your skin.</li>
            <li> I have to shave everyday, because I&#x27;m Reserve Military and LEO. The current razors on the market are garbage, they tore up my face. For the cost of this razor + or - $40 and I buy packs of 10 dbl edge safety razors for it for about a 1$. The blades are double edged and extremely sharp, so sharp that you don&#x27;t press down while shaving. I&#x27;ve been shaving with this razor for almost 5 yrs and now I understand why grandad shaved with this type of razor.. I&#x27;ve put no less than 20 dudes onto this system for shaving. You won&#x27;t regret it! This razor IS NOT intended to shave your body with, although I use it for that as well. I reccomend that if you get this razor that you get a shave bowl and brush too. I use a combination of prorasio and bump fight shave gel in my shave bowl. This system of shaving is much more high quality than anything that the disposable companies could ever produce and is just a quick. I use my blades for 5 days then change blades. Stop throwing away your money on the disposable crap, I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
            <li> This is a well made razor that is simple to use and has a nice finish. The short handle takes a little adjustment, but the weight feel good.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor. He decided to go retro and get the old school style razor for a closer shave than with disposables, and gets fewer ingrown hairs to boot. He says he will never go back to BIC.</li>
            <li> This is a solid razor with old school craftsmanship. it feels really good in the hand, it has weight to it which make the shave very reassuring. I purchase i don&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor. I did a lot of research and found this is a very popular razor.  I agree -- it&#x27;s great.  The handle and weight make it easy to spin to use the other side.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to give DE shaving a try while I was semi happy with &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; razor closeness and over effect the cost seemed silly to me. I shave my face and head ever other day and was going through razor blades like water. I tried a straight razor and while on my face it was ok the backside of your head with a straight razor is a bit scary and I have nicked myself plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why but a DE sided razor came to mind did some reason and Merkur seemed like a good choice to try as a starter. While I have sort of gotten used to the shorter handle of the 34C and its a great length for my face I wish I would have gone with the longer handle for my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have been debating trying a DE razor don&#x27;t, the transition will be quicker than you realize. My first shave was a bit slow and only nicked myself once (on my mole) after that it got faster and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaving costs are greatly reduced and I&#x27;m considering giving them out as gifts to my friends and family cause its not something someone would always get themselves but I think alot more people should use. Modern and new doesn&#x27;t always mean better I think alot of the modern and new razors are just to line the pockets of companies the advancement isn&#x27;t really need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing dive in an try it its rather simple and not that much to get started in. I feel the shave is as good or frankly most of the time now better than my Fusion (who now resides in the bottom draw forgotten).</li>
            <li> I am a straight razor shaver. I needed something for when I am on the go. I am in the military so I&#x27;m on the go a lot. There is a small learning curve to this razor, I cut myself twice which is funny cause I don&#x27;t cut myself with my straights. Any who the razor itself feels very heavy to the hand and feels of high quality. The chrome appears to be good quality as well. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking to purchase a Double Edge razor... In fact I have already. This is definitely a great compromise between straight razor shaving and cost. The product shaves very well. I am a person that does not get impressed often or easily, this razor did impress me.</li>
            <li> I bought my wife a brand new car for the summer and in return she bought me this razor. I will never go back to the new school shaving again. I love this razor!!!!</li>
            <li> Husband has always had really sensitive skin, so he couldn&#x27;t shave with a regular razor. Purchased this one for him and it works perfectly and his skin isn&#x27;t irritated when he shaves!</li>
            <li> Good product, use a blade about three times, I don&#x27;t get any nicks</li>
            <li> This is the second one I owned in my life.  The last one I drop in my tub and the top broke off.  I owned the 1st one for over 8 years with no issue.  I have had this one less than 3 months.  I dropped it the other day in shower and it damaged the metal around the area which touches my face.  I will have to file it down or purchase another one. Good Summary: Great safety razor and has saved me a lot of money over the years. Small and compact to take on trips. Easy to replace blades.  Bad Summary: If you drop it, it can be damaged easily.  UPDATE:  I have dropped this one in the bathtub too, and now one side of the razor has damage to it.  When I use it on the damaged side, I can feel it and it sometimes scrapes my cheek.  If you have a porcelain, steel, or tile tub, this razor can get damaged very easily.  I recommend you don&#x27;t place the razor anywhere it could fall after your done shaving.</li>
            <li> Great razor. Slightly more aggressive than most starting razors, but still gentle.  The blade changing mechanism is also very convenient.</li>
            <li> Helped my make the jump from the 5 blade cartridges and it&#x27;s performed well. Still a bit tough to get under the nose but it handles the rest perfectly.</li>
            <li> Are you using an electric or cartridge razor? Stop reading and buy this now, you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no experience with other Safety razors, but this is hands-down better than the 4-blade cartridge I was using before. Less irritation, smoother shave, and cheaper blades. What&#x27;s not to love? The razor itself here is nice and weighty, and the short handle just seems to be the right length.</li>
            <li> Once I got used to the style it has worked great.</li>
            <li> My favorite double edge safety razor. No need to use pressure on the face. This razor has all the weight you need to get a close, comfortable shave with all types of double edge blades. It&#x27;s two -piece design makes it very easy to change a blade. The handle is non-slip and feels good in the hand. A simple &amp;#34;twist &amp;#34; of the knob at the bottom of the razor will release the head for the blade change and you&#x27;re ready to shave.</li>
            <li> Very solid razor. Lasted 5 years until the top broke off.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave every time. Quality product. Strong 2nd place to 1954 Gillette</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a safety razor before but this is the one and only I&#x27;ll need. It was not very hard to learn how to use properly. I haven&#x27;t cut myself yet the main risk seems to be if you try to reuse your blades until they&#x27;re dull or lose their coating.     I may switch to a straight razor one day. Maybe when this safety razor breaks or rusts (which I suspect would require years of neglect), I&#x27;d need a replacement.</li>
            <li> Great razor, shaves very close and comfortably. My only complaint is that it was supposed to come with a blade already included. It did not. Luckily I had the foresight to buy a 10 pack of Merkur blades along with it.</li>
            <li> Just made the switch from electric to DE shaving and I have seen the light.  This is a great razor and I enjoyed my first shave very much.  Was it perfect?  No, but some practice on my technique is in order.  Everything they do say about DE shaving is true though - there is zero tugging or pulling and its miles ahead other shavers.  I can&#x27;t believe I used to use \\&quot;fast food\\&quot; razors.  Also, on a side note - the handle unscrews from the bottom of the razor, not the top.  This means when you are taking it apart you don&#x27;t need to have your fingers anywhere near the blade which is a nice safety feature.  The Derby blades that came with it are also nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> I have no standard for comparison, this is my 1st saftey razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got fed up with razor burn from cartridge razors - I would constantly break-out on the right side of my neck. I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Mach 3&#x27;s since I started shaving as a teenager - but a little internet research led me to saftey razors. I&#x27;m too cheap to want to replace cartridges as often as you&#x27;re supposed to - but with a saftey razor you can get 100 packs for 10-20 cents per razor! Which translates to sharper blades and better shaves on the cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My observations after about 5 shaves with both a Merkur blade and a Feather blade are these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. There&#x27;s a learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s time intensive.&lt;br /&gt;3. I&#x27;m already getting closer shaves on my neck - although I&#x27;m still having some razor burn (on stubborn areas like my adam&#x27;s apple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that once I get a feel for proper angles and technique the time investment and razor burn will decrease. I&#x27;m totally happy with this purchase and look forward to building my skill and turning a routine into a ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I was scared that I would be carving up my face with a saftey razor, but as long as you&#x27;re patient you&#x27;ll be fine. I have yet to really nick myself very badly with this Merkur.</li>
            <li> Only 1 bad nick so far, and that was my fault.  Hard to get hairs right under the nose, otherwise I would have given this razor a 5 star.  Nice weight and feel to it.</li>
            <li> One word... &amp;#34;AMAZING&amp;#34;! ;-D</li>
            <li> I came from an Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl.  I decided to give this Merkur a shot because my EJ fell and snapped at the screw.  Apparently EJ&#x27;s have this problem because they use cast steel.  So I&#x27;ve heard many good reviews and the ratings on here are great for Merkur.  Merkur also uses forged steel, so it shouldn&#x27;t snap as easily if dropped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t know if I somehow got a wrongly manufactured razor or what.  I have to shave twice, one right after the other, on a daily basis and I still get long spots all over my face and NONE of the shave feels close at all!  There is no way that I can call it good with one shave.  With my EJ I could easily go a few days without shaving, shave once and I had a great close shave.  I&#x27;m using the same blades (Astra Platinum) and shave cream (Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood) as I have always used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I half way think that I got a bad razor, because I can&#x27;t believe that so many people are satisfied with this junk.  If this is your first and only razor that you have used.  I would highly suggest trying anything else and seeing how it works for you.  I almost never give one star ratings, but this product cannot even sort of do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Great looking, easy to clean, easy to install new razors.  Good balance.  Nice and light in my hand.  At times wish it was a little heavier so I could get slightly closer shave but nothing worth throwing this out for.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor and it not only feels right while getting a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased another highly rated razor just to compare.  I like the Merkur better personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would but it again.</li>
            <li> I am surprised about how well this works.  Obviously, much cheaper than five blade devices and works better.  Get it, buy a brush and soap shaving cream as well and enjoy the art of shaving.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and I gotta say, I enjoy shaving!! Short handle helps a lot moving up and down the neck. Definitely recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Provides a great shave and is pretty easy to use. I will use this thing for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that the handle is not smooth and will not twist in your hand when wet like another one I have.  The short handle is perfect to rest on my little finger.  Perfect control.  Never cut myself but plenty of contact to do the job.  I like the two part versus three part assembly.</li>
            <li> This thing is proof that sometimes the old ways are the best ways. I just barely touched it to my face and it sliced through the hair like butter. Cartridge razors are costly and clog easily and never seem able to clear all the hair off my face without a lot of pressure and struggling. This razor may be a bit expensive but the investment will pay off in the long run because you won&#x27;t be buying razor cartridges or shave heads for electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, make sure to use soap or else it won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> i am satisfied from product</li>
            <li> Great Razor! Try Persona blades with it as well. This combo won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> great razor at an affordable price</li>
            <li> My husband loves it. He says it is by far the closest shave he has ever had. I love it too- his face is so smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> only reason why i gave it a four is that is has a short handle. unless you are a little person with little hands, buy the long handle one.&lt;br /&gt;the merkur is the best razor i have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Stainless Steel instead of chrome plated, heavy weight, made in Germany.  What else could you want?  The included blade was pretty poor, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> The price on this razor seems to fluctuate a lot and at it&#x27;s current price I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good value (compare the price to other Merkur Razors). When I purchased it it was almost $20 less. Just a heads up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first DE razor and it suits my needs fine. I&#x27;ve used for a few months. The construction isn&#x27;t the most attractive to me and I think if I could do it over again I&#x27;d purchase a longer handle model or different Merkur model but it&#x27;s a solid razor and I will continue to use it. People recommend the short handle for greater control but I think I&#x27;d have preferred a longer handle. Aside from that it&#x27;s a great investment over expensive cartridge based systems and I would guess it will last a long time. Seems solid.</li>
            <li> Fantastic razor!  Clean shave with no razor burn.  I enjoy the weight of the handle and the durability of the Merkur blades.  If you are starting out with safety razors, look no further my friends, you found it!  Take your time and use a good glycerin soap to work up your lather.  Relax and take care of your face: it is the first thing people see when they look at you. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> The perfect razor!,  After you learn how to use a safty razor.  Easy to clean and sanitize for for those who have probems with skin infections and acne;  just disassemble and place in alcohol, or just dip the head of the razor in a small jar of alcohol, then let dry on you&#x27;re razor stand.</li>
            <li> Great product very happy with it.  Best shave I have had.</li>
            <li> the short hndle makes it slightly awkward to get used to at first, but after a few shaves it feel quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(my first DE safety razor, so theres a learning curve for me)&lt;br /&gt;liking it more and more wih every use. ^_^</li>
            <li> Perfect weight, size, and aggressiveness. I own a few super speeds that I don&#x27;t use as often anymore. It had a learning curve after the milder shave from the old super speeds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never use s double edged razor before but after research and reviews, I found this to be a great razor to buy and use so far. Now I&#x27;m looking for the best razor blades for me.</li>
            <li> First, let me put this in context: I had never used a double-edged (DE) razor before. This was a highly-rated DE razor, so I decided to try it because there seem to be many people who claim that DE razors are superior to the more common safety razors (e.g., Sensor Excel, Mach 3, etc.). So, this review is not comparing this DE razor to other DE razors, but rather comparing the experience I had using this DE razor as opposed to safety razors. Note that I tried both the Merkur blade that came with the razor, and some Feather blades I purchased separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who favor DE razors claim everything from them providing a better shave, to being faster, to being much cheaper (in the long run). There are also those who just like the experience of using a DE razor (I can&#x27;t say much about that, to each his own).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DE razors are cheaper in the long run, that&#x27;s a fact given the relative blade costs (less than a dollar for a DE blade compared to $2-$3+ for most good safety razors). But faster or a better shave? Or safer (not cutting yourself during shaving)? That was not my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the Feather blades (which are insanely sharp - so sharp that I actually don&#x27;t like them because you don&#x27;t get any feedback - they just slice through the hair and you don&#x27;t even feel it) the end result is no better than a good safety razor. Granted, not having used DE razors before, I&#x27;m sure my technique isn&#x27;t perfect. But, my technique for a safety razor is just fine. The shave I get with a safety razor is just fine. There is no question that I can shave faster with a safety razor, since I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I felt like, unless you are actually using a DE razor due to their inexpensive blade costs, the supposed advantages of DE razors were hype (which is ironic, since DE fans say that safety razors are just hype to get people to buy more expensive blades), and to me they just aren&#x27;t worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> Gives a great shave! Like all modern razors except stainless steel ones, it is made of nickel plated pot metal. Vintage Gillette razors for $10 are made of higher quality materials, but it does give a great shave.</li>
            <li> I bought the Merkur 34C to learn how to shave with a double-edged razor and it has been an excellent performer for fit, finish and function. It is heavy and well-made, with a simple two-piece design that makes changing razor blades quick and easy. I have relatively small hands and feel that the shorter handle on this razor is comfortable and controllable. People with large hands may want to consider a longer-handled model by Merkur. In any case, the handle and knob knurling is effective against slippage and the gentle bend the head imposes on blades seems just right. It will almost certainly last my lifetime and is nice enough to be worthy of passing on to a child or grandchild. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Prior to this purchasusing I was an electric razor abd theb a Gillete razor that used 3 (count them) blades. My good friend told me tha I could make my life easier and save money by ising this razor and a good double edge razor blade. I bought this and oter then learning how to shave with a lighter hand my experience has been smooth shaving.</li>
            <li> Very Good razon. It has great handling. Fits in your hand nicely. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> seems like good quality</li>
            <li> Great weight, great shave.  I love this razor.  It is my first experience using a double edge razor and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  It&#x27;s a close shave and I don&#x27;t get any nicks.  The razor itself is a little more expensive up front, plus you&#x27;ll need a bush, and you&#x27;ll want a stand.  But once that cost is out of the way, you&#x27;ll save a ton on razor blades for years to come.  This will make you  a great birthday present and, boom, no upfront cost!  Take the plunge, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> My Fiance&#x27; said, Best present ever!</li>
            <li> It is a small handle and thus hard to ease through the shave, maybe in time I will get accustomed.  Good for traveling.</li>
            <li> I love this razor and the blade that came with it. I wish I&#x27;d bought it years ago. I&#x27;ve been shaving with this razor for a month now and haven&#x27;t had a single nick yet. Works like a charm. Buy one and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Because the of the cost of disposable razors, that&#x27;s a total sham!!!  Anyway I made the decision to switch over to the saftey razor and I&#x27;m SO glad that I did!!  I purchased this specific razor after an incredibile amount of research, I looked at all of the blades side by side in stores and online.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor !  Stop overpaying for all the multi-blade hype and shave like a MAN !!!  Excellent beginner safety razor.  Gives an excellent shave !</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. This was his first type of razor like the Merkur.  The razor itself is a great quality and the weight makes the razor easy to handle. It is also extremely easy to clean. I am glad I bought it with the blades included as the blades are rather expensive separately. My husband loves the clean lines the razor provides and he says he will be using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> This product has a weight to it that helps me relax my hand.  The purpose is to allow the razor do the work for you and prevent shaving too close.  Worked wonders for me and I love the shave!</li>
            <li> I dove into the wetshaving world eyes open and this was the most recommended razor for wetshaving virgins.  I have had trouble shaving my whole adult life.  My facial hair grows slow (very slow) and my skin is dry and sensitive.  So the in-grown hairs under my neck aren&#x27;t coarse enough to break the skin surface properly.This razor and Merkur blades has made shaving enjoyable for the first time in my life and I am 50 yrs old.</li>
            <li> Switched to the Merkur 34c and had a smoother face than any multiblade razor or electric razor I have ever tried. Why mess with a classic?</li>
            <li> Great razor! Use this instead of drugstore junk</li>
            <li> Came as advertised, would buy from again.</li>
            <li> I was tired of spending a ton of money on cartridge blades and decided to try a safety razor. This razor is of high quality and love the smaller handle and weight. Allows for a good grip and ease of hitting the hard spots on my chin. Not even worried about cutting myself with this razor, still trying to find the right blade. The Merkur that came with is very sharp and gives a great shave, have Persona now, and they are OK, but not that great as they could be sharper. Waiting on my Feather blades to arrive and hope they are worth the wait for a great shave.</li>
            <li> It is the traditional double edge razor.  It is well weighted and is entirely out of steel. I would prefer the handle to be a little longer,  but all together it is a wonderful tool.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as I was tired of paying the ridiculous prices for Gillette blades etc. I remember this type of razors as the first I learned to shave with as my father used them. This will give a much closer shave then new conventional razors. Be warned though they do take some getting used to as the blades are sharper then on your Gillette etc. It is not a razor for the impatient. I found the weight of this razor to be excellent and it is well balanced. The short handle allows me to get closer to my face and almost feels as if you are running your hand over your face as you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades are much cheaper and available at your local CVS, Walgreens etc. It is a snap to clean and you just twist off the handle and run warm water over it. No issue at all. Enjoy your shave.</li>
            <li> Great first purchase for those who want to try a safety razor.  Very easy to handle, substantial in the hand, and takes the guesswork out of blade exposure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally bought one and stopped using regular shavers you buy in stores. They are a waste of money. This straight razor is really, really great.</li>
            <li> This is the best Razor of all that I have used!!!!!</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted!  Very heavy duty, price is fair. I will never use amother razor again! Even my girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to classic shaving, but I have to say, I&#x27;m absolutely impressed with this razor. Having purchased it on a whim as an alternative to the Gillette Super speed I&#x27;ve been using before now, I have gotten the chance to finally try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the results... they&#x27;re very impressive. It&#x27;s quite easily the best shave I&#x27;ve enjoyed. I even having swapped my Astra blades I usually go for with the Merkur sample blade, but didn&#x27;t notice it detracting from this razor&#x27;s effectiveness. With the right technique, this razor provides a consistently excellent, close shave, with almost no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few considerations. First, this razor is relatively short, so large-handed users or those who prefer a longer razor should consider the 38C instead. Second, this razor is heavy, which admittedly provides a more aggressive shave than the super speed I used to use, but newer users should be cautious of applying pressure to this effectively weighted razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this razor and strongly recommend it either as a first safety razor or for users who want something a bit different to try.</li>
            <li> Great razor.  Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Exactly as described - great quality - perfect for the job and really easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> The best razor I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Very good quality and solidly built razor. I had imagined it to be heavier. There is definitely a learning curve in order to get a clean shave, especially coming from regular cartridge razors and electric razors which require no effort at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing when starting to use a double edge razor, or any older/traditional shaving methods, is the process and overall experience. The experience of prepping, shaving, and post-shave rituals creates satisfaction that is absent from today&#x27;s more contemporary methods.</li>
            <li> Been using this razor for a few months now and just love it.  Had a Edwin Jagger razor but it was a big dissapointment due it&#x27;s poor quality.  I love the short handle on this Merkur razor which makes it easy to shave in awkward places.  Would recommend to any newcomer to DE shaving!</li>
            <li> Great shaver.  Easy to use.  My first DER.  How did I shave without it!</li>
            <li> Too small and heavy. I won&#x27;t buy this razor again</li>
            <li> If you like safety razors, this is one to get. Quality build, easy maintenance &amp;  short length makes it very easy to control &amp; use. Best DE razor I have had. Highly recommend. I use with Merkur blades.</li>
            <li> I decided to finally switch from the very well marketed cartridges to this safety razor.  Paying so much for the cartridges I knew there had to be a better alternative.  I heard some colleagues talking about the safety razor, did some research, and figured I would give it a try.  I have to admit there is a learning curve making the transition.  I&#x27;m still working on some patchy areas, some irritation after the first use.  The idea of lathering, shaving, lathering again, shaving, takes a bit to get used to.  I recently purchased a brush, bowl and shaving soap kit, hopefully the combination of tools will make the shaving experience more pleasant.</li>
            <li> Great quality but just a little too aggressive for my skin. It is hard for me to not get razor burn with this blade. I have sissy skin so my Feather AS-D2 is my one-and-only. It was a much bigger investment but for me it was very worth it.</li>
            <li> well built, feels good in my hand. too bad we dont manufacture any safety razors as good here in America.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just got back into using a double edge razor. And I&#x27;m happy that I did. The feel of this instrument is that of quality. Not some flimsy lite plastic or lite mental. The weight feels good and it helps make the shave all the better. This device is made for a man who sees a shave as a ritual and not a daily task. I highly recommend the Merkur.</li>
            <li> Works great, cleans easily. Recommend buying the longer handle razor, it is easier to use.</li>
            <li> The weight of this razor is  superb. You will throw out all of those Machs and track cartridges and get a real shave.If you have not tried  this razor you do not know what you are missing.</li>
            <li> This is the best shave I’ve ever gotten. Combined with Feather blades I can’t believe I ever used a Gillette.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a great razor that didn&#x27;t cost a whole lot. This one fits the bill. Good quality, easy to use and with the right blade, a great shave. The razor looks good, has a good finish, but for a big guy, it would be nice if the handle were a little longer and larger diameter.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a safety razor and I did not cut myself, finished shaving in 4 min, and got the smoothest skin ever. I&#x27;m sure it will take less time with practice, and will save money on blades in the long term, so the investment was very worthy. Also, some blogs that compare this razor vs Edwing Jagger 89BL show pictures with a lot of small flaws in the finishing of the 34C. Mine does not have any of those flaws. The plating is just great. Thinking of getting a few more as gifts for my brother and my very good friends.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor for 2 years and still using same 100 ct. Personna box of blades. I usually get 4-5 shaves per blade. That&#x27;s about 4 cents a shave. TIP --- Do Not Press down on the razor. You will not get as good a shave and will dull the blade much faster. Just let the razor slide across your face. Let the razor do the work. Go over a few times to get the closet shave. Take your time.  You will be very pleased. By the way, I clean and dry my razor and blade after each use; it looks like the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> My husband requested this as a gift &amp; I confess I was concerned - especially once I received the package.  This is a very small (short handled) razor.  He LOVES it.  The weight and balance are perfect, and it looks great on his chrome shaving stand with the chrome handled brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to the manly art of wet shaving.  This razor is great for me.  Built like a tank and shave&#x27;s well.  Easy to take apart and clean.  No regrets.  I didn&#x27;t care for the included Merkur blade. Get a few different blades up front (shipping will be free now vs. later) and find the one that works best for you.</li>
            <li> Very good quality but the short handle doesn&#x27;t work out that well for me.  If you are starting out with DE blades I&#x27;d recommend starting off with a less expensive razor with a longer handle to see what you like.  I just purchased a parker 22R and it seems like a bargain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently moved to shaving with a safety razor and bought this little beauty.  I love the small handle and overall size of this razor.  It&#x27;s really heavy weight and well made and I&#x27;m sure it will last me for year and years to come.</li>
            <li> Went back to what dad used as razors are so unbelievably overpriced. And the razors you buy in the store never last me more than 3 shaves then the blade gets mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of this item is weighted just rite so the weight of the razor is all you need on the skin. The design is pretty classic and  it still works the best. The replacement blades are cheap and I&#x27;m getting 20 good shaves out of a razor. Nice!</li>
            <li> In a mere 2 passes, this razor gets my face smoother than any jet fighter razor (e.g. Gilette Mach 3) on the market. Not only does it get my face smoother, it does so with almost no skin irritation.  I use it with a pure badger brush and William mug soap.  It will definitely save money in the long run, and it turns shaving into an enjoyable ritual instead a hassle.</li>
            <li> Love it! Done being ripped off by Gillette and spending $20 for each pack of 4 blades. First of all, let me disclose that I&#x27;m a woman and that I use this razor for body shaving. This type of razor actually gives me a cleaner shave once I got used to how to hold it. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like a multi-blade razor. Although I will say that it&#x27;s easier to get an occasional nick, mostly on the front part of my shin if I put pressure on the blade. That&#x27;s another thing: unlike multi-blade razors, you really don&#x27;t need to use pressure for a closer shave. Just drag it along at the right angle. I also really like the fact that this razor looks and feels really weighty and high quality, and will never have the gross residue that builds up in a conventional razor that has rubber inserts. My only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t realize that it came in a long handled version; I think for use on the body, the longer handle might be a bit easier to use - so check both out before you order.</li>
            <li> I was tired of cartridge razors that were too expensive and still didn&#x27;t feel good. After looking and looking, I decided to bite the bullet and try this razor. I was only worried because I bought into the safety of cartridges too much, and had too vivid an imagination of cutting myself to shreds and bleeding everywhere with an seemingly open blade. I&#x27;m glad I tried it. This razor is heavy and well-made. It&#x27;s easy to use with a careful technique. I also found it hard to believe that it would actually make shaving a pleasure. But I was wrong there too. It&#x27;s great. I do enjoy shaving now, and I haven&#x27;t cut myself yet a month into it. I&#x27;m never going back to the cheap (but expensive) shave of a cartridge.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor so I am learning, but I am extremely pleased with my purchase. This thing is great quality and is heavy so a lot of pressure is not needed when shaving.</li>
            <li> This is simple but high-quality razor. Along with some great German or Japanese blades like Wilkinson or Feather, this thing is a pleasure to use with no nicks or cuts. I was worried about the short handle and just about went for the longer but am glad I got this. It&#x27;s very weighty and balanced and handles very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended if your tired of the extremely high cost of those plastic refill types. Those are several dollars a piece while a high-quality German-made blade like the Wilkinson Sword or Japanese-made Feather are a measly 25-35 CENTS.</li>
            <li> Love this razor. Well balanced, good weight, easy to use, and works as expected. This is a permanent replacement to those junkie multi blade units that cause skin irritation...</li>
            <li> There is a reason why these razors are obsolete (from the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s). Modern cartridge style razors are more expensive but so much more convenient! I have been using the modern 2-5 blade disposable razors for years and they are just so much better (faster, less maintenance, and safer-you can easily cut your finger when loading a new blade). I tried the DE razor because of the lower cost per blade. It just Did not work for me. Gave me razor bumps and many cuts even when shaving much slower than with disposable razor. My brother bought a similar razor from a local store and returned it in a week because of the same complaint. If you are accostomed to the convenience of the moder razor it is highly doubtful that you will like the experience.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three weeks now, and it is excellent!  The handle is shorter then I realized but I haven&#x27;t found that too be much of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;Since this is my first razor; I like the fact that the safety bar is fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight is just right and it does aid in applying the right amount of pressure so that I don&#x27;t cut myself (that often).</li>
            <li> Excellent razor for the money. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great razor, year old no problems, German made , need I say more?</li>
            <li> My initial impression is happily satisfied. Upon first use I found the razor to be easy load, and the handle length fine. The shave is so smooth it did not think I was actually cutting the hair/stubble from my face.</li>
            <li> Love it! I was worried this wouldn&#x27;t cut as well as the fusion quad blades but after using this and spending 12 bucks for 100 blades as opposed to 8 blades for 42 bucks with the fusion, enough said I&#x27;ve switched and will never go back!</li>
            <li> Did not realize this was so short, still it works well</li>
            <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve had in years. Have ordered some &amp;#34;feather&amp;#34; blades that haven&#x27;t arrived yet. I used the blade that came with the razor; then purchased some generics at the dollar store. They give a great, close shave, and are reasonably priced. Balanced feel in the hand. quality workmanship; I&#x27;m delighted. Yes, I&#x27;d recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> This razor reminds me of the razor I cut my first beard on, my dad&#x27;s Gillette Fat Boy.  It is easy to grip, aggressive enough for a very close shave, but not so much as to slice up my face.  I was a little concerned about going back to a DE razor after 40+ years of throwaways.  After a few days of using this razor, I wish I had never left.  I actually enjoy the the morning ritual now: lathering up the Sandalwood Shaving Cream and foaming up the face and neck.  The time to shave and clean the razor is a bit longer, but using this razor and the Personna Prep Double Edge Razor Blades (100 pack at 35 cents each) gets me a much closer shave at a much better price.  If you are on the fence about switching to (or back to) a DE razor, just do it.  You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> As a first time DE safety razor user I was apprehensive to use this razor, but from the first use I wonder why I was wasting so much money on plastic junk.  This razor is easy to handle, has great balance and I&#x27;m looking forwards to shaving now instead of it being a chore!!</li>
            <li> I found out almost all Merkur razors have the same Head, Just different handles. I still like all of my Merkurs</li>
            <li> I just switched from those multi-bladed, expensive razors to using &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; double-edge razors. This Merkur is the second I&#x27;ve owned (first one from another manufacturer fell apart...a butterfly model) and is very nicely machined. I use the short handle version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I can get four or five shaves from a blade and change when it begins to feel like I was using a NEW multi-blade razor.  You read that right...a new multi-blade razor drags and pulls like shaving with sandpaper.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband.  He has been looking for this type of razor and we couldn&#x27;t find it in any store.  He really likes the close shave it provides the weight to the razor.</li>
            <li> Actual stainless steel.  Never rusts.  Easy to change the blade.  Well balanced.  It is short, but it all depends on how you like to hold your razor.  If you want to use a 5 finger grip, don&#x27;t get this one.  But if you use a lighter touch this is perfect because it is heavy enough to compensate.</li>
            <li> Great choice. I&#x27;d recommend Feather platinum blades for a non irritating shave for guys with sensitive and/or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Best shaving experience I&#x27;ve had in years! All men who shave must try using one of these razors!</li>
            <li> The 34C is a good razor. It is considered a very gentle razor and therefor very easy to use for somebody new to wet shaving. It has a short handle but still has a lot of weight. The construction is very solid and easy to clean. I find that the Merkur blades are not very sharp and recommend getting something else. You can go to westcoastshaving.com and get a very nice sample pack for a good price. This way you can a good blade that works for you.</li>
            <li> bought for my husband who is an experienced shaver with the old style razors-he loved the weight of it, but after using it a while said a longer one would be better, and it is a little difficult to use due to the length of it..brand is great, will see if they make the same one but longer..</li>
            <li> Awsome razor very well built heavy duty works great with feather blades easy to replace blades and clean I like the size good grip should last a lifetime</li>
            <li> My first double edged razor. Very well built. I appreciate well made mechanical items and this is definitely that. Heavy, well finished, and precise blade release mechanism. I&#x27;ve enjoyed DE shaving so far. I was a little worried about getting cut but it&#x27;s really not much of an issue and I&#x27;ve really started to enjoy the ritual of preparing shaving cream and taking my time with multiple passes etc. It seems to cut better for longer than all the multiple place disposables I&#x27;ve used in the past. I rarely skip a day shaving now because I enjoy it much more. The variety of high end shaving creams is great and a big part of what I enjoy as well</li>
            <li> The 34C is a no-frills razor that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  The quality is superb; as you would expect from Merkur.  The plating is excellent.  It&#x27;s a bit shorter than my previous safety razor.  I have big hands but the 34C is well-balanced so after a few shaves that became a moot issue.  This is a two-piece razor but I prefer it to my old butterfly-opening razor because the blade angle at the edge provides a smoother shave.  Also, being a two-piece, a little more care needs to be taken when handling/changing blades.  Again, not that big of a deal, but anyone who has a problem safely handling double-edge blades needs to just grow a beard.  And lastly, the price makes this a great buy.</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for about two years now.  I have a very heavy beard but even when doing three pass shaves, I have yet to cut myself with this Merkur.  Solidly built, will definitely last you a lifetime and you will never out grow it.  Great for beginners yet close enough shaves for even the experienced shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, chrome is excellent, very durable, blade sits squarely and snug.  Actually buying two more, one for travel and one for my 19 y/o son.  It&#x27;s about time he knew what real shaving is about.</li>
            <li> Not near as good as the Gillette Fusion at least for me.  I fell for the advertisements and gave it a try and ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> I just love it, it fells good on my hand,  right size and a very close shave, price was good</li>
            <li> Sick of paying crazy amount of money for today&#x27;s razor blades (4 blade) Using the Merkur #34 C works excellent, a better shave and the money I will save is incredible. If you want a better shave and save allot of money get this Merkur Razor!</li>
            <li> Ive been shaving with this razor for roughly 3 months now and I do not foresee myself ever going back. I enjoy the closeness of my shave and enjoy the process of DE shaving. I will admit I do not love it nearly as much as some others who describe their new shaving ritual as calming or therapeutic though I do enjoy it far more than I ever have shaving in the past. Blades do matter quite a bit when DE shaving friends. Do yourself a favor order a sample pack and figure out what you like, not what is most popular. I personally love the astra&#x27;s and hate the feathers, derby&#x27;s and merkur blades. They just did not work out as well for me. Also I&#x27;m not sure how people are ending up bloody messes. Its a razor blade guys, just be careful and you will be fine. You will get nicks, cuts, and little mishaps here and there. (why would there be a market for pencils and alum blocks if they didn&#x27;t happen?) Overall great razor though be warned it is quite small in size. I have large hands but I still manged just fine with this one.</li>
            <li> I cant find a thing wrong with this sucker.  Built well.  Handles well.  Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> Being a multi blade cartridge guys for the first couple years of my shaving &amp;#34;career&amp;#34; I was a little worried about getting cut, shaving causing more break outs and ultimately cost.  So I generally just shaved with multi blade cartridge.  Often just the cheap disposable ones.  Silly I know and I have been wary about going all in with the double edge razors.  Weird how cheap and not getting cut was the way, in my mind to a good safe shave using the multi blade cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have been using the Double Edge razor, I find that a little patients in the beginning goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have I been cut? No more so than I would have using a multi blade cartridge.  That was a huge relief.  Again be patient and it will soon be second nature like using the old, cheap multi blade cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it cause more break outs? No, if anything I have notices, especially on my neck, I have seen some improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, is it more expensive?  You do the math.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One new, high quality, double edge razor handle cost $50ish dollars.  I felt that was high but with the high grade steal, I can&#x27;t see wearing this out for many years.  Blades are about $10ish dollars for a high quality 100 pack.  Ok, if you are still with me, so for one year of shaving changing the blade every week and only shaving 6 times a week.  I give my face a break on Saturday.  That adds up to about $55 dollars in the first year.  What does the second year cost? Hmmm, since I will still have blades left over and won&#x27;t have to get another handle.  $0-$5.  If you can beat that with a multi blade system and have a fresh blade every week.  Be my guest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a quick look on Amazon and found a 15 pack of just Mach3 blades for $34 and a handle with handle with 2 blades for $18.  That will only get you through the first third of the year.  For the full year it will cost you $120ish the first year and then about $100 a year every year after that if you throw the blade away every week.  So as far as cost, you at getting something that is more than 2X as cheap the first year and something nearly 20X cheaper the next.  Plus or minus 10X on the second year for the engineers now checking my math.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence and have the time and money, I recommend adding 2 to 5 minutes to your shave time for a better, cheaper and I find it more enjoyable shave experience.  You be the judge.</li>
            <li> Solid piece of gear. worked fine , no problems. the Merkur razor blade  it came with could have been better.  I liked the razor so much I bought one for my uncle . I would  recommend it .</li>
            <li> First off, let me say, that I have never written a review of any product. My wife got this razor for me as an early father&#x27;s day gift. I did some research on safety razors to get some opinions and had used the One Razor for about a month. A cheap razor just to see if I could deal with the experience of shaving that way. The one razor was decent, but I really had to work to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got the Merkur. A comfortable close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honey, you are the best! Wives, get this for your husbands and show them how proud you are of your men!</li>
            <li> The best of options for razors! I got this for my husband and he loves it!</li>
            <li> After years of using disposable cartridge razors which are now upwards of four bucks a piece, I decided to try this razor and have been using it for three years with feather and derby blades. It works well with either blade if I take my time, and those blades are very inexpensive, the derby&#x27;s are about a dime a piece when bought in bulk, and they are good for three or four shaves. Thing is, if I want a quick, really good shave, the cartridge is the \\&quot;no-fuss\\&quot; way to go. I need plenty of time and not be in a rush to enjoy using this razor. Otherwise I get nicks and razor burn.</li>
            <li> Great product..it is good quality for the price.  Will be purchasing more of the blades when I run out, which will be months away, since the blades last a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> THE Merkur is the best razor you can buy. Its back to the good old days of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;You only need one blade.</li>
            <li> The handle length and weight are perfect.  This razor is much better than those I used in the early sixties.  I recommend this razor to anyone wanting to experience double edge shaving.  Disposable razors offer no advantage over double edged blade shaving.  I used the Mekur blade that came with the razor as well as Derby blades.  The Derby blade provides a good shave and is much cheaper.  Hint:  Don&#x27;t apply pressure on your razor while shaving.  Just let the weight of the razor shave your beard and you will avoid nicks and razor burn.</li>
            <li> This razor is of excellent quality and very easy to shave with.  There is no need for a longer handle.</li>
            <li> This is a FANTASTIC razor! Feels great in the hand, very high quality finish, and just feels so damn awesome to shave with!</li>
            <li> Great razor but if you have large hands the long handle is the better choice.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor that I have used. I was using a parker 99r de razor and it did a great job as well but I would always cut myself somewhere along. I decided I would give this razor a try. The razor itself is a lot shorter than the parker, but it seems to fit better in my hand. It was a lot easier to shave with, and not to mention how close of a shave I got in just 2 passes. I can&#x27;t stop touching my face since it is so smooth after using this. This will probably be my most used and favorite razor. I look forward to shaving with this every time.</li>
            <li> Great razor, thanks!!</li>
            <li> Great razor. Better than what I previously used.</li>
            <li> Amazing razor feel like a man now</li>
            <li> Good razor and works as advertised. Short and has some weight to it.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Very we&#x27;ll built worth the money!</li>
            <li> It is a nice razor. I have used safety razors since 1960. I still have a Gillette safety razor from WW2. This one is a nice medium comb. I have a really tough beard and sensitive skin. You should not over tighten the head. If you do I notice it lifts one side of the blade too much. The blade that came with it is okay but the Persona Blades seem to work better in it. I know people tout the short handle but I still prefer a slightly longer handle in my hands. Well worth the price paid. Longer handle and I would give five stars.</li>
            <li> Very nice shave.  I will never use a disposable again.  It also saves me a ton of money.  I am still using the blade that came with the handle a month later.</li>
            <li> This is a great starter razor for someone interested in wet shaving. I have been using this razor for a year, and I have not had one issue. I clean the razor before every use, and the chrome is still in great shape.</li>
            <li> I really like the weight of this razor as well as the knurled handle. The two piece design is really convenient I find. However I couldn&#x27;t not ever get a comfortable shave. I have since tried vintage Gillette&#x27;s like the tech, superspeed and Fatboy. I have also the EJ88. Often this 34hd and the EJ89 are compared to each other as a great first razor. I was torn between them but now having owned both the EJ89 for me wins hands down. My merkur actually had a spot beside where the post goes into the handle, where the plating chipped. I tried to contact merkur and emailed every listed email with no response whatsoever. Its pretty well documented then plating issues and customer service problems with merkur. I returned the razor trough amazon. I&#x27;ve never seen a razor as beautiful as the EJ89. Get the barley handle for extra grip.</li>
            <li> If you are new to wet shaving and looking for a razor , this razor is is an exceptional choice.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve learned there&#x27;s a reason why the DE Safety razors where the only real choice for shaving for 100 years.  It&#x27;s superior to the cartridge based systems in every way.  I&#x27;ve used the cartridge based system all my life and never knew anything else as the adverts lead you to believe this is the only choice.  I hated shaving.  Absolutely hated it.. I was prone to razor burn even though I only went with the grain, and passed over once which never really gave me a close shave.  Yes it felt smooth if I ran my hand along the grain, but go the other way and it felt like sandpaper... and that&#x27;s the shave I got used to for 15 years.  I started to look into different approaches to shaving and came across an article that talked about the merits of shaving the &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; way like your grandpa.  Did some digging which pointed to this razor as the beginner go to.  Purchased it and watched some videos on youtube in anticipation of getting the razor.  I admit.. I was a bit worried using a new system and feared that I&#x27;d knick and cut my self to shreds.  I purchased a pack of Astra&#x27;s Platinum razors to go with it.  I loaded it all up, put the shave cream on my face and proceeded to shave.  I gained confidence in the first couple of strokes as it was easier on my face than the cartridge&#x27;s.  My first shave I only did the one pass.. and the end result was the same as the cartridge.  So I did bit more digging and found out the secret is to do a second pass.  Holy cow.. what a difference that made... I&#x27;ve never had a smoother shave and it&#x27;s smooth to the touch going in both directions and my skin is not sore or burning in any way.  I&#x27;ll never look back to the expensive cartridges ever again.  I&#x27;ve had this razor for a week now and I look forward to shaving! My only complaint with this system is I do have a small mole on my face that I used to just shave over with no issues with cartridges, but I struck oil the first time shaving with my new Merkur, so I have to take carearound that area.</li>
            <li> Biggest problem with this razor is the fact that it only leaves a .5-1mm blade showing, so if you intend to get an amazingly close shave, you will not get that. However I would highly recommend this to someone who is unsure of how to shave with a DE.</li>
            <li> Great razor!  I&#x27;m done with those costly disposable razors!</li>
            <li> After much research i chose this over other models. The handle is shorter but it provides great grip and control. I have a rounder face and was worried the short blade wold make it harder to shave but on the contrary it allows for good control of the blade. The razor is well balanced and easy to clean. I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Great razor -just the right weight, glides easily over the face and cleans up easy. I would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great razor seems well built. Good shave for a fair price. Should last a life time and even more .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Merkur. Very high quality, great construction and provides a great shave. I&#x27;ve been using it over a year and have no complaints. I&#x27;ve got multiple brushes and accessories but only one razor. Guess that&#x27;s a testament to the quality of this razor.</li>
            <li> Words cannot describe how pleased I am with this razor. It has the quality, feel, and design your face deserves. And for about 43$, its a steal! This is the standard by which I will; and have judged all other razors. Buy this now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to the double edge world; buy this! There is nothing out there for less than 43$ that will give you quality. Its a good entry level razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you an experienced double edge guy; buy this! You will ask yourself why you have deprived yourself of this for your entire life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have an extra 43$; buy this! You will not regret it. It will introduced you to the world of double edge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a chick; buy two of these! Give one to your man and he will be happy. Use the other to shave your pits and legs; your man will be happy.</li>
            <li> I have one but bought this one as a gift for a friend.  It is the perfect razor for those just getting started with DE shaving.  It is a fairly mild shaver which means it is unlikely you will cut yourself (unless you are truly careless).  It&#x27;s not the best build quality, but for that you&#x27;re looking at two to three times the price.  I&#x27;ve used mine daily for over a year now and the fit and finish remain good as new.  There&#x27;s a reason this model has been around for so long.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with this one especially if you are new to DE RAZOR shaving like me. don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this.</li>
            <li> New interesting but works great!</li>
            <li> I tried to give it some time thinking I just had to adjust.  This will give you a decent shave but you have to go really slow.  Even when I went really slow I ended up getting cut up each day.  As nice as it would be to save money it just can&#x27;t compare to today&#x27;s multi blade razors at all.</li>
            <li> This razor is fantastic!!  I am not actually a huge fan of the Merkur blade that came with but Personna Double Edge Razor Blades seem just right for my face and I now look forward to shaving in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for a Merkur long handle which lasted about 8 years before being dropped one too many times.  Like its predecessor this one gives an excellent shave and it does seem sturdier justifying the higher price for the Heavy Duty model.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000QYEK88 Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor #34C (Blade Included)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very new to \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaving, but this is a great product.  The thing I like about it is the weight and feel it has.  I&#x27;m still learning but my shave in the morning has gone from an after thought (with a Fusion Power) to something I look forward to.</li>
            <li> This is a good safety razor, but it is not stainless steel. The head is chrome plated zinc alloy and the handle is chrome plated brass.</li>
            <li> This product works well but I like my Edwin Jagger Faux Ebony Double Edge Safety Razor better.</li>
            <li> Much classier and closer-cutting than a modern cartridge razor, and very easy to adapt to.  Makes shaving a much more rewarding activity; more relaxing as well.  I highly recommend buying a nice, weighty one like this, as the heft really allows you to stop raking the blade across your skin and let the razor&#x27;s weight do the job for you, resulting in a very smooth and gentle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of blades is much more acceptable as well.  I bought 100ct for around $13.  But be forewarned: if no one has ever told you before, RAZOR BLADES ARE SHARP!  VERY, VERY SHARP!  LIKE WAY TOO SHARP FOR BABIES AND KITTENS AND STUFF!</li>
            <li> Great quality. The handle provides enough weight for good balance without being too long or unwieldy. Merkur blades are very thin and very sharp providing a close shave.</li>
            <li> Best investment ever , my face thanks you.</li>
            <li> I use this Merkur #34C with Feather blades; previously I had only used Gillette cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur is beautiful, feels great, shaves well, and handles two-month-beard removal like a cartridge never could. I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> Product was excellent and it shaves great; just one con: razor blades were not in the box, appears they were removed. Other than that, it is wunderbar. I stand corrected, blade fell of box and found on the floor.</li>
            <li> Its just hard to get a close shave. Also the shortish handle is hard to hold on to if I&#x27;m in the shower.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical in using a double edge razor, but this makes shaving so much easier. I used Feather razor and I love how it shaves.</li>
            <li> I switched from cartridges to this, it was my first foray into wet shaving and DE razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it and will never go back. There is a learning curve of a few shaves to get your technique down, but you&#x27;ll get it fairly quickly. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and have yet to cut myself, which was a concern I had initially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a beautiful piece and cleans very easily. I purchased a variety pack of blades and have decided the best for me is the Derby DE blades, although many others worked well too, only a couple I didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. It is well made, and holds the blade exactly where it should giving an even cut on both sides. Recommended by nick shaves on YouTube [...]</li>
            <li> I used to hate shaving completely, electric razors, prior to that cartridge razors with the fake compressed can shaving cream.  I have now started the hobby of using a safety razor, this one specifically is perfect sized, only have problems in tight spaces by having a large head (Directly under the nose). Though I am enjoying the shave very much and I have only done it twice with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to not getting any ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> The only razor i&#x27;ll ever use. Best investment I ever made!</li>
            <li> Love it... Nice weight... Easy control / manufacturability... Smooth finish. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I expected this razor to be better constructed than my Parkers.  I noticed some inconsistency in my shaves and decided to pull my feeler guage out.  I measured the blade gap to see how aggressive the razor is compared to my others.  It is as expected in the mid-range--on one side that is.  The blade gap differs between the side by .18 mm when measured with a blade installed or without a blade.  I really thought that a Merkur would be better constucted.  Unfortunately, I missed the deadline for returns by 4 days.  Should have pulled out my feeler guage sooner.</li>
            <li> My guy loves this razor. I accidently left it in the hotel room and I was in trouble! I had to order a new one right away! He acted like he was dying when he had to use a store bought razor! I have used it to shave my legs a few times...it just takes to much care and time to get the job done right for me!</li>
            <li> The is very nice - I just miss the butterfly open action instead of removing head to change blade</li>
            <li> The 34C was my go-to razor for the longest time.  It&#x27;s mild and safe and the cuts I would inflict on myself were from me not being careful where I had sharply raised blemishes on my skin.  The biggest difference in the quality of your shave with this razor will be from the blade, because the razor itself is tip top.  The short handle works for most, but does not work for me.  I upgraded to the 38C and enjoy having the added weight and extra reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is all subjective, however, and this razor gets 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> This razor is by far, my favorite razor, it&#x27;s my second Safety Razor and it&#x27;s just a very smooth razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not overly aggressive, but just aggressive enough to tackle almost all types of beards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is one of the most recommended razors for beginners and long time users.&lt;br /&gt;From what I&#x27;ve inspected of the build quality and everything, it isn&#x27;t over-priced, you are getting a high quality Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy, very good knurling for a good grip and nice weight to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this razor to ANYONE who wants to get a high quality razor without dishing out a huge wad of cash!</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor, and have been using it for two weeks now, and not one single nick. It has a good weight and feel to it, nice balance. Far better than shaving with cheap disposables or expensive electric razors.</li>
            <li> My first de safety razor, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. Good feel, good weight, and looks good hanging next to the sink.</li>
            <li> I love well made tools that serve their intended purpose, so this German made beauty is right up my alley.  It&#x27;s beautifully and (from what I can see) flawlessly  designed. It&#x27;s handle is shorter than the cartridge razors I&#x27;ve used all my life but I&#x27;m ok with that because of its heavy head; this extra weight let&#x27;s the razor do all the work without me having to place extra pressure on the handle to press the razor against my face. So I really don&#x27;t need the leverage of a longer handle the way I needed it with a cartridge razor and I still get the close shave I crave without the irritation. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back to cartridge razors ever again!</li>
            <li> Has an amazing feel in the hand. Blades are easy to change, shave is close and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wetshaving for a year and a half now. Before I joined the military I would only shave maybe once or twice a month. I was used to walking around like a scraggly faced hobo. After I got out of boot camp I was having issues getting my A-school instructors to believe I had shaved in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There had to be a better way.&lt;br /&gt;So i bought the cheapest safety razor I could find and a pack of feather hi-stainless blades. There was a bit of a learning curve, but the shaves were the smoothest I had ever had. I was still using regular shaving cream, the gillet gel type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to up my game. I bought psoraso green soap. My eyes were open. I had understood the lies at the heart of the american  dream. No. Wait. That was the time I read &amp;#34;fear and loathing in las vegas&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my eyes were open. Why had men switched from such a sensible, elegant, and ultimately cheaper method of shaving towards ever more gimmicky and increasingly less effective disposable razors? I don&#x27;t know. The wet shaving method is clearly more effective. With practice it takes only five to ten minutes to get an excellent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never look back, shipmates.</li>
            <li> I really like the weight and quality of this product, but I wish the handle was about an inch longer. I know there&#x27;s a version with a longer handle, and that will likely be my next purchase. However, I bought this one because I have fairly small hands for a guy so it seemed like the right move at the time. I don&#x27;t regret it and it works great, just wish it was longer.</li>
            <li> good razor. the angle is not very aggressive so good for beginners.</li>
            <li> The razor is somewhat heavy but handles well. Blade included is fair, but does a nice job.  Only used once.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using a EJ 89LBL for a bit now because most reviews said the Merkur 34C HD was too aggressive of a shaver. After a year now I purchased my first Merker 34C HD. I don&#x27;t know how the ones who reviewed this razor said its too aggressive. I got my best and smoothest shave since I started DE Shaving. I don&#x27;t know if the angle of the blade is different or not as much blade is exposed , but I can say, it&#x27;s definitely not too aggressive. I used the Merkur blade it came with. I also used a Derby , Wilkinson and Gillette Silver and all gave me a similar shave with zero irritation or nicks. I use to get at least one nick a week with my EJ.  AAA +++</li>
            <li> Works good. I like the shave. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the way it shaves. I am&lt;br /&gt; Never going back to double blades.</li>
            <li> I have used this item for about 3 mo. and have been completely satisfied. I had only saved with multi-blade disposable razors, but have quickly made the switch and will not be going back. I heavily debated on getting the shorter or longer handle, but after a lot of research I went with the shorter handle. I am glade as the razor feels very comfortable in my hand. It is a different style of shaving, but I feel that I get just as close if not closer of a shave while saving money on blades.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Merkur heavy duty double edge 34C for my husband. As the cost of replacement drug store brands has gone up dramatically he had been looking into the old school blades. I researched  the razors and was happy to find this one on Amazon. Same great Merkur razor for a lot less than our local retailers were offering. We ordered from Simply Beautiful/Amazon. They shipped quick and would happily order from them again.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the razor,my husband loves it. He said it gave the best shave ever. He has thick,curly,course hair and it gives a very clean close shave. No nicks  or razor burn either. He recommends you look up videos on The Art of Shaving store&#x27;s website for detailed directions on the best way to use these blades(says ignore videos on YouTube) and take your time while you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to enter the manly world of wet shaving. After reading numerous reviews the Merkur #34 HD kept popping up as the One to buy for new shavers. It offers the perfect balance and easy to hold. This is a medium aggressive razor. It does have some heft to it so new shaver beware - let the weight of the razor do the work. If equipped with a super sharp blade like a feather, you must take your time. What will be rewarded is a baby butt shave (BBS). Easy to load and clean. A must have.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving experience I have ever had.  I had peach fuzz all through high school so I did not start shaving until I joined the Navy when I was 18.  In boot camp we all had to shave every morning no matter how many whiskers we had on our face, and we all had to use the same type of razor, a Gillette Atra.  Since this was my first shaving experience I just kept on using Gillette razors, from the atra to the sensor and eventually the mach 3.  30 years later I discover this razor, and all I can say is I can&#x27;t understand how our fathers and grandfathers ever let someone convince them that a plastic multi blade razor was an improvement over this type of razor.  I just lather up my face, hold the razor against my face and control it as it slides down, allowing the weight of the razor do the work.  Then I re-lather and slide the razor against the grain, once again allowing the weight of the razor do the work and I have a nice comfortable shave.  I love this razor and it is a definite improvement over my old mach 3, plus replacement blades are a hell of a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the great reviews. I tried it for two weeks and it&#x27;s just flat out terrible, trust me I tried many different ways to shave with it, stick with Gillette razors, nobody comes close to them.</li>
            <li> This model is the most popular of the safety razors according to online reading. The blades are surprisingly thin. I did not have any problems with the blade shifting around or being misaligned with the included blade.I like the short handle. No problems shaving with this. But of course it&#x27;s not a cartridge blade so you must keep your face moisturized. Shave was close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face shaving is all setup now to be affordable, fun, and very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving my back hair (yes girls hate it) with cartridge/disposables using the awesome and simple and elegant [[ASIN:B002MUAP2E Razorba Back Hair Shaver]] which gives me a comfortable, safe, close, diy, and easy reachable back hair shaving. I just plug in a sensor excel razor, cheap, no special razors, no batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since you&#x27;re getting a DE face shaver, might as well get a DE body shaver. I started using the newer Bro Shaver Back Hair Shaver for back and body shaving  [[ASIN:B01JB4UQ7C NEW! BRO SHAVER BACK HAIR SHAVER uses Refillable Standard Double Edge Safety Razor Blades Replaceable for Pennies, DIY, Stainless Steel Bolts, Compare to competitor baKblade]]</li>
            <li> Perhaps not, but it&#x27;s just as good if not better than most cartridge type razors and much cheaper in the long run...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m new to this style of razor, but I found this razor simple to use and to clean and I get just as good a shave with this as the higher end disposable cartridges (I know somebody will take issue with me not immediately saying that &amp;#34;it was the best shave of my life&amp;#34;, but my cheeks aren&#x27;t sophisticated enough to know the difference...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big win - blades are sooooo much cheaper and last much longer!</li>
            <li> This is a relatively mild razor but it&#x27;s great to learn technique. On badger &amp; blades aggressiveness scale it gets a 3 which is plenty to learn with. There aren&#x27;t many better razors to learn with. Try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. A true classic.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor, well done. I would say get a dissent razor blade and you will never use disposable razor again.</li>
            <li> I was tired of spending a lot of money on the super duper 20 blade 50 horse power blades that just irritated my skin. I ordered Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor #34C because of the excellent feedback after doing a lot of research. I used it last night for the first time and could not believe how smooth and easy this thing shaves! I used the Mercur blade that it came with and I have no complaints whatsoever.    It&#x27;s built like a tank and shaves as smooth a silk. I did not get any razor burn or ingrown hairs! Wow!!! I am thoroughly impressed! Other then profit I cannot see why you can&#x27;t buy this product at the local grocery stores or pharmacies. I will NEVER go back to using regular commercial razors. I strongly recommend this product, excellent quality, built for life, easy to use, cheap to replace blades and shaves closer than anything on the market!     Please note: that you need a good shave soap or shave cream (not that combustible stuff in a can) for this product to work efficiently as designed. I recommend Speick shave cream with this razor, a good badger brush, and whatever your choice is of aftershave.</li>
            <li> I never enjoyed or looked forward to shaving until I switched to the DE razor.  It forces you to take a little more time but well worth it.  I really feel like I am pampering my face.</li>
            <li> The weight of this shaver makes shaving with even the sharpest blade a pleasure. The knurled handle keeps me in control, even with wet hands. I won&#x27;t look any further.</li>
            <li> Always use this over my Parker 99r. Awesome razor.</li>
            <li> Item just as described... Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to wet shaving with a double edge razor. I had a cheap Walmart DE razor and I loved it so I wanted to step up my game. I read a lot of reviews and listened to a few friends and man am I happy that I did. I love this DE razor! The construction is extremely sturdy, the razor looks to be very well made and you can tell that the Germans really took their time building this thing! My first shave with this razor was like a dream compared to my other razor! I used a brand new blade but didnt have a great soap and it was still a great shave! I also shaved with a razorock soap later and it got even better! This is a great razor and I am so glad that I made the change to wet shaving and getting very far away from the cartridge gimmick!</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the better purchases I&#x27;ve made.  The quality is top-notch.  Clearly this is a product that is not only built to last a lifetime, but to be passed down from father to son and maybe one more time after that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the cost savings I&#x27;m experiencing using this razor instead of the Gillette line is astonishing.  My Gillette Mach5 heads were costing around $28 for a pack of 5, if I remember correctly.  In contrast, I purchased 100 blades for my Merkur razor for about $9.  I bought these blades last year and am still not through the lot!  To put this into a bit better perspective, the Merkur razor along with 100 blades cost me less than 6 months worth of Gillette Mach 5 heads alone (which is to say, not including the price of their razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I this next bit is somewhat subjective, but it deserves mentioning: my wife and I agree that the Merkur gives me a much better shave than the Gillette Mach 5 system.  Much. Better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to sum up: amazing quality, very low price (compared to other products), better shave. Why would you NOT purchase this Merkur razor?</li>
            <li> Nice razor. I would recommend it.  It has a nice natural weight that helps to make shaving easy and comfortable.  I am an experienced Safety Razor shaver and I find this razor not to be very aggressive. I&#x27;ve been shaving with this razor for the past few weeks now and have not given myself so much as a nick.  I have shaved with other razors which seem easier to nick yourself with.  This razor would be great for a beginner. I am thinking about purchasing one for my brother as a gift. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> My first time using a safety razor. This one is recommended by most sites I&#x27;ve read and I can see why. It&#x27;s a solid product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> In a word, this is a solid razor.</li>
            <li> I think I may have fallen in love with my new baby soft face!!  I have used cartridge razors from the moment I started shaving and always hated to shave.  This razor makes me appreciate my smooth face all over again.  My wife finally approves of how my face feels.  Not to mention the lack there of in terms of irritation and redness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never going back to a standard cartridge razor again.  Having to shave a lot with the fire department, I wanted something more efficient while being close at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing takes a bit of practice (I highly recommend short strokes the first shave or two) but wow,  this is the best investment you can get with shaving.  Simply put, go buy one now.</li>
            <li> Yea it might cost a little bit more in the beginning, but this razor gives me a better shave and it is going to save so much money in the long run.  Cartridges are so over priced for disposable razors.</li>
            <li> The quality of the engineering of this is built to last a lifetime and work just as long. The extra weight of the head does all of the work with regards to pressure and ensures a smoothe shave.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE safety razor.I like it so far,good stuff!</li>
            <li> Handle is to short on this razor! Great weight and quality razor.&lt;br /&gt;This razor should have been supplied with two handles a short one and a longer one.</li>
            <li> I started with a double edged safety razor and have tried various shaving methods for the past 30 years. The search is over. Solid design and quality blades have resulted in my best shaves ever. I enjoy skipping the shave over the weekend and there&#x27;s no more pulling through the resulting 3 day shadow when it&#x27;s time to go back to work. No more cuts or nicks on the first shave waiting for the new blade to be broken in. I&#x27;m planning on purchasing one as a gift for my old-school father and am certain he&#x27;ll appreciate the quality. If I still have to say it... HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> This was the first razor I bought when I switched off cartridge razors.  I&#x27;ve tried open comb razors, and TTO razors, and this one is the one I keep coming back to.  It&#x27;s built very solid, it has a good heavy feel in the hand.  The knurling is deep and grips very well when wet.  I have NEVER dropped this razor, which I can&#x27;t say for any of the others I own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two-piece design makes blade changes a snap, and the razor holds the blades evenly and securely, giving you a consistent easily repeatable shave every time.  The construction is high-quality, rest assured this razor will likely outlive you under normal use and abuse.  And the plating is smooth, even and consistent, lending to a comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fairly mild razor, mild enough to shave with it daily without irritation; but open enough and with enough blade exposure and clearance to easily tackle a few days of growth.  This is a really good all-rounder.  I would recommend it for anyone, whether you&#x27;re just getting started in DE shaving, adding to your collection, or replacing a broken daily shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband started the family revolt against the expensive plastic disposables.  I found a site online all about switching back to the double edge, so I followed the advice and got this Merkur and an assorted blade pack.  Husband loves it, so I did the same for my son and he loves it.  Son #2 will get the pack for his birthday.</li>
            <li> While pricing out replacement Mach 3 cartridges I stumbled on reviews for safety razors, an idea I had never considered. After the many reviews I decided to take a shot and I am glad I did. Bye, bye cartridges. This razor along with a brick of Feather blades, Proraso shaving cream and badger brush causes me to wonder how modern cartridge razors ever took hold to begin with. After nearly a dozen shaves, this little fella is nothing short of amazing. I shave my whole head except a goatee. Here&#x27;s the rundown:&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t nicked myself yet(with either the Feather blades or the included Merkur blade.)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clog nearly as fast as a cartridge and clears faster allowing for long passes through even several days of growth.&lt;br /&gt;Allows closer trimming of moustache and beard.&lt;br /&gt;Get four shaves per blade.&lt;br /&gt;Takes twice as long to shave and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll get much faster.&lt;br /&gt;Skin was a little tender after the first few shaves. That has dissipated, so either I&#x27;m getting better at it or my skin/hair is getting accustomed to it.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> I hated shaving. I used to use disposables and tried to finish as quickly as possible. I dreaded it. I cursed why on earth does the modern man have hair on our face. Have we not evolved past that yet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I discovered the Merkur #34C. It took about a week or two to learn the how to shave properly as the disposables gave me lots of bad habits. But now I enjoy shaving very much. It&#x27;s a ritual I look forward to, and I spend the time to pamper myself. I found my &amp;#34;me&amp;#34; time that I so desperately craved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet shaving has changed me from a shave hater to a shave lover, and the Merkur #34C was the conduit. This is a fine, quality piece of equipment. I am very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it time to shave yet?!??</li>
            <li> Well made impressive razor. The razor is a return solid craftsmanship. The trick is learning to shave with this razor. Other reviews on this site have been great in learning how to use a double edge razor. I grew up using cheap disposals. I have learned that shave oil and good lather helps avoid cuts. This first week I have cut my self 4 out 5 times but the shave is so close it is worth the pain of the learning curve. You may not be able to get a Porsche but the Merkur gives you affordable German craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor earlier this month and have to say that coming from cartridge razors, this razor blows away every razor I have ever owned and I have probably owned them all from the classic twin razor to the Mach 5 with a lubricating strip and vibrator (oh gods does that sound naughty!).  Eventually I settled on the blades from Dollar Shave Club thinking I was getting the best deal and the shaves were alright, and I’d even hazard to say that these blades were some of the best I had used.  That is until this simple, beautiful razor landed at my door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this razor is quite steep investment and at $44 it is one of the more expensive ones in its class, but once you start factoring in long-term maintenance costs -- ie, replacement blades -- this razor quickly pays off.  Even compared to the DSC, I can get more shaves -- better shaves -- for half the cost on blades.  You will need to purchase a good shave soap, some alum or a styptic pen, some lotion, and aftershave if you want a great shave, but those are really required for any great shave.  Just keep in mind you will want to at least upgrade your shave cream to a proper cream if you are using Barbersol or other aerosol based product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself came in a box with one blade.  I was a bit disappointed about this, but the blade itself is decent, however, I am going to upgrade to Feather blades because I have a rather course and thick beard which means I need a sharper blade.  The blade itself is quite sharp and effective, but shaving around the neck caused a bit of skipping.  What was impressive, even on the first shave there was minimal cutting and bleeding.  Less so with the DSC blades and I rarely cut myself on those.  With decent technique, even a novice to DE wet shaving, it is hard to cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is very well weighted and balanced.  It exposes enough blade for a great cut, but enough guard to make it hard to make any serious cuts.  The textured handle is really nice on this product and makes it very stable to hold: it would be difficult to accidentally drop this razor even with wet, soapy hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is also very sensitive as well, so shaving with cartridge razors would always result in razor bumps and burn.  Not so with the Merkur.  The first time I shaved, the blade did cut over the tips of some of my previous bumps from the DSC razor, but a few hours after the shave I couldn’t tell.  Shaving the next time was like cutting through butter and left me with a baby smooth face, though there is a little bit of stubble around the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor doesn’t get gummed up during the shave and dipping and shaking in a warm bowl or water or giving it a blast from the faucet will suffice during a shave and the metal absorbs the heat and feels great of the face.  After the shave, cleaning the razor is simple as most of the time a good run-through of hot water will suffice.  Changing the razor and giving it a full cleaning is simple: just twist the bolt at the bottom of the razor, hold the top piece of the head and the side of the razor and pull apart gently. From there changing is simple: remove blade, wash or replace, put back onto handle, and tighten screw.  It takes only a few seconds and the whole thing has a very solid feel and construction once fully assembled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would give this a solid four out of five simply because I think that it should ship with a few more courtesy blades given the cost; otherwise I would have given it five stars.  I would and have recommended this razor to friends, and if you are looking for a great wet shave look no further.  While it might not be as flashy or cool as the butterfly models Parker makes, it makes up for in simplicity and solid design.e is really nice on this product and makes it very stable to hold: it would be difficult to accidentally drop this razor even with wet, soapy hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is also very sensitive as well, so shaving with cartridge razors would always result in razor bumps and burn.

            <li> I am really glad that I decided to buy the Merkur 34c. I forgot what a good shave the old Double Edge razors give, plus all the money that I save not buying razors every month or so.</li>
            <li> I shave my head every day and I have been spending hundreds of dollars on other commercial razors. Then I heard about Merkur and read the reviews and learned about it. Now, I have been using it for couple of months and I can say that I am never going back to commercial razors again!</li>
            <li> Blade gap uneven, good quality chrome finish.  Blade can be moved around inside the head which can leave uneven blade exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaves very close and smooth for me with a feather blade.  Every other blade I&#x27;ve tried, Merkur, Bolzano, PolSilver, and Personna Lab Blues, have really left me raw, bloody, and sore.  Should&#x27;ve spent a little more on a mergress.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only owned this razor for a couple days, but I already love it. I just upgraded from a \\&quot;Feather Popular\\&quot; razor with feather blades, and the difference is unbelievable. I didn&#x27;t even feel the blade against my skin with the Merkur, yet it was doing its job very well. I got one of the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever gotten with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some users seem to dislike the included blade, but try it anyway since blades work differently for different people. It&#x27;s working very well for me so far</li>
            <li> Awsome! should have made this purchase years ago.</li>
            <li> I could IMMEDIATELY tell that I made the right choice in this razor. My first razor was the Parker 99r and I now realize that it was a more aggresive razor. The merkur HD is more suitable for a beginner and even the more experienced shavers.</li>
            <li> Nice razor.  I&#x27;m using Persona USA made blades with it (works well for my sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> I have black thick facial hair which tugs and pulls with most razors leaving me with burn and irritation. Sometimes in grown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually used Gillette Fusion line of razors which were good. But i was sick of paying nearly $20 for a four pack of blades or new razors. So my buddy who is italian and pretty much a beard afficinado recommended the Merkur 34c to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered it Tuesday and got it now as of Saturday. I was timid on the first shave but for ONE blade it had a WAYY smoother stroke without yanking than any razor i have ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE. This is a product i think i will be using for life and im only 22. Worth the $43 a nd razors are extremely cheap.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have EVER had. Going back to 1981 when I was beginning to shave! This is the real deal. This Shaver with Japanese blades have made shaving a good experience. I have a disposable when I gotta go! When I want a GREAT close shave, I have MY Merkur 34C, and Japanese blades. This razor was so outstanding right Out Of The Box! Check it out! You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Works best with lubricating creme or soap. Oh, BTW, listen to Fear Of Lipstick on your music player while you shave!</li>
            <li> 1st DE razor but fantastic product, short handle but heavy enough to do the job</li>
            <li> I love the quality but I didn&#x27;t realize the handle was so short, but eventually I was able to adjust</li>
            <li> I was afraid of shaving with the D/E razor but talked with friends who are using them and decided to buy. The single most important rule is to go slow.  I had the razor for two weeks before I nicked myself (going fast).  I&#x27;ve used both the Merkur blades and a friend gave me a Feather.  I like both right now.  I use Nivea sensitive shave gel and get a great shave. Don&#x27;t be afraid to use D/E. Can&#x27;t beat the cost per blade!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Mach 3 Turbo for many years, but was really interested in trying the old school method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading reviews on many razors, I decided to splurge on this one. I used my favorite brush and Jack Black Supreme Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following advice from reviews, I applied no pressure and let the weight of the razor just rest on my skin. The strokes were easy and pain free, and the result was closer than Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, there is more potential for nicks with these, but I was surprised how easy and effective it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wavering and not sure about trying this razor - go for it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much more I can write about a Classic. A great starter razor, the Merkur blade is also a very forgiving blade and allows you to learn if you are new to wet shaving. I recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> Never owned or used one of these types of razors before [heck, never even heard of one until lately], and I thought it would be a little short to work with by the looks of it on Amazon, but once it comes in, just play around with it without the blade and get a feel for it, position your fingers in various ways. I&#x27;ve been using it for only a couple days and now I like to hold it with my thumb and index/forefinger on the skinny tapered neck part [just under the head] and with the bottom end of it resting on the edge of my palm between my pinky and ring fingers wrapped around it. It sits nicely there and I feel a bit more confident with it [also because of the grippy rough diamond texture on the handle]. it should work fine with big hands. you might not need the slightly bigger Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl [in case you were looking at that one too].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some aloe plants in my yard so I cut a section off a leaf, scratch up the inside with a small knife, and rub the gooey gel all over my face. It&#x27;s pure plain and simple and healthy. I could also use unrefined coconut oil. i don&#x27;t use shaving creams or soaps of any kind, which no matter how &#x27;natural&#x27; they may be, aren&#x27;t truly natural [always gotta be some darn chemical or refined ingredient in there or just unnecessary stuff].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hold [tilt] the razor about 30 degrees out and I make short light strokes without applying too much pressure, as it really is nice and heavy duty with good weight to it. It smoothly slices off the hairs on its own, no tugging or pulling, and it feels like a nice shave after. no irritation, no nicks or cuts or ingrown hairs [of course, as long as you only go with the grain and do it slow and steady]. it is waayyy much better than all them regular multiblade cartridge razors. totally worth it. if you&#x27;ve never had one before, don&#x27;t fear it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new into DE razors, so this is my first and only DE razor but it&#x27;s hard to imagine what can be improved on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a great weight to it, a simple but elegant look and a perfectly knurled handle that&#x27;s nice and grippy. Okay, one gripe is it doesn&#x27;t do that cool butterfly open on top like I&#x27;ve seen some other razors do, instead the whole top just unscrews by twisting the bottom of the handle. Not as cool, but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s enough to dock it because now it doesn&#x27;t have an ugly split down the center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me however this works great. I used to shave with cartridge razors every other day or every third day depending on how I felt. I like using this razor so much I shave every day now. Hell, if I have to take a second shower in a day before going out I&#x27;ll use it twice in one day! Something about it is just fun, and the shave feels a million times better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use this razor for my neck and head (no face, the beard will always be there), and while it takes a little getting used to in just a few weeks I&#x27;ve got the pattern down and can shave my neck in seconds and my head in a couple of minutes while getting a closer shave than cartridge ever allowed and without nicking myself (okay, well, the occasional nick, still).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, at least for me, the Merkur blades don&#x27;t seem to be as well engineered as the handle itself. Sure, they work, but I have been using Personna blades to great satisfaction and am looking to try others as well when these run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all very pleased. I have always had a liking for things a bit more old school because, well, many older tools seem to provide with better results, albeit with more associated risk or effort involved. That is certainly true of DE razors, but your grooming ritual won&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re playing with a toy, either. There are of course cost benefits that for me show up rather quickly: cartridge razors are expensive-- a pack of 15 costs around as much as this razor itself does. For a fellow that shaves his head I went through cartridge razors fairly quickly, and while I replace these razors with the same regularity, they&#x27;re tons cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately now I will have to check my luggage everywhere I go. Damned if I will switch back to those expensive cartridge razors for the convenience of being able to do carry-on.or itself does.

            <li> I decided to try shaving with a DE safety razor after being repulsed by the cost and styling of the Gillette cartridge razors (what kind of man wants to shave with something that looks like a character from a Transformers movie?) and finding that the more elegant and economical Harry&#x27;s cartridge razor, while excellent for what it is, didn&#x27;t shave any better than the Gillette razors. It still tugs and rips at the hairs, inviting razor burn and ingrown hairs, just like every other cartridge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the extremely helpful wet shaving celebrities on YouTube recommend the Merkur 34C HD as the ideal safety razor for novices, and after my first shave, it&#x27;s easy to see why. Would I be able to find the right angle? Would I be able to use short strokes without any pressure, overcoming my cartridge razor habits? Would it tug? Would I feel like I was always on the verge of cutting myself? Would I actually cut myself? These are some of the unknowns facing the first-time DE shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the first stroke with the 34C put my concerns to rest. I just lined up the safety bar with my side burn, held the razor at angle that felt balanced in the hand, and let the razor glide down my cheek under its own weight for an inch. Oh! That&#x27;s the way shaving is supposed to feel! It doesn&#x27;t tug or pull at all. You just feel the blade slicing cleanly and effortlessly through the stubble. Finding the angle was a non-issue. If it&#x27;s at the right angle, it shaves. If it&#x27;s too parallel or perpendicular, it just doesn&#x27;t shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because your shaving with a robust hunk of metal, you get excellent feedback on what the blade is doing. You can feel it cut and hear it cut. It&#x27;s a very reassuring sensation. After a few strokes, it very quickly becomes intuitive, and you just know what inputs into the razor will give you that positive feedback. I thought I would only go straight down for my first few shaves to get the hang of it, but by the end of my first pass I felt likeI could go crosswise on the next pass. A couple strokes on my cheek is all it took to find the angle and get just as comfortable shaving in this direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a very conservative cleanup pass after that and wound up with a categorically smoother shave on most of my face than I&#x27;ve ever had with a cartridge razor. I didn&#x27;t do as well right up under my nose, and I was gentle on my lower neck where I know I&#x27;m sensitive, so I did about as well there as I normally do. My skin felt smooth and healthy with no irritation. It definitely seemed like a far less traumatic experience for my face than the cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tremendously satisfied with my first DE shave. It easier, smoother, and more enjoyable than I anticipated, and I look forward to my next shave. It can only get better from here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also completely satisfied with the Merkur 34C HD. It lives up to the hype. Besides being easy to use and giving a smooth enjoyable shave, it exudes the quality and refinement of a finely crafted tool. It&#x27;s a beautiful object, in a manly and minimalist aesthetic, and it&#x27;s a nice thing to own in that respect. It&#x27;s also the rare thing these days which is obviously designed to last. There is no part or detail on this razor which feels cheap or disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other details of my shave:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade: I will use the sample Merkur blade which came with the razor at some point, but for this shave I used a Personna &amp;#34;Comfort Coated&amp;#34; blade which comes in a blue box of 100 blades for $12. These blades come highly recommended on the Internet as an inexpensive middle-of-the-road blade (sharp but not excessively sharp) which is made in the USA. Being the first blade I&#x27;ve tried, all I can say is that I had no problems with it. It cut smoothly and did not cause any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush: I used an Omega Professional (model 10049) boar hair brush. This brush is cheap and huge. It&#x27;s bigger than I expected and does not fit in standard brush stands. It&#x27;s still breaking in and just a tiny bit scratchy. Boar hair brushes are supposed to be good for face lathering (which seems like better and faster preparation than bowl lathering). I started using this brush with my Harry&#x27;s cartridge razor a few times before using the 34C. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble producing good lathers, but in hindsight I think I would be happier with a smaller brush. This beast can get unwieldy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather: I used Nivea Men Sensitive Shaving Cream, which comes in a 3.5oz tube. This cream got some great reviews along the lines of &amp;#34;I&#x27;m astonished that a cheap cream from a big global brand is my new favorite cream&amp;#34;. I definitely recommend this for new wet shavers. It&#x27;s very easy to use and produces a very slick lather. It&#x27;s high in glycerin, so it holds lots of water and leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated. Maybe someday I&#x27;ll try the expensive stuff from Taylor of Old Bond Street and the like, but for now I&#x27;m happy with this Nivea cream. I also have a puck of Arko soap, which didn&#x27;t work as well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set and Setting: I did my first DE shave on a lazy Sunday morning after a nice long shower, and I encourage other newbies to do similarly. It didn&#x27;t take an enormous amount of time, about 20-25 minutes including lathering. But you don&#x27;t want to be pressured for time. You want to take as much time as you need to pay attention to all the new sensations that guide the shaving process. My plan is to shower and shave at night this week to get more practice. Hopefully by next week I have this down to 15-20 minutes and be comfortable DE shaving in the morning before work. Experienced shavers can do it in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor and I must say I am happy with it overall.     I was concerned that the handle would be too short, but now that I have used it for month, I like the maneuverability it offers. I previously used an electric, so I didn&#x27;t have too many bad habits to unlearn like with cartridge razors. It has plenty of weight to provide a comfortable shave too.</li>
            <li> My first DE Razor. The Merkur HD is a safe bet for all beggining DE razor shavers out there. I used to shave with disposables and cant imagine switching back to them. The Merkur HD is of high quality, and affordable blades make it the logical choice for all men suffering from five o&#x27;clock shadows out there. It has a good short grip to it. I use Merkur blades for my thin hairded beard but i reccommend getting a sampler pack to find what blade suits your santa claus the best. I&#x27;ve had mine for two months now and it shows no signs of rust or deterioration. I reccomend it.</li>
            <li> After trying out the cheapo 5 blade razor I decided to splurge and go retro with this safety razor. I have been using it for a week and have nothing but praise for this product. I am starting to get over my fear of cutting my throat and am finding that this is incredibly smooth and shaves close even with the light touch that is required. I am still learning the ropes involved in shaving close under my nose and on the curves of my chin but I am getting there. The razors that are included are good and last about 3-4 shaves (I have medium stubble). My advice is not to try a dry shave and do not go against the grain of your hairs until you have a better feel for the razor. This razor has been very forgiving and I have not gotten many nicks. I&#x27;ll probably try out the variety pack of razors to find the right brand. I don&#x27;t think I will ever get the big name rip-off razors again.</li>
            <li> This handle makes shaving &#x27;Fun&#x27;  If you are new to this type of shaving handle, take your time while shaving to reduce nics and cuts.  The handle is a bit of an expense but the blades are economical.  I have made the transition from &#x27;FU$ION&#x27; system and will be using this for years to come.  I shave in the shower and I get very good results with this product.</li>
            <li> Back to my roots: cultural and shaving. I began shaving ca. 1960 with a double-edge razor and now I&#x27;m back. My first shave with this razor, with one of the included Merkur blades, was incredible. I can hardly wait to try the Feather blades I purchased with this razor. Bye-bye, disposables. --Ron</li>
            <li> My Gilette Fusion was my only razor for the longest time. It often left me with lots of irritation and a reasonably close shave. I wanted something that would give me a better shave, with less irritation. The Merkur 34C fit the bill. The razor has a good weight to it, and feels way better in the hand than any cheap plastic razor. I was worried that shaving with a single blade would be difficult, but it turned out to be just as easy as my Fusion. No nicks, closer shave, and most importantly, no irritation. As an added bonus, blades are ridiculously cheap. Thirty bucks got me 12 cartridges before, now i can easily get 200+ blades for the same price. So before you run out and buy more cartridges for your old standby, pick a double edge razor and give it a shot. Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> Ditched the cartridges forever. If you&#x27;re even considering this, don&#x27;t look back.</li>
            <li> the handle is just shy of 3&amp;#34; but heavy. it looks like it&#x27;s going to be too short but once you use it for a while you see why it&#x27;s made that way. there is a longer-handled version if you really need it. see other reviews for more details. i wish i amazon would allow me to choose the length of my own reviews, sometimes there isn&#x27;t much to say, particularly if there are lots of reviews already and you only have one thing to add. people get tired reading the same thing over and over, looking for usable information.</li>
            <li> this is small but I love it. smaller and thicker body looks much better in chrome. another shiny star in my armor. try with wilkinson sword blades</li>
            <li> Awesome razor. It is definitely shorterf than most disposables but its actually nice to use. Handling is not an issue and the razor with the blade that came with it which is the brand of the razor provided a very nice close shave. Happy I made this purchase. No more paying for expensive blades for the razor I did use. Shaving is not as much of a chore now as it was. Wish I would have switched to this method years ago. One pass shaving and I had the closest shave ever and no nicks or cuts if you just take your time.</li>
            <li> This razor is great and is everything I was looking for.  Paired with a blade that works well with your type of hair you will get one of the best shaves of your life.  Amazingly smooth goodness your partner will appreciate.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor since the day I purchased, great clean shave, intimidating look but works great,  goodbye Gillette!</li>
            <li> Great razor. Heavy, looks beautiful, and fits nicely in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to change out disposable razors, and it feels incredibly sturdy. Basically it does everything I hoped it would do, and it looks good enough to keep on my kitchen sink! Now to choose a razor blade brand..</li>
            <li> This razor is definitely worth the money! For $44.00, it&#x27;ll pay for itself in less than 3 Fusion 4-pack cartridge refills. The others that have written reviews on this razor know what they&#x27;re talking about. It&#x27;s all in the technique you use. With this razor, there is no need to apply any pressure - let the weight of the razor do the work. It&#x27;s much heavier than your standard plastic Gillette or Schick. I had m 4th shave with it tonight and each time it&#x27;s getting better and better. The more you use it, the better you&#x27;ll become. As far as blades are concerned, I purchased a 5-pack at my local drug store for $1.00 (that&#x27;s right, $1.00). It&#x27;s the store brand but I had one of the best shaves of my life. If it&#x27;s this good with the cheap ones, I can&#x27;t wait to buy some expensive ones, for like $5.00!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not be sorry. If you&#x27;re like me and you enjoy a clean, comfortable shave, do yourself a favor and give this a try. Don&#x27;t get discouraged. You&#x27;ll need some practice but it&#x27;ll be worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied both with my decision to change to using a double edge razor and the quality of this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is not very long, but I find that it is easy to grip and maneuver. While this did feel out of place initially, I think a longer handle would add to the difficulty of shaving. Blades are easy to change, the styling of the razor is attractive, and so far the feel for the quality is very high (weight, finish, precision of parts fitting together).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest advantage I received by switching to this razor from a Gillette MACH3 is that I experience significantly less skin irritation, especially on my neck. I have had no razor bumps at all on my neck since using this razor, and these were always a concern before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuts were a concern before I began using the razor. Following advice I read, I began by only shaving down for the first two weeks. After this two-week period, I began shaving up as part of a second pass. I received a few minor nicks the first time I shaved up, not not subsequent times. Shaving is not as easy, and the size of the shaving head makes it more difficult to see when near sideburns or underneath my nose. This relatively minor disadvantage is far outweighed by less irritation for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect product. After over a month of use, I see no rust or any other points to complain about. The design is simple, and it works as it should. To think I almost spent $80 on one at The Art of Shaving store. Their mark-up is driven only by brand-name, not functional superiority.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this razor and have enjoyed the change to this shaving method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very small, however for me this is for the best - it helps not to put too much pressure when shaving. It&#x27;s heavy so it does the work for you. Strongly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Mach 3 cartridge razor my whole life, and decided to get into DE shaving after reading a really good article, talking about the benefits. This particular model has been considered a standard, and reputable for being of the highest quality and long lasting. I have to say I am completely pleased with my purchase and have since been trying to my friends to also purchase this razor. Shaving used to be an expensive chore, now it is something I look forward to! Cheaper, less irritation, better for your skin and for the environment... one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> I recently got back into wet shaving using a safety razor. I bought this razor based on some of the reviews I was reading online. I have used it now for several weeks and it does a nice job. Very comfortable and forgiving. Very smooth shave with very little irritation. The gap between the safety bar and the razor is spaced well and not overly aggressive.  I have sensitive skin and have been prone to ingrown hairs. This razor has been perfect. No ingrown hairs since using it.  The razor is heavy and feels great in your hand. I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Best way to shave. Great weight in hand. Easy to clean, maintain. Great value for the price - should last a lifetime with proper care.</li>
            <li> using one of these takes a little longer than more modern cartridge razors, but the shave is smoother...and so much cheaper.  if you&#x27;re switching to &amp;#34;wet shaving&amp;#34; with a razor like this, you&#x27;ll also need some pre-shave oil and a styptic pencil or alum block, at a minimum.  i really like the personna blades, which you can find on amazon for about $10 for 100 and i use them for about 3 shaves each.</li>
            <li> LOVE this razor,but now I&#x27;m curious about the Seki/Feather AS-D2.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting back to DE shaving after many years away. For anyone, like me, with less than fond memories of the old gillettes, this razor is a remarkable improvement. Also much much cheaper to use over time that the current better quality cartridge razors. This thing will last more than my life time.&lt;br /&gt;Very simple to use. The top unscrews and comes off. You plop the blade on and screw the top back on. The short handle on this bad boy basically prevents you from leveraging the handle and pushing down to hard. No adjustments to the razor are necessary (or possible.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are cheaper &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; razors available. Don&#x27;t fall for those. Spend a little more and get a very high quality product that you won&#x27;t get tired of. You&#x27;ll save money in the not very long run. A lot of reviewers and you tubers love this razor, even when compared to much more expensive options. I wish more stuff was made like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One blade comes with. Order more with the razor. I recommend the Feather brand. I have reviewed those separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for close to a year, I have no complaints. One of the things to get used to is the reverse loosening(Lefty Tighty, Righty Loosey) for the blade compartment, but once done it is a very nice razor.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband...he loves it!&lt;br /&gt;It make take longer to shave,but the results are better and the refills much much cheaper!</li>
            <li> This is a great foundation for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Something that people have to remember is that your razor is only as good as the blades that you use, so please do this razor justice and get some nice blades that feel great for your skin. I have been using Merkur and Feather blades and can attest that they both fit and provide a clean, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: quick disassemble/assemble, easy to clean, fits nicely in large hands, solid construction&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to beginners to shaving with a safety razor as well as experience users.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my husband. The quality is wonderful. He loves the razor. He shaves a lot more often than he used to. It&#x27;s so much better for the environment than disposables, too.</li>
            <li> No issues. Does what I expected. Excellent craftsmanship!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the good reviews of Merkur razors. The razor is well built and feels nice in the hand. My only complaint is the lack of dimension info on the page. This is a very short razor  it&#x27;s almost too small for my hand. Other than that it&#x27;s a great razor.</li>
            <li> Ordered after reading reviews for many razors. My shave time is definitely longer while I adjust to this razor, but my skin is far less irritated than it was with my 5-blade razor.</li>
            <li> excellent! is the best ...</li>
            <li> Good razor.  Fits hand nicely and works well in shaving.</li>
            <li> I got this for my birthday and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving with straight razors off/on for the last year or so. I enjoy it, but it seems I can only occasionally get as good a shave as my disposable razors and it takes a lot longer. I think I&#x27;m not getting the blades as sharp as I need to, and it is a long learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed something that would be faster and hopefully provide as good as a shave as the disposable, I turned to the double edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the provided Merkur blade my first shave was better than that of the disposable razors (with just a hint of burn). I was astounded. I think my time with the straights, and my respect (fear) of the blade lent to such a good shave right out of the box. After 3 weeks of shaving I have had a little razor burn here and there, but nothing as bad as when I was learning to shave at 15, or when I first got the straights. I did really rush it tonight and got a little more irritation than I had been, but it seems to be a more forgiving learning curve than the straights, and a great way to get a better shave than disposables, at a better price point. I have been using a badger brush from frank shaving, and the taylor of old bond st sandalwood cream, what a delight! It&#x27;s a ritual I look forward to now! My wife has also noticed that my face has been exceptionally smooth on some occasions (still in the learning curve).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a pack of 25 different blade types, so it is highly possible I will find a blade that I get even better shaves with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a short razor, and I think it would be easier to follow old angles learned from disposables with a long handled razor, but being that this is a double edge, it may be good to start fresh. The razor has a real nice heft to it, and blade installment is easy (and you only have to do it once every 2-3 weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So get a brush and some shave cream, take your time, and enjoy exceptional shaves!</li>
            <li> Fantastic razor.  I made the change from a cartridge razor to this one about 4 years ago.  The Merkur still looks like it is brand new (once I wipe off the soap).  It has also reduced my shaving costs considerably.  Instead of buying chemicals in a can and expensive cartridge blades, I have this investment, cheap blades, and spend my money on pre-shave oil and aftershaves.  My face feels much better and shaving is actually enjoyable to me thanks to this razor.</li>
            <li> Good quality good weight and will last a life time</li>
            <li> Wonderful weight and has stayed looking good after nearly a year of use.</li>
            <li> As someone who has big hands, I kept going back and forth between this razor and one with a long handle.  I&#x27;m glad I went with this.  Unlike a traditional razor like the Mach 3, a safety razor is designed for more than one pass in different directions.  A long handle would have gotten in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has a very solid, sturdy feel to it.  It&#x27;s heavy enough to let gravity apply just the right amount of pressure.  If I ever buy another razor it would be for looks, not function.  This razor is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that this is a closed-blade razor so it&#x27;s best when used everyday or with stubble.  Open-blade razors are best used for shaving long facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Merkur razors come with a single, double-edged Merkur blade.  Its packaging is no different than anyone elses.  I would not recommend shaving with it - just throw it out.  Unlike Feather, Merkur blades do not come highly recommended.  Using it will leave you with a sub-par shave, razor burn, and regret.</li>
            <li> What a nice feeling in the hand, smooth threads inside promote easy and safe blade changes. The included blade was junk, didn&#x27;t cut my face but didn&#x27;t really cut my beard either, Immediately bought a pack of ASTRA brand blades. The razor rinses clean very easily and you can just let the weight of the razor do the work. TRY IT. Get a brush and shaving soap for the full experience.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, found this to be overpriced compared to what i received. If this would have been priced at 1/2 it would be a fair deal.  I do not recommend this product. I still utilize my Gillette multiblade razor for a better shave.</li>
            <li> I researched everything I could before buying this. Seeing who recommended what. Seems  like 90% of the sites i visited said the same thing, that ultimately you had to decide for yourself. You can read all the reviews on this razor and  the one thing you can glean from them is that this is a quality  2 piece razor. Its not too aggressive nor too safe. The razor blade seats pretty consistently,so  you don&#x27;t have to fiddles with the blade to make it square with the razor. All that said,whether beginner or veteran I do not think you can go wrong with this razor.</li>
            <li> Combining this with the included blade, a badger brush, and some Proraso shave soap, provided an excellent shave!  Well done!</li>
            <li> I love it! Bye-bye Infusion!</li>
            <li> I cannot say that I shave often lately but when I do... this is a pleasure with this Razor. Please buy some good Japanese razor blades.</li>
            <li> I just tried this razor for the first time.  I used to use Gilette ProGlide.  When I first tried the Merkur, I thought it wasn&#x27;t working because there was no resistance at all -- but it was working fantastically.  For best results, you have to shave against the grain with it -- that&#x27;s why the shorter-handle version is better than the long handle.  I was a little bit afraid of cutting myself with it -- but I have no cuts.  This razor shaves so close I&#x27;m afraid of ingrown hairs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is extremely cost-effective compared to Gilette.  The ProGlides I used to use are $50 for 12 blades.  The best blades for this Merkur (Feather, which I have not yet tried -- I&#x27;ve just used the blade that came with the Merkur)  are under $15 for 50 two-edged blades.  I&#x27;m expecting 50 to last me at least 6 months, if not a year.  I have a very thick beard and shave every day.</li>
            <li> I prefer my Edwin Jagger DE89 Knurled handle razor.  The Merkur 34C is a good razor.  I like the weight and grip and it gives a fine shave.  The posts that attach the head to the base are just a little loose requiring me to check and adjust alignment whenever I load a blade.  I don&#x27;t have to do that with my Edwin Jagger, vintage Gillettes, or my $15 Feather Popular.  The finish on the Edwin Jagger is also much nicer.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong: i like the 34C.  If it wasn&#x27;t for the slack in the blade alignment, i would give it five stars.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent safety razor, at least based on my limited experience. Very easy to set up, short heavy handle feels great and makes it easy to control, blades come off easily. Overall great product and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Merkur Heavy Duty #34C Razor after having used a single blade injector razor for the past 30 years. I read the reviews of this razor used with the Feather blades and since most of the reviews were really good I purchased one. I&#x27;ve used it for about a week now and although it does an excellent job it&#x27;s only marginally better than the injector razor that I formerly used. I still have to shave &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; to get a really good shave just as I did with the injector razor and by doing that I get about the same results as I did before. I do like the heft and feel of it and it&#x27;s well made but I&#x27;m disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t shave a bit closer. The Feather blades are excellent with not even a hint of getting cut. I think the cutting &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; with the Feather blades is really overblown. All in all, it&#x27;s a good razor but not the shaving panacea that some would have you believe.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he LOVES it!!</li>
            <li> First time DE shaver, and this is my first ever DE razor.  After two months of shaving with this I haven&#x27;t nicked or cut myself once, and I love the shave.  My first round has been with Merkur blades, and I&#x27;m about to experiment with other brands, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have a goof here and there, but overall I love the feel of the razor, the quality, the look, etc.  The handle is small, and I know that bothers some people due to the &#x27;size&#x27; of their hands, but you shouldn&#x27;t be gripping this thing like a pipe wrench.  There&#x27;s plenty of area for your fingertips on this razor, and the pattern on the handle provides a great slip free hold.  I&#x27;m sure the longer handled ones are fine too, but I like the appearance of this little gem.</li>
            <li> handle too short for big hands</li>
            <li> Been using for about 8 months and love it. Great balance and weigh</li>
            <li> First time using a DE razor, and it has taken some adjustment, but definitely like the razor. Great price because this razor is offered at The Art of Shaving for double what you pay on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review about a week after I got this, and I loved it, first de safety every had......then my brother bought the Rick Harrison Micro Touch DE razor at wallmart and its 100000 times better, easier to clean, just twist and rinse.  I bought one the next day.  they are only 19 bucks plus 10 free razors.</li>
            <li> Gift for my husband.  I know I have done this review before this was a gift for my husband, and he really liked it. He wanted this because he wanted to go back to the old way of shaving. He was tired of buying the expensive throw away razors</li>
            <li> Are you ready for a great shave? Great Seller--Superb shave. Used with your favorite double-edged blades (I prefer Israeli-made Personna Red) this razor puts any double, triple, quattro, cinco...etc. razor to shame. Best shaves only require a single sharp blade and proper preparation. All those new-fangled over-marketed modern B.S. razors with their balls and lubricating strips and what-not aren&#x27;t worth doodly-squat. When it comes to a high-quality shave...less is more.</li>
            <li> It can be hard making the transition to wet shaving and to safety razors.  It seems a little confusing at first, and the prices seem a little high, especially if you decide you don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well guess what?  You&#x27;ll like it.  In fact, you&#x27;ll love it.  This razor makes the process effortless and amazing.  The razor is well balanced and easy to use.  It&#x27;s durable and will last you a lifetime.  Compound this with the value of razors (around twenty dollars for 100 blades) and you&#x27;re set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For around 50 bucks you should be set for over a year of shaving, as one side of each blade can easily last 3-4 shaves, meaning 6-8 shaves per blade, meaning roughly 52 blades per year. Leaving the other 50 for the following year.  This means a 2 year cost of shaving is a total of roughly 60 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid deal.  Do it. And enjoy a better, closer shave while you&#x27;re at it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for nearly 20 years. I&#x27;ve used everything from disposable razors to straight razors. I have very thick facial hair and there was pain associated with every product I tried. I tried switching from creams to gels to hot foam, it made no difference. So I grew to accept that shaving would just naturally involve a bit of discomfort. For the past 6 years I have switched to the double edged razors with the same result, still uncomfortable, but the blades are cheaper. Now I don&#x27;t buy the cheapest blades I can find, I&#x27;ve been using the feather blades which from all the reviews I could find had a pretty good rating. Well, I wanted to upgrade my razor and so again I started searching for reviews. I settled upon the Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor as it consistantly had some of the highest reviews. When I got it and tested it out I was absolutly blown away. There was no pain. No pulling, no tugging, no burning. I figured they must have some amazing blade in it, so I put one of my feather blades in it to see the difference. There was none, it was still amazing. I tried it with foam, cream, gel, (I even tried with just watter) all with the same results, completly pain free and close shave. So ya, spent almost 20 years suffering through shaving untill I landed on this razor. Now I get a quick close shave, no nicks, no pulling, no burning. I could not be more satasfied with this product. I&#x27;ve even bought a few as gifts and everyone has been equaly as impressed with the product.</li>
            <li> I used the Merkur HD for the first time tonight; this was the first time ever using a DE safety razor. I was fully expecting some blood loss...(even bought a stypic pencil). The shave was exceptionally smooth. No nicks, cuts, or irritation!</li>
            <li> Best razor! I will never go back to the plastic razors.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this razor.  I am trying different blades to find the perfect match.  Believe it or not, the blade type does make a difference, so buy a sample pack to go with this.</li>
            <li> This was my second of these, purchased strictly for business travel.  Outstanding safety razor that would be hard to improve upon.</li>
            <li> This razor is not worth the price. The chrome finish on mine began flaking and chipping after about a year, revealing the metal underneath. It seems like once the company was acquired by DOVO the quality has declined. I contacted the company and sent them a photo, and received no response - poor customer service. If you Google on this razor you will see numerous reports of the chrome flaking and chipping. I am now using a Weber and it is much better made and gives smoother shaves. If you want a razor that will last about a year or two then this is for you; otherwise, there are better quality razors out there for a little more money.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my man for Christmas. He usually shaves with expensive 3 blade razors with replaceable blade heads. He complains of razor burn and skin sensitivity after using these modern razors. After his first shave with the Merkur HD double edged razor he was amazed at how smooth and close his shave was. He seems to look forward to shaving rather than dreading the task. It was a good investment and a great gift to give.</li>
            <li> This was the first safety razor i have ever owned. I spent some time looking at differant ones and reading reviews and forum posts, and they all said the same thing...this is a great razor to own...so i purchased it. Alittle shorter than i imagined although it was about the wieght i figued it would be, but i never ever thought it would give me a shave like it did. Close, smooth, quick (i didnt have to keep going over and over and area to get the shave i was wanting) and so i will say it in my review as well...this is a great razor to own. and for me it is The last razor i will ever own.</li>
            <li> This thing is great!!! I&#x27;ve gotten the best shaves of my life with it.  Yes, the handle is shorter than a typical disposable, but that&#x27;s fine and this is a very heavy duty razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t ever go back to disposables.</li>
            <li> best shave I&#x27;ve ever had and I&#x27;m saving money</li>
            <li> This is my first doube edge razor so have nothing to compare it to but it seems very well built and I like using it.</li>
            <li> Sometime in the 70&#x27;s I switched from my trusty old Gillette double edge razor to the Schick Injector Razor and others as they were advertised and released. The price of razor blades for those lightweight pieces of crap is astounding these days. I finally switched back to what I started with, a double edged razor. It arrived today and I had grown a two day beard to see if I could still shave with one without nicking or cutting myself. I used Cremo shave cream and the 34C with a Derby blade and got the best shave I have had in years. No nicks, no cuts, no irritation, just a damn good shave. Highly recommended! Incidentally, I have large hands and long fingers, the 34C was fine as the weight and non-slip knurled grip gave the feel of old world craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> Just the best shaving experience I&#x27;ve had in about fifteen years of shaving (I&#x27;m almost 29 now).&lt;br /&gt;I find myself shaving a bit more often than I did with the multi-blade razors I used to waste my money on, but that&#x27;s no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the first blade more than five times (I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s advisable, but it&#x27;s my first safety razor, so what do I know?).&lt;br /&gt;My point is that the blades are very high quality and you don&#x27;t have to use a new one for each shave, though they&#x27;re just about cheap enough and easy to find that you probably could. I don&#x27;t like being wasteful, and this is much cheaper, &amp;#34;greener&amp;#34;, and just a better shave than what I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only possible negative thing I can report (which is most likely my fault) is the irritation I got when I shaved against the grain around my mouth. My skin is quite sensitive, so I should&#x27;ve known better. Well, now I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for a good shaving cream/soap. Thinking of trying ProRaso. It looks a little expensive, but I want to try a few brands and see what I like best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so can you!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Merkur for several months now. Amazing shave and it&#x27;s less expensive then constantly buying cartridges.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and it is virtually fool proof. It is a two piece design with the handle and comb guard as one piece and the top of the head removes to change out blades. The razor itself has a nice weight to it. I find the the handle to be a bit on the short side. when compared to holding most modern cartridge razors it feels like there just isn&#x27;t enough space available for my average sized hands. After a few weeks of use the handle size is no longer and issue and it feels plenty comfortable to hold, especially since safety razors aren&#x27;t meant to be pressed against the skin, just glided across with the shaving cream of your choice. The only suggestion I would have for someone new to safety razors is to buy a sample pack of blades and see which brand works for you. The Merkur blade that comes with this razor is not the sharpest or most forgiving blade on the market. That is the beauty of owning a safety razor, though, you can now buy ten different razor blades for less than the cost of one cartridge and each one will give you a unique shave till you find what suits you. Happy Shaving!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an old Gillette red handle for years and thought I&#x27;d try the Merkur.  Mistake!!  I cut myself on every shave.  I use feather blades,so I know it&#x27;s not the blade.  This razor just feels wrong!  Think I&#x27;ll stick with my old reliable Gillette.</li>
            <li> A single stroke was all it took and I said WOW! I&#x27;ll be throwing away my fusion and the few remaining cartridges for it. Closest shave with the least irritation I&#x27;ve ever had. So glad I decided to give this a try. Not to mention it will save me tons of money since replacement razor blades are so cheap compared to cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30yo this is my first razor like this. I love the shave. I do not like how short the handle is. My hands are not oversized. but of normal sized hands i guess of someone who is 6&#x27;3. I find that i cant make it through a full shave without my hand cramping. Having to use just fingertips to hold this caused issue for me. Although this product works great and im happy, i may purchase another with a longer handle so put relive some of the grip with my palm.</li>
            <li> This is my first attempt at using safety razor and wish I would have done it once I started shaving years ago. This razor is small and has some good weight to it. I have slim big hands so it did take getting used to. However I would prefer the compact size of this model compared to the longer handled model. I used the feather type blades and will admit that I have had the best few shaves with this item that I have ever had. I have been plagued with ingrown hairs and sensitive skin. Part of it is technique, but the other part is absolutely the lack of better shaving tools and lotions that I now have. Great razor.</li>
            <li> A very solid razor. Well built, well designed, simple to use and maintain. Some may prefer the longer handle version, but this works fine for yrs trly.</li>
            <li> Love the old school razor.  Bought one for myself and then another as a gift.  Solid construction that will last.</li>
            <li> Hi: It is as I expected: beautifully crafted and gives me a very nice shave. I&#x27;m actually looking forward to my next shave. And thanks for delivering it on time for Christmas. I ordered it so my wife would have a present for me. She was at her wits end trying to think of something nice for me for the big day at the family gathering on Christmas Eve. The men were impressed with it...Sidney J Brown</li>
            <li> My only regret is not buying one 20 years ago. What a great shave, and so economical. It has enough weight that it gets through the toughest stubble and is just the right length to alter your grip when shaving on either side of your face. I shave my head as well and there is no place I can&#x27;t get to for a smooth shave. When you consider how cheap and easy it is to replace blades, which last for a month easy, this razor will make you feel silly for not making the move years ago. Good-bye to cartridges forever! I plan on buying one for each of my brothers for their birthdays!</li>
            <li> Razor too course for light beards.  Handle too short.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. takes some time to learn how to use but this is a high quality product!!!</li>
            <li> This blade is amazing. At first i was a little skeptical even after reading all the good reviews. Some say it&#x27;s hard not to cut yourself with this blade, so i was a little concerned. To my surprise during my first shave, this cut so smoothly that i wasn&#x27;t sure if it was cutting at all! I had to look closely in the mirror to see if it indeed get the stubble and it sure did. My shaves are much closer than my old Mach 5 and it does NOT take longer than shaving with the plastic razors. After a few practice shaves, my shaves are just as fast and easy, with NO razor burn at all. These blades are incredibly sharp so you do need to put a little more care into your shaves. Those people getting a lot of cuts must either have a face with lots of curves and bumps or they are just being a little reckless with the blade.      My wife used to complain about my stubble when it touched her face, but after using the Merkur, no more complaints. Even after my stubble grows longer, she says that it feels different and less prickly.  For my wife&#x27;s sake i would sometimes shave against the grain, but that would frequently result in small cuts and always bad razor burn, but with the Merkur going against the grain is painless.  I also find that i can be much more precise with the Merkur and get those little bits of hair right under my nose or if i have a bump on my face i can easily shave around it. Could never do that with my Mach 5 even with the little \\&quot;grooming\\&quot; blade on the front end of it.     I will never go back to those cheap plastic razors. I am a DE guy for life! Do your face a favor and buy this blade!</li>
            <li> I just started wet shaving last month.  I ordered this razor and two things struck me when I opened the box.  1)it is very heavy 2)It is pretty short and small Both of these factors make shaving a lot easier.  The weight allows you to apply very little pressure while shaving and the size makes it easy to maneuver.  I also get the impression that if cared for properly this razor could last basically forever. It&#x27;s easy to take apart and the blade adjustment is very simple.  I would recommend this product quite highly. I was skeptical of the high price at first, but upon seeing and feeling the quality of the product I&#x27;m sure that it was worth it.</li>
            <li> These razors are the just the right weight and hold the blade just right for a close shave with out razor burn.</li>
            <li> Two sections of this review - looks / first impressions, and function.    I have to say I am not satisfied with the looks for a few reasons. One is that I expected it to be made out of stainless steel because that is what the description says. In reality is looks like the head is cast zinc and then chrome plated. I tested it with a magnet.    The handle looks cheaply made to me. If you were expecting an heirloom object that you can pass down to your son as I was, this is not it.    Now to the shaving: I used it for the first time today. I have never used any double edge safety razor before, as far as I can remember. I normally use a Norelco rotary and then clean up with a disposable blade or possibly a cartridge like a Mach 3. I put in a Personna blade and shaved and had basically no learning curve - it just worked. This is with proper shaving soap but my brush didn&#x27;t even arrive yet, so I used my hands and didn&#x27;t have any lather to speak of. I was surprised as I watched some videos and was told to expect it to take months to learn this kind of shaving.    So while I have close to no experience, this must be an easy to use razor. I just wish it were physically nicer. That being said, probably most people would be ok with it, as the other reviews tend to indicate.</li>
            <li> Had the handle for my replaceable cartridge blade break on my just after buying a new one, so I finally made the plunge into double edge razors. Keep in mind, I used to shave with straight razors, so I was somewhat familiar with shaving with a single blade. This was an awesome investment though! It&#x27;s pretty much the finest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now, and I am only on my third blade! I have pretty thick stubble, and this makes shaving a breeze. Comfortable and simple design. If you&#x27;re moving from electric razors, you may want to learn about wet shaving before making the switch, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Relatively new to the wet shaving game but it doesn&#x27;t take an expert to recognize the quality of this razor! Great weight and extremely close shave. There is a bit of a learning curve (carved up my face pretty good the first time) but it is worth it. I feel like my grandfather would be proud of me every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Smooth razor. Will take some getting use to as for the small handle. Over all its ok a littlesmaller than im used to but i think it will be oi.</li>
            <li> Good weight, good size for medium hands. Way better than my old, expensive 3-blade razors. No razor burn, but you must lubricate whether it be sharing cream, or soap.</li>
            <li> Well worth the $$.  I am done with all of the newer razors and happy to be going &amp;#34;old school.&amp;#34;  I don&#x27;t know why anyone would continue to pay exorbitant prices, and wait for some clerk to find a key to unlock a case, just to purchase a stupid razor.  I have also found this provides a much closer shave than any of the newer razors I tried.  Don&#x27;t know why I ever trashed my old double edge years ago.  ...but the silver lining is, after using this razor, and seeing how well it is constructed, I now have a razor that will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Best ever razor!! German quality as expected. Now I start saving money on blades and no more disposable razor cartridges.</li>
            <li> Solid performer. I had a cheaper brand that i bought locally and this functions much better.  If you are trying to find a cheap option, go with this razor and you will only have to buy a razor once.</li>
            <li> I purchased this model specifically based on recommendations made by a company through which I purchase other shaving products.  I concur with their assessment: the shorter handle on this safety razor is excellent for maneuverability and managing the pitch of the blade.  The texture on the shaft is unobtrusive and effective, keeping my grip sure even when my hands are wet and/or soapy.  I cannot comment on the included blade...due to unforeseen circumstances, I ended up using it to scrape burnt plastic off an electric range.  It was, however, quite effective in that role.</li>
            <li> Outstanding razor! Great balance, no trouble finding the right angle.  Good weight, perfect handle size for me.  Easy to manuever around cleft and chin areas.  The great reviews of this razor are all true.  Buy with confidence, use with increasing glee and satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I have not shaved with this type of razor for years.  It is very well-made and will probably last for 30 years.  I found that Gillette Silver Blue blades work especially well with it - better than the blade that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and seems great! Going to give it as a gift so I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s actual shaving qualities, but it looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> Good razor but it came from kiwi bazaar in a smashed box with hair packed in the blade. Clearly used and returned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco 5601X for most of my adult life.  It&#x27;s been amazingly reliable and gets the job done with minimal irritation.  But the electric shaver just can&#x27;t handle stubble older than 2 to 3 days so I started looking into buying a cartridge razor, but found the price of replacement cartridges rather high.  That&#x27;s when I came across the old school double-edge razor and the whole wet-shaving enthusiasts.  I purchased Merkur 34C and have been using it for a few months now and I find that it has its pros and cons.  I enjoy the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of the razor in my hand.  I especially like how I can better maneuver shaving under my nose and above lips better than typical cartridge razors.  As for skin irritation, I find that I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference between both types.  I tried shaving with both types of razors over 2-week period and my skin is irritated either way.  What I do appreciate is that I haven&#x27;t nicked myself that much using the DE razor.  A huge plus.  And of course, it does feel &amp;#34;cooler.&amp;#34;  The whole ritual involved with the shaving is a bit more pleasant and well, different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside is that I can&#x27;t quite seem to get that close shave just yet.  I realize that I shouldn&#x27;t go for complete removal, but compared to the cartridge razor, I have to do at least 3 passes or more to achieve a real close shave.  I also find that I can&#x27;t just rake across my face like I can with an electric shaver or cartridge razor.  So again, if time is an issue, I&#x27;ll opt for the electric shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, when compared to shaving with Norelco, I hate to admit it, but my electric razor outperforms in terms of time, convenience and performance (again, only for short stubble).  Nevertheless, I&#x27;ll continue using the DE razor and hope to improve over time and find it a much better solution for wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Quality DE safety razor. Heavy enough for newbies to really get the wet shaving thing down Out of the gate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stock razor that Merkur includes is pretty lousy though. I recommend getting a sample pack to try many different kinds of blades. I discovered that Feather brand was really good for my skin and dialer type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is fairly short which is good because it forces you to focus on the angles and gives you done play as far as good aggressive a agave you want. The handle is heavy enough that you don&#x27;t have to work the blade at all. The weight of the shaver will do the work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I comfortably shave with and against the grain with this razor. So far i really like it. Really good entry level safety razor for the curious.</li>
            <li> Fantastic razor. Unbeatable price for a tool you will use for the rest of your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This + Personna blades &#x3D; Butter zone for shaving.</li>
            <li> As a completely new user of double edge razors, I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this product. It is very easy to use (have never cut myself), and actually is much more enjoyable to use than cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> Brand new razor in original package and came with one new Merkur blade. Standard shipping it only took 4 days. I bougth it as a gift for my dad but I will order one for myself</li>
            <li> Trying to get use to it. I&#x27;m getting a better shave with a cheaper razor. Seems to cut better if I loosen the blade slightly.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving a treat and I get a much better shave than with a multi edge.</li>
            <li> Nice, heavyweight razor.  Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Great first time razor, I&#x27;ve had the razor since October 27, 2013. It works great, easy to clean and easy to maintain. This works really well and I love how much money I save with the double edge razor.</li>
            <li> Was never a big fan of shaving, but decided to try the old fashioned way of shaving to see what the fuss was about. This is by far the most enjoyable and comfortable way of shaving I have ever tried. I have gone from shaving a couple times a week to shaving every single morning now. Money well spent and money well saved when you compare cost to the Gillette junk.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. It is a high quality, durable, long-lasting razor. I have a relatively simple shave kit; razor, spare featherweight blades, and your typical gel shaving cream. One day I&#x27;ll step it up and get some nice lathering shave soap &amp; a bowl, but until then this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the razor does not need a stand (which I was worried about.) It sits on my granite counter-top without touching the blade to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I use it every day!  Great razor and a great shave.</li>
            <li> Good product...great price...quick shipping. Trifecta!</li>
            <li> Great Razor Handle! I&#x27;m a beginner using double sided razor blades but this does a great job of convincing me to switch over. The handle is a little smaller than I anticipated, but no complaints.</li>
            <li> Nice looking razor.  The blade is held in securely and has good balance.  Hair rinses out well even with 2-day growth (coarse beard).  The Merkur blade included was not the best for me, but buy a sampler pack on Amazon and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Truly the best razor out there... great weight and simplicity.</li>
            <li> Works well..wish the handle was a little longer. But shaves are clean and nice</li>
            <li> Very good razor. Shaves good but doesn&#x27;t cut your face.</li>
            <li> Great razor! Just the right size and weight to get a good shave in the hard to hit neck areas.</li>
            <li> Love it so far. Can&#x27;t wait to try with the feather blades I ordered also. Get a good cream and brush , don&#x27;t forget a stand. You&#x27;ll be hooked on old school wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars but I&#x27;m still learning to use it.  I was nervous as I thought I would cut my throat but it&#x27;s definitely NOT going to do that!  I really do love the shave but the only thing I haven&#x27;t figured out is how to shave close under my nose.  All in all I would recommend this product!  I&#x27;m also still learning what blade is best for my skin...they really do differ and I recommend the sampler you can buy online.  I do enjoy the old-school feel and knowing I&#x27;m not throwing as much trash into the landfills.</li>
            <li> awesome, old school but sometimes old school was the best. In this case it is, well worth it. 5 to 8 shaves per blade easily</li>
            <li> After having a 5 O&#x27;Clock shadow at 2:00 PM, this give a smooth close shave that lasts the day. Had one of these in the Army and I am welcoming back an old friend.</li>
            <li> The heft of this almost does the work of shaving for you.  It feels like a TOOL, not some cheap plastic &amp;#34;beauty product&amp;#34;.  The blades are hilariously inexpensive compared to disposable or cartridge razors, even the ones made of German-made medical grade steel, meaning you can change them out as often as you like, even every shave, and still be economical.  It has practically eliminated the razor bumps I&#x27;ve had on my neck for my entire adult life (and to be honest, I expect it will -- I&#x27;m still healing from the damage I didn&#x27;t know the other razors had been doing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, think back to the razor your grandfather used, and you may remember one like this, even long after those pitiful disposables and cartridge razors from Bic, Gillette, and the like were in fashion.  There&#x27;s a reason he preferred this.  Discover it for yourself.</li>
            <li> Best decision I have ever made!! I&#x27;ve officially ditched those 4 blade vibrating swiveling gimmick shaving toys! Look around a little while and you&#x27;ll learn that this Merkur is top notch in the world of DE shaving. Perfect weight and balance, and easy to hang on to with the nurled handle. For the first time in my life I LOVE SHAVING! Combine this with a little Colonel Conk shave soap, an inexpensive Parker brush, and your favorite razor,(I like the Feather and Astra blades) and you&#x27;ll never look back at those other shaving side-show throw-aways again!! Happy shaving my friend. :)</li>
            <li> Using this razor solved my spouse&#x27;s razor burns for over 20 years. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with this model for twenty one years. I would never consider using another razor. The razor still looks brand new and I have used Wilkinson blades exclusively for the same consistent smooth shave. This razor will last more than a lifetime. And twenty one years ago I paid 60.00 for this razor, the prices on Amazon are more than fair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for a month and love it. I was concerned the handle would be too short but it&#x27;s naturally balances between the thumb and index finger and the butt rests comfortably on my little finger. Very heavy for it&#x27;s looks, it gives the feel of a very well built and well engineered product. Solid like a Mercedes. I have yet to nick myself and I get a much smoother shave than disposables or cartridges.</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor because I was tired of paying $20 for Mach 3 refills every few months. I calculated that this razor would pay for itself in about a year (factoring in shave soap, scrub, etc.). I ordered this at the same time that I ordered [[ASIN:B002JKR0HA Col. Conk Amber Glycerine Shave Soap]] and the [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]]. I also picked up some Neutrogena pre-shave scrub and post-shave lotion from a local store. Due to the vagaries of shipping times, I actually received all my shave accessories before the razor arrived, so I had a chance to experience wet shaving with a Gillette Mach 3, good shave soap, and adequate face preparation before my Merkur razor arrived, and then compare the two.&lt;br /&gt;First off, I was surprised how much of a difference the pre-shave scrub and post shave lotion made. It took me awhile to figure out the shave soap and brush lather, but after about 4 or 5 shaves I had it down. The shave was the smoothest I&#x27;d ever experienced, and I was worried the Merkur razor would not live up to the hype, just because the shave soap and scrub made such a difference.&lt;br /&gt;After the Merkur arrived, I used it with the included blade for about a week, and was impressed, but not blown away. I wasn&#x27;t getting a shave any closer than the Mach 3 had with all the preparation. Then I switched to one of the [[ASIN:B004SGKMA0 Derby Double Edge Razor Blades]] I had ordered, and immediately experienced what all the hype is about.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been frequently bothered by ingrown hairs with the multi-blades razors, and haven&#x27;t yet (fingers crossed) had one with this. It is smoother than the best I was able to get with a Mach 3, and my girlfriend agrees. Once I got the hang of it, it is not slow either.&lt;br /&gt;Caveats:&lt;br /&gt;1) It is a bit slower than a disposable. Certainly the fastest I&#x27;m able to shave with this is about 3-4 minutes, as opposed to 30 seconds or so with a Mach 3 right out of the shower with my trusty [[ASIN:B005FNVINA Barbasol]] alone.&lt;br /&gt;2) This thing is tiny. I don&#x27;t know that I have huge hands, but the razor is only half the length of my Mach 3 and it is small enough to be awkward to hold. It takes some getting used to, and I&#x27;m thinking about going with the longer model and using this for travel purposes.&lt;br /&gt;3) it is possible to nick yourself with this blade. But I haven&#x27;t noted it is any worse than I occasionally got with the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this, along with the Derby blades and some good face preparation.</li>
            <li> It is tough to go wrong with this razor. High quality metal, easy to open, easy to replace the blade, easy to clean, etc. It is mild and forgiving, great for my sensitive skin. The heft of the razor makes shaving easier as it is easy to avoid applying pressure. Once you find a blade that works well for you, you&#x27;ll never want to go back to multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> The handle is perfect. Easy to use and maneuver. I can&#x27;t see myself ever buying another one of these, unless it gets really worn out in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades were crap after I tried out a variety pack, though. But you should try out each blade yourself to see what best suits your skin. I have sensitive skin, and the merkur blades left my skin very irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, hard to knock off a star for this razor because the couple of sample blades didn&#x27;t satisfy my needs.</li>
            <li> Great razor for both beginners and experienced alike.  Easy to use and great quality.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> When you hold quality products in your hand, you know it. When I first held this Merkur Heavy Duty Razor, I knew that my shaving experience was about to be upgraded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this razor, you let the weight do the hard work for you. It glides effortlessly through stubble and beard, leaving a smooth, clean path in its wake. Should you need to go &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34;, you can do so with the confidence that this razor will not carve your face into a work of modern art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re switching from disposable razors, please understand that you will need to adjust your technique. Once you do (and it doesn&#x27;t take long), you will enjoy a close, smooth shave that looks good and feels great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for 5 months and it hasn&#x27;t chipped or rusted. It&#x27;s a solid razor, the handle IS small but it isn&#x27;t a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Not as good as original Gillette</li>
            <li> Love it, wish I didnt wait so long to get it. Much better shave than a disposable or electric razor</li>
            <li> Good-bye to skin irritation.  The single blades are super economical.  Before I used to shave every other day with the regular double-blade razor because of irritation and would change the blade every week.  Now It&#x27;s been almost 2 weeks using the same blade shaving daily and it is still sharp.  My skin has not felt this good in many decades, smooth and healthy.  I don&#x27;t even need to use after-shave cologne or balm.</li>
            <li> Great razor, not to aggressive for people with irritation issues</li>
            <li> Razor fine. Did not have a blade as advertised, is reason I gave it a four</li>
            <li> Timely delivery, great razor. Second one I purchased, this one was for my wife to use on her legs.</li>
            <li> The tools do make the difference! Had used high quality, multi-blade razors, the Merkur far surpasses all of these. The balance, weight, ease of shave transforms the shaving chore to an enjoyable experience. While seemingly expensive at first, the money is quickly recouped in the price of the blades. Have easily convinced my son this is the way to go. No Regrets!</li>
            <li> For me, this is a great razor.  The short handle allows me to have more control while shaving.  I started wet shaving with a longer handle and found it to be somewhat cumbersome.  This razor works much better for me and my face.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is truly a quality razor. Perfect size and weight. Just like I remember from 40 years ago.</li>
            <li> Outstanding razor. All my other razors are in a box and out of sight.</li>
            <li> Sorry to rain on everyone parade, but I tried to like this and after 4 or 5 months of use, I have switched back to my old razor.  My problem is that I am very bony and have very thick black leg hair (very sad for a woman!).  The blades are super sharp and there is no pivot in the head to get around the sharp contours of my bony shins and ankles.  I constantly have a few nicks along my shin bone and trying to navigate this around my ankle bones was a nightmare.  Maybe I&#x27;m just careless or unskilled at shaving, but I can&#x27;t handle this baby!  It&#x27;s too much razor for me!  I&#x27;m happily reunited with my razor that has a pivoting head and handles my jagged bones better.</li>
            <li> Was what my son had hoped for; he loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor on June 23, 2014 and like the way it shaves. I am only giving it three stars because the handle broke after six months. I don&#x27;t know how or why but, decided to reorder it again. I didn&#x27;t complain I just decided to take responsibly for it. If it breaks again I will complain and if lasts for longer than a year I will give a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve every come across. There is no pulling or tugging, the razor just glides over your skin so effortlessly you will think its the best thing since sliced bread. I would strongly recommend this product to any and every man.</li>
            <li> I used to use this type of shavers many years ago as a teenager, then moved on to gillette excel (two blades) and then 3 blades.  I found that with 3 blade gillettes, I would get ingrown hair around my neck area and also shave bumps/ razor bumps.  I went back to Gillette Excels (2 blades) and that helped a lot. But those are becoming harder and harder to find and buy. Then I came across an online discussion regarding shaving and after a few minutes of search here and there, I was surprised to see that the old school shaving method that I used to use back when, has become the trend and is probably better for my skin (explained why I never had razor bumps before but now I get them a lot more.)  This razor was listed in many forums as a good overall razor, so I decided to order it and tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good workmanship, definitely a high end product. Works well and I am kind of excited to be back to the old ways.  I get a very clean shave (closer than Excel) without any irritation.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor after using disposable blade razors my entire life.  I bought the new gillette swivel fusion last year and generally liked it except that I would still get razor burn and the cost of the blades is annoying.  My wife bought me an art of shaving starter kit last summer and I began using a shaving brush and before and after shave creams.  This was a big improvement over the gels I was using.  This also generated some interest in looking at other shaving options and after looking at all of the reviews about this razor I decided to give it a try and also buy feather blades based on reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely takes some adjustment to your shaving technique.  I tried the blade that came with the razor at first and didn&#x27;t really like it and actually started to doubt about my decision.  I tried the razor with the feather blades and what a huge improvement.  I can finally get a shave as close as my 4 blade razor and it was comfortable and just a generally more enjoyable experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy that I made the switch, not to mention the cost savings.  I bought 20 feather blades for $7 versus 8 fusion blades for $28.</li>
            <li> I am still not sure I like this.  The Merkur blades are really lousy compared to others in sample kit.  I find the short handle annoying. The balance just doesn&#x27;t feel right and I find I am using more pressure then on other safety razors I use.  I have a Merkur Futur and it shaves like a dream.  Will try this with other blades before it goes in the drawer.</li>
            <li> So I originally started shaving with a safety razor using the flawed Edwin Jagger DE89 because I heard good things about it as well and it was $10 less. Safe to say though it was all hype. The is the razor to buy. The weight and size is phenomenal. As perfect a shave as I expected. The highlight is the stainless steel design. The DE89 has a brass handle and plastic head that were chrome plated. Though it&#x27;s listed only as brass. This is ALL stainless. That means the head as well. Also the thread for the head goes almost the length of the handle, as opposed to 1/2in long chrome plated plastic. This truly is a durable razor that will last a lifetime of flawless shaves if you maintain it.</li>
            <li> Great all around DE razor.  The Merkur 34c is my goto double edge razor.</li>
            <li> First off, as I would tell anyone, a quality shave is the product of a lot of factors. I&#x27;m assuming that anyone who is interested in this type of product has already taken the time to pursue a good prep (i.e. soak,brush, lather, quality after-shave treatment etc.) If you&#x27;re switching over from the radioactive-colored gel/plastic face-grater routine, it&#x27;s a good idea to take a gradual approach. Try using plain old shaving soap &amp; a brush, &amp; get a good lather. Keep it Simple. Get all that chemical crap off your face. Despite what the ads say, women don&#x27;t want it, and it just provides more things for your body chemistry to reject. That by itself will give you a MUCH better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an African American male who, like many others, has had to deal with razor bump issues. I went from gel and multi-blade, to brush/soap &amp; multi-blade, to  brush/soap and a DE razor (Merkur #34C). Just as applying with a brush is superior to using your fingers, Having a single blade, which you can control, is much better than scraping multiple blades across your skin. You will FEEL the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 34C has been a great first DE razor for me. It does take time to adjust. Don&#x27;t pick up a DE razor for the first time when you have to catch a train in 15 minutes. It takes time to re-learn your beard. You&#x27;re not using an axe anymore, it&#x27;s more like a trusty knife. Unlike multi-blades, a DE won&#x27;t get clogged. If you pick up a bit of scuff, rinse, switch sides, fresh blade. You MAY have to pay a bit more attention to what you&#x27;re doing, but if you&#x27;re a guy like me who has had to deal with bumps/irritation for years, you already were. Keep it light,don&#x27;t try to get it all in one pass. Unlike a cartridge razor, you need NO PRESSURE. You won&#x27;t get cut if you let the weight of the razor do the work. If anything, go by resistance/sound rather than feel. You can do the with/against/cross method and lather every time, but even if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll get just as good as a cartridge, that&#x27;s the beauty. The shave is as good and long lasting as the time you&#x27;re willing to put in. I&#x27;ve also found that getting a clean edge is much easier with the broader DE blade. And the blades are cheap. Very cheap (relatively).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction of the Merkur 34C is top notch. The handle is shorter than the plastic face-shredders but the added weight gives counter-balance &amp; a sense of touch. Like any other tool, you can judge the quality by holding it in your hand. Buy one and you will probably pass it on to your son one day, seriously. STOP WASTING YOUR MONEY ON PLASTIC.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised,well built and nice weight</li>
            <li> Well made very nice I would highly recommend theis razor to any one I love the quality and craftsmanship of this razor</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about trying something new on my face but WOW, talk about a smooth shave. I just love how if I dont shave a few days this razor still is super easy to clean. My Fusion always gets clogged with my hair and half the time shaving is spent trying to get the hair free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happily using an Edwin Jagger DE razor for several months now.  I decided to buy another razor and chose the Merkur 34C due to its strong reputation--basically being the state of the art in DE razors.  After using it, I can understand why.  While the Merkur may not be quite as pretty as the EJ, I find it to be functionally superior in a couple of ways.  Blade changes are easier--less pieces to fiddle with.  Ergonomics are better due to the knurling and the increase in diameter at the end of the handle--both facilitate a better grip and thus control during the shave.  Both razors give excellent shaves and I have no problem endorsing the purchase of either, but I believe the Merkur to be a bit more user-friendly.</li>
            <li> small nice little shaver and if you KNOW HOW TO SHAVE right YOU WONT GET CUT. so everyone saying it doesn&#x27;t give a good shave you clearly dont know how to use a safety razor or you aren&#x27;t that smart sorry but its the truth.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.  BEen using it for a couple years now and very happy with it.  I shave my head and neck and it has been an excellent investment.  So much better than disposables.  Not even comparable to this really.  This is such a good close shave and in my opinion it is not challenging at all.  I rarely knick myself and I do my entire head and neck.  Love this razor.  Have recommended this to others.</li>
            <li> I grew up and learned to shave using a double edge razor.  Between cartridge razors and electric shavers, it&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve used one.  But I&#x27;m now re-learning to shave with a double edge.  This is a terrific razor.  Different than the cheaper mass market models I used when I was younger.  You can definitely feel and see the quality.  I was worried about the short handle ... but I&#x27;m 6&#x27; 2&amp;#34;, over 250 pounds, and I definitely don&#x27;t have small hands ... and this works fine for me.</li>
            <li> I did an enormous amount of research before purchasing this razor (which I do before buying anything of any importance). It arrived on time, in perfect condition, and exactly as advertised. The razor, a Merkur HD 34C is an absolutely amazing piece of hardware and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. Some buyers have complained about either its weight or its short length, but I believe this buyers failed to appropriately check the item out before purchasing it. It is solid and heavy (as expected from the name) and is definitely shorter than a standard modern razor. Both the weight and length, in my opinion, provide a better sense of control when shaving, allowing for a closer shave and tighter lines if you&#x27;re wearing a beard or side burns of any kind. So far, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the selection. I will update this posting in a few months and rate the longevity of the razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plain to see why this is a classic safety razor -- the perfectly-weighted handle is short enough to make it easy to control while generating enough pressure to support a clean shave.  The razor appears to be made with Teutonic rigor that oozes a quality feel.</li>
            <li> Great razor. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of years and no complaints.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected from Merkur: A precision engineered and manufactured razor. This DE razor makes it easy to get a close, comfortable shave. And it looks great also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only maintenance required is cleaning (rinsing) after each shave and occasionally adding a touch of mineral oil to the screw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this Merkur to anybody looking for a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> I am a new wet shaver. This has been an excellent safety razor. Even with Feather blades, very few nicks. My technique has improved remarkably with the Merkur 34C as I no longer put pressure when shaving. I simply guide the razor as it seems so easy to have a feather touch (no pun intended). I have normal hands (I think) and the handle is more than adequate and quite comfortable to use. I highly recommend this product. It is quality built and the seller, Simply Beautiful, was superb. Everything came well packaged and on time.</li>
            <li> This thing is great. It&#x27;s sturdy and well made. The blades are dirt cheap. Shaves as well as your favorite 17 blade cartridge. I tried using the mug o&#x27; shaving soap and ended up covered with nicks. Switched shaving gel. Much better.</li>
            <li> Works great for me easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best razor available, all categories. I us it with Derby Extra blades, every day. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After my son read many reviews and about razors. He says this was the best rated. Solid and manly, he remembers watching his grandpa using something like this. Thank you for offering such a great product!</li>
            <li> Great quality, weight, and feel. I did not remember my dads razor handle being so short but I was much younger then! Read description for length.</li>
            <li> This is my first double edge razor.  I was suprised at how easy it is to use.  It takes off my beard with no effort.  The weight of the razor does all of the work for you.  Much better than my multi-blade disposable.</li>
            <li> Product is of good quality. I wish I had bought the long handle</li>
            <li> Exactly what my nephew wanted for his birthday.  I received the item very promptly.  The quality makes it worth the price.</li>
            <li> I really like this little razor. It has a nicely machined look to it and a knurled grip so it won&#x27;t easily slip in your hand. The chrome is substantial and it&#x27;s generally just a fine product. I use the Feather brand blades, they might be the sharpest out there.</li>
            <li> This used to be THE razor, and many articles still point to it. But there are better options for less. You can get a Maggard&#x27;s razor or a Parker 26c for cheaper and have a better, or at least equivalent razor.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Hold is good. I switched from cartridges as they were not giving a close shave any more. I contemplated between going for electric shaver and this. I am so glad I tried this. It took some learning. Had cuts and bleeds few times. I was doing it all wrong. I was not keeping the skin taught etc. I was not soaping enough and create hydroplaning. May be I was holding the stroke angles wrong and irritated the stubs. Takes a good a month or two so you shave with optimal 3 or 4 passes. WTG, XTG, ATG and your final couple so you get BBSM shave. Once I got the skills right and with combination of this cute small well built DE razor and blades ( I use both Personna and Feather) - shaving is not a chore. I enjoy giving myself a good shave. I do listen to music while shaving (got a Abco Tech water resistant wireless bluetooth) so I can listen in bath. I do sometime listen to audiobooks as well. I can&#x27;t do this, if I had gone with electric shaver. Besides it would never have given me a close smooth shave. After a month and half, this Merkur blade is as good as new. No rusting or loosing shine or anything. Easy to load blade and clean. I do use mineral oil at the end of the  shave to apply to blade edges and also to parts of the blade. This prevents bladges from getting rusted. Razor also repel water and becomes easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I waiting a very long time before buying this razor and it was well worth the wait. I started out with the Feather Popular, but always felt like it wasnt aggressive enough as I&#x27;d like so i did the tons of research and was stuck on getting the 34c. I&#x27;m very happy with my choice because this  razor is right there in the middle of the road for me on how it shaves, its amazing. It is a 5 star razor, but the one I received when replacing the blade I have to align the sides of the blade with the razor. It has been very seldom though, so thats why I gave it a four star. The 34c is a really great razor and I have no mind into looking for another one any time soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just decided to take the plunge into DE shaving, and gave this Merkur 34C a try. Like many others, I browsed the numerous forums and reviews online before deciding which razor to get. Most debate seemed to come down to this product and another from Edwin Jagger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ultimately decided to try this from Merkur, and have enjoyed using it very much thus far. It feels very well-made, with a good weight to it in your hand and an easy glide. It seems expensive initially, but with the amount you save on razors (including the very tangible benefit of changing your blades more regularly because they&#x27;re so cheap), I&#x27;d say the outlay is well worth it. There is also some discussion out there about how it might fit into your hands if you&#x27;re a large person with bigger hands and all of that. For those of you wondering, I&#x27;m 5&amp;#34;7 with with normal-sized palms, and like how this feels in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives a wonderful, close shave that I certainly prefer to any of my previous cartridge razors (I used shavemob before, which I liked). The only downside to this (unavoidably) is that it really does take time to learn how to use this properly and quickly. You cannot be impatient about it and just have to put the effort into it. Otherwise, I&#x27;ve thoroughly enjoyed - and frankly look forward to - shaving with this product. I&#x27;ve recommended this to many of my other friends, some of whom are considering trying it too. I would absolutely love to try any of their other products, because I&#x27;ve been so impressed with this.</li>
            <li> Great shave. Should have bought this 20 years ago and skipped spending that small fortune on Mach 3 and Fusion cartridges given that six months of blades for this cost almost nothing in comparison. I also recently invested in a Boker straight razor and find the Merkur to compliment it perfectly for when I need to save time in the morning. I shave my head twice a week and find that a bit scary with my straight razor but didn&#x27;t have any worry or knicks with the Merkur. The Merkur has a nice heft to it and combined with the feather and derby blades I have tried to date it has been super smooth and enjoyable to use, with less razor burn than the Fusion. It did take me a few minutes to get used to the smaller handle but overall it feels the way a quality metal tool should feel.</li>
            <li> This is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten!  I have short, broad fingers, so the size and weight are perfect for me.  If you have long piano player fingers, you may want a longer handle.  My wife has tried it and loves it too.  Beats a Bic without question!</li>
            <li> The razor is a true gem -- when loaded with a feather blade, it cuts my &#x27;Homer Simpson&#x27; beard like a hot knife through butter.  Quality razor that gives a great shave in less time than my old Gillette and I will save $ in the long run.  Hard not to be pleased...</li>
            <li> Best new razor on the market. Close shaves but not too aggressive. Very forgiving for anyone new to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> Good razor! Fit and finish is top notch. Provides a good shave. This is my first safety razor over the $10 price point and it looks nice and feels nice and provides a great shave. Unfortunately, although it feels different in the hand I honestly don&#x27;t tell any difference in shave quality between the 34c and my $10 utopia razor. I am a 41 year old novice at DE shaving but I can&#x27;t believe they get $45 for chromed brass. Probably cost a buck or two more to make than the $10 razors out there, just sayin&#x27;! Overall,  I am happy with the purchase as it is a higher quality tool than cheaper razors and should last a lifetime. If you are looking for a high quality razor that you can pass down to your son this is a good choice, if you just want a good cheap shave I would recommend the utopia or feather popular razors as they will provide an equally good shave for the non-conneseur.</li>
            <li> Just got the razor this morning and tried it out.  I had my doubts about a single blade razor but to my surprise this little puppy is awesome!  I was trying to find a way to be able to carry more \\&quot;shaving-days\\&quot; in my camp pack, without all of the bulky blades offered by the modern razors.  This thing looks o&#x27;-school but is definitely pimp and it gives you an extremely surprisingly close shave!  Now I know where that extra money went;)  I would recommend this to all looking for a quality razor.</li>
            <li> I rated this as a 5-star razor based on its heavy-duty quality and design.  It is amazing that this is how it has been done for so many decades in the past, and somehow we were all duped into thinking cartridge-based safety razors were a good deal.  This Merkur razor shaves more deliberately than a proglide.  If you shave quickly and carelessly, you do have a slightly higher likehood of nicking your nose, but again, that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re careless.  The short handle makes it more maneuverable.  The blade replaces easily and costs less than one-tenth of a gillette proglide replacement cartridge.</li>
            <li> My beard grows in really awkward directions on my neck, so I&#x27;ve never really gotten the kind of close shave other guys are talking about. I *have* taken off large amounts of skin from using shaving techniques picked up with cartridge razors. I *have* got lots of missed areas because I just didn&#x27;t want to deal with the pain and sting of razor burns. I *have* unloaded a lot of money into making this work; it&#x27;s probably just not going to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the learning curve involved in changing the way I shave, I just had some surgery which will leave a fairly large raised scar on my neck. Since I&#x27;m having trouble without that impediment, I&#x27;m just going to chalk this up to a bad purchase and go back to the more forgiving cartridge shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a beautiful razor, and with shaving oil, it&#x27;s capable of more than I&#x27;m doing with it. I just have to accept that it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor, and the heft feels good in my hand. I just wish the handle was a bit longer. I had forgotten what it is like, after shaving with the less than satisfying mass market safety razor and multiple blade nonsense for more years then I care to remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a great shave, this is the razor for; and don&#x27;t forget to buy the Feather stainless double edge blades for a Razor and blade combination that can&#x27;t be beat. The vender, The SimplyBeautiful Family, delivered on time and my razor and the rest of the order was well packaged. Happy to have done business with them.</li>
            <li> This razor has a nice weight to it.  With the shorter handle, I feel there is more control. About a year ago, I started using this type of razor so this was the next step from the longer handled version.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more for my sons.</li>
            <li> the shaver works but after almost 9 months of trying out many blades I gave up.  enough with the cuts, the blood, the rashed out skin.  It tried to make this work then went back to disposable blades.  They shave me just as well and I rarely cut my face with them.  razor is well made but I will never use it again</li>
            <li> I thought the short handle would be a problem with my bigger hands but it works great. I have since seen some less expensive alternatives, like the butterfly opening style. but since this is all I know I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first double edge razor so I will say that it is not as close a shave as modern multi-blade types. What I do like is over time these are less expensive and less wasteful. Also, my face feels great after a shave with this, where a Mach-3 would leave my face so raw I couldn&#x27;t shave for 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a bit of a learning curve though, I cut may face for the first month or so.</li>
            <li> This is the third DE razor I&#x27;ve owned and consequently the third stab I&#x27;ve taken at DE shaving.  I&#x27;m in the military and have to shave every weekday.  I&#x27;m used to suffering through mild but painful razor burn from the middle to end of the week when using old cartridge standbys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first DE razor was a decent Edwin Jagger.  It had some weight to it but I felt it wasn&#x27;t helping me enough.  Several months later I picked up a 1940&#x27;s Gillette on Ebay.  It&#x27;s much lighter and built of a better quality but I still wasn&#x27;t getting the shave I desired.  Fast forward three years and I&#x27;ve decided to pick up DE shaving once again.  After reading reviews on several other razors, it was hard to pass this one up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing has some weight to it.  That&#x27;s a good thing, because it lessons the chance that you&#x27;ll be tempted to push rather than let the razor do the work. It&#x27;s sturdy and the crosshatch pattern on the handle provides good grip, even when wet with water and lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since switching to this razor, I&#x27;ve had great shaves.  Little to no razor burn--still a bit of a learning curve, but I&#x27;m getting there.  I use this combined with Feather blades, The Art of Shaving Lavender cream, a Parker silver tip badger brush, and finish with Nivea sensitive skin aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, this is a great razor to get you into the game.  Pair it up with some quality cream and a brush and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor for beginners. It took no time to become proficient shaving WITH the grain. I cannot shave against the grain, never have been able to, not surprised I can&#x27;t now. That&#x27;s okay, though. The extra razors that come are DORCO blades and they are great. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have had one of those for over 5 years and just ordered a second one. The quality is amazing. My first one still looks like the day I bought it. The razor is, as the name implies, heavy. I personally prefer the way the extra weight feels in my hand. It feels like a higher quality razor though I am sure the quality of the other Merkur products is just as good.</li>
            <li> This is my first double edge razor. If you are looking to start with DE shaving you could not go wrong picking this up as a learning razor.</li>
            <li> Great holder. Thanks.</li>
            <li> A high quality well balanced double edge razor made in Germany.  Once you  get used to shaving with a double edge razor, you will never go back to all the new fangled razors on the mkt. today</li>
            <li> Very good razor. DE shaving is much better than cartridge shaving by far. This is a great razor that will keep you happy past the intermediate level of razors, if not your whole life. Great weight, really allows you to avoid applying pressure. With a good prep (lather, etc.), this razor will serve you well.</li>
            <li> A tad on the heavy side, but a quality razor.</li>
            <li> I switched to the 34C after about 3 months use of the 25C open comb, which I found a bit too aggressive for my skin/hair type. My skin always felt a bit inflamed and sensitive to the touch after using it, even with just 2 passes. Using the 34C with Personna reds and Nivea Sensitive Skin After Shave Balm I can now do a 3-pass shave without any irritation. It feels good in the hand, on my face and just performs well. I am relatively new to DE safety razor shaving, and happy to have found the right combination of razor, blade, soap, brush and after shave that works for me.</li>
            <li> Very nice razor, stubby and built like a tank. Price is fair.</li>
            <li> Works great and a lot cheaper than buying the replaceable cartridges all the time. Price of blades for this is a dollar a dozen. Smaller handle than the average razor blade but easier to maneuver after a couple swipes. I have and will keep telling people to switch.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and heavy-duty. Only down-side is that I wish the handle were a little bit longer. But other than that, I like it and don&#x27;t miss shaving with the name-brand disposable cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> Nice heavy double edge handle.  Works great for me, some people may prefer a longer handle, but I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my first double edge razor. I did a lot of research and everything pointed me to this one. I love it and haven&#x27;t looked back!</li>
            <li> Top notch. Still can&#x27;t get over it</li>
            <li> This is my first de razor. Just got into wet shaving and have been in enjoying it from the beginning. You won&#x27;t go wrong with this razor.</li>
            <li> I was sick of buying overpriced junk razors. The idea of spending over $20 for around 3 cartridge razors made me nauseous. So I decided to go old school and never looked back. This was the best idea I have had lately and the cost savings is tremendous. The quality of this razor is great and made of solid metal. Finish is great and I have never gotten a better shave. Tell P&amp;G to stick it and go old school!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that I can add anything new here that hasn&#x27;t already been said, but I will say that between switching to this type of razor and watching You Tube videos on shaving, I feel like I am learning how to shave correctly after shaving for many years the wrong way.  I really enjoy this razor.  As stated, I am new to this type of shaving, and I very seldom get cut.  I used to shave everyday with my old razor and gunk in a can.  Now, I shave every other day (sometimes less) and people don&#x27;t even notice.  My skin is thanking me. In shaving math, that means that this razor is shaving twice as close.  I use a combination of Arko shaving soap and Kiss my Face shaving soap (both sold here at Amazon).  Both are terrific products on their own, but together, they are fantastic!  I use both Astra and Personna Blue razor blades.  Both are great products and are very forgiving on my face.  Try this type of shaving--you&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with cartridges as long as I can remember, until now. Recently purchased the Merkur 34C DE safety razor. Invest! Comfortable shave with no irritation.  A few nicks, but I believe that was operator error.  The weight of this razor does the work for you so there&#x27;s no need to push down like with others.  Leave the latest cartridge razor fad on the grocery store shelves and buy this razor!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  I was a bit hesitant to use a different technology at first but after a few go&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve gotten comfortable with it.  It is super safe and I get an excellent close shave from it.  It is easy to clean and to use.  I use double edge blades from the local CVS store.  I&#x27;ve used three blades in the span of a month or two now.  I think it&#x27;s like less than a dollar per.  It may sound like you&#x27;re spending more money on razors, but you definitely save in the long run... and when I say long run, I mean a month or two you probably get it back.  What are you waiting for?  Buy it now!</li>
            <li> Excellent piece of hardware, though I found the handle to be too short and uncomfortable to shave with, especially compared to the Gillette Fusion I had been using. That noted, it would be quite handy to travel with. I decided to exchange this for the long-handle version, which I am much happier and more comfortable with. The return/exchange process was straightforward and without hassle.</li>
            <li> I am new to this kind of shaving and the recommendations regarding this product are spot on.  I like the handle&#x27;s feel and action.  It&#x27;s not adjustable like some of the pricier models but does it&#x27;s job well.  If you don&#x27;t need the adjustability this thing works fantastic.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this DE razor, I was using the Mach 3 blades.  My beard comes in pretty coarse and I would get ingrown hairs here and there.  In fact, I knew that if I ran the blades across my face, at a certain angle, I would definitely end up with ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have been shaving with this DE razor for about a month, I have to say, I will never go back.  Once you find a brand of blade that works best for your facial hair/skin, you will notice the difference.  My face has never been so baby smooth.  After learning the proper technique for using this blade, I have not had any ingrown hairs for weeks.  And since these blades don&#x27;t pull on your hairs, like the multi-blade cartridges, I can run this razor at angles that would have given me razor burns before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a good weight to it and the shorter handle makes it easier (at least for me) to shave.  I tried a longer handle model, but found the handle would get in the way during my shaves.  That could be due to my technique, but after getting this one, I never went back to the longer handle.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy and well-made (and frankly, beautiful) razor. It takes a little getting used to a single blade after using Gillette&#x27;s perverse multi-bladed abominations, bur it&#x27;s very well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Have had this razor for 3 weeks now, having switched from a Mach 3. It has taken me this long to start to feel confident with the Merkur. Now that I&#x27;m getting used to it, I really like it. But I didn&#x27;t like it at all for the first week, mainly because I was overly worried about getting cut. Now, I do feel like I get a closer shave than with the old mach 3, but it comes at the expense of adding a couple of minutes to my shave. While everyone seems to say that you should always shave with the grain, there are some areas where I (still) have to shave against the grain to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is well built, heavy and sturdy. But it&#x27;s short, and I wish I had opted for the long handled version. Where it really becomes an issue is shaving around your jawbone close to your ears. It&#x27;s hard to keep a good grip on this short handle for that area. The shortness is kind of a plus, however, when getting the area right under your nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a tip, when you&#x27;re rinsing the razor between strokes, twist the bottom to loosen the blade, and then run it under the water. This allows everything to rinse out - otherwise it tends to stick in there.</li>
            <li> Built like a tank,  a beautifully polished chromed one at that.  It lives up to its reputation as an excellent DE safety razor.  It is not difficult to get a BBS (baby bottom smooth&amp;#34; shave from this razor.  I even like the Merkur razor blade included with the purchase, but razor blades are very subjective to the specific user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of 4 DE safety razors that I have in my rotation (Merkur 34C, Lord L5, Lord L6, Weishi 9306-H).  I like them all and they all have been good razors to learn with.  The Merkur 34C is the heftiest of all, it is the best manufactured of the 4, however also costs 5X more than the other 3 razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur 34C must be a more aggressive blade angle and blade tolerance than the other 3 because it gave a smoother shave with less passes.  However, that being said, I find it pleasurable to shave with.  My styptic pencil is used rarely.  This razor has been reviewed with very positive user experiences and my experience confirm the public reviews are correct.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very stylish&lt;br /&gt;Perfectly weighted&lt;br /&gt;Durable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is a two piece that unscrews at the base of the handle, which to me makes it way better than the three piece handles.</li>
            <li> I already use the Merkur Futur Gold (probably the most... or second most expensive Merkur).  It&#x27;s a very nice unit and I enjoy it immensely. Being a gluten, I decided I needed another safety razor, even though a Merkur will last a lot longer than a human LOL.  After much reading, I decided on this little beauty. The 34c, or model # 34001 as it&#x27;s listed, is a pleasure to use.  It doesn&#x27;t scream luxury or pricey like the Futur, but I honestly think I like it better. It&#x27;s the perfect weight and size. One thing I really like is that the head is really flat so you get the under the nose/upper moustache area better without having to contort your poor nose.  Also a lot friendlier when attempting to cut a clean sideburn line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow-- for anyone thinking about wet shaving..... Go for it, and try this unit. Can&#x27;t go wrong. Just remember, the most important step of ALL is applying a pre-shave oil (I use Art of Shaving Sandalwood).  It makes all the difference.</li>
            <li> I started shaving old school and bought this razor along with the soap,brush and stand.  I love the thought of saving money on razor blades.  Sure it&#x27;s not the 5 blade razor that I was use to but as long as you take your time, listen to some good music as you shave, it makes the moment of shaving unique.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor as my first safety razor. I was tired of paying for expensive cartridges and wanted to move to a safety razor. The short handle makes shaving a breeze and this razor is extremely sturdy and well made. The razor is easy to handle and clean. I&#x27;m not spending time trying out different razor blades to optimize my shaving experience. Moving to a safety razor has changed my shaving life.</li>
            <li> The first razor I ever shaved with was a safety razor that was my dad&#x27;s during WWII, government issued.  I have used many razors since, most recently electric razors.  I am back old school:  this razor provides the best and closest shave, bar none.  The quality of the product is outstanding.  I highly recommend this razor.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> This razor has a very nice heavy feel to it and with a good blade is a very comfortable shaving instrument. The blades are much cheaper than the expensive fancy heads on the big brand razors and it does at least as good a job. Try this and you will like it if you know how to shave.</li>
            <li> I recently took the plunge into safety razor shaving.  This was primarily done to offset the cost of replacement disposable blades.  The result has been fantastic.  I get a much closer shave despite the fact the it seems every hair on my face grows a different direction.  The blade was easy to install, cleaning is super easy.  I have only nicked myself once so far after using daily for the past weeks, and that was completely my fault.  The weight of the razor is one that allows you to believe that it will last for years and years.  The screw in the handle loosens the top of the razor which is removed to install/replace blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using it seems as though you would actually have to work at nicking yourself with it (but I somehow managed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product and I would buy again although I am not sure that I ever will have to.</li>
            <li> Have had this for around 2 months now.  Love it.  It&#x27;s beautiful, seriously substantial feeling in your hand, and the blades are very inexpensive, especially when bought in a pack of 100.  I will probably not need to buy blades for over a year, and it cost me under $10 to get them.</li>
            <li> This razor is extremely will built and very forgiving.  I am still in the process of finding which blade works best for me.</li>
            <li> Have had this blade for a couple months now, and love the transition from the Mach 3 to this blade. Never would have guessed that I would enjoy the experience of shaving with a safety razor as much as I have. Brings the enjoyment of a morning ritual back into perspective.</li>
            <li> This is my first D.E. razor. I purchased it after reading reviews on Amazon &amp; other sites. I have had it for over 2 months and use it with both soap &amp; cream. I cannot believe that it took this long to purchase this.</li>
            <li> Great razor. This was my first DE razor. I love it. I own the 39C as well and the 34 is my favorite. Much easier to use for a beginner and looks great. The 39 is sweet looking and fun to use but I have to be incredibly careful with it. The 34 is my go to 5 out of 7 days a week.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other shavers out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I CAN say that as a beginner, I felt comfortable using this from the get-go.  I was worried I&#x27;d slice myself up - hasn&#x27;t happened.  So that&#x27;s good.  Not sure I like the Dorco blades it came with, though.  They take quite a few passes and leave me with some irritation.  I tried a Derby blade recently and that seems to have lessened the problem dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For other beginners - be aware!  If you&#x27;re like me, switching to wet shaving will mean your shaves will require more concentration and preparation.  They will take longer.  And they may not be as close and smooth as you&#x27;re used to.  But I view this as investing in a skill that helps me know myself better, take better care of my skin, and feel more manly and confident.  It has helped me turn a chore into a ritual, and psyches me up for the day.  It helps me feel proud and in control of myself.  It lends me some desire to look nicer - and my lady loves that.  Just know what you&#x27;re doing - the benefits here aren&#x27;t short-term.  When you get a DE razor, you&#x27;re committing to some work - research, practice, and experimentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very happy with my purchase.  Good item, as described, no troubles yet, good shipping and customer service.  Unfair to deduct a star because the blades didn&#x27;t suit me personally?  Maybe, but it has definitely affected my enjoyment of the product, so there you have it.</li>
            <li> Very nice and capable razor for the money.  There really is no reason to spend more unless you are collecting these type of razors.  I primarily use electric but I occasionally will like to grow out the beard.  This razors works perfectly for removing it when I go back to a clean shaven look.  This is way above and beyond the feel and use of those silly marketing designed 5 blade razors you see at the grocery store.  If wet shaving is your thing you should definitely try this one.</li>
            <li> Razor arrived on time and works great. It feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> A little too small for my liking, nonetheless works great.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this in the mail. Great razor and comes with 1 blade. Blade is not too sharp or dull but I will probably by sharper blades online. This razor is a short handled razor which is fine with me but if you want a normal size length razor then get the longer version of this. Overall very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this razor, I really do. I do think that getting the larger handle version is what I will do next time I am in the market for a new safety razor.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this razor.  I have never used one before, but with a few strokes it was easy to pick up.  I&#x27;m using the blade that came with it, not the higher quality blades I purchased, so I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s giving me a closer shave than a cartridge razor.  What I can say is that this Merkur is well-constructed, balanced in my hand, and it will pay for itself in a year since I don&#x27;t have to buy overpriced expendable cartridges.</li>
            <li> I have to say the Merkur is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made of any product! The first thing you will notice is the weight and how well made the razor is. The weight is crucial because it allows better manipulation and control. I&#x27;m very happy I chose the shorter handle as it also allows better control. The razor does take a little getting used to and the blades are sharp which has given me the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years!  I dont ever see myself switching back to a multi-blade razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I switched from my cartridge razor.</li>
            <li> No other way to shave for me than an old school &amp;#34;Hot Shave&amp;#34;.  Love it.</li>
            <li> My husband States this is the absolute best shave he has ever had. He has extremely sensitive, oily skin and this razor gives him a smooth shave, does not cause any razor burn, and is so easy to keep clean. Quality product and is a great price. I think we have found the last razor he will ever buy!</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to.  REALLY sharp blades that will slice you up if you dont shave slowly and carefully.  So much cheaper in the long run than the major brand disposables.</li>
            <li> Love this razor. It&#x27;s my go to razor amongst many. Perfect blade gap for an efficient and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Exactly what I wanted. Not sure about the blade it comes with, though. I&#x27;ll probably try another brand when I have to get a new one.</li>
            <li> I use to use gillette pro glide razor cartridges. I was fed up with paying $18 mo for cartridge razors. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it was good, but expensive. This razor is absolutely nice, has a good solid weight to it, and beautiful finish. If you take care if it, it will certainly last for generations. I cannot say the same for the pro glide. I got a closer shave using a feather blade with this razor. When shaving, it feels absolutely amazing on my face. I felt a lot better with this product then my previous razor. The price appears a little pricey, but you certainly get what you pay for. You get a nice looking razor that performs very well. The blades themselves are cheap, this product is a very good investment. I would recommend this to anyone male or female. As far as the fear factor, of hacking your face. I very seldom have any nicks or cuts, no different from using a cartridge razor. Plus I receive no irritation on my neck. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this. For the new wet shavers, practice makes perfect, make sure you have a good lather applied prior to shaving. It&#x27;s very nice to go back to old school shaving. You will certainly take pride in your shave with this.</li>
            <li> Heavy. Not a huge fan of how you have to open it. Should have stuck with an open comb. Overall good product but wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> This is one of the best razors i have used.  Very smooth and good grip.  It is small but it is designed that way so you get good shave and can maneuver nicely.  Very easy to change blades.</li>
            <li> My first DE razor. Did a lot of research and looked at a bunch of recommendation lists and this won out. Good weight to it. I guess this would be on the &amp;#34;milder&amp;#34; side for razors since it doesn&#x27;t seem aggressive with the Astra SP blades I use with it.</li>
            <li> Very nice, heavy duty construction.  Will pay for itsef in less than three months low cost of blades.  I pay $2.55 for a 10 pack of store brand blades.  A blade lasts for 7 days.  Primium blades are not always in stock at the local supermarket  and I&#x27;ve never priced Merkur.  The blade that came with the razor lasted 7 days.  This razor is heavy, so it took me a while to get use to it.  If you like a good shave and can spend an extra minute shaving, I recommend trying it.  I&#x27;m 57 years old and I love mine.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I rarely cut my face. When I do is when I am in a rush, which is expected with any razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take your time and do it right, you will have a perfect shave every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and change blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to anyone who wants to shave the right way.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re probably here because you&#x27;ve got some interest in trying a classic shave. Everything everyone else has said is true, this is a good product. This is my first DE razor, and seems like a good one for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this razor 5 times now and am very happy. I have light beard growth and have been shaving with this every other day since I received it without any irritation. I also have larger hands and still find this short handled model easy to use, because shaving with this style razor is done more with your finger tips. I look forward to shaving with this razor, and if you take your time and make deliberate, light and steady strokes you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s not as difficult as some make it sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re interested in a classic shaving experience give one of these a try.</li>
            <li> Great price, great shave...it reminds me of my Dad&#x27;s old Gillette safety razor that I would occasionally sneak a shave with!</li>
            <li> Out of the safety razors that I own, the Merkur HD 34c is one of my favorites that I keep going back to as I&#x27;ve yet to find anything that gives a better shave at any cost. There are many who compare this to an Edwin Jagger DE89, which I also own (DE89LBL lined handle). However, the Merkur 34c shaves better than the EJ and is perhaps a little more aggressive which is a good thing, albeit, still a mild smooth consistent shave. If I were going to own just one quality razor, it would be the Merkur 34C which will provide a lifetime of use with reasonable care.</li>
            <li> After way too much research, I decided to buy this razor and give the Double Edge Safety Razor a try. GREAT decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality:&lt;br /&gt;Ever heard the saying &amp;#34;they don&#x27;t make them like they used to?&amp;#34; Well, in this case, they make them EXACTLY like they used to. High quality. In fact, the moment I pulled this out of the package it was obvious this razor was of the highest quality. It has weight to it. This is not a cheap plastic thing - it&#x27;s a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size:&lt;br /&gt;I like the size of this razor. I debated over whether or not to get the long handle version. My advice is unless you have monster hands just get the shorty. When it came, it was actually a tad shorter than I imagined it would be, but this turned out to be a good thing. The shorter handle actually allows for better control and movement (because there isn&#x27;t a lot of extra handle to deal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2016-12-05&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this razor for over three years now, and it&#x27;s still as nice as the day I bought it. I use it 3-4 times a week and can get a closer shave with this than I ever got with an expensive modern razor. Shaving doesn&#x27;t take any more time than it did before. This purchase has paid for itself several times over with the amount of money I saved from not purchasing expensive razor blades.</li>
            <li> Nice double edge razor.  Handle is short, and the head has weight to it.  Fits my likes.</li>
            <li> Love this razor. The handle is a little short for me, but not a big deal. Works great.</li>
            <li> Fantastic intro razor. Will spur more razor purchases</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Outstanding quality and a serious instrument. Proud to own one. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for 2 years now. Incredibly happy with it. Durable and with a great weight. I like the textured handle as it offers some friction, even if wet. The short handle also allows for great control and maneuverability. Really good razor for starting or if you&#x27;re just looking for something different.</li>
            <li> Love the razor highly recommend</li>
            <li> Nice heaft to the razor, solid build. I thought the handle was going to be too short but it&#x27;s just right for me since my hands are a medium size.</li>
            <li> This product feels sturdy and looks great. I enjoy using it. The shorter handle gives great control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Merkur for 6 months and I&#x27;m still getting used to it.  But so far, it works great.  I have nicked myself several times because of to much pressure being applied.  It is usually on the right side where I start.  I have found that Derby blades work best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brought a Edwin Jagger to compare it with.  They are both great razors but I like the way the Merkur disassembles for blade replacement.  That may be why I use it more.  The Merkur seems to be less aggressive which is better for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish is flawless.  It looks great in the chrome stand.</li>
            <li> This razor is well made for the price, dont judge it by the blade they send with the razor because in my opinion it wasnt good. i bought a sampler pack that had some feathers in it from amazon and the shave was a lot closer like no stubble close. The sample pack i purchased came with 50 blades wish i bought 25 feathers, because i will be getting a straight blade with disposable razors. This is a great razor to get your strokes down and comfortable with but after two uses i feel im ready for the single blade. after i finish my sample pack of blades this will be given to a buddy for a gift and i will be stepping it up. close shave well made decent price great starter. make sure you try it with a diff blade then the one they send big difference.</li>
            <li> Great razor! I too will never use a cartridge razor again. The blade that came with it worked really good for me but I&#x27;ve ordered a sample pack of razors to try out different brands. Highly recommended product</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying out a double edge and after a lot of online reading I decided to get the 34c. I thought it would take me a while to get used to it, as some say, but I got the hang of it right away. It really gives you a better and closer shave than disposables. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great razor if you have small hands. I am 6&#x27;2\\&quot; and have pretty big hands. I ended up giving this to a buddy and buying the 38 hd which was much, much better</li>
            <li> Was quite apprehensive due to razor bumps, and just being totally new to the DE razor scene. After my first shave, I was TOTALLY impressed and had no issues. I use Art of Shaving products, and take my time. Also, I followed past reviews which suggested that I let the weight of the razor take over. Side note on 5 blade offer: I contacted the seller because I didn&#x27;t receive 5 free blades. They emailed back promptly and acknowledged the mistake. They sent me the feather blades, which I greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking care of me, will buy from seller again.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor from the art of shaving, i use a straight razor and love it. BUT for the days i don&#x27;t have enough time to shave with the straight razor i use this little guy. Not going to lie, but it gets that baby smooth feel! I also have thick hair which is why i was surprised as how close the save was.The Art of Shaving told me to use the blade only 10 times, but i have easily gone over that with the 1 blade it came with. It also looks amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my main brand of razors was the Gillette Fusion razors, which are expensive! BUT YOU DONT NEED THESE! EVEN IF YOU HAV SENSITIVE SKIN!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great razor and worth the money! HANDS DOWN!</li>
            <li> The Merkur HD 34C safety razor feels solidly made and  substantial in your hand. Its weight feels nicely balanced to me. One of the reasons I chose this razor was that it was not flimsy and that it had only two separating parts:the top blade holder section and the bottom holder section with attached handle that screws into the top section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The handle is shorter than most of todays modern multiblade-headed razors which unlike DE (double edge) razors usually also have a floating head. This DE razor&#x27;s handle is about 3 inches long. I like it though. It kind of forces you to use your fingers to lightly hold the handle so that the non floating head can gently follow the contours of your face. I have a feeling that if it had a long handle new users like myself just switching to a DE razor would tend to grip it in their plams and nick the heck out of their faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Everyone is slightly different when it come to shaving and some of the choices should be made by user&#x27;s trial comparisons. This thought applies to shaving creams/soaps, brush (if used) and the blade brand used. Each individual varies in skin type, beard type, and preferred beard preparation method. So shaving choices which include which shaving soap or cream, soap brush or can cream, and  personal choice of a DE blade brand that works best are items each user needs to decide on for themselves based on their personal conditions. Choosing the right blade for yourself is pretty important. I can tell you that some blades that got very good reviews did not turn out to be my favorites, at least not with this razor and my own conditions. You should try some sample packs until you find a blade that works well with all of your personal variables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I think most users will like this razor as it works well and gives very nice results once you get used to DE shaving techniques. Maybe people with very large hands would prefer the longer handle version, but for me this has been working quitewell for the last 6 weeks or so that I&#x27;ve had it and I&#x27;m quite pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Used this type of the razor with art of shaving kit. This razor definitely did not meet my expectations. Not as fine shaving as it claims to have. Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> This thing is going to last forever.  I love it.  Classic look and feel.  The free blades were so-so.. prefer feather or shark blades.  If you have never used a double edge, it takes a little getting used to.  But once you get the hang of it.. it&#x27;s hard to go back to disposables.</li>
            <li> just as described.....worth every penny! Great DE razor....highly recommend</li>
            <li> Best razor yet. Nice and heavy. Drop my blades in and its always lined up.</li>
            <li> I managed to break my long handled version of this. This feels sturdier and works great so far. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use this occasionally when I want a closer shave than electric and honestly it doesn&#x27;t take much more time.</li>
            <li> Being new to Wet shaving I went with the one that iv&#x27;e researched as a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;No doubt one of the best on the market</li>
            <li> I have above average size hands and can work well with the razor. I don&#x27;t feel like I need a longer handled version, but that will come down to personal preference. The razor is well balanced. If you need to clean it because soap scum or other gunk starts to build up, I&#x27;ve left it soaking overnight in vinegar and baking soda and it was clean as new the next morning.</li>
            <li> Great razor. This is my first quality razor and I was tossed between this and the 1904. The 34C won as i don&#x27;t have a thick beard and shave nearly everyday. Super easy to use and very forgiving but still provides a close shave for me in two passes (WTG/XTG) using an average at best blade. Curious how it will be with a feather.</li>
            <li> I prefer this razor over the Edwin Jagger 89 dbl.  I got it from Simply Beautiful/Amazon at the amazing price of $26.  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and simple, works quite well. It motors through a week&#x27;s worth of stubble without slowing down. The cost of this razor was about the same as a large package of blades for my former razor at Sams, but will last for the foreseeable future. It takes a bit of practice, but after you figure out how to angle the handle, it works great.    I use this razor, with Feather blades, to shave both face and head, with little difficulty. Rather than use the mug soap &amp; shaving brush most shaving websites recommend, I use HeadBlade&#x27;s HeadSlick shaving lotion, touch up with a styptic pencil when needed (not very often, unless I rush or apply too much pressure) and finish up with Gilette Aftershave Gel.    After shaving, I disassemble it, pat everything dry, reassemble it and dip the head in alcohol before putting it into a case I cobbled together from a travel soap case, a kitchen sponge and a couple of desiccant capsules out of pill bottles (total cost: about 2 bucks).    I am a truck driver, and don&#x27;t always have an opportunity to shave every day. In fact, there are weeks I only shave once or twice, and this razor effortlessly mows right through a weeks stubble without slowing down. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy this razor, or one like it, years ago.</li>
            <li> Very well weighted, nice to use. I really like this better then the Edwin Jagger razor that I have, I think the build quality is much nicer.</li>
            <li> Kind of a pain in the butt to change the blade case you have to unscrew the top part</li>
            <li> This was must first safety razor. It has great weight, so it is easy to use for a beginner. It looks great and is also easy to clean. The one complaint that I have is the handle is on the small side, but it was easy to adjust to it. I plan on holding onto it for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Quality that should last a lifetime...add a feather blade and experience an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, yet simple.  I actually enjoy shaving again.</li>
            <li> solid feel and size... works really well</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the packaging to be so cheap looking, though we don&#x27;t shave with the packaging.  I purchased this based on a TON of reviews on lots of different websites and forums, and a few youtube videos.  It works as they say.  I&#x27;m a first time wet shaver so I approached it very cautiously.  It works well.  It&#x27;s smooth, easy to work with.  I&#x27;m in between with the handle size.  I would like a little more handle but not as much as the other one.  I prefer this over the long handle.  There are a ton of options out there, you gotta start somewhere and learn what you like.  This was a good beginning point, I don&#x27;t regret it.  This was&#x27;t a very expensive product, aside from the packaging, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t seem very cheap as well.  It&#x27;s a in the pocket kind of purchase for someone like me wanting to start out with a quality razor, getting to learn the art, and not blowing the bank.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to use the rasor yet because the blade had a nit</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it- best shave ever. You could almost say the shave is smoother than a baby&#x27;s butt. I ordered a package deal, with the bracket/stand to hold the razor and brush and I have to admit the stand truly compliments the razor. Delivery and package exceeded expectations.</li>
            <li> I have used an electric shaver as well as the mach 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...but nothing comes close to this Merkur HD razor. Please note that I have not tried any other safety blades...but I do know that this Merkur HD gives me a pretty awesome close shave without any irritation or ingrown hairs. Freaking amazing. However, there definitely is a learning curve. If you&#x27;re as inpatient as I am, prepare to lose a little blood all over your face. It took me about a month before I got used to it and . Love it!!!</li>
            <li> As a long time user of disposable razors, I never thought of using a safety razor until I saw the commercial for the Micro Touch so I decided to research it.&lt;br /&gt;Most reviews gravitated towards the 34C as a good razor for newbies and experienced users alike for the price point so I bought one.&lt;br /&gt;Watched several YouTube videos on how to use a DE razor and luckily haven&#x27;t nicked myself yet.  Very nice close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Using a Van der Hagen shaving set until I get more into the art of shaving.  Looking forward to trying different soaps/blades and I read that Semogue boar brushes rival silvertip badger brushes and are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Merkur heavy duty double edge razor (34C).  This was after reading a lot if reviews and trying to find a solution to sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always used the Gillette fusion, five blade razors. I shave almost every day and have sensitive skin causing razor burn and ingrown hairs. The Merkur with Personna blades gives me drastically less irritation. I had no issues of cutting myself during my change. I simply take a little more time to make sure I get everything right at the jaw line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, DE razors are cheaper than Gillette cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I made the change. I should have changed to the Merker DE razor a long time ago; you should too.</li>
            <li> I see why it&#x27;s rated number one.</li>
            <li> Quality, well made razor.  Fit and finish very good.  Solid feel and good weight.  My only problem was that it was too harsh for my beard/skin.  I shaved three times with it, using Porazo soap with badger brush, and three different blades, Derby, Feather, and Shark.  Razor burn all three times.  Nice razor, but not for me. Returned it.</li>
            <li> A rugged razor that uses double edge blades.</li>
            <li> Just as good as advertised. I am very happy with the razor</li>
            <li> This razor is the best duoble edge razor you can buy for the money. The weight of this thing is perfect! Invest in some nice Feather blades and you&#x27;re in there!</li>
            <li> Though i have been using de razors for the past 15years which are farely good, wanted to try merkur 34 c for all the comments its receiving the popularity it has. Bought one last week and after the 1st shave, i can say its really good. Once u expertise the art  of shaving it really doesnt matter if u have reasonably heavy de razor or merkur. Its all in the art one has mastered over time. I like merkur for its weight, quality..otherwise its all the same among ej or parker</li>
            <li> I received this razor in new condition but I think it is wrong. I was under the impression that this was a 2 piece razor. The one I received was a 3 piece razor. I ordered the 34C and it looks like I got the 33C.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this razor. It is my first DE razor. I find that the Merkur blades themselves were not a good match for my skin, but that a couple of other brands I have tried worked much better than the included blades.</li>
            <li> Great razor , would recommend it for anybody looking to change to a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Only used it a couple of times so far, but it seems like a well made razor.  The supplied blade is very good.  I still have to get used to loading and unloading the blade without the butterfly action.  I was using an old Gillette razor that my father-in-law had, so I’m used to the way that operated.  I ordered 100 Astra blades at the time I ordered this razor, so I hope they work as well as the Merkur blade.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try a double edge razor, the razor is very well constructed, &amp;#34;worried that I would slice my face to bits&amp;#34;, hasn&#x27;t happened, easy to use, Taylor of Bond street cream , great close shave, went from shaving twice a week to almost daily,, love the scent and feeling, only reason not to get five stars, the length, should have bought the longer razor</li>
            <li> If you spend over 3 dollars a week on razor blade cartridges. IE Gillette Fusion. Or if your the guy that makes his cartridge last a month.... This razor is for you. There is a learning curve. It&#x27;s a fact. You will have to soften your beard in the shower with conditioner. Or use a preshave product such as Paraso. ANY form of shaving cream will result in a good shave. Don&#x27;t let the die hards peer pressure you into the fancy shaving soaps... Unless you want to use them. I like them. But unnecessary. Look into an After Shave Balm. They can.be helpful starting out. Otherwise the same Paraso will work great. You will find yourself looking forward to shaving. To spending less time in the shower and more time in front of the mirror. By choice. The most you could possibly spend on blades a week is $1. The least $.10. Get a blade sampler pack. Try them all once. Keep a journal of pros and cons for each blade. Then try them all again. You will find the perfect blade. Good luck and have fun! Your life will forever be different.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, he loved it, I tried it to shave my legs, I loved it. We both thought it was the best shave we have ever had. The handle is small but it fits perfectly in both of our hands and is easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> Thick hair? Irritattion? Ingrowns? Buy a safety razor. This is my first safety razor. Just shaved with it for the first time Not difficult. Not cuts. Best shave since I was 16 years old. Four stars because it came with one blade. Come on, throw in another!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to any other form of shaving, using a safety razor is one of the most relaxing things I&#x27;ve been able to do in a long time. This product works perfectly for beginnings, it allowed me to develop a very nice technique.</li>
            <li> I started using this Merkur about 3 years ago, and I won&#x27;t ever use anything else. It might seem a little awkward because the handle is so short, but it&#x27;s very easy to control.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful piece made with outstanding craftsmanship. The short handle, I believe helps it to feel well balanced.</li>
            <li> Just received this razor today and I have had my first shave with it already and it was good.  Nice weight to the razor heavy in the hand don&#x27;t need to add any additional pressure to shave my rough bread. So far to early to give a full honest review I will update later once I have a lot more shaves. But first impression was nice.</li>
            <li> Feels super premium, looks good, great weight on the skin, cleans easily. I couldn&#x27;t as for more from a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Great all around razor. Well made and has a hefty handle. No need to put any pressure on the handle while shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought my man this razor for Christmas. When he wasn&#x27;t looking, I snagged it to shave my bikini line. Blessed Jesus, I&#x27;ll never use those expensive store bought pieces of crap again. Close shave, no cuts, and no ingrown hairs!. It&#x27;s a miracle! What was my mom thinking when she taught me to use those crappy razors.? She probably didn&#x27;t want dad killing his 3 daughters. I&#x27;m buying myself one today since the man left to go out of state to work, I can&#x27;t look like a gorilla when he gets home.</li>
            <li> Awesome weighted safety blade. Easy to change blades. Took me a few weeks to achieve nick free shaves, so if you are new to the safety razor wet shave, buy a styptic pencil with it. With Amazon, you use Subscription Order for the blades to keep well stocked.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to switch to this.  With the insane prices of razors, I was looking at dollar shave club, but you only get cheapo disposables for $1 there and you have to pay for shipping.  I looked into the best bang for my buck with shaving and kept coming back to safety razors.  Took the plunge with this beauty.  I love it.  Less cuts, less ingrown hairs, less razor burn, great smell with Taylor of Old Bond Street Shaving Cream.  I read some reviews that were concerned about cutting, and this thing will cut the daylights out of you if you don&#x27;t properly wet the soap and push the razor like you do with disposables.  Let the weight of the head do the work and you will get a close, comfortable shave that will cost you next to nothing.  I got 50 feather razors for $15.  So breaking down my shaves by week including blades, razor and soap, I&#x27;m paying about $1.42 per week to shave.  Next year that total goes down to $0.57.  Total no brainier.</li>
            <li> Far better than any cartridge razor I ever used. I did have to relearn how to shave again but it&#x27;s only a short learning experience. Finding the right blade has taken more time than learning how to use this razor. My dad saw this and I think he misses his old razor. There might be something for him under the tree this year .</li>
            <li> I don’t know about anyone else, but every time I looked at the price of cartridges I could feel my butt cheeks clinch. This was the main reason why I bought the Merkur 34C. I don’t have a GQ style review to write so all I can say is this razor works. If you’re looking for economy, value, a green product, and an awesome shave this is it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t do this sooner.</li>
            <li> I just got into double edge safety razor shaving.  This is a great introductory razor.  It has a short handle and is nicely weighted so you do not have to press against your skin to get a close shave.  The grip on the handle helps prevent any possible slipping in your hand.  If you are just beginning with a safety razor this is an inexpensive way to get started.  Don&#x27;t let the short handle dissuade you - a short handle gives better control than a long one.  Great buy for the money</li>
            <li> This razor is okay not my favorite, but i will still leave it in my rotation.</li>
            <li> I used the Feather butterfly for more than 2 years. It used to give me the same feeling of this Merkur. but it got the touches started to change and thus after reading so many reviews, I have decided to choose this.&lt;br /&gt;I use it with Feather blades which use to give me irritation with the feather razor &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34;. however, I DECIDED to take a challenge to see how this will perform on my skin with Merkur. Feather became very very gentle...OMG&lt;br /&gt;The Weight is heavy which no need to press while shave and let you feel that you are handling something worthy. I give 9 /10&lt;br /&gt;The finish is piece of art. rate 9.5 /10&lt;br /&gt;The fixing of blades is vey easy as it is only two peaces but for sure not like the butterfly ones. Rate 9 /10&lt;br /&gt;The blades inserted is fixed and not moving like the butterfly as I do make it loose in the butterfly for making the moustache lines. while in this; it is only one fix and make sure it is tighten will and you will get every thing. 9.5 /10&lt;br /&gt;close shave. 9.5/10</li>
            <li> excellent.  I won&#x27;t ever go back to disposables or electric.  The shorter handle does take a bit getting used to.</li>
            <li> Just so you know to order some blades, while the ad said blade included, none were - and I carefully checked the packaging. Not a big deal, and a heads up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oops... Found the blade in the small paper instructions - look there to find it. They are so thin the blade is easily missed</li>
            <li> Great razor. It has really aggressive knurling, it&#x27;s easy to hold, nicely weighted, holds any standard safety razor blade, and is easy to clean. The angle on the blade isn&#x27;t super aggressive, and it can be easily used for body shaving as well as face shaving. Definitely a winner.</li>
            <li> I did it, I fell for the hype.  I was shaving with a Quatro and was having so much irritation with it that I was tired of them.  I have always been one for Nostalgia, but I fell for the &amp;#34;more blades is better&amp;#34; hype and was worried about switching to something my &#x27;grandpa&#x27; used to use, because as things go on they are supposed to get better, right?  WRONG.  This has been one of the best purchases I have ever made!  It took me 2 strokes to get the technique down and it is so much better than those fancy disposable blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is up there, but that is just the initial cost.  When you compare the cost of maintenance with this as compared to the disposable razors (namely the blades and frequency of changes), this is cheaper by far.  It also takes up far less room when you get the stand that holds it.  I wish I would have done this from the beginning and saved hundreds of dollars.  I recommend you do some research online and make the leap to the tried and true method of shaving.</li>
            <li> Used mine for the first time on Christmas morning. Awesome shave and incredibly easy to learn. Wonderful gift to myself!</li>
            <li> Just switched to a safety blade.  Quality product in all aspects. Beautifully chromed and knurled handle. First time using this razor achieved an incredible close shave.  Best part is the money which I save not having to buy Gillette cartridges. Bought a second for business travel</li>
            <li> Nice weight, easy to use. High build quality. I bought it because it was highly regarded as a good DE razor for beginners, and it did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor and I love it.  I heard a lot of people start with this and they are right about it being a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: works great.  Easy to use, Compact&lt;br /&gt;Cons: closed blade makes it hard for head shaving.</li>
            <li> Very nice razor. Not to aggressive. Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love this item, I get very harsh ingrown hairs. After buying this and shaving every other day my skin has been restored!! Save your money and buy this produce its amazing . Be ready to bleed at frist lol</li>
            <li> This is a very nice safety razor. It provides an excellent shave and is built very well. The only reason I didn&#x27;t gave it 5 stars is because is a bit too short.</li>
            <li> Best safety razor I have ever used. Excellent construction perfect size and weight for me. Will use this razor for years to come.</li>
            <li> Great product, well built DE Razor, it came with a Merkur blade, but my go to blade is a Feather Platinum. Great razor for beginners not very aggressive, but will give you a gret shave.</li>
            <li> Great razor. I&#x27;ll never go back to a fusion or any other over priced modern razor. If you&#x27;re a man then get it.</li>
            <li> Being new to wet shaving, I did a lot of research to determine what would be the best starter razor, and everywhere I looked the Merkur 34c HD always came up. I am so pleased with thus razor and can see why it has such a great reputation. It&#x27;s quality made and built to last. It is short, but holds its own it weight, making it perfect for a new wet shaver trying to learn the skill. Just let the weight of the razor work for you. I really had no trouble adjusting and look forward to every shave.</li>
            <li> Great. Good product as expected.</li>
            <li> Great safety razor at a great price.</li>
            <li> I definitely like the razor and am surprised at how small it is.  It works just like my Merkur 38C, but with a little less heft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the shipping front...it&#x27;s orders like this that make me wonder why I pay for Prime.  When it takes 10 days from the time you order a product to have it show up, there seems to be no point in requesting 2 day shipping.  This order was also fulfilled by Amazon so there&#x27;s really no excuse.</li>
            <li> I was tired of getting poorer and poorer shaves with these multiple blade disposable razors so I gave wet shaving a try. First of all this is a very well made razor! They don&#x27;t make products like this in the USA anymore, made to last a lifetime! Wet shaving gives me fantastic shaves, and the variety of soaps available only add to the pleasure. You can get outstanding help if you are new to wet shaving on YouTube at &amp;#34;Paulshaves&amp;#34; too. And, it&#x27;s very inexpensive!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor to eliminate the need for the expensive multiblades that still seem to cause razor burn and wear out after a week. I&#x27;m not trying to go back to the past and spend 20 minutes shaving with badger brush and serious lather. I use this razor, an Astra blade, and regular old sunflower cooking oil to shave. My skin loves it.</li>
            <li> First DE used. Tremendous shave quality, I like the Merkur blade that came installed in the handle as well as the Feather blades everyone has suggested. I did get a sample pack, but found it very difficult to remember which blades I liked or didn&#x27;t. Works very well on African American skin/beard types with almost no ingrown hairs to worry about. I also use Clinique shave cream which stays very close to your face and doesn&#x27;t foam. The shorter handle seems to be precise for me, I also have a long handle but prefer the smaller more agile 34c.</li>
            <li> The best DE shaver you can for the money from beginner to advanced users you can never go wrong with this Merkur its a must have.</li>
            <li> Wow!! just used it for the first time tonight. Even after a few beers I didnt cut myself as others suggested would happen your first time wet shaving. All I can say is wow! why didnt I do this sooner...  awesome shave and soo close. bye bye expensive multi blade cartridges! Im sold...  I should have switched sooner. Live and learn I guess. 5 stars !!</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for about a year. Use it with Feather blades, Vanderhagen shave soap from Walmart, an Escali badger brush and  Nivea post shave balm also bought at the Walmart.  Total setup cost was about $60.  The Feather blades are awesome and much better than Derby or Astra.  This is my second razor.  My first was a Parker that kept cutting my neck and chin.  This German razor cost $15 more but is so much nicer.  The affordability of wet shaving is such a great saving.  50 Feather blades cost about $11 and can give 3 shaves apiece. 100 Astra or Derby blades cost around $11 and can also give around 3 shaves but not near as close. After one year the razor looks great if I clean it up and has no rust.  Simply awesome piece of tech that every man should be using.  $60 today will last you till the middle of next year when you will have to spend $11 to order enough razors to bring in 2016.</li>
            <li> One of the best razors that I have owned. Smooth shave and solid feel. Much better shave than when I have to use a disposable head system. I find that the Persona blades work the best for me; but the safety blade itself is a personal choice. Maintenance is very easy. This razor is a good choice for anyone wanting a good, close shave.</li>
            <li> This handle is short, but my husband says he thinks it&#x27;s great that way. It is easy to change the blades. This is a sturdy product and is as described. I think this will be his permanent razor from now on--no need to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I just purchased and used the 34C along with Sandalwood shaving cream and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the shaving experience!  I have been using the Micro touch for several weeks and prior to that it was expensive multiblade razors, preceded by electric.  I now discover after shaving for 30 years with subpar results, that good preparation and using a decent safety razor &amp; good blades are a must.  First off I lathered the shave cream real good and applied with brush to face for about 1 1/2 minutes.  The Merkur cut the whiskers like butter using a light touch and letting the weight of the razor do the work.  The handle is short but very balanced and offers great feedback while shaving.  Best shave of my life by far!  I also purchased the 100 personna DE pack bring the cost per blade down to about .12 cents.  Wish I had done this sooner.</li>
            <li> I got the text message saying that my razor was delivered, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home to try it out. I already shaved that morning but I couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a try. The razor is more aggressive than the one that I had been using and the blade that came with it certainly made me feel it so into the blade bank it went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased some Derby blades and I tried it with one of those the next morning. That was a much better pairing and I got a smooth shave with no nicks. I use a shaving cream called Billy Jealousy that I purchased from Costco. It works pretty well and requires re-wetting to keep my face slick. I do 2 passes, the first across the grain and the second against the grain. I tried 3 passes before but I don&#x27;t get better results and it seems as though the first pass going with the grain really doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can tell that this is a precision product made with quality materials. I feel like this is going to out last my lifetime. The Germans are great at what they do. I wish that I could say the same for the blade, but I hear that what&#x27;s good for one may not be good for another because our hair and skin combinations can dramatically affect the result that we get with the different blades out there. I am shave daily because I work in a professional environment, and it&#x27;s important how comfortable the shaves are because I certainly feel it, and razor burn and nicks affect the following day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I shave I wipe everything down including the blade with a wet towel and dry / polish everything with a dry towel and re-assemble so it will be ready for shaving again the following morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Quality, looks great, works great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I can&#x27;t think of any</li>
            <li> Good simple gear. Works as expected. If you like a good smooth shave, this and the quality blade of your choice (my choice was Personna) can deliver.</li>
            <li> Nice product! Very good weight will never go back to a standard razor. Not to big and not to small a good normal size so its easy to hold while using.</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving with very little investment and was using an old Gillette adjustable double edge razor.  That worked fine but the razor really needed to be professionally re-plated and I wasn&#x27;t going to deal with that.  After reading reviews, I went with the Merkur 34C and have been nothing but pleased.  I always grip the razor near the head so the shorter handle is fine for me.  The weight of the 34C, along with a really good blade, does all of the work and gives a great shave.  I also just like putting a new blade in and going, no adjustments like I used to do.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was DE curious but scared, turns out my fears were over nothing. It&#x27;s shaving, way nicer shaving, but no more difficult than that. Get good cream, I like Taylors Old Bond, get a mid price badger brush and a stand and a blade sample pack. Soak your brush in warm water while you shower. Dry off, leave your face wet, if it dries shake out your brush and wet your face. Swirl your brush on the cream and get just a bit and swirl it around on your face. Dip the ends in a bit of water if you need more. Shave using motions 90 degrees to the razor head. If you miss spots lather up again, wash the brush, rinse your face in cold water.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor but did not receive the razor blade as advertised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but I really like the 43C Merkur. Much heavier. If the 34C had the weight of the 43C  it would be perfect. Shorter handle is a plus on the 34C.</li>
            <li> My first foray into safety razors. It is fantastic. The stainless steel cleans very easily and the weight of the handle makes it easy to control. Expect it to last me a lifetime.</li>
            <li> This razor does a great job.  It&#x27;s a fine a quality as one you&#x27;d find at the mall. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am a gentleman. I require an exceptional razor with quality razor blades to achieve the professional look. The Merkur 34C razor is an essential part of my morning routine. Technique is critical. The shaving time is longer than with traditional cartridge razors, but it gave me time to reflect who I was as a human being. Be selective with your badger brush purchase, and spend timing considering the perfect soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care with Feather brand razor blades. Incredibly sharp: perhaps too sharp for the recently converted. Sample packs with a variety of different brands are available on Amazon to help you decide which razor blade is suitable for your skin and beard.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the time testes procedure to shave like our forefathers did. It was great. I was impressed with the weight of the razor. I got a extremely close shave. But I do recommend as I will do for my next shave, don&#x27;t use your regular shaving cream, use a pre shave oil if possible and take your time. Enjoy shaving. Also if you have large hands like myself, maybe you should consider one that is a little bigger as i am but I will stay with Merkur. Now its on to Barbour shaving.</li>
            <li> its heavy, which helps with a close shave. I like that it has the blade changer screw from the bottom, washing the blades out makes it easy for me.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied! Great product. This razor gave me the best shave I have ever had. The razor replacement cartridges are very inexpensive compared to the name brand Gilette brands.  :) I</li>
            <li> Very professional and well built. Will last a life time and then some. The weight is perfect, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> If you want to feel like a man when you shave try a safety razor. This one is awesome. Gives a great clean shave. The blades are cheap. I&#x27;ve never had a closer shave with less irritation.</li>
            <li> My dad loves this product it gives a great smooth shave. And the razor is good quality and worth the money will own it for years to come.</li>
            <li> Some much better than those multi-bladed razors.  Maybe I should have gotten the long handle model but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get use to this.</li>
            <li> I began using an old butterfly type Gillett Double Edge Razor some 40 years ago.  Soon after the newer double, triple, and five bladed razors were introduced I stopped using my double edge razor.  Now the expense of these along with their short life span, I decided to go back to the &amp;#34;old school - tried &amp; true&amp;#34; method.  I ordered the Merkur 34C along with some additional Merkur blades, some Taylor of Old Bond Street St. James Luxury Shaving Cream,  a Parker 100% Pure Badger Bristle Black Handle Shaving Brush, and an Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand.&lt;br /&gt;Now this is shaving!  The Merkur 34C is a well balanced, well made, and attractive shaving device.  Blades fit perfectly securely without any guess work.  Simply unscrew the razor head using the knurled knob on the end of the razor.  I invert the razor head and place the blade in the head.  Invert the handle and place the bolt of the razor head back in the handle and retighten the head.  Simple and quick.&lt;br /&gt;The Parker Badger Bristle Brush is amazingly soft and the Taylor Luxury Shaving Cream is superb...a magnificent combination to prepare your beard after showering.  The Escali Chrome stand holds the Brush and Razor perfectly and the combo is incredibly attractive.&lt;br /&gt;Merkur Double edge razors set the bar for close shaving luxury and whichever razor you choose to use will be highly dependent on your personal preference(s).  The 34C will hardly wear out and is easy to care for. On a cost/benefit ratio it is a no-brainer.  If you have a tough beard and are on the fence of whether to give up your Gillett multi-blade razor...this is probably the one to consider.  It is easy to learn the art of wet shaving with this razor due to it&#x27;s inherent weight.  No real exertion on the users part is required.  Just a steady guiding of the razor across the face with an accurate touch.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Freakin awesome!!! No more gimmiky overpriced cartridge Mach III BS for me. These razors may be a little high to start with but in the end hey are even cheaper than shave clubs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Merkur Heavy Duty for a couple months now and I really like the weight and balance, it is well crafted.  I haven&#x27;t used a double edge razor in about 35 years, and I can&#x27;t remember why I got I started using the crappy/expensive safety razors.  I will admit you need to be more cautious and not rush when using a double edge razor, but that&#x27;s not a problem.  Razor blades are rated 1 - 5, where 1 is least sharp and 5 is most sharp. I chose Derby blades (rated a 1) because my whiskers are fine, and because blades rated 1 are more forgiving (less likely to cut yourself).  Having said that, I think I&#x27;ll try a 2 or maybe a 3 next time, but considering I only spent $5 for 25 blades, it might be awhile.  I can&#x27;t believe how much money I&#x27;ve wasted on the safety razors over the years - no more.  Conclusion, the Merkur is well built, easy to clean, nice quality - I&#x27;m very glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy shaving with my new Merkur Heavy Duty. It provides a close save and, after you get used to the new technique required to shave with a double edge razor, you will not want to go back to the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; razors. Shaving becomes a new thing for you - much better.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I didn&#x27;t go the safety razor route sooner. it&#x27;s the best shave I had to date. I actually enjoy shaving now! Highly recommend this razor for first time buyers which is what I am.</li>
            <li> I get a much better shave with this than a fusion.  I&#x27;m still working on technique and trying to find just the right blade.  When using an Astra or 7 o&#x27;clock I get a nice smooth shave and the blades are cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off a star because one of the 4 corners on the razor&#x27;s head is a bit &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; not that it would ever cut you.  It is rounded enough to prevent that, but is a bit more pointy.  So, at times that point gets me in the nose or neck.  Other than that I really like it.  I tried an Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl this morning.  I liked that razor, but even though it is lined it is still too slippery compared to the Merkur&#x27;s knurling.</li>
            <li> I was referred to this razor by a friend who had been into DE wet shaving for a while and this is the razor that he had started with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a little bit of time to get used to the razor itself and the correct angle. To help out I watched a couple of video&#x27;s on YouTube and spoke with my friend. I also changed out the razorblade to a different brand and that helped me out a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for 6-8 weeks now and I love it. It definitely takes a little bit longer to shave due to only using one pass and then reapplying shaving cream again to shave again, but it is so worth it. The razor itself is the perfect size and feel comfortable in your hand. The weight is good, and it glides effortlessly when you use it. If you take the time to get used to it, and use good shaving lather you will love this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also cleans very easily and the blade is a breeze to change out.</li>
            <li> Have not used a safety razor in 40 years but missed the quality of the shave.  My last safety razor was the Durham.  I read &#x27;The Ultimate Guide to Safety Razors&#x27;.  Then I took my time, followed these recommendations and got a perfect shave the first time with no nicks.  Amazing!  I did one minor deviation from the suggestions.  I continued to use liquid hand soap on my face.  It has always worked for me and continues to do so with this razor and blade.  The plastic handle disposable shavers were no longer working well for me.  Something has changed ... maybe they are not making them as well as they had been.</li>
            <li> First time I have ever used a double edge safety razor and I am sold. Never again will I pay for a disposable razor. The Merkur 34c is the way to go, smooth shave, easy to use, easy to install the blade and the short handle works great. Simply an amazing product.</li>
            <li> The Merkur #34C (aka Heavy Duty DE Razor) has a short, BUT VERY THICK handle that is ideal if you have some pretty heavy hands that otherwise would make the #180 Long Handle impractical to use (something that I personally use because my fingers ARE long).  This was a gift but I still played around it after presenting this to him when he asked for one.  I&#x27;d have no complaints traveling with this, it&#x27;s a nice little companion that offer&#x27;s a lot.  Don&#x27;t expect Merkur to produce cheap products because this is the real deal.  Need something with a thick Handle but with a longer handle like the #180?  Then consider the #39C Slant Bar.  When I did buy the #34C, I also have to give credit to the venue that I did business with:  The Luxury Barber, THESE PEOPLE WERE AWESOME!  Quick and professional service, I&#x27;m excited to do business with these people again in the near future.  THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> After researching on-line the 34C was recommended for a beginner to wet shaving. After several shaves I highly recommend Merkur and their 34C. Initially I was concerned about the handle length (which was a lot shorter than my cartridge razors), after my first shave I found that the length of handle actually helped in the balance and control. The quality of design, materials &amp; build are incredible -certainly worth the cost. If you&#x27;re new to WS, you won&#x27;t go wrong with the 34C, just remember to keep the pressure off and let the weight of the razor do the work. Coming from years of cartridge scraping, added pressure was necessary to drag the multiple blades through one&#x27;s beard. Something you will not need do with a DE/safety razor; in fact, too much pressure will cause nicks, razor burn and other issues which will make your face unhappy. I did use the included blade for the first three (3) shaves and am now trying out blades from a sample set. Something highly recommended for a newbie, as well as the book &amp;#34;Gourmet Shaving. A lot of useful info, insight and recommendations that has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin needs all the help it can get . And this device on my face helps drastically to reduce razor bumps . I&#x27;m a dark skin black male and guys in my shoes notoriously get razor bumps from a lot of different shavers . This one blade action on my skin gives me a close shave without having to deal with 3 or 4 blades pulling my facial hair causing them to curl back in causing severe razor bumps . I&#x27;ve been using this style razor for a few years now and I love it . Just one thing. Be careful because the double edge blade that goes in it is sharp as hell!!!</li>
            <li> Great razor&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- perfect quality&lt;br /&gt;- good weight&lt;br /&gt;- workmanship is superb&lt;br /&gt;-Performance is top notch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Comes in a carboard box and no case included.&lt;br /&gt;-Plastic merkur case is extra and should come with a razor priced at this level</li>
            <li> This was the best decision I have ever made for my sensitive, rarely happy and irritible face. The day after the first shave left me with no nicks, a good feeling and the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in years. Well played, Merkur, well played...</li>
            <li> To begin I didn&#x27;t give this razor 5 stars because this was (as the title said) my first every DE purchase so I have nothing to compare it too. When compared to my old Mach3 this thing has some weight and doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy at all. It&#x27;s also very nice to buy something that isn&#x27;t made out of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I settled on a blade (bought a sample pack and tried them all) I finally began to enjoy the entire process of shaving. When you get the right lather, a blade that works for you, and a proper DE razor, you won&#x27;t even feel that you are shaving. Which is a huge departure from anything I ever had before. Should have dropped multiple blade cartridge crap yrs ago. IMHO, wet shaving with a brush, soap, and DE razor is the only way to fly.</li>
            <li> Far better than the USMC issue safety razor I remember from Parris Island back in 83. I&#x27;m getting used to a single bladed razor again. Not as many nix as the week/s previous. As I remember to let the shaver&#x27;s weight do the work of plowing through the whiskers, I can&#x27;t but wonder why I messed around with all those pricey shaving systems for so many years. I&#x27;m liking this a lot. I wouldn&#x27;t say I love it...yet. Check back in another month or two.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a DE razor and I couldn&#x27;t figure out the differences between the popular ones listed so I went ahead and ordered 6 of them to do my own evaluation. I&#x27;ve tested the Merkur 180(23C), Merkur 34C, Merkur Futur, Parker 99R, Parker 22R, and Edwin Jagger De89lbl. I personally rank the Merkur 34C and the 180(23C) as my favorite razors. It&#x27;s short but has a good solid grip handle with a solid end grip. The other DE razors have design grips that slip and just feel bulky.</li>
            <li> Been using this razor for couple weeks now and i really like it. It feels nice and sturdy. The only down side for me is i have big hands and the handle seems a bit short for me but i did notice that they sell razors with longer handles so that could be my next razor.</li>
            <li> Works well, hardest part is choosing the correct blades to your face.</li>
            <li> As a newbie to wet shaving w/ safety razor, I thought I had a unique opportunity to test some different razors before I developed any opinions or biases. My goal was keep price around $25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month in I now have the following:&lt;br /&gt;Mercur 34c&lt;br /&gt;Kinbar, long handle&lt;br /&gt;Parker 26c open comb&lt;br /&gt;Samari Classic&lt;br /&gt;1953 vintage Gillet TTO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mercur heavy duty is by far the most comfortable smooth daily shave. Each razor has something I really like but the Merkur is my go to safest of the safety razor quiver I have.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t tried many DE razors, and this one was my first one. But I love this razor. It&#x27;s a 2 piece, which is fine by me. My only other DE razor is an Ikon 102 slant. It&#x27;s a great razor, too. But I use this Merkur the most.</li>
            <li> loved it!  left it in Switzerland at a friends house.  I hope they&#x27;re enjoying it b/c I miss it...</li>
            <li> I got into safety razor shaving last year and haven&#x27;t looked back since.  I had read an article on the website The Art of Manliness and became interested in the art of a proper wet shave.  I started off with a low-end twist to open safety razor I bought at a foreign food store while in Seoul&#x27;s Itaewon district.  It wasn&#x27;t bad, especially when I paired it with some [[ASIN:B0022R947O Feather Hi-Stainless Platimum Double Edge Razor Blades 50 Ct]] I got during one of my trips to Japan.  But eventually, I wanted something more substantial.  I&#x27;d read some very good reviews on the quality of Merkur&#x27;s razors and decided to take the plunge.  I recently did my first shave with this beauty and was not disappointed at all!  The handle was shorter than I expected, but that&#x27;s not a problem.  The weight of the razor when I first pulled it out of the box was very pleasing.  I thought to myself, this is a proper and well-made tool and worthy of respect.  I enjoyed how the head retains heat when run through hot water while I rinse it off.  I decided to use [[ASIN:B001E6TTX8 Kiss My Face Lavender &amp; Shea Butter Moisture Shave, 11-Ounce Pumps (Pack of 4)]] with this and was amazed at how smooth my shave went.  The razor glided across my face with no problems and it almost didn&#x27;t feel like I was shaving.  There was zero irritation afterwards.  I highly recommend this razor to anyone wishing to enter the art of shaving.  The price to quality ratio of this razor is outstanding.</li>
            <li> We bought this razor for our son, who switched from electric. He LOVES it. Best shave ever he says.</li>
            <li> Just what my husband wanted and loves it!</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband at his request for Christmas. He loves it!</li>
            <li> Great Quality Product</li>
            <li> Great razor. I have the Feather Light also which is much more money and this works just as well.</li>
            <li> Jumped head in first and no regrets!!! The razor has the right heft it&#x27;s a little heavy and shaves itself, you have to just guide and correct angles as it glides down on the face. Important to have a good blade with it. I have tried a bunch of blades from try-a-blade site. I have a thick beard with steel wire growing. I find sharper blades like Rapira swedish stainless, Feather (the best in my opinion) and Polsilver - Super Iridium do a good job. For sensitive skin or moderate facial hair Personna, Astra would work well. There are dozens of blades, buying a couple of each of the ones with good reviews, should put you on the right path - happy shaving..</li>
            <li> Keeps my face and nether regions and smooth as a veal cutlet</li>
            <li> I dd my research and while this razor doesn&#x27;t have the butterfly-style open, it&#x27;s sturdiness, weight, and forgiveness has made it a wonder DE razor for someone new to this style of shaving. The two-piece design is solid and changing blades requires very little effort. The extra weight on the head allows for close shave with zero effort without sacrificing balance. I won&#x27;t be trading up anytime soon.</li>
            <li> It gives as good a shave as Gillette 3, 4 and five blade combinations.  Where can I get replacement blades</li>
            <li> Outstanding razor. Solid construction.  It will last me a life time.</li>
            <li> I have always used Gillette Cartridge razors since I started shaving. Typically the Mach 5 or Fusions. I was always having trouble with irritation and razor burn near my adams apple where the grain of hair changes. After reading and pondering on safety razors and blades for a few weeks I decided to plop down the money and buy myself the whole kit. I got some nice soap, a badger brush, Merkur 34C, and a nice stand to top it all off. This razor has absolutely changed my outlook on shaving! After watching a few YouTube videos on how to prepare a good lather I was off. First shave and I didn&#x27;t even cut myself. The irritation of the cartridge razors is a thing of the past and to top it all off I can now pickup 100 blades for about 11 bucks! This is an infinitely better way to shave that begs to question why we ever got duped into paying for 5 blade cartridges that offer an inferior and painful shave. If you are on the fence, take the plunge with one of the best time proven safety razor handles on the market. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Razor works well, however I chose a more aggressive razor. I now use above the tie atlas open comb H2 head. The gap is bigger and open comb is better. When I want a break from this aggressive razor I use the 34c. Sometimes when shaving late in the day on a Sunday Monday morning I may use the 34c. It is a very good razor for the price and the ATT razor is expensive, but worth every penny. When reviewing my orders I note I paid 49.50 and now it is selling for under 40.00.</li>
            <li> Gives a great shave.  Definitely prefer over the multi-blade disposables. Although I like the feel of using this razor, I&#x27;d have preferred the long handle version.</li>
            <li> A classic razor in all regards! I&#x27;ve since upgraded to the Futur which I love as well!!</li>
            <li> It is a very well built razor it doesn&#x27;t break easy. I&#x27;ve dropped mine a few times and is still in tact were others have broken. The closeness of the shave could be a little better. There are closer shavers out there they also promised a new blade that didn&#x27;t come with it. I don&#x27;t know if the blade would make a difference I&#x27;ve tried 4 different ones and the closeness of the shave is the same.</li>
            <li> Recently made the switch to wet shaving and chose the Merkur 34#C because many of the reviews described it as a great place to start for newbies. After just a few weeks, my face is noticeably clearer - no more razor burn or bumps. I&#x27;m still experimenting with different DE blades but so far every brand has fit perfectly in my Merkur razor. Easy to operate and easy to clean. Great razor - definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I will say this is a very early review as today was the first time I shaved using my new Merkur 34C HD DE razor.  I had been pretty public about me switching from cartridge shaving to DE shaving originally for cost savings, despite the upfront investment.  This was a great buy!!  No nicks or cuts and seriously the closest shave I think I have ever had doing a three pass shave (if you don&#x27;t know what that is, contact me and I will send the same video I watched).  I used a Gillet Mach 3 and it was probably the best cartridge I have used and was smooth if I rubbed my face after shaving in one direction, but after shaving with this my face is literally \\&quot;baby bottom smooth\\&quot; in all directions, even my wife is surprised at how smooth my face is. A little irritation but expected since it is a new way of shaving, similar to if you have switched from cartridge to electric or vice-versa.  Highly recommend this if you are thinking of the switch.  Requires more prep time and attention but I am pretty sure this is going to be a permanent change and never look back at cartridge shaving again, especially once you consider the continuing costs involved with both.  The picture is my actual set-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding a two week follow-up:  I am still very impressed with this razor and I mentioned above about some slight irritation and as I thought it was just the change in shaving, or possibly the blade, but after a couple days of this new shaving I had no irritation.  My technique is gradually getting better and there is a difference in blades used.  I have so far tried Derby, Personna (Red), Crystal, Merkur and Astra.  I still have a pack of Feather blades to try but wanted to make sure my technique was down before trying those.  Astra is my favorite blade with this razor, very close shave, no pulling or tugging, and no irritation.  I can see sticking with this razor for a long time and I also very much better understand the comments about better control with the short handle.  I would highly recommend this razor for beginners or advanced users as I don&#x27;t see how you can get a closer shave.  I will even recommend this to my Barber for neck shaves.y recommend this razor for beginners or advanced users as I don&#x27;t see how you can get a closer shave.

            <li> Best DE razor available. Well built.</li>
            <li> easy to use. would prefer it to be a little longer but it works very well and gives an excellent shave with the Merkur blades.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor. I has a nice weight and balance to it. I wish that I had known about this particular brand of razor 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> nicely balanced. solid</li>
            <li> Read the reviews. It&#x27;s worth every penny, especially for a new DE user. I love it.</li>
            <li> I am Linda&#x27;s husband and the razor is for me.  I like everything about it, but the handle could definitely be longer.  Had I realized it was that short I would have ordered one with a longer handle.</li>
            <li> I think for a guy, this is probably one of the best purchases you can ever make. Don&#x27;t let the short handle fool you, it works exceptionally. I have also tried the longer skinnier handle and it is not even close to this razor. At first you will get a bunch of cuts and there is about a month learning period. It does take a little more time shaving but it is a pleasure to do so. I highly recommend a badger brush and it does make a huge difference. After spending some $$$ on that all you need are the razors which are super cheap here on amazon. If everyone knew how good shaving like this is Gillette would go out of business for the mens department immediately.</li>
            <li> Excellent piece of shaving awesomeness. Great construction, upper mild shave. Perfect for my sensitive skin. I would recommend for anyone 10/10!</li>
            <li> I had never used a double edge (DX) razor before although my father and uncles used one. For some reason I was afraid of the DE razor; it looked as if one could cut oneself badly.  I went to YouTube and found a few videos demonstrating &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; shave using a DE. One video had the instructor shaving a five (5) day old beard, which by the way came off like a hot knife through butter.&lt;br /&gt;I summoned my courage and tried the DX razor.  For a moment while shaving for the first time, I thought that the razor did not work; I didn&#x27;t feel a thing, i.e. there was no &amp;#34;tug or pull&amp;#34; of the DE blade on your facial hair. For a &amp;#34;brief&amp;#34; moment I thought that there wasn&#x27;t any blade in the Merkur. Wow, I can&#x27;t describe the feeling of shaving with the Merkur Duty Double Edge razor. It is simply the best shaving appliance that I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;In retrospect I cannot believe that I had been denying myself a great shaving experience all these years.  I don&#x27;t say this lightly but do yourself a favorite a try &amp;#34;any&amp;#34; double edge razor and see for yourself that it provides the closest and most comfortable shave that you had had.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, did I mention that the cost of a DE blade is approximately 15 % of the cost of a Gillette cartridge and gives you twice as many shaves?</li>
            <li> This razor is very heavy duty and well made. The razor that came with it gave me the closest most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> This is the second DE that I have owned. My first one was a cheap one($10) from a beauty supply store to see if I even liked it. I told myself for a long time that the extra money wouldn&#x27;t buy me anything. I was completely wrong. The price on this is still very affordable but does worlds better than the one I had before. I think the biggest difference is the weight. This is a pretty heavy razor and I personally like it, if you are looking for a light handle this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d promptly.  Good DE Razor for basic shaving.  I certainly recommend it if you&#x27;re just starting out.  Comes with stock blades, but I would definitely upgrade when you run out.</li>
            <li> I simply got tired of getting robbed buying MachIII replacements. Anything is better than paying that much.. I LOVE shaving now. Of course the savings is huge, but I never expected such a great shave from such a simple blade. Now to the razor itself. Quality, and worth spending a few extra up front on the German Merkur. That wraps it up. The short handle threw me off at first since I have big hands, but now I understand that following the contour of your face dictates the smaller handle. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the long handle version. I bought my 21 yr old son his own and were good to go.</li>
            <li> I started with the 3pc Shaveology razor (gift from my Father in Law), and while it worked, I wanted something with more &amp;#34;heft&amp;#34;, a shaft with textured grip, and I didn&#x27;t like that the comb was entirely separate from the base.  This razor fixed what I found lacking and didn&#x27;t cost an obscene amount.  Shaves very similarly, and I LOVE that the top piece screws in via the knob on the bottom to make this a 2pc razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The textured handle means I have full control, even with slightly slippery hands (common due to water and dripping shaving cream after a pass, etc), and the weight helps me minimize the pressure I&#x27;m tempted to apply (you should apply as little pressure as possible, idealy NONE) and thus get a less irritated face. The razor itself holds the blade such that it&#x27;s not very aggressive, so that allows you to use sharper blades without getting all sliced up by them (I&#x27;m experimenting with feathers, wilkinsons, and personas right now, after having used astras for a few months and finding them not as aggressively sharp as I&#x27;d like).</li>
            <li> This is just a fantastic product. Great weight and a smooth shave. I&#x27;ve probably used it 5 times since I got it last week and not so much of a hint of a nick or cut. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Outstanding quality for price. My husband loves it!!!&lt;br /&gt;He states It fits comfortably in the hand, good weight distribution, and easy to clean, exceeds expectations!!</li>
            <li> This was not a good razor.  Compared to my other two razors this did not give a close shave.  Even after three passes. It just tore up my face and I don&#x27;t mean that in the sense of a aggressive razor. You have to push harder to get a close shave. I&#x27;m not sure if I have a knock off because I do own a Merkur 38C safety razor and that shaves wonderfully. I get a very close shave usually with one or two passes only. I thought I would try a Merkur with a shorter handle to see if I could get better control and balance. I was wrong.  I also own the Muhle  R89 and that gives and very nice shave as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sick and tired of spending so much on shick and oyjer name brand razors , When I was 16 my dad bought me a safty razor so I would stop using his  in the mid 1990&#x27;s I broke , and couldn&#x27;t find a replacement so I got sucked in to the disposeable razors. and now a four pack good blades can cost you anywhere 15 to 20 dollars. I found this here on amazon and I&#x27;m so happy not only are they cheeper but if you go and buy the cgeapest bladrs you can find youll get a better shave then the big name brands can give you with there 5 blade crap.</li>
            <li> Love this razor. It does everything that my former Gillette multi-edge razor did and more. I am able to shave very close to the nasal area; something my cumbersome multi-edge couldn&#x27;t do. Excellent, close shave with a single blade. And that single blade lasted a LONG time. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this razor. Have recommended it to several relatives and friends.</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a month or two now and I&#x27;m still on the first blade!</li>
            <li> The handle is way too short.  I find myself struggling to maneuver the razor across my face.  For some odd reason my hand cramps terribly.  The quality is good, or superior but go for the longer handle.</li>
            <li> When looking to buy a double edge razor most reviewers recommended Merkur. After some research I couldn&#x27;t decide whether I wanted to heavy duty (fat) handle or the long model for better control and grip. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try the long handle, but after using other narrow handle razors I would strongly recommend a model with a wide handle. It makes maneuvering the blade along the curves and contours of your neck and face much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the razor functioning itself, this is my first foray into double edged razors. I first got onto the single blade safety razor from an old cheap hand me down my grandfather still had. Although the old GEM model was a good introduction, the quality of the Merkur was is of a solid quality that marks my commitment to every purchasing over priced multiblade refills and polluting the planet more than needed.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed.  I thought I would never be able to shave with a razor,but this type of razor is perfect for African-Americam beards.  I am razor bump free.</li>
            <li> great job. no more 5 razor nonsense for me ever again.</li>
            <li> Great razor.  Easy to load/unload and clean.  Comes apart in two pieces.  Solid feel and weight in my hand.  There is a longer handle model.  I prefer the shorter handle since I use my fingertips to hold the razor.&lt;br /&gt;No nicks or cuts after finding the right blade for my beard.  Buy a sample pack and try them out.&lt;br /&gt;Good chrome finish and simple design should last decades.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is the most cost effective razor I have ever used. It handles wonderfully. I wished I had bought it years ago.</li>
            <li> I did my first wet shave today and I&#x27;m kicking myself for not doing this sooner. I&#x27;ll keep it short and sweet. Great razor, easy to use, shaves like a champ. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this a my first DE razor and could not be happier. It is not to agressive but gets a good clean shave. Much better than the electric i switched from. I would recommend to anyone who whats a quality razor to start out a new shaving addiction. Great, Well Made Product!</li>
            <li> Tired of the monopoly of the current razor industry so decided to go back in history.  This razor feels awesome and performs very well.  Great value</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor after using cartridges for a long time. The shorter handle is supposed to be more forgiving and I have yet to cut myself after using it for a week or two so that&#x27;s pretty good. It&#x27;s heavy and feels substantial in your hand which is also a plus. Easy to clean and change blades. Overall I&#x27;m really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Very sturdy and heavy:) Saving over $200 a year now!!</li>
            <li> I love this razor. Perfectly weighted and balanced to give the best shave. Excellent safety razor for the novice or experienced user. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a double edge razor and I liked it. I know I will save money on buying razor&#x27;s.  The best part is using a Edwin brush and barbershop soap on your face.&lt;br /&gt;it makes you feel you had a barbershop shave.</li>
            <li> This is one product that lives up to the sales hype. It&#x27;s been decades since I used a DE Safety razor and the Merkur brought me back to basic shaving with no (cut) anxiety. Initially I was interested because of the rising cost of easier shaves. I&#x27;ve been getting the new model of Norelco (fantastic electric razor)  each year for hundreds of dollars. This Merkur seems kind of pricey but it will last forever and the cost of blades is negligible. Just don&#x27;t go crazy on expensive shaving creams or soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m subject to severe ingrown hairs due to my wire-like curly beard. In the past I attributed it to the razor but it was my shaving method. Over the years I &amp;#34;discovered&amp;#34; the way to shave as to minimize ingrown hairs and razor burns. It applies to both bladed and electric razors. Allow me to pass the word:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) DO NOT shave against the direction your beard grows. Notice the neck hairs grow side to side.&lt;br /&gt;2) DO NOT stretch the skin. The hairs will bend back into place beneath the surface of the face and start growing inwards.&lt;br /&gt;3) DO NOT press the razor into your face. Just let the weight of the razor do the work or barely touch your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important part is #3. There will ALWAY be times when you need to shave against the direction of the beard or when you have to stretch the skin, but you should NEVER press too hard. That cuts hair below the skin line.</li>
            <li> The Merkur Heavy Duty is a high precision beauty of classic technology.  Feels like it will last forever, just the opposite of most things in our disposable society.  I have small hands, and the standard handle length on this razor surprised me with how short it is.  I don&#x27;t really have a problem shaving with it, but it actually looks funny its so short.  Men with larger hands will definitely want one of the long handled models, and all sizes may want to consider the long handle.  One factor that should benefit longevity is that this razor is solid stainless steel (from Solingen, Germany no less!), so it should resist nicks, dents, and mechanical wear better than the more common brass razors with chrome plate.  I am very pleased with this razor and would recommend it to anyone who does not need a long handle.</li>
            <li> I have DE razors that cost $175 - $200 and they don&#x27;t even come close to how well this razor shaves. I use Personna &amp;#34;lab blue&amp;#34; blades and get at least four great three pass shaves per blade (WTG, XTG, ATG).  *** Public service announcement: Your preshave preparation is very important to a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> This was my first razor since stepping off the Gilette/Schick merry go round, and it was a great first choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a learning curve of about a week, I only nicked myself once.  After that, my shave time cut in half, and I now get a smooth shave with no cuts and minimal fuss.  I recently upgraded to the Merkur Futur, but there was nothing \\&quot;wrong\\&quot; with this razor in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every article on wetshaving recommends this as a first razor, and I agree entirely.  If you&#x27;re looking to make the switch to single blades, this razor will go easy on you while delivering a world-class shave.</li>
            <li> As many have already stated, this is a great everyday, easy&lt;br /&gt;to use, DE safety razor. Nice feel. It took me a little time to&lt;br /&gt;get used to the shorty handle after using long handled Mach and Fusions&lt;br /&gt;for years, but not a huge adustment. Good weight, very little pull , let&lt;br /&gt;the blade do the work.</li>
            <li> Very Sharp when used with FEATHER brand blades in my opinion. If you let it stay in warm to hot water it retains that temperature on the blade so you get a warm smooth shave. It looks VERY CLEAN as WELL. Very simple to use and clean I like it even though I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li> Great quality and serves its purpose. Very good price. It is a bit odd due to handle length but over time I am getting use to it. That&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I own 16  saftey razors, 6 being merkurs. This was my first,  and it&#x27;s still the best shave I know of!</li>
            <li> Smoothest shave I have yet had. Feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> This razor is top quality. Heavy and well built. Nice chrome finish. I was using the Gillette fusion pro glide, I was paying about $50 for 14 blades at Costco. Now I pay $15 for 100 blades. And I get a closer shave. Why we all stopped using these safety razors and went to disposables is beyond me. I can use a new blade every time I shave and still save a ton of money and get a better shave. The only down side is that it takes me a a few minutes long to shave but its a closer shave and worth the extra few minutes. You can buy a cheaper safety razor if you just want to try it out, I think they all pretty much come with a few blades. It&#x27;s worth your money and your face to try these out.</li>
            <li> Very solid heavy design. Haven&#x27;t dropped it yet, but I would imagine that it can take a beating.</li>
            <li> Great site. Razor was in great shape and with a good blade cuts throug</li>
            <li> I grew up using an electric razor and one day I decided I finally had enough of it. Too many ingrown hairs, razor burn, time spent running the razor over the same spot on my face without it cutting. I&#x27;m very glad I decided to make the switch. A wet shave is definitely the best shave you can get. I&#x27;ve had this for about a year now. It&#x27;s very easy to put a new blade in, and to clean after shaving. Having never had a wet shave before, I youtubed a couple of helpful videos, and after a rough shave or two, I quickly learned how to work the razor. I still get an ingrown hair now and then, but not nearly as many as I did beforehand. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my acne has cleared up around my beard line (although I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m 100% sure it&#x27;s because of my new shaving method).</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get out of paying Gillette a king&#x27;s ransom for replacement razors, but hadn&#x27;t found a solution. I tried Dollar Shave Club, Henry&#x27;s, a straight razor (for the high maintenance shaver), and then on a whim decided to try a safety razor. This Merkur razor is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with this took some getting used to (customers who bought this item also bought a styptic pencil), but it has been great. I shave with the grain first pass, against the grain second pass and I get a super clean shave. And &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; replacement blades for the Merkur run about .50 per blade. My problem area is under the nose, and although the Merkur doesn&#x27;t shave that spot as economically as the Fusion precision blade, it works far better than any other solution I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have bought this razor sooner. I love it for its utility, for the replacement blade cost, and its durability. I would buy this again.... if it weren&#x27;t such a tank of a razor. I can&#x27;t imagine ever needing to buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is based on my very first shave with a safety razor. Had been a Mach III/Fusion guy till now, but I found I was going through the cartridges rather quickly (around 2 months, on average). So I did some online research and found many people recommending safety razors, if for nothing than for their affordability. I went for the Merkur 34C after reading about the strong grip it offers because of its weight (it does) and, well, because its Merkur. The razor came with a Merkur blade.&lt;br /&gt;A common observation shared by newbie safety razor users is that getting nicks is unavoidable, specially during the first few shaves. Imagine my delight when I didn&#x27;t get a single nick during my first shave! Plus, I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but my face feels a lot naturally lighter after the shave, when compared how it would after a shave with a Fusion. The irritation is also virtually non-existent, again not something that cartridge razors could do. However, I was initially afraid about going against the grain with a safety razor, but realised it was a must if I wanted to get anywhere near a close shave. Going with the grain was basically pointless, which made me wonder if it has to do with the blade (the Merkur blade) than with safety razors in general. But going against the grain did the trick. So, overall, fairly happy with my first shaving experience with safety razors!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning to wet shaving after years with an electric.  Did my homework and felt the Merkur 34C would work well for me.  I was right.  The heft is perfect and the short handle is just right for shaving down across the jaw bone as a longer handle could require me to bend my neck back to less comfortable angles to give clearance.  Like it so much, I ordered the Merkur travel shaver for when I&#x27;m on the road.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a butterfly hinged style, but rather a screw plate which makes it tricky to load. But the plate flexes the blade to just the right angle for a really close shave. First time I used it, I applied too much pressure (what I normally use with my multi-blade) and nicked myself a a lot. After, the second shave, I got the feel of it and am now getting the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from any razor. I get generic blades from a local pharmacy for now, and still get a great shave. Blades last about 5 to 6 shaves and I have a coarse beard. At 24 cents a blade, that translates to huge long term savings. Plus it&#x27;s environmentally a good it. Far less waste. Looking forward to buying bulk premium blades online and saving even more. This razor is built simply and will last forever.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic razor. I&#x27;ve turned 4 people onto this razor, and I use it myself. I love it.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a good shave and is made with true craftsmanship. You can never go wrong with a Merkur razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday present for my SO.  He had been using various disposables or other razor/blade combos for years....it was a very expensive habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a bit of an initial investment but then the blades are just pennies to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is short (at his request) and very maneuverable.  It has good sturdy weight to it and therefore has a very solid feel in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very nice razor and we are very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Good weight and size. Very easy to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this razor for about six months now. Rinsing it off after every use has kept it looking new.</li>
            <li> I own 8 safety razors.  This was the first I bought new and it&#x27;s the only one I use on a regular basis anymore.  It is wonderful with the right blade and it&#x27;s made to last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I learned how to shave with one of these 25 years ago (I \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot; one from my grandfather). Then I used the disposables for all these years and then decided to give it a try again. I have to say I am a bit disapointed. The product is \\&quot;cool\\&quot;, it is better on the budget and the environment over a long run, but the shaving experience is not as good as with a new 3-blade Gillette. Not as close, and not burn-free.</li>
            <li> Love this razor! Very sturdy, good weight, good grip. Overall very well constructed, and gives a nice close shave!</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor.  Easy to use; comfortable in the hand; easy to work around sideburns and neck.  Took about a week to get a hang of this type of razor and learn good technique.  Feels like I am working with a tool, whereas the cartridge razors feel like a kids toy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor. I already have a Merkur 23c 180 long handle but didn&#x27;t like the weight of it. Too light. I also thought that I &amp;#34;needed&amp;#34; a longer handle because that&#x27;s what I was used too in cartridge land. I found out that the shorter handles make it easier to maneuver. I then bought an Edwin Jagger DE89L based on reviews. Yes the razor is beautiful, chrome, etc... I used it for about 5 months everyday, head and face, to get used to it. Tried all kinds of blades and angles... My razor is either defective or it&#x27;s just not good for me. The blades never felt smooth over my face and left me raw no matter what angle or how lightly it touched my face (never hade problems with it on my head though). I could live with it but decided to try another Merkur as the 34c was it&#x27;s main competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People on forums said the 34c is more aggressive than the DE89... I just don&#x27;t see how. I shaved my head and face today with it... no nicks, no cuts, no irritation. The alum bar didn&#x27;t sting at all which was a (somewhat missed) change. My aftershave didn&#x27;t burn, my neck wasn&#x27;t red. So... either my DE89 sucks and EJ should send me a new one or people haven&#x27;t actually used a 34c. Currently I am using Astra SP blades. I have 50 Feathers on the way...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence, this is a great option.</li>
            <li> Works great. Don&#x27;t be scared, you won&#x27;t cut yourself. Absolutely worth twice the price! Fine tool indeed!</li>
            <li> Just got it today and used it right away, Great shave, first time away from the multi blade type razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhay disappointed with this razor. It gives a great shave but I&#x27;ve had it  for about 4 months and the chrome plating is already staring to chip! I Was under the impression that it would hold up better than that. I plan on contacting the manufacturer to see if the some kind of warranty.</li>
            <li> I got the longer version of this and returned it. Much easier to replace razors on this one. The bottom part spins to release the safety guide, as opposed to having to spin the entire top off.</li>
            <li> Excellent Shaver and would buy another one if this one fails for whatever reason.  I would imagine this will last a long time as long as I keep up with the cleaning process.</li>
            <li> After having done some considerable research, I asked for and received this razor for my birthday. I&#x27;m not going to get into the cost savings of using a double edge versus conventional disposable razors, as others have already done that and your common sense should tell you that as well. I&#x27;m also a head shaver, so this razor gets the work in. This Merkur is nicely weighted, reminding you to simply glide the razor along your skin. Access for blade installation and removal is achieved by unscrewing from the handle&#x27;s bottom. The design of the head doesn&#x27;t really allow for hair to get stuck inside the razor, but can be easily cleaned once taken apart. Hope you found this review helpful.

            <li> This is a great razor. I am really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Been using a butterfly gellette that was handed down. Decided I wanted a new one so I looked and watched reviews about several DE razors. Ordered this one. The shipping time was awful, shouldn&#x27;t say you are gonna recieve it between dates and then not make it happen. Came in envelope the box was crushed and the razor was loose in the envelope.&lt;br /&gt;  After observing the razor I found 1 rough spot on the underside of the bar. The corners are sharp and pointed. Overall the razor is nice and seems of good quality. First shave was nice. The short handle was weird but seems to work well around the neck area. It came with 1 merkur blade that was not impressive.&lt;br /&gt;  I look foward to seeing how it holds up. Considering my Gellette was a 4th quarter 1955 model that still works great.</li>
            <li> It cuts hairs off my face! Feels nice in my hand. Shiny. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Awesome razor for the price!</li>
            <li> Excellent razor! Product delivered just as promised. I have extremely sensitive skin and this is the best way to go! I will never go back. As far as money goes, I bought 1 10 pack of razors for 7.99, I shave every day, and I still have 1 razor left after 7 months!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I converted to using a safety razor and I will Never go back to expensive double, triple, quad or whatever again!! Smooth shave. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is a great starter razor.  I&#x27;ve used this razor with various brands of blades the shave is not as aggressive as other models available making it perfect for someone starting out.  Build quality is terrific and the balance will leave you with a great shave provided you&#x27;ve done your part.  I recommend this to anyone that is looking to get into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I like things to be made well and simple. That is what you get when you buy this type of razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a better alternative to shaving due to razor burn I was getting on my neck as well as a way to stop spending $$ on cartridge shavers. I also have an electric razor that I would use in a pinch, but also received a fair helping of razor burn from that too. Once I switched to shaving with a double edge razor, my skin was clearer after first use. I enjoy shaving every morning now and receive a close, quality shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take your time with learning this classic way of shaving and do a your research if you are new at it. I bought a beaver brush, proraso shave soap, alum block, promos aftershave balm, and variety of blades to get the ball rolling. Still testing the blades out to find my favorite. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this new transition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to shave like your grandpa did and get a good clean quality shave...make the transition now!</li>
            <li> Just got into DE shaving after 25 years of waiting. Product is as advertised and works really well with Personna Red and Gillette Razor blades (at least for me). I give it 4 stars because I like it but dont love it yet. Seeing as it is the first DE razor I have used, have two more on order, once give those a try can give a better assessment of how it stacks up. But honestly, for the money and for ease was great and would definitely recommend. As many others say, try a few different blades in it...bought a sample pack and glad I did because did not dig the Feathers, they irritate my skin...they may be good for you so dont take my word for it. Coming to that part will say am disappointed with seller (DE razor)...they only sent me 3 of the 5 free Razor blades...so the sale was not as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor everyday for several months and couldn&#x27;t be happier! If you want to switch to a safety razor you should do your research before you buy anything. After watching several how to videos on YouTube and reading many reviews on Amazon I decided on and highly recommend this razor, feather blades, Escali badger brush, and Proraso shaving soap. A video I found very helpful on how to use a safety razor was http://youtu.be/2IuA8HGacJw the 34C is even used to make the video. There are no cons of this razor!</li>
            <li> Great for first time users.  Simple to use and easy to maintain.  Doesn&#x27;t get slippery in your hand.  A tad bit too short for my taste, the long handle was out-of-stock when I purchased this one.  All-in-all, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Was a Mach 3 razor guy, but they price of their razor blades became too much for me. I&#x27;ve shaved daily with this razor for almost 2 years and get the same closeness of a shave as the Mach 3, at a fraction of the price! Love it and will never go back!</li>
            <li> I started my safety razor shaving with this razor and it was very easy to use.  The blade cover is shaped like a regular razor so the shave isn&#x27;t as aggressive, easy to use, and hard to get cut (unless you are not cleaning it).  I would highly recommend this for beginners.</li>
            <li> Great razor for first time wet shavers.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to go back to old school shaving. Did much research and settled on this razor. A little shorter than I would have preferred but feels well balanced. Tried the included Merkur blade and did horrible the first time. The razor won. The second time, it was a draw and the third time I won. Maybe one or two small nicks. Popped in the \\&quot;free\\&quot; treet blades with the same technique. It took FOUR DAYS for my face to heal. Today I used the feather blades and except for one or two nicks, my face was smooth and good to go.  Overall, double edge shaving takes a little more time than cartridges but it&#x27;s cheaper and better for the environment. All those plastic cartridges will sit in a landfill for generations to come.</li>
            <li> This razor is a bit on the heavy side but works like a dream.  My husband refuses to use another razor.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor, so take my review with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;It works nice mechanically. I have been learning how to use this without cutting myself, and I&#x27;ve really gotten it down within a handful of tries.&lt;br /&gt;The parts are all solid and it works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe might be the handle size... I am a tall male (6&#x27;2&amp;#34;) with decent sized hands. I have seen other DEs with longer handles online, and while I have never held a DE with a longer handle, I feel like I would benefit from one.&lt;br /&gt;But i certainly can navigate this bad boy with the handle given. So it is no deal-breaker. And I read about this criticism before purchasing, so it isn&#x27;t a big surprise on my end. I still give it 4/5 because I don&#x27;t really understand why this DE has a short handle compared to most others.</li>
            <li> Item came really quick and I am very pleased with it. I am a beginner and I had no trouble learning with this razor.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this razor.  It is just as advertised, a well made, quality product.  It has just the right amount of weight for a great shave and is so easy to clean.  Now I look forward to shaving!</li>
            <li> I am well pleased with the 34C. It is well made. Cleans easy and gives me a wonderful shave every time.</li>
            <li> I originally got the product, and due to a problem with my local delivery agent (it was lost by the USPS, not the sellers, and was damaged) I spoke to the sellers, and they issued me a replacement blade for the one that had been bent, at no charge and first class priority. Had it the next day for my first shave. Fantastic service. The blade is amazing. As someone who has only shaved twice since I received this, classic store bought razors (Schick, Mach 3, etc) have NOTHING on the feel of a wet shave. Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor, and so far I absolutely love it!  I find the shorter handle keeps me from applying pressure against my skin as I shave, and helps my maneuver around my goatee.  Would buy again if necessary.</li>
            <li> I needed a new razor that would not irritate my skin...so far so good.  I am really enjoying shaving with this razor, it takes three passes but the shave is close and does not irritate my face.&lt;br /&gt;  The razor is top notch, I was worried about the finish from reading other reviews, but the finish is perfect and looks great everywhere!  If you are thinking of making the environmentally sane choice and moving away from plastic disposables that chop your face to ribbons and fill our land fills, DO IT.  I did and will never go back.  Highly recommended for several reasons.</li>
            <li> I have owned this razor for about 5 months and use it daily.  This razor is a good quality and well built product.  After sampling different blades, I have settled in on Astra Superior Platinum blades as they seem to be the sharpest and longer lasting blades for me.  If you enjoy shaving, this razor is balanced to give a decent close shave without applying much pressure to the razor.  I enjoy the type of shaving again that I once started with.  No more disposables for me.</li>
            <li> Great razor...  I use on my face every day!  Takes me an extra 30 seconds over a disposable safety razor (a hair slower under the nose) but totally worth what I save not having to buy fusion pro glide blades!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for learning how to shave with a DE. I&#x27;ve tried others but always end up back to this one.</li>
            <li> What can I say about this... this mighty staff of Zues haha, but really, it&#x27;s a razor that&#x27;ll make me pitch a sale for it. I use a VDH butterfly open safety razor and got a chance to use this and WOW, the VDH is now part of my travel kit and the Merkur is the stay at home premium. I get an enjoyable shave and it&#x27;s nicely built, lives up to its HEAVY DUTY title nicely, but will more than likely handle this like porcelain just because it is a maintenance tool, and any self respecting man maintains and makes sure their tools are in the best working condition to reduce the chance of failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Precision and durability under $40 RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> Wow, the other reviews weren&#x27;t kidding about this. This DE razor ROCKS. This with feather DE blades equals the best shaves you&#x27;ll ever have. Lather up with a badger brush and some nice cream and shave with this bad boy for 2-3 passes and you&#x27;ll see why people give up their mach 3s or fusions.</li>
            <li> Really like it. A friend told me about Merkur and glad I tried it. Their blades are not super sharp but this was good for me to start on and they still do well. Love the feel of this. Happy.</li>
            <li> I get a great shave from this razor. It is very responsive and easy to control. I very much like that the head is secured by twisting the knob at the base of the handle. This makes it easy to gently snug up the head without having to handle it. As an added bonus, it also allows easily loosening of the head to open it up a bit for rinsing. Very handy, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am knocking off one star because the finish on this razor is the worst I&#x27;ve seen on a razor from a respected manufacturer. A look at the underside of the cap shows the base metal is very rough under the plating. Rough surfaces are harder to keep clean. I think in only a few years the plating will start to peel. The appearance is in stark contrast to similarly priced razors such as the Jagger 89.</li>
            <li> This thing has saved me tons of money on razors. There is a bit of a learning curve with this as with anything but I tend to get bumps or razor burn. You have to take your time while shaving. I also get a lot better shave while in the shower after having washed my face. In short I have not purchased any razor blades outside of the 100 set I bought when I purchased this.  I enjoy walking pas the Mach blades that 15-30 bucks for few blades depending on what style you have. I bought a hundred razors for this for that cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for at least 17 years and tried all types of shaving tools.  Electric, double blade, triple and even four blade razors; and none of those come close to this \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; safety razor.  I have had far less cuts and razor burn when using this razor, and it produces much better results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a few things to keep in mind about this razor; a lot of which has been mentioned in previous reviews, so I won&#x27;t waste your time, but a lot of them are spot on.  Also if you have large hands, you might want to consider a long handle model.  The handle on this model is only about 3\\&quot; from the head of the razor, but it still does exactly what is supposed to.  It just takes some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love coming across products that are built to last; and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this is the last razor I ever buy.  If you enjoy that clean feeling from a good shave, I would strongly recommend that you give this a try.</li>
            <li> Love this razor! I just purchased it with the Merkur Platinum coated stainless blades, used this razor twice and have received the best shave yet. My chaffing and in-grown hairs from shaving with my Gillette Fusion have also started to subside. This Merkur razor is well balanced, fits nicely in your hands and is easy to use for newcomers to shaving with a DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially nervous about getting a DE razor because of the negative reviews where users claimed to have cut themselves badly. Just my two sense, but one must be drunk or highly uncoordinated to cut yourself with one of these. There&#x27;s a reason DE razors are also called &amp;#34;Safety Razors.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this after a hot shower and only apply regular shaving cream by hand. I don&#x27;t have a Badger hair brush or fancy cream and am still getting an amazingly smooth/close shave. I will likely invest in these other shaving tools to get an even better shave down the road, but my point is that you don&#x27;t need all the extras to get an awesome shave with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what did I do with my Gillette you ask?? Gave it to my wife to shave her legs....</li>
            <li> Nice weight and balance.</li>
            <li> Works great with Astra blades</li>
            <li> I thought i purchased the longer handle razor.</li>
            <li> Great razor.  Heavy, so if you like that (I do) it has a great feel.  Easy to change the blades, cleans nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced this is the last razor I&#x27;ll ever buy. Solid as a rock and rust free! I submerge the razor in hot water pre-shave and it works great coupled with Feather DE Blades!</li>
            <li> This razor is ranked one of the best and now I know why it is built well and sturdy with perfect weight if you like a long handle you should probably get the long handle version.  I have nothing bad to say about this razor and it looks beautiful</li>
            <li> There are more expensive razors out there, but this one is awesome. I was using an old vintage Gillette razor that was 80 years old, and when I changed to this, I noticed a huge difference in the quality of the shave. If you want a razor that gets the job done for the right price, buy this razor.</li>
            <li> I decided to go back to the old double edge razor and help reduce the outrageous prices being charger for the multiple blade injector blades. It had been years since I had used a double blade and it found it a little awkward using the shorter handle again. I am adjusting, but I might recommend buying the long handle model if you have not used one before or it has been years.</li>
            <li> Great Razor perfect weight</li>
            <li> one of the best razor in my line up,  I find you need to spend a little more time but well worth the work.</li>
            <li> This razor is awesome. I&#x27;ve always used a Gillette Mach 3 and the Meekur gives a 10x closer shave. You have to use a little more technique with any DE razor but if you can devote a few extra minutes to your morning shave you won&#x27;t be sorry.  After the initial cost of the razor and supplies you will save a ton of money on blades. You can pick up 100 packs of blades for around $10. The quality of this razor is outstanding, has a nice sturdy construction.</li>
            <li> Well built, easy to use, and just what I was looking for. I opted for this model as opposed to the long handle model. Reason: I read somewhere that it&#x27;s easier to perform advanced techniques like buffing and j-hooks with a shorter handle. I&#x27;m still learning with a DE razor so the easier I can make it on myself, the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean the razor with a little antibacterial soap and a cheap toothbrush after every shave (being careful around the blades). Shave soap will leave a residue on the razor and make it appear dull and not shiny without a little cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there are better razors out there that can give you a closer shave on your final BBS pass. But for the price point, and considering that I&#x27;m a beginner, this razor was perfect for me.</li>
            <li> One of the best razors I own.</li>
            <li> My first safety razor was the Edwin Jagger chrome plated razor.  It worked great for about a year.  Though there was a short adjustment period where I had nicks and cuts, I appreciated the greater control (and the cost savings) compared to cartridge razors.  After a year of shaving with the Jagger, however, screw which seated into the stem became corroded and did was difficult to thread and screw on- in my effort to get it screwed on I stripped the threads.  I liked the Jagger, but thought I would try a different model and selected this one (Merkur) based largely on the positive ratings, and have been pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about it: First and foremost- this is definitely a safety razor.  I can&#x27;t explain why- don&#x27;t understand it myself- but this razor is decidedly safer (harder to cut yourself with) than the Jagger.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for a few months, and don&#x27;t think it is any less close of a shave.  In order to get the desired level of closeness I shave twice with these razors- and am very pleased with how close a shave doing so achieves.  Having the screw at the bottom makes changing blades easier and faster than the top screw of the Jagger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like: I wish it had a bit more heft.  This &#x27;heavy duty&#x27; was supposed to be pretty heavy, and though it is substantial I believe it is lighter than the Jagger (which was longer).  Probably a very individual preference- but I&#x27;d like it to be heavier.  I&#x27;m not sure it would make it more stable, but the lighter weight is noted and not preferred.  This is largely me being very critical- but knowing there is one with a longer handle- I&#x27;d probably go with it in hopes of getting a greater heft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m satisfied, pleased with it, and glad that I got it.  It&#x27;s a good razor.  If you&#x27;re looking to get a safety razor, I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I got tired of spending $20.00 for 4 razor blades. So I bought this highly crafted razor like my Father used. I am 61 now and the first time that I used it I was amazed, it was the best shave I ever had. I highly recommend this razor, it is high quality!!!</li>
            <li> Better than the long handle for my face. Also it loads easier, as it unscrews from the handle, not the blade.</li>
            <li> I should have switched to a DE razor long ago. I could only shave comfortably with a cartridge razor about once a week. With this razor I can shave every other day. The razor itself is heavy and very well constructed. I like the feather blades best, and I use Cremo shave cream.</li>
            <li> If you have large hands purchase the 38C, this felt like it was baby sized when I picked it up.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a first time user, it takes a while trying to find the right angle that&#x27;s going to give you the perfect shave. It&#x27;s extremely close. I work in law enforcement so having to shave everyday was becoming super painful until I started using this. Go to The Art of Shaving to check it out in person before you buy it. They have a lot of options.</li>
            <li> This razor is heralded as a classic for a reason. Weight, build quality, design, ease of use, and cleanup are absolutely perfect. You can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> A great razor featuring a very nice and unique design.  The supplied blade is not the best tho.  I find Feather blades to work the best. A much more enjoyable shaving experience than using disposable multi-blades razors.</li>
            <li> This razor is my first attempt/return to wet shaving.  My father always used shaving soap and a brush when I was growing up but I never really used it full time.  I started with an electric razor almost twenty years ago and used a cartridge razor when I wanted a closer shave.  I finally got fed up with the poor shave that I received from the electric razor (despite the high price tag) and the discomfort of the cartridge.  I wanted to return to a wet shave.  After nearly a month of it I cannot believe I waited this long to return to the traditional shaving practice.  It takes only a little more time than I used to spend gnawing at my face with my electric razor and is much more enjoyable.  I use shaving soap and was very pleasantly surprised about how easy the transition was.  The quality of this razor really assists in the transition.  Its weight and size encourages you to be gentle with the blade and produces a very close shave at the same time.  I have had very few cuts or nicks at all (I was expecting a lot).  A lot of people/reviews say this is the double edge razor that all others are measured by, I can see why.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m 61 and just started shaving with a DE razor about three weeks ago and I wish I had started 30 years ago.  My curousity was triggered by the commercial Rick Harrison does on TV for DE razors.  I started to do a little research online and to my amazement discovered DE shaving is making a big come back.  Disposable razors came out just about the time I started shaving so I didn&#x27;t use a DE when I was younger but I remember there always being a bunch of butterfly type DE razors laying around in the bathroom that my mom and dad used.  Wish I had them now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used disposables all my life and started using a Braun electric a few years ago.  My beard is about medium-heavy I would guess and to be honest I can get a pretty good shave with disposables.  The only good thing about the electric is it is so fast and easy, but it comes nowhere close to even a disposable blade shave and within a few hours I have a pretty serious stubble going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try DE shaving and I am so glad I did!  I bought 3 razors, the Murkur 34C HD, the Murkur Futur and the Edwin Jagger DE89L because they are so highly rated for beginners and the least aggressive.  Also bought a blade sampler pack, various other small packs of blades, a brush, soap, alum bar, razor/brush stand, brush bowl and countless other accessories, etc.  I have not cut or nicked myself one time :).  There is a learning curve, but I did my research and watched some youtube videos so I avoided the mistakes that a newby could make that would cause them to possibly give up on DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started off with the Murkur 34C HD with a Murkur blade in it.  The first week, I had a slight amount of irritation during the day but I was not using any aftershave or skin conditioner.  I bought several different kinds of aftershave, including an aftershave sampler from MR. Fine online and some skin conditioners. I have been having fun using a different aftershave everyday and I really enjoy the little whiffs of scent throughout the day.  Some of the old timers like Old Spice, Aqua Velva blue ice and Clubman are still great aftershaves and I love them.  The aftershave was the icing on the cake and my face now feels great all day and I am still amazed at how smooth my face is and for how long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although there was a little trial and error in the beginning, my routine is now pretty quick and simple.  I shave before I shower and although I use hot water to warm up my brush, I now use cold water to shave because I felt hot water was opening my pores too much which increased irritation.  I warm my badger bristle brush while brushing my teeth, then wet my face with cold water, whip up a nice thick, wet lather and cover my beard.  I make a pass with the grain, re-lather and make a pass across the grain, re-lather, and the third pass is against the grain.  Learning the correct amount of pressure (almost none) is key, DE blades are so sharp minimal pressure is needed.  I rinse my face, run the alum block over the shaved area (there is a little stinging) and jump in the shower.  After drying off, I splash on some aftershave (little more stinging) and by the time the aftershave dries, all irritation is gone, I smell great, my face is incredibly smooth and I am good until the following morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the initial investment, DE shaving is quite inexpensive.  I change my blade every monday morning although I think I could run them much longer.  I used the Murkur blade I got with the razor for 10 days and I was just starting to notice a little dullness.  I am now using an Astra blade and it is giving me an excellent shave.  My plan is to use each razor for one month to get a feel for how each one shaves.  It is important for someone just starting to do some serious research on the various razors that are available because they have different levels of aggressiveness.  If someone just starting out bought a razor that was too aggressive they might hack their face up and throw it in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, thats my story an I&#x27;m sticking with it :)  I HIGHLY recommend anyone thinking about doing this to spend some serious time on some of the larger DE shaving forums because there is really a lot to learn about all of the various razors, blades, soaps, brushes, techniques, accessories, etc.  I&#x27;m really glad I did, and now shaving has become almost a hobby and something I look forward to doing instead of it being a morning drudgery.  I also think it is ironic that Gillette which invented the DE razor and sold tens of millions of them does not make one now, at least as far as I can determine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So check it out and enjoy your morning BBS (Baby Butt Smooth) shave!</li>
            <li> I have had this razor one month - since mid-July 2015.  I bought it to replace a Parker 92R which I used for 4 months.  Problem with the Parker is that the knob used to open the butterfly kept getting loose while shaving which occasionally led to nicks or cuts.  The Merkue #34C is far superior.  Although it&#x27;s a 2 piece the shaves are much better.  No nicks yet.  The safety bar is perfectly positioned.  The handle is shorter than the Parker but very easy to control.  The grip is superior even with some lather on it.  I shave every day and there is hardly any irritation whether I use Cremo Cream or Taylor of Old Bond Street.  I plan to switch to Feather bladed based on the reviews after I finish using the Personnas I received with the Parker.  The Personnas are fine but the Feathers might be even better.  That switch won&#x27;t happen until sometime in 2016 as I get 5 shaves from each Personna.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving so I don&#x27;t have any other razors to compare it to.  I can tell you this razor is a quality piece.  I found no blemishes in the finish and it seems like it&#x27;s built to far outlive it&#x27;s owner.  Much research led me to this as my first DE razor and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> not a better shaver on the market - perfectly weighted, for great control and balance. Partnered with Feather blades and its a perfect match.</li>
            <li> Great DE razor to introduce oneself to wet shaving.  Well constructed and feels solid.  Would anticipate this can last for decades!</li>
            <li> Really good razor! I guess this is the razor I would recommend to a friend who was interested in taking up wet shaving. It is not my favorite but it is about half as expensive as my Weber. The results are pretty close to it though! It is probably about a medium aggressiveness, and so it gives a smooth shave with little to no discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade included in the pack however is another story! I have never liked Merkur blades they just don&#x27;t do a good job for me, and they don&#x27;t seem to have improved since last time I tried them YMMV. Try other blades if you order this razor and take the time to learn the techniques required to use this tool properly and you will be rewarded with a better shave than with one of those multi-bladed jobs. Though I admit it is a little more work and I do have to pay attention which I never did when I shaved with a new Gillette, but i get fewer ingrown hairs, and almost never get any razor burn like I did with that thing either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to address the plating issues that some have had but as I shave with distiller water and wipe my razor after every shave I doubt I will have any.</li>
            <li> Works very well (Although I would have prefered one a bit longer).&lt;br /&gt;Very well made, should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I have both this Merkur Heavy Duty #34 and the Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl.  They are both great safety razors.  The Merkur is a two piece design.  The Jagger is a three piece design.  I personally prefer the German two piece design over the English three piece design.  I think the Jagger manufacturing quality is slightly better than the Merkur.</li>
            <li> Anyone who uses this razor will probably never go back to conventional razors. This is easy to use and only requires double-edge razors as replacements (which are much much cheaper than conventional 4 or 5 blade replacements). A must for any guy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor after reading multiple reviews that this was a good all-around double-edge razor.  This was my first foray into the use of a double-edge razor and I have found it is not as scary and death defying as I thought it would be.  Using an Astra razor blade (for now) from an Amazon-sold variety pack, I found that the Merkur and the blade itself are surprisingly forgiving.  The blade drops into the Merkur easily and tightens without issue.  The Merkur feels solid and has a good weight.  The razor glides over the face and I have yet to cut myself.  I found that with this razor and blade, I can be a lot less careful than I thought I needed to be, and I have not had to dramatically change my shaving method from when I used a Gillette Fusion.  With, across and against the grain, I have had no problem with cuts.  So far I have not had as close a shave as promised, but it is closer than the Gillette I previously used, and I have to continue to work on my method and I will likely purchase a badger hair brush, good shaving cream and change to a sharper blade from my variety pack (probably Feather) in the near future to assist the process.  For those entering the double-edge razor arena, the Merkur is a solid piece of equipment and is good for a beginning and advanced shaver (according to those who are advanced double-edge shavers on the forums), and not nearly as brutal as I thought.</li>
            <li> The best and most used double edge razor in the market.</li>
            <li> The razor itself looks nice and had a good weight to it. Very comfortable in the hand. HOWEVER...    The head wasn&#x27;t machined perfectly symmetrical. One side of the blade (the included blade) stuck out slightly more than the other, which made that side shave more aggressively than the other side, which shaved too mild to get a good cut.    If it had been too mild or too aggressive on both sides, it would be OK and you could deal with it. But with each side having different shaving characteristics, it was too much to deal with. Especially since this is a \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; safety razor, I have a hard time recommending a product that isnt consistent. A completely new person to double edge shaving might not realize why they keep burning their face some strokes and hardly getting off hair with the next.    As in most cases, you get what you pay for. This is a pretty cheap razor that has a great reputation for the most part. I got one bad one, there are lots of good ones out there. Hopefully someone reads this who is having problems and can check for alignment before their 30 day return period is up!</li>
            <li> This razor is straight old school cool</li>
            <li> where have you been all my life?!?!  my favorite, hands down</li>
            <li> This is actually the second double-edge razor that I have purchased.  My first was a Merkur Futur, which I felt was a little unforgiving and aggressive to my skin.  Based on the Futur, I wasn&#x27;t sure that DE shaving was for me.  The first shave with a 34C, however, proved to me that I made a good move switching to a DE razor.  I&#x27;ve used this razor for about a week now and my skin has never been happier.  I have some pretty sensitive areas on my neck, but using this razor has been a blessing.  I was initially concerned about the length of the handle, but those worries went away quickly.  At this point, my shaves are just about smooth as glass with no nicks or irritation.  Trust me, it will take a while to get the hang of a DE razor.  Don&#x27;t give up, though.  This razor is the best thing that has happened to my shaves ever.  I actually shave every day now (when I used to shave about twice a week) because I like the experience.  I wouldn&#x27;t have thought that buying a razor would be a life-changing event, but I really am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised on how much better this &#x27;old style&#x27; razor performed compared to modern razors in terms of shave comfort and closeness.  For a number of years I have increasingly been unhappy with the multi-blade shaving razors by Gillette, Bic, etc.  I was contemplating making the switch out of desperation.  Now that I have been using the Merkur for a little over a week, I wish I pulled the trigger sooner.  It is not a slight improvement but a remarkably improved shaving experience.  It took me no time to learn how to use it.  Whereas today&#x27;s modern disposable razors are nimble like a sports car, this is more like a truck but the comfort and smoothness cannot be beat.  An incredibly close shave.  I can see that if you have larger hands, this razor may seem a bit small, but for my average sized hands it is fine.  It comes with one Merkur blade which was perfectly okay to me and now I am trying the Wilkinson German blades (which I find no difference).</li>
            <li> Husband loves this razor</li>
            <li> This is a nice tool to hold in your hand - nice and heavy, well made, etc.  But I did not find it gave me a close shave like the Fusion.  And it ave me worse razor burn.  But if you like old school razors, this is a good one, which is why I gave it three stars</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be scared of the safety feature. This razor will give you the closest shave you can experience. I wish I would have converted years ago</li>
            <li> The Merkur 34C is a great product. This is my first double edge safety razor, and I doubt I&#x27;ll need to ever buy a second.  This is precision made with a beautiful chrome finish and knurled handle.  Nice weight to it.  I use this with Shark blades from Japan.  I will never go back to modern day multi blade cartridge systems.</li>
            <li> I have 4 Merkur razors counting this one I just purchased and out of all 4 this Merkur  #34 is my favorite and its a great razor well worth the money spent.&lt;br /&gt;I like the way that it is a 2 piece over most others are a 3 piece.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves great and a real nice razor with a great feel and weight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and I&#x27;m so glad I decided to pay extra for this razor. It has a very solid construction and I have no doubt that I&#x27;ll be able to pass this down to my son when he gets old enough. The shave is very nice, I have thick beard hair and this razor cuts through it with no problem. The heft of the razor allows for a nice glide down your face without applying to much force. If you want a solid razor with quality construction at a reasonable price look no further. German engineering at its finest.</li>
            <li> This razor is rated very high and for good reason, it&#x27;s always a risk purchasing something that you have never tried and that&#x27;s why I rely heavily on my fellow reviewers, I was just telling my wife about the difference in this razor and the Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl it&#x27;s almost like you can get a feel for where they were made, the merkur being made in Germany and the Edwin Jagger made in England. The merkur is solid and well made, very hefty and feels like a well built tank in your hand. The Edwin Jagger on the other hand feels elegant and flawless, I know I&#x27;m a bit partial towards the Edwin Jagger but if you try it out you will be as well. Okay moving on, this razor is great you really can&#x27;t go wrong with it, the handle is a bit short for me but I&#x27;m thinking I have to get used to it, I also ordered the long handle as well due to Amazon having the wrong description but heck I kept it,</li>
            <li> Really heavy duty shaving razor. I like it so much I bought a 2nd one as a christmas present for my brother. It comes with a free razor, but throw that away (or recycle it rather) and buy yourself a supply of Feather razors to get a close shave that doesn&#x27;t cut your face.</li>
            <li> Nice, heavy feel razor.  Well made and works like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I gave wet shaving a try after not being able to stomach the disposable cartridge price at Costco.  This razor works perfect for me.  As I had used disposable razors (as opposed to an electric) there was not much adjustment.  I watched a couple of youtube videos that helped with the process.  I started slow with short strokes with the grain and really had no problems.  For a close shave, I will do two passes, the first with the grain and second against.  For a super close shave, I have used a shaving oil first and then applied the shaving cream.  Normal shave really takes no longer than the old disposable, is closer and way cheaper once you have the set-up.  Will never go back to modern technology or advertising.  Looking forward to my order for upgraded blades and soaps.</li>
            <li> My first safety razor. Very well constructed - heavy and balanced well. I bought Astra replacement blades because the Merkur blades that were included weren&#x27;t quite sharp enough for my heavy-ish beard.</li>
            <li> This razor is my new go to razor, great feel and plenty of control with when wet. I have a couple of razors that have thinner smooth handles and they are difficult to control when wet and easily results in nicking my neck. This handle actually is thicker in than any razor I own and has perfect control. Loading the blade is easy and the razor seems to rinse well with very little loading under the blade with heavy creams.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas, and he loves it!  Gives him a super close shave without all irritation. You do have to use a good quality shaving cream - not just one from the drug store.</li>
            <li> Just now started using a DE razor and its awesome. Such a smooth shave when you use a good cream and brush. The weight feels really well in my hand. I have nothing but great things to say about the Merkur 34C. I will say that the Merkur blades are not very good. I used it once and then swapped it for a personna coated blade(American made) very sharp but not like a feather. Great for a coarse beard.</li>
            <li> good weight, works as advertised, recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/12/15:  I think I personally prefer the Butterfly style of blade removal, but no big deal.  Also wanted to add, in an attempt to \\&quot;sling\\&quot; off excess water to enhance drying out the interior of handle, the screw-piston close/open device went flying out, bounced off the wall and hit the floor....so for those of you who want to make sure the inner works of this thing get dried out, it does come apart into 3 (actually 4) parts...the 4th part is a cylinder-ring type device wrapped around the piston, to hold it inside the handle.  Apparently you can dislodge it if so inclined, as I did.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s dry now, by gad....and no broken parts!</li>
            <li> Fits my hand just right. If you don&#x27;t have nimble fingers, than go with this one</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this razor. It works great as expected. I have not used any other DE razor but I have no reason to try any other after using this.</li>
            <li> I had been considering a safety razor for about a year and settled on a Merkur based on favorable reviews online.  I keep a short beard so I primarily use this razor to keep my neck and upper cheeks trim and smooth.  I was concerned about the shorter handle initially (being used to disposable razors), but decided the original design involved a short handle for a reason.  I find that the shorter handle is a nice advantage, providing enough balance and weight while also allowing me to shave around my neck without being cumbersome.  Feels solid in the hand and shaves very well once you develop some technique.  Even as I&#x27;m learning to use it properly, I find that razor burn and ingrown hairs have become less common.</li>
            <li> Great Razor the weight is perfect and the shorter handle makes it easy to control and get a great shave.</li>
            <li> Settled on this safety razor after much searching. I&#x27;ve found you can go as cheap or expensive as you would want to and still be able to find a good quality razor that meets your needs. This one works great for me!</li>
            <li> I moved from multiple blades to double edged to be kinder to my skin and reduce shaving bumps, etc.  So far, the Merkur has proved very easy to get started with and the blades that came with it are excellent and last at least 1 week.  There is generally less irritation, particularly if I start with a pre-shave oil and work the lather with a brush.  Taking your time to get a smooth shave is essential to getting a shave as close as the multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> FINALLY no more money wasted on overpriced disposable cartridges. I wish I would have tried this years ago. I was nervous about using this razor at first, but it&#x27;s very easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Razor 2 years ago ( March 2013 ) along with the Feather blades. It is absolutely better than the cartridge razors. You shave with this razor as if it were sharp...unlike the safety razors that you can just whip across your face. The difference is this will last for 30 years or more. The razor is robust and sturdy, it has a little heft to it ....though I don&#x27;t notice it anymore. I disassemble mine after each use and clean it off to prevent build up. The finish has not dulled at all. It could still pass for brand new. The screw bottom ( which tightens and loosens the blade housing ) secures tightly and firmly. The blades drop onto the pegs with alacrity and when the head is screwed down it lines up precisely and consistently every time. I look forward to continued use.</li>
            <li> Gillette and other foolishness never again. Merkur is the best razor I was shaving with in my entire life. Highly recommended for people with​ sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The Merkur 34C is a great operating razor for a good price.  Most of my life I used Gillette razors, butterfly, adjustable and ball-end.  I still have the ball-end so I compared it with my new Merkur using Derby blades.  I can&#x27;t say exactly why, but the Merkur cuts more smoothly.  The heft difference is noticeable but I think the blade gap must be slightly different as well.  Whatever the reasons, I retired the ball-end razor and now use only the Merkur.  My aged sun-damaged skin is in better shape than it has been in years.</li>
            <li> little small for my hand. But very nice shave, very proffesional looking. Moving to the single edge blade really reduced the amount of ingrown hairs too.</li>
            <li> Well crafted and works nicely.  Probably a good reason for the reputation!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is perfect (at least as good, if not better than, cartridges)&lt;br /&gt;Excellent, sturdy design&lt;br /&gt;Blades are cheap&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is incredibly easy&lt;br /&gt;Razor won&#x27;t clog with hair like cartridges do&lt;br /&gt;Saves the environment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Shave time increased for me but only by a few minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to shave with lotion (e.g. NIVEA) instead of foam..... much better for the skin....</li>
            <li> The 34 C is a standard beginner&#x27;s razor for getting your feet wet in double-edge razor shaving.  It&#x27;s not aggressive and budget friendly.</li>
            <li> I am new to the world of wet shaving, but I am getting the hang of it.  This is a nice quality product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as smooth as the 38C , though the 34C&#x27;s blade gap should be bigger than my earlier 38C&#x27;s. Simply,it doesn&#x27;t have as much blade exposure as the 38C,and this problem had a great negative impact on my shaves with it.</li>
