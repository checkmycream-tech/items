            <li> product has absolutely no smell when real Borage and real organic unrefined extra virgin cold pressed borage oil has a very typical smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This oil is extremely thin and very light--almost watery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not keen in putting unknown stuff on my skin.</li>
            <li> This oil is supposed to look yellowish with little acid smell...</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t bear to watch her porcelain skin turn into a mess!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely not USDA.&lt;br /&gt;The company has a creepy website and they do not say ANYWHERE where is their oil coming from.</li>
            <li> Wasted money unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The origins of this oil are questionable.</li>

            <li> The item was used in a cosmetic formulation and performed exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what to think about this product the oil color I received is completely clear/transparent and it has no smell at all. This oil is supposed to look yellowish with little acid smell... I don&#x27;t know what I received and I&#x27;m worried to used it for its purpose. I won&#x27;t buy it again. Wasted money unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I tried this after a dermetologist on a TV program recommended mixing this oil with Argan oil, to greatly improve/relieve dry skin during winter months. This oil is extremely thin and very light--almost watery. I saw no improvement by adding it to Argan oil (which I have been using).</li>
            <li> very nice product, happy with it</li>
            <li> Love! I cannot believe how good my skin looks!</li>
            <li> EXcellent product from FRANCE...first class and organic...they could not put organic on the bottle since they do not use the USDA label...they use their own.  Amazing what it does for so many things. We got it for daughters skin problems, but it not only fixed them, it took the wrinkles out of my wife&#x27;s face and now I am going to get gel caps and take it internally for my good health benefits...Amazing stuff and first class for sure.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve bought so far really like it</li>
            <li> My skin cleared up very quickly</li>
            <li> A+ product! Makes my skin feel and look great!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know about this product before and i was in real need to help my wrinkling skin. I felt helpless and i tried a lot of things until a good friend of mine told me about this one and i thought i should give it a try and i did and it went very well. It really improved skin condition so fast and so effectively.</li>
            <li> I like this oil and the container is large enough to see results because of use over time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this (along with hemp seed oil and grape seed oil) after spending countless hours reading about the Oil Cleansing Method (OCM) for acne. My daughter is struggling with acne and I couldn&#x27;t bear to watch her porcelain skin turn into a mess! Acne runs in my family and I spent a lot of time searching for natural treatments.  THIS WORKS FOR HER! Borage seed oil reduces inflammation, calms the skin and promotes blood flow. I would definitely recommend this brand and this is a must have for treating acne! She puts this with her oil mixture of (1 part hemp, 2 parts grape seed, and 1 part borage oil) on her face 10 minutes before she gets in the shower. Then she simply lets the steam from the shower open her pores and massages it in with her fingers. She rinses well under the warm water and just before she exits the shower she simply wipes it off with a warm, wet wash cloth (twice). This oil is a MUST have for the oil cleansing method for acne! I am so HAPPY I found this!!</li>
            <li> Will order again. I love how it make my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Many uses. Great quality</li>
            <li> husband bought this for me.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s amazing, smells amazing, feels amazing, and  it was honestly a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of Borage seed but when I saw this product and looked up the active ingredient I was impressed. Apparently Borage seed is much higher in y linolenic acid  higher even then evening primrose oil. This is  worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely helpful for problem skin and wrinkles. Which is why I was interested in the product. If evening primrose oil is good then this is even better</li>
            <li> AVOID ABSOLUTELY!!!!! This is absolutely not USDA.&lt;br /&gt;The company has a creepy website and they do not say ANYWHERE where is their oil coming from. Therefore I guess it comes from China :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has absolutely no smell when real Borage and real organic unrefined extra virgin cold pressed borage oil has a very typical smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not keen in putting unknown stuff on my skin. If you feel the same, RUN AWAY!!!!</li>
            <li> This oil contains synthetic fragrance ingredients. The origins of this oil are questionable. There is no manufacturing company name listed on the label. Do not buy! Someone needs to be accountable for selling this as 100% natural..</li>
            <li> great stuff and great price. loved this.</li>
