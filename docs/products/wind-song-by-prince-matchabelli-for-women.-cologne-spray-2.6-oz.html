            <li>3 stars for large attractive bottle &amp; funny jr.</li>
            <li>some times its great to go back to an \\&quot;oldie\\</li>
            <li>Light feminine scent never goes out of style.  </li>

            <li>Clean and light...</li>
            <li>This is a classic drugstore scent that any perfume collector should own.</li>
            <li>This is not the original perfume.  </li>
            <li>Not the original, not even close.  </li>
            <li>What a shock that its not only still around, but that so many women apparently love it!  </li>
            <li>Such an old but wonderful scent.</li>

            <li>Favorite scent from way back.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>wind song is a casual scent if you want something exotic this is more fresh and light scent floral i would give 4 star&#x27;z</li>

            <li>high one year the boys were each assigned a girl to buy a christmas gift for and vice versa.  </li>
            <li>It is also a mature, moderate, flowery fragrance that works for a variety of evening or special daytime occasions.  </li>

            <li> I saw it when ordering some other perfume and ordered it to give to her as a gift.  </li>

            <li> , She still wears it an it is hard to find</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in my area</li>
            <li> i expected something weird or</li>
            <li> It is one of those subtle fragrances that can be worn both during the day and at night.  </li>
            <li> My Sister in Law and wife and Mother all like the subtle aroma of this perfume.</li>
            <li> I never grow tired of it.</li>
            <li> Recommend this cologne to all women who like the subtle fragrances!</li>
            <li> but it arrived and is broken !</li>
            <li> Disappointment.</li>

            <li> This is not the original perfume.  Forget it!  I would not even have given it a one star if I could.  I am allergic to perfume but have used Windsong all of my life.  Thsi one I was allergic to so I know it was not the roiginal for positive.</li>
            <li> I looked all over for this timeless perfume. I have always loved windsong and it smells just like I remember.</li>
            <li> This brings back lots of fond memories of when I was young. It is exactly as I remember it and am happy with both the product and timeliness of getting my order. Will do business with this company again.</li>

            <li> some times its great to go back to an \\&quot;oldie\\&quot;  this brought back memories of the  childhood.  had to have this again</li>
            <li> What can I say? My mother has used this signature scent my entire life. Hugging her after being apart for 6+ months and inhaling her Windsong fragrance is all the home coming I ever need. Simply perfect.</li>
            <li> I still like Wind Song.</li>
            <li> Disappointed to find that this old American fragrance is now made in China.  Bottle and box look the same as the old USA, but the fragrance does not last longer than five minutes. Do not buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance in the summer and reminds of cool evenings. I am so glad that the classics are still available. I will always buy this  &#x27;rotation&#x27; fragrance...what can I say, I change moods and this suits a lot of the time.</li>
            <li> I never understand how a perfume becomes \\&quot;dated\\&quot;.  If it smells good (like this one does)  WEAR IT!!!  It is one of those subtle fragrances that can be worn both during the day and at night.  It fits any occasion. I never grow tired of it.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and not too sweet or overwhelming.  Light feminine scent never goes out of style.  I like to keep it in my rotation of about three scents and tend to where it more in the summer</li>
            <li> How can we forget the wonderful scent of wind song?  I had bought 3 wind chimes while on vacation in Colorado. for 3 birthday gifts.  They seemed a little dinky when I looked at them later so I ordered 3 wind song colognes to include.  THEY LOVED IT!</li>

            <li> This is a classic drugstore scent that any perfume collector should own. It does definitely smell a bit \\&quot;dated\\&quot; but in a good way. I&#x27;m only 34 &amp; always get compliments when I wear it.</li>

I grew up in the 80s &amp; early 90s, when every boy and girl was soaked in CK One, and in jr. high one year the boys were each assigned a girl to buy a christmas gift for and vice versa.  the boy who got my name was a class clown &amp; kinda picked on me, when I opened his gift of Wind song, at first I was pleasantly surprised!  i expected something weird or a gag gift - Perfume was a nice mature gift- it was a well-known brand with the tv commercial - &#x27;I can&#x27;t seem to forget you!&#x27;  ...And then I smelled it, and became convinced that this boy must&#x27;ve searched for the stinkiest perfume he could find to give me!  The commercial was right - I can&#x27;t forget the musky windex amonia stank of this product.  What a shock that its not only still around, but that so many women apparently love it!  To each their own!  3 stars for large attractive bottle &amp; funny jr. high memories!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, a light fragrance, &amp; arrived quickly, in good condition.</li>
            <li> It would&#x27;ve a 5 but it arrived and is broken !t won&#x27;t spray and just leaks onto my hands. Very disappointed. Won&#x27;t buy thru Amazon for this again!</li>
            <li> Annual stocking stuffer for my wife. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Favorite scent from way back.  Casual, not overpowering, fresh, light scent with floral tones.  Clean and light...great for summer!</li>
            <li> wind song is a casual scent if you want something exotic this is more fresh and light scent floral i would give 4 star&#x27;z</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and with a fresh sent.  Smells great and I will order it again.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Like the fragerance.  Would recommend to my friends.  It is hard to find in my area so just thought would give the internet a try.  Glad I did.</li>
            <li> Have used for many years.  Feel naked without it!!</li>
            <li> Not my favorite but this is a perfume my mother-in-law liked years ago so my husband suggested we purchase this as one of her gifts as a nice memory.  She was thrilled so that is what is important.</li>
            <li> my all-time favorite perfume - truthfully, it stays on your mind!</li>
            <li> Just what I remembered. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Mom loves her perfume!</li>
            <li> I love the woman who wears it.</li>
            <li> This was an old fragrance that I loved and lost track of.  I didn&#x27;t think it was on the market anymore, I was glad to order it and I an\m pleased. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this timeless fragrance, every time I wear it, I get compliments...and people want to know....what are you wearing?  It&#x27;s just a wonderful fragrance....brings me back to a more romantic time in my life.  (I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> Does not smell as good as the ones in retail stores.</li>
            <li> Wind Song is a comforting and classic traditional scent that emanates warmth and beauty.  Wind Song perfume resonates casual sophistication that is ideal for evening wear or anytime you want to leave a good impression. The perfume is a complex balanced construction that brings together florals with fruity, green middle notes that finishes with hints of musk and amber. It is also a mature, moderate, flowery fragrance that works for a variety of evening or special daytime occasions.  Who am I kidding,I love Wind Song anytime.</li>
