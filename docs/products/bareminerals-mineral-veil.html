            <li>Great item</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;m very very happy</li>
            <li>deal, works well and a good value for those like me who do not like to wear make up.</li>
            <li>i prefer the untinted mineral veil more but this is great quality but</li>
            <li>Also, this is a good finishing/touch up powder and will give that needed hint of color just in case your foundation came on too light.</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals is the best ever for me to use.  </li>
            <li>I love the tinted Mineral Veil because I have more of an olive complexion.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I recommend using the foundation to start and mineral veil on top of it.</li>
            <li>I love this make up however I do not like the retail price.  </li>
            <li>Totally love tinted mineral veil.</li>
            <li>But wish it was more &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34; so it could cover existing foundation.</li>
            <li>Samething at a better price and didn&#x27;t have to drive to store and fight the crowds.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but this is better.  </li>
            <li>I am able to use this by itself because of the tint.  </li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, I had so many compliments!</li>
            <li>it is easy to forget that I am wearing it.</li>
            <li>It would be perfect for anyone with a little color in their face</li>
            <li>I have light colored skin and use the Fairly Light BE mineral foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The item was shipped promptly and the price was fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like wearing make-up, but the mineral veil is so light</li>
            <li>Very great for overall coverage--don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li>it was the original.</li>
            <li>I have a great big smile as I use it.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, the shade seemed dark for my skin tone but it blends in perfectly - and without much effort.</li>
            <li>I used the regular mineral veil before and loved it</li>
            <li>This came quickly and was full sized.</li>
            <li>It gives me just the right amount of \\&quot;summer glow\\&quot; and makes my skin look like it has a lot of natural color on its own, which it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It worked fine with my olive skin tone, but if my skin was one tone lighter, it would have been too much.</li>
            <li>It really evens out your skin and makes it look smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>I loved how well it covers my skin and at the same time it&#x27;s not heavy like make-up or pressed powder.</li>
            <li>I use this in place of bare minerals foundation, applying primer first, and the results are a quick makeup routine that makes skin look naturally pretty.</li>
            <li>I love Bare Minerals in general, and this Tinted Mineral Veil powder sealed the deal.</li>
            <li>I used to have a bathroom shelf full of different products I had tried.  </li>
            <li>This was brand new and unopened as pictured.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using bare escentuals for years and really like it.  </li>
            <li>It looks so natural, does not clog pores, and I have had no allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li>, I am in my early 60s</li>
            <li>It is not heavy and does not clog your pores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a good way to help darken your foundation if you bought the wrong shade by mistake.</li>
            <li>I wear tinted mineral veil in the summer when I have a tan or just to make me look a little tan, and I wear the original mineral veil the rest of the year.</li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals is the makeup of my choice as I use very little and it suits me fine</li>
            <li>Been using bare minerals for about 11 years now</li>
            <li>I put it over my Bare Minerals Medium Foundation Powder, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Have used Bare Minerals for yrs.</li>

            <li> but I am pale and if I use it on my face I have to do my whole neck to match.</li>
            <li> But with all of thr Bare Minerals products, you only need to use a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Be careful when you order as their are a few different types of this product.</li>
            <li> not exactly what i wish i had ordered.</li>
            <li> I have terrible make up allergies and have tried many different brands; however, none of them worked.</li>
            <li> That said, I was afraid this tinted mineral veil would be too orange or leave a funny tone on my skin.</li>
            <li> Just be careful if you are very pale because the tint might be too noticeable for you.</li>
            <li> I use it almost every day because I am prone to being oily and this works wonders on shine without being heavy.</li>
            <li> I use the tinted mineral veil year round.  </li>
            <li> No more.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than retail.</li>
            <li> After years of breaking out, swollen eyes, and terrible rashes, I almost gave up on wearing make up.</li>

            <li> I love the tinted Mineral Veil because I have more of an olive complexion.  It gives your face a finished look.  But with all of thr Bare Minerals products, you only need to use a little.</li>
            <li> i prefer the untinted mineral veil more but this is great quality but not exactly what i wish i had ordered.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this product for several years. I love it. I have terrible make up allergies and have tried many different brands; however, none of them worked. After years of breaking out, swollen eyes, and terrible rashes, I almost gave up on wearing make up. Someone suggested that I try this brand; and to my surprise, it worked.It looks so natural, does not clog pores, and I have had no allergic reaction to it. I wear tinted mineral veil in the summer when I have a tan or just to make me look a little tan, and I wear the original mineral veil the rest of the year. I recommend using the foundation to start and mineral veil on top of it. It really evens out your skin and makes it look smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> I have light colored skin and use the Fairly Light BE mineral foundation. That said, I was afraid this tinted mineral veil would be too orange or leave a funny tone on my skin. But it is perfect. It gives me just the right amount of \\&quot;summer glow\\&quot; and makes my skin look like it has a lot of natural color on its own, which it doesn&#x27;t. :) I&#x27;m very very happy I took a chance on this product.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for years. Less expensive than retail. Great item at a great price. Great item</li>
            <li> Been using bare minerals for about 11 years now so I trust the brand. Also, this is a good finishing/touch up powder and will give that needed hint of color just in case your foundation came on too light.</li>
            <li> Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good deal, works well and a good value for those like me who do not like to wear make up.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it was the original. I recieved it and it was tinted. It would be perfect for anyone with a little color in their face but I am pale and if I use it on my face I have to do my whole neck to match. Be careful when you order as their are a few different types of this product.</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals is the makeup of my choice as I use very little and it suits me fine</li>

            <li> I have been using bare escentuals for years and really like it.  I used to have a bathroom shelf full of different products I had tried.  No more.</li>
            <li> Samething at a better price and didn&#x27;t have to drive to store and fight the crowds. I will probably always buy on Amazon for now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time. It &amp;#34;finishes&amp;#34; the face to give an over-all smoothness. When I first started using it, I had so many compliments! Now, I guess, my friends just expect me to look this way.</li>
            <li> I loved how well it covers my skin and at the same time it&#x27;s not heavy like make-up or pressed powder. It won&#x27;t leave your skin oily either. Just be careful if you are very pale because the tint might be too noticeable for you. It worked fine with my olive skin tone, but if my skin was one tone lighter, it would have been too much.</li>
            <li> I like having the tinted mineral veil, it gives me the ability to need only one product when in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals is the best ever for me to use.  I do not use foundation, only powder and blush, I am in my early 60s and this is just enough to look ever so nice.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I love Bare Minerals in general, and this Tinted Mineral Veil powder sealed the deal. I put it over my Bare Minerals Medium Foundation Powder, and it lasts all day. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the only makeup that I use.  I use the tinted mineral veil year round.  It is not heavy and does not clog your pores.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Have used Bare Minerals for yrs. love this product.</li>
