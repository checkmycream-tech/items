            <li>/&gt;TL:DR; GREAT case</li>
            <li>Amazing product!  </li>
            <li>This case is amazing!</li>
            <li>Nice and roomy, good quality!</li>
            <li>For ladies who just want to be able to hold their own makeup in one place at home - this is absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect any train case to fit everything perfectly.</li>
            <li>Sturdy n looks good as well.</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>Seems good quality, but hoping this gap doesn&#x27;t get worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so very pleased I purchased this case.</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Now I have room to buy tons more nail polish!</li>
            <li>I love this makeup case!  </li>
            <li>So much space, well made, beautiful color!</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it were lighter.</li>
            <li>Looks nice.</li>
            <li>Also is nice looking.</li>
            <li>It is nice, I love all the room it has.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>Also comes with a lock and key which was awesome.</li>
            <li>I just received this in the mail today, and I&#x27;m rather pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It stores all of my immediate makeup &amp; more, which means I no longer have to carry around 3+ makeup bags when I travel or move from one bathroom to another in the house.</li>
            <li>Besides, it&#x27;s so much better than digging around in a makeup bag over and over.</li>
            <li>Love this makeup case/organizer.  </li>
            <li>The casing itself was aesthetic and sturdy, and looked sexy (the silver diamond texture).</li>
            <li>While it has a strap, I bought it to keep on my counter (mostly, in addition to travel).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t judge) and was able to get all of my things into this case with room to spare.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still able to fit all of my makeup</li>
            <li>It holds a good amount, and allows for great organizing, and comes with a little cup that brushes can stand in.</li>
            <li>It is easy to find things with all the compartments.</li>
            <li>All my items fit in the case.</li>
            <li>They could totally break and lock you out of your stuff, so if you need a lock, maybe find a way to secure this your own way (your own lock, duct tape, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Holds many many items and keeps things very organized.</li>
            <li>This first one I bought had a cracked handle, but Amazon was quick to refund me and the next one I bought was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, attractive but above all it takes ALL of my cosmetics including taller items such as toner and makeup removers kept  tidily in one place.  </li>
            <li>(10 + years worth).</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I returned it because it was my first ever train case, and at the time I didn&#x27;t realize the true massiveness of my makeup collection.</li>
            <li>Its just right.</li>
            <li>I had to be very precise when organizing my makeup in it because certain things won&#x27;t fit together, but that&#x27;s not really a big deal to me.</li>
            <li>It looks nice while closed, and when you open the top and the trays, it displays everything to you</li>
            <li>Secondly, each lock on the top has a literal lock, and the case comes with 2 keys.</li>
            <li>She also really likes the diamond textured pattern of this item.  </li>
            <li>Very well made too.</li>
            <li>While it is not a huge kit, it has plenty room and the aesthetics are nice as well.</li>
            <li>I was even able to fit my brush cleaner bottle, a little storage compartment, and 3 tiny makeup bags (filled w/ extra brushes, lip glosses, lipsticks, etc) inside.</li>
            <li>Super big and has a lot of compartments for everything!  </li>
            <li>, just make sure it&#x27;s big enough.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t particularly mobile, and I wouldn&#x27;t ever use the locks.</li>
            <li>I rated this a 5 out of 5, because even though I returned it, it was of incredibly high quality.</li>
            <li>The strap really makes it easy to carry around and the box is pretty heavy duty!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little bit of a makeup junkie (ok, so I need a 12-step program.</li>
            <li>It unfolds neatly to allow easy access to small through large items.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not small by any means</li>
            <li>The keys are made just like diary locks for little girls, and bend incredibly easily, IN the lock.</li>
            <li>Also it was very inexpensive compared to what I paid for the same thing made by MAC 14 years ago ($350 or something)</li>
            <li>The drawers were big enough for the full Naked palette.</li>
            <li>but I surprised myself by needing a bigger one.</li>
            <li>Came fast and earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>No more digging in my makeup bag trying to find the right brush.</li>
            <li>I banged into a few walls but that would have been remedied if I had been a little less clumsy and more aware of my new volume.</li>

            <li> The strap is very well made and does not feel weak or insecure, but the size of the case makes it a little weird to have hanging on your side.</li>
            <li> &gt; - A bit on the expensive side&lt;br /&gt; - Small, and I mean SMALL, gap on one side where the fabric meets the side.</li>

            <li> The exterior lid was not finished off. It had two areas where the metal was not secured to the frame. Had to return this. Wonder about the quality control measures taken to ensure the completion of the product.</li>
            <li> The case met and exceeded my expectations.  All my items fit in the case. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Came fast and earlier than expected. This was a gift to a friend and she loved it! The drawers were big enough for the full Naked palette. Also comes with a lock and key which was awesome.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Fits a lot of make up (10 + years worth). Is relatively sturdy.  Very comfortable to use.  I can now access everything I have with ease.  Also it was very inexpensive compared to what I paid for the same thing made by MAC 14 years ago ($350 or something) Love it! Love it! Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so very pleased I purchased this case. It&#x27;s sturdy, attractive but above all it takes ALL of my cosmetics including taller items such as toner and makeup removers kept  tidily in one place.  Gone are the odds and ends in various drawers.  It unfolds neatly to allow easy access to small through large items. I looked for a long time trying to find something that would be convenient and this case fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail today, and I&#x27;m rather pleased with this purchase. It stores all of my immediate makeup &amp; more, which means I no longer have to carry around 3+ makeup bags when I travel or move from one bathroom to another in the house. I had to be very precise when organizing my makeup in it because certain things won&#x27;t fit together, but that&#x27;s not really a big deal to me. I don&#x27;t expect any train case to fit everything perfectly. Besides, it&#x27;s so much better than digging around in a makeup bag over and over. Everything is in plain sight in this train case. I was even able to fit my brush cleaner bottle, a little storage compartment, and 3 tiny makeup bags (filled w/ extra brushes, lip glosses, lipsticks, etc) inside. I will post pictures to show.</li>
            <li> Luv it! Nice and roomy, good quality!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  Super big and has a lot of compartments for everything!  The strap really makes it easy to carry around and the box is pretty heavy duty!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter as a Christmas gift.  She LOVES it!  There&#x27;s room for all her cosmetics.  She also really likes the diamond textured pattern of this item.  Hoping it holds up for a long time</li>
            <li> It is nice, I love all the room it has.</li>
            <li> Perfect size!!! I used it for my nail polish collection.  Now I have room to buy tons more nail polish!</li>
            <li> Its just right. Fita all my makeup in one convenient case. Sturdy n looks good as well.</li>
            <li> My teenaged daughter uses this daily. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Looks like it will hold alot and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup case/organizer.  So much space, well made, beautiful color! This first one I bought had a cracked handle, but Amazon was quick to refund me and the next one I bought was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup case!  Holds many many items and keeps things very organized. Fits perfectly under the bathroom sink. Very well made too.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me. I use it for my stage make-up to take to the theatre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - 6 trays makes organizing make-up easier&lt;br /&gt; - make-up brush holder&lt;br /&gt; - because the trays open on both sides, the case is properly-weighted and doesn&#x27;t fall over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - A bit on the expensive side&lt;br /&gt; - Small, and I mean SMALL, gap on one side where the fabric meets the side. Seems good quality, but hoping this gap doesn&#x27;t get worse.&lt;br /&gt; - Heavy. Would be nice if it were lighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and needed a kit to hold my powders, glosses, shadows, brushes etc. While it is not a huge kit, it has plenty room and the aesthetics are nice as well. For ladies who just want to be able to hold their own makeup in one place at home - this is absolutely perfect. For a traveling MUA - you may want to consider something larger unless you get 2 of these. I&#x27;m still able to fit all of my makeup but it&#x27;s not in an organized fashion in the bottom compartment. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I rated this a 5 out of 5, because even though I returned it, it was of incredibly high quality. I returned it because it was my first ever train case, and at the time I didn&#x27;t realize the true massiveness of my makeup collection. It holds a good amount, and allows for great organizing, and comes with a little cup that brushes can stand in. The trays are of high quality and at no point seemed brittle or weak. The casing itself was aesthetic and sturdy, and looked sexy (the silver diamond texture). While it has a strap, I bought it to keep on my counter (mostly, in addition to travel). It looks nice while closed, and when you open the top and the trays, it displays everything to you which I loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 little oopsies, but they are so small that I didn&#x27;t consider them worth lowering the rating. The strap is very well made and does not feel weak or insecure, but the size of the case makes it a little weird to have hanging on your side. I banged into a few walls but that would have been remedied if I had been a little less clumsy and more aware of my new volume. Secondly, each lock on the top has a literal lock, and the case comes with 2 keys. I can see why some people would need these locks, and if you are one of those people that NEEDS a lock or locks, maybe go with a different case, because I don&#x27;t think these could be used regularly, nor would they actually stop anyone looking to steal your stuff. The keys are made just like diary locks for little girls, and bend incredibly easily, IN the lock. They could totally break and lock you out of your stuff, so if you need a lock, maybe find a way to secure this your own way (your own lock, duct tape, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL:DR; GREAT case, just make sure it&#x27;s big enough. It&#x27;s not small by any means but I surprised myself by needing a bigger one. The strap works well but it isn&#x27;t particularly mobile, and I wouldn&#x27;t ever use the locks.</li>
            <li> This is sturdy. Looks nice. Holds a lot of things.</li>
            <li> It holds a lot of cosmetics ( or whatever) . It is easy to find things with all the compartments. Also is nice looking.</li>
            <li> This case is amazing! I&#x27;m a little bit of a makeup junkie (ok, so I need a 12-step program. Don&#x27;t judge) and was able to get all of my things into this case with room to spare. The deciding factor was that it has a brush cup. I can&#x27;t even tell you how convenient that is. No more digging in my makeup bag trying to find the right brush. I&#x27;ve got them all at my fingertips. The case is also sturdy as are the shelf hinges. I would have preferred a black exterior instead of the bronze, but the color wasn&#x27;t enough of a deterrent to make me decide against it.</li>
