            <li>Great product at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>The taste isn&#x27;t awesome but barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>On the hand, because it is very potent -- it is an excellent item to have in your emergency kit due the number of nuclear plants.</li>
            <li>I have found that taking iodine in a liquid  form works better.</li>
            <li>The product arrived on a timely basis--when promised--and was packaged safely.  </li>
            <li>Tried Sunny D seem to be better.</li>
            <li>I just assumed I probably needed more.  </li>
            <li>This brand is way way more potent than others you may see in stores.  </li>
            <li>If you use iodized salt and avoid chlorine for the most part, you may not need this.</li>
            <li>When the bottle is gone I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Make sure you can take iodine and not allergic to it.</li>
            <li>Yes you can find it it costs more.</li>
            <li>Sure so part medium and part Sherlock Holmes.</li>
            <li>This formula is great for anyone that is nervous about taking too much iodine as it is water soluble.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much better and relaxed</li>
            <li>ok..</li>
            <li>I even sleep without covers a lot of the time whereas before I&#x27;d have two comforters on top of me.  </li>
            <li>I am feeling better already.</li>
            <li>I would use orange juice or whatever juice you like to be able to take this without the bitterness.</li>
            <li>More energetic.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had my repeat blood tests yet but am warmer and have more energy.  </li>
            <li>Many iodine supplements contain potassium.</li>
            <li>otherwise I love the sleep.&lt;br /&gt;HATE</li>
            <li>So somedays it give me more energy</li>
            <li>Followed the instructions and after about a week felt like I had more energy.</li>
            <li>probably the most absorbable iodine on the market</li>
            <li>I think I would need to do more trials to see the results.</li>
            <li>So far it working good!</li>
            <li>while I can&#x27;t specifically say I&#x27;ve noticed any changes, I have noticed that my weight doesn&#x27;t fluctuate as much anymore in a good way.</li>
            <li>If you want an iodine supplement that is easy to use, this should work well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Within 20-30 minutes of using 2 drop in a glass of water, my nose is the first thing to start to warm up</li>
            <li>and I really think I have more energy!</li>
            <li>I have now upgraded to a different type since I require more than most people, but this worked great when I first began supplementing</li>
            <li>and I believe it is playing a huge role in my recovery from Adrenal Fatigue and helping me to overcome Hashimoto&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Great for anyone with low thyroid function.</li>
            <li>So shop at Amazon I do with free shipping and</li>
            <li>I really l enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li>Cause after taking one drop per day for several days, that&#x27;s what I experienced:</li>
            <li>This stuff is great if you don&#x27;t get enough iodine in your diet.</li>
            <li>Great product that we use daily!</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I used to buy it somewhere else before I was aware Amazon handled it, now I&#x27;m glad they do for it helps me get into the &amp;#34;Free Shipping&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>per adult day, please check with your own)--</li>
            <li>When I look in the mirror I almost tear up because I finally feel good again after 20 years.</li>
            <li>so much so that I had to grab my cart at Target to make sure I didn&#x27;t pass out.</li>
            <li>Been using this brand for several years and it is a really good iodine supplement.  </li>
            <li>easy to take and not bad in water, came fast!</li>
            <li>In an emergency one bottle would supply more than enough water soluble iodine for many people -- do not confuse mcg dose with mg</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly as does all things I order from Amazon.</li>
            <li>it comes quick.</li>
            <li>i switched to a pill form and it works better for me, just because i take it more regularly!</li>
            <li>This formula quickly increased the iodine in my body.  </li>
            <li>Since many iodine supplements contain potassium, concurrent use may result in dangerously high levels of potassium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amiodorone</li>
            <li>Since many iodine supplements contain potassium, concurrent use may result in dangerously high levels of potassium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amiodorone</li>
            <li>I am somewhat concerned that I really need to be tested to make sure I&#x27;m taking the right amount.  </li>
            <li>The manufacture is very consistent.</li>
            <li>However I wanted to warn everyone that if you develop a persistent, strong cough with this, you really must stop taking it immediately as that is a sign of allergic reaction to either the iodine or the suspense</li>
            <li>dose --- seek professional naturapathic advice for more information (mine suggests max.</li>
            <li>I had read about this in a newsletter I receive from Dr. Williams,  so far I am pleased with the results that I have recieved by using it.</li>
            <li>It is working well so far, and I expect to be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>Dissolves best if you add the drop to the empty glass prior to filling with water.</li>
            <li>but of course it might be just the right thing for someone else.</li>
            <li>It was just right thank you</li>
            <li>and I have already  noticed better appetite control, less stomach bulge, and more energy.  </li>
            <li>My hair and skin was a mess and no matter how many calories I cut, or how many aerobic classes I teach, I still gain weight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Iosol has been a great help to me, in that, being a perimenopausal woman over 45, my periods, which used to be very heavy and somewhat prolonged, are now normalized.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much, just 3 drops in 8-10 oz. of water.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product mainly for my wife to warm her up a bit in the winter, and for overall thyroid health.  </li>
            <li>The first endocrinologist I saw said \\&quot;iodine deficiency doesn&#x27;t exist in the USA.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Make sure you NEED iodine before ingesting it regularly, something I didn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>It will put more speed in the metabolic system making you feel younger!</li>
            <li>This product helps to safely replenish this necessary substance.  </li>
            <li>first week I used two drops in water morning and night.</li>
            <li>For these reasons, you should not take iodine supplements without first talking to your doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Iodine is essential for a healthy thyroid function.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s doing anything positive</li>
            <li>After taking one drop of this stuff, I felt foolish for listening to all those positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I found that gargling and ingesting this iodine pretty much rid me of sore throats and colds.</li>
            <li>I pretty much stick to one drop for now.  </li>
            <li>This is easy to take on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an easy product to find locally, so I buy through Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>we dried it out in bags we liked it crisp.</li>
            <li>Along with T3 daily, it&#x27;s made a huge difference in my thyroid function.  </li>
            <li>This product is very potent and should be taken in small doses.</li>
            <li>Both are important for health but our salt is only supplemented with one.  </li>
            <li>At the moment I have a fast heart rate.</li>
            <li>I really am thankful for this product.</li>
            <li>Even, for some reason the definition around my lips and nose are much nicer.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve read that there is no way to determine how much iodide is in this formula.  </li>
            <li>I use this product all the time and really trust it for my health.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not feeling much more energy, which I expected to.  </li>
            <li>Bring Hypo for 5 years I really wish I&#x27;d had this supplement years ago.</li>
            <li>I used too much of it and had to stop, but I will continue again with one drop a day.</li>
            <li>I have since received the product and have found the price is back at the original price that I order.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to be able to get this small bottle that will last for quite some time.</li>
            <li>Decent price and fast shipping...</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a month, and am noticing improvements in hair loss (less than before), and energy levels (greater than before use).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this particular product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking this for two weeks, approximately 3 times a day, and I honestly feel so much more awake in the afternoons and that hasn&#x27;t been the case for a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>-- Concurrent use with iodine supplements may result in dangerously high levels of iodine.d with ACE inhibitors and ARB&#x27;s, iodine may result in an increased level of potassium in the body, which may be dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potassium</li>
            <li>-- Concurrent use with iodine supplements may result in dangerously high levels of iodine.</li>
            <li>One thing to be aware of, I did eventually get afib-rapid, irregular heart beat, I think it was caused by taking big doses of bromelain, or ginkgo biloba or another supplement I was taking for joints, but, must consider it could have been from too much iodine which is known to cause afib</li>
            <li>In the first several weeks, I was taking 3-4 drops per day of Iosol along with the full recommended dose of Thytrophin (3 per day), until my morning basal temp (taken under the arm before ever getting out of bed) finally came up and over the minimum 97.2° mark.</li>
            <li>me, this product is a God send and has improved my energy, focus, skin, hair (I have new growth coming in), sleep, and has helped with my weight.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s usually not the Iodine people are allergic to, it&#x27;s the protein in the shell fish.  </li>
            <li>Use it both topically and internally as I have a thyroid problem and want to make sure I am getting enough iodine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Taking more iodine per day than you usually get from table salt, or about 160 - 600 mcg (micrograms), may be harmful.</li>
            <li>Not sure how badly I actually need this supplement, but it&#x27;s easy to take, cheap, and will probably last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>I feel better each week since starting it less than a month ago.  </li>
            <li>No problems so far; would wait for follow-up blood test before commenting on its efficacy.</li>
            <li>It is a natural substance.</li>
            <li>If you can find it in a health food store it is sealed and soft.</li>
            <li>Iodine has made the biggest impact out of all of my supplements so far, and I feel the biggest difference when I do not take it.</li>
            <li>Everyone has really noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li>I got this for my Mom so that she can try it to control her thyroid naturally.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is only useful for drinking, not fot applying topically.</li>
            <li>It is better to make increases slowly.  </li>
            <li>Daily intake of 2,000 mcg iodine may be toxic, particularly in people with kidney disease or tuberculosis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are currently being treated with any of the following medications, you should not take iodine without first talking to your health care provider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally back to normal.  </li>
            <li>doses of iodine may block the production of thyroid hormones, causing hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels) in someone with otherwise normal thyroid function.</li>
            <li>I am self-treating myself since the tests always come back on the normal range</li>
            <li>Within a few days I was sleeping soundly after several years of severe insomnia.  </li>
            <li>this review is no reflection on the quality of this product as it did to a large extent clear up my psoriasis and my other skin problems.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t much care for the flavor of the product, being unused to it, but have gradually adapted to it, and now I hardly notice it at all.  </li>
            <li>Not saying it was bad, just didn&#x27;t have the affect others have experienced</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll end it here  :O)</li>
            <li>I feel my neck kind of hurts and very tired</li>
            <li>Well I knew she was full of it because I had just read an article on Medline that talked about elderly in particular being iodine deficient because they tend to avoid salt.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very cheap therapy compared to all the money I&#x27;ve spent on medication and supplements in the past!</li>
            <li>Iodine is extremely vital for our energy level, because it&#x27;s necessary for the thyroid gland to work properly.</li>
            <li>Currently working on boosting testosterone as natural as possible.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much better and relaxed</li>
            <li> ok..</li>
            <li> I even sleep without covers a lot of the time whereas before I&#x27;d have two comforters on top of me.  </li>
            <li> I am feeling better already.</li>
            <li> I would use orange juice or whatever juice you like to be able to take this without the bitterness.</li>
            <li> More energetic.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had my repeat blood tests yet but am warmer and have more energy.  </li>
            <li> Many iodine supplements contain potassium.</li>
            <li> otherwise I love the sleep.&lt;br /&gt;HATE</li>
            <li> So somedays it give me more energy</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions and after about a week felt like I had more energy.</li>
            <li> probably the most absorbable iodine on the market</li>
            <li> I think I would need to do more trials to see the results.</li>
            <li> So far it working good!</li>
            <li> while I can&#x27;t specifically say I&#x27;ve noticed any changes, I have noticed that my weight doesn&#x27;t fluctuate as much anymore in a good way.</li>
            <li> If you want an iodine supplement that is easy to use, this should work well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Within 20-30 minutes of using 2 drop in a glass of water, my nose is the first thing to start to warm up</li>
            <li> and I really think I have more energy!</li>
            <li> I have now upgraded to a different type since I require more than most people, but this worked great when I first began supplementing</li>
            <li> and I believe it is playing a huge role in my recovery from Adrenal Fatigue and helping me to overcome Hashimoto&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Great for anyone with low thyroid function.</li>
            <li> So shop at Amazon I do with free shipping and</li>
            <li> I really l enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li> Cause after taking one drop per day for several days, that&#x27;s what I experienced:</li>
            <li> This stuff is great if you don&#x27;t get enough iodine in your diet.</li>
            <li> Great product that we use daily!</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I used to buy it somewhere else before I was aware Amazon handled it, now I&#x27;m glad they do for it helps me get into the &amp;#34;Free Shipping&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> per adult day, please check with your own)--</li>
            <li> When I look in the mirror I almost tear up because I finally feel good again after 20 years.</li>
            <li> so much so that I had to grab my cart at Target to make sure I didn&#x27;t pass out.</li>
            <li> Been using this brand for several years and it is a really good iodine supplement.  </li>
            <li> easy to take and not bad in water, came fast!</li>
            <li> In an emergency one bottle would supply more than enough water soluble iodine for many people -- do not confuse mcg dose with mg</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly as does all things I order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> it comes quick.</li>
            <li> i switched to a pill form and it works better for me, just because i take it more regularly!</li>
            <li> This formula quickly increased the iodine in my body.  </li>
            <li> Since many iodine supplements contain potassium, concurrent use may result in dangerously high levels of potassium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amiodorone</li>
            <li> Since many iodine supplements contain potassium, concurrent use may result in dangerously high levels of potassium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amiodorone</li>
            <li> I am somewhat concerned that I really need to be tested to make sure I&#x27;m taking the right amount.  </li>
            <li> The manufacture is very consistent.</li>
            <li> However I wanted to warn everyone that if you develop a persistent, strong cough with this, you really must stop taking it immediately as that is a sign of allergic reaction to either the iodine or the suspense</li>
            <li> dose --- seek professional naturapathic advice for more information (mine suggests max.</li>
            <li> I had read about this in a newsletter I receive from Dr. Williams,  so far I am pleased with the results that I have recieved by using it.</li>
            <li> It is working well so far, and I expect to be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> Dissolves best if you add the drop to the empty glass prior to filling with water.</li>
            <li> but of course it might be just the right thing for someone else.</li>
            <li> It was just right thank you</li>
            <li> and I have already  noticed better appetite control, less stomach bulge, and more energy.  </li>
            <li> My hair and skin was a mess and no matter how many calories I cut, or how many aerobic classes I teach, I still gain weight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Iosol has been a great help to me, in that, being a perimenopausal woman over 45, my periods, which used to be very heavy and somewhat prolonged, are now normalized.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much, just 3 drops in 8-10 oz. of water.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product mainly for my wife to warm her up a bit in the winter, and for overall thyroid health.  </li>
            <li> The first endocrinologist I saw said \\&quot;iodine deficiency doesn&#x27;t exist in the USA.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Make sure you NEED iodine before ingesting it regularly, something I didn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> It will put more speed in the metabolic system making you feel younger!</li>
            <li> This product helps to safely replenish this necessary substance.  </li>
            <li> first week I used two drops in water morning and night.</li>
            <li> For these reasons, you should not take iodine supplements without first talking to your doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Iodine is essential for a healthy thyroid function.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s doing anything positive</li>
            <li> After taking one drop of this stuff, I felt foolish for listening to all those positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I found that gargling and ingesting this iodine pretty much rid me of sore throats and colds.</li>
            <li> I pretty much stick to one drop for now.  </li>
            <li> This is easy to take on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an easy product to find locally, so I buy through Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> we dried it out in bags we liked it crisp.</li>
            <li> Along with T3 daily, it&#x27;s made a huge difference in my thyroid function.  </li>
            <li> This product is very potent and should be taken in small doses.</li>
            <li> Both are important for health but our salt is only supplemented with one.  </li>
            <li> At the moment I have a fast heart rate.</li>
            <li> I really am thankful for this product.</li>
            <li> Even, for some reason the definition around my lips and nose are much nicer.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve read that there is no way to determine how much iodide is in this formula.  </li>
            <li> I use this product all the time and really trust it for my health.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not feeling much more energy, which I expected to.  </li>
            <li> Bring Hypo for 5 years I really wish I&#x27;d had this supplement years ago.</li>
            <li> I used too much of it and had to stop, but I will continue again with one drop a day.</li>
            <li> I have since received the product and have found the price is back at the original price that I order.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to be able to get this small bottle that will last for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Decent price and fast shipping...</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a month, and am noticing improvements in hair loss (less than before), and energy levels (greater than before use).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this particular product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this for two weeks, approximately 3 times a day, and I honestly feel so much more awake in the afternoons and that hasn&#x27;t been the case for a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> -- Concurrent use with iodine supplements may result in dangerously high levels of iodine.d with ACE inhibitors and ARB&#x27;s, iodine may result in an increased level of potassium in the body, which may be dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potassium</li>
            <li> -- Concurrent use with iodine supplements may result in dangerously high levels of iodine.</li>
            <li> One thing to be aware of, I did eventually get afib-rapid, irregular heart beat, I think it was caused by taking big doses of bromelain, or ginkgo biloba or another supplement I was taking for joints, but, must consider it could have been from too much iodine which is known to cause afib</li>
            <li> In the first several weeks, I was taking 3-4 drops per day of Iosol along with the full recommended dose of Thytrophin (3 per day), until my morning basal temp (taken under the arm before ever getting out of bed) finally came up and over the minimum 97.2° mark.</li>
            <li> me, this product is a God send and has improved my energy, focus, skin, hair (I have new growth coming in), sleep, and has helped with my weight.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually not the Iodine people are allergic to, it&#x27;s the protein in the shell fish.  </li>
            <li> Use it both topically and internally as I have a thyroid problem and want to make sure I am getting enough iodine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Taking more iodine per day than you usually get from table salt, or about 160 - 600 mcg (micrograms), may be harmful.</li>
            <li> Not sure how badly I actually need this supplement, but it&#x27;s easy to take, cheap, and will probably last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I feel better each week since starting it less than a month ago.  </li>
            <li> No problems so far; would wait for follow-up blood test before commenting on its efficacy.</li>
            <li> It is a natural substance.</li>
            <li> If you can find it in a health food store it is sealed and soft.</li>
            <li> Iodine has made the biggest impact out of all of my supplements so far, and I feel the biggest difference when I do not take it.</li>
            <li> Everyone has really noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Mom so that she can try it to control her thyroid naturally.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is only useful for drinking, not fot applying topically.</li>
            <li> It is better to make increases slowly.  </li>
            <li> Daily intake of 2,000 mcg iodine may be toxic, particularly in people with kidney disease or tuberculosis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are currently being treated with any of the following medications, you should not take iodine without first talking to your health care provider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally back to normal.  </li>
            <li> doses of iodine may block the production of thyroid hormones, causing hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels) in someone with otherwise normal thyroid function.</li>
            <li> I am self-treating myself since the tests always come back on the normal range</li>
            <li> Within a few days I was sleeping soundly after several years of severe insomnia.  </li>
            <li> this review is no reflection on the quality of this product as it did to a large extent clear up my psoriasis and my other skin problems.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t much care for the flavor of the product, being unused to it, but have gradually adapted to it, and now I hardly notice it at all.  </li>
            <li> Not saying it was bad, just didn&#x27;t have the affect others have experienced</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll end it here  :O)</li>
            <li> I feel my neck kind of hurts and very tired</li>
            <li> Well I knew she was full of it because I had just read an article on Medline that talked about elderly in particular being iodine deficient because they tend to avoid salt.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very cheap therapy compared to all the money I&#x27;ve spent on medication and supplements in the past!</li>
            <li> Iodine is extremely vital for our energy level, because it&#x27;s necessary for the thyroid gland to work properly.</li>
            <li> Currently working on boosting testosterone as natural as possible.</li>
            <li> Too much iodine can also increase the risk for other thyroid diseases, such as Hashimoto&#x27;s disease, Graves&#x27; disease, certain thyroid cancers, and thyrotoxicosis (a dangerous condition involving a large amount of thyroid hormones in the bloodstream).</li>
            <li> I recently ordered a new bottle after using Iosol after a few years.</li>
            <li> As for the effectiveness of the product, I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say.</li>
            <li> Bottle last a long time.  </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks I reduced the dosage &amp; would notice occasional days when I felt cold but would just take 1 or 2 drops more for a couple of days &amp; it seemed to take care of it.</li>
            <li> I am stronger now, by heart is stronger, I am still cold all the time during the winter months, but am sleeping much better.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had not listened and took so long to try this product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product at the dosage of 4 drops in 16 fluid ounces of bottled water, and now am gradually tapering down to two drops in the same amount of water, with no reduction of benefit.  </li>
            <li> I am slightly hypothyroid and its so hard to get the right amount of iodine needed in my diet.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of use in a single bottle though.</li>
            <li> Whenever I start to get cold easily, I know I need about a drop of this a day (in water).  </li>
            <li> I decided to go to wellness resources and buy iosol iodine I think is the same that this one I&#x27;ve been taking it for like a week and a half.</li>
            <li> Not much really there.  </li>
            <li> It does help with my Hypothyroidism, but it does have a bitter taste.</li>
            <li> I have always been allergic to iodine in seafood, medications and topical disinfectants to I just started by rubbing a few drops into my skin.  </li>
            <li> Short story, I read of few articles online</li>
            <li> In the future, I will take a little less</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that the extreme afternoon tiredness between 2 and 3 pm is non-existent on days that I use two drops by 10 am.  </li>
            <li> Does all the stuff other reviewers say it does.</li>
            <li> I take Iosol Formula li every day, and during the winter I take more of it, as it helps me keep the cold and flu bugs away!</li>
            <li> Really wish I could take this, because it did clear up my psoriasis, but the cough was bad news.</li>
            <li> At least gargle it regularly for immune health.  </li>
            <li> ( average 3 - 4 drops in 2 - 3 ounces of water).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it might be shutting down Thyroid- -</li>
            <li> I have low thyroid levels on my tests but my doctors were nervous about increasing my thyroid medication because I have heart failure.  </li>
            <li> I Originally wrote a bad review about this product based on an e-mail from Amazon that the product had not shipped and that my card would not be charged.</li>
            <li> I lost a few pounds too, however there is still another 15 to come off that was put on due to my Thyroid not functioning well.  </li>
            <li> I see beneath the black.</li>
            <li> Coumadin, a blood thinning drug) may make warfarin less</li>
            <li> /&gt;People with thryoid disease may be particularly susceptible to ill effects of iodine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who is hypothyroid, since hormones can be expensive.</li>
            <li> Iodine use to be added to our salt and other food products, but it is hard to find it in anything other than Sea Salt nowdays.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over 6 months now.  </li>
            <li> I read about the Iosol from several different internet sites, stating that it was a water soluble product and didn&#x27;t need to worry about it storing up dangerously in our organs and tissues, so I gave it a go.  </li>
            <li> I am still waiting for my magnifying glasses so will not look like a freak when take out a round magnifying glass to read oracle angel cards.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in a glass of water every morning to help nourish my thyroid.  </li>
            <li> It came recommended highly a few years ago and we have been using it satisfactorily ever since.  </li>
            <li> A few drops on my cereal in the morning</li>
            <li> After a few days my hands and feet were noticeably</li>
            <li> I had a low body temperature at around 97.2 and had dry itchy skin with red patches,was irritable,had magnified allergic reactions, got cold easily,my eyes were getting worse (reading), didn&#x27;t sleep well.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the medicine has changed my thyroid count until they do another blood test in 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Usually 2x a day</li>
            <li> (way past time) with things blowing in from the West.</li>

            <li> I did a little research and found that decades ago iodine therapy had been used to treat congestive heart failure</li>
            <li> I use less than what others use because I&#x27;d hate to take in too much.</li>
            <li> In combination with other things that I am doing, not feeling as tired as before.</li>
            <li> Use caution and good sense, I would hate to see anyone get sick.</li>
            <li> It has been several weeks now (about 4-5) and I still take 3 drops every day in water and no more cold feet or hands.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything negative.</li>
            <li> My hair was falling out, I was ALWAYS tired and I constantly felt cold</li>
            <li> But, at least it isn&#x27;t climbing anymore for no good reason!...</li>
            <li> I was having a lot of trouble with feeling cold all the time when no one else in the house was.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with slow Thyroid function for awhile now, and unable to take the pharmaceuticals prescribed to treat this problem.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel hungry because I am tired like I use</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get tired in the afternoon and have stopped taking naps.</li>
            <li> I have tried potassium iodide (Lugol&#x27;s solution) in the past and had unpleasant side effects and kelp</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t jump in blindly and don&#x27;t overdo it.</li>
            <li> I was taking  pill supplements that were useless.</li>
            <li> I always felt so very tired.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after I reviewed the positive reviews, It arrived on time, I started to take it as it mentioned on the lable, it tastes bad, made me sick, haven&#x27;t got any change on the temperture of my body, got very bad period side effects</li>
            <li> If you have a weak stomach like I do can make you sick.</li>

            <li> It is not too bad when diluted in water.</li>
            <li> For the 2 years I took this, I never got sick.</li>
            <li> I had to assume this was what prevented me getting sick since iodine kills germs, etc.</li>
            <li> This stuff will make you sick.</li>
            <li> I just hate having to cover the dropper with plastic to avoid getting the solution on my hands.</li>
            <li> It is very bad tasting if taken with water as directed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Taste isn&#x27;t the best but product works! I have found that taking iodine in a liquid  form works better. I am slightly hypothyroid and its so hard to get the right amount of iodine needed in my diet. This is easy to take on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I Originally wrote a bad review about this product based on an e-mail from Amazon that the product had not shipped and that my card would not be charged. At the same time the price listed on Amazon went up dramatically. I have since received the product and have found the price is back at the original price that I order. I am happy about this because this is a good product and many people I know have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Iodine is a needed trace element that the body cannot manufacture for itself. It is collected and stored by the thyroid. This product is very potent and should be taken in small doses. On the hand, because it is very potent -- it is an excellent item to have in your emergency kit due the number of nuclear plants. In an emergency one bottle would supply more than enough water soluble iodine for many people -- do not confuse mcg dose with mg dose --- seek professional naturapathic advice for more information (mine suggests max. daily dose of 1,000 mcg. per adult day, please check with your own)-- but I keep a bottle on hand.</li>
            <li> very good iodine the best for sure thank you</li>
            <li> Yes, I use it regularly when I have to use the Nettie Pot for clearing my cold and opening up my sinuses along with a pinch of seal salt and warm water to dissolve the salt.</li>
            <li> They say that decades ago we used to inhale iodine, but today the air is too polluted, so we need to take supplemental iodine. Iodine is extremely vital for our energy level, because it&#x27;s necessary for the thyroid gland to work properly. This supplement is basic for me. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over 6 months now.  My hair was falling out, I was ALWAYS tired and I constantly felt cold; when we moved to NV in the summer 125 degrees felt good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 20-30 minutes of using 2 drop in a glass of water, my nose is the first thing to start to warm up, then my hands will start to warm up and so on. I&#x27;ve also noticed that the extreme afternoon tiredness between 2 and 3 pm is non-existent on days that I use two drops by 10 am.  My hair loss has dramatically slowed and my monthly fibrocystic breast issues have almost vanished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something to it.  I encourage anyone who has done their thyroid research thoroughly to try the product. Please don&#x27;t jump in blindly and don&#x27;t overdo it. The first endocrinologist I saw said \\&quot;iodine deficiency doesn&#x27;t exist in the USA.\\&quot;  Well I knew she was full of it because I had just read an article on Medline that talked about elderly in particular being iodine deficient because they tend to avoid salt.  I had been using &#x27;seasalt&#x27; for years (no added iodine).  I also didn&#x27;t understand the difference between dietary &#x27;iodine&#x27; and dietary &#x27;iodide&#x27;.  Both are important for health but our salt is only supplemented with one.  This product supplements the missing &#x27;iodide&#x27; in our modern diets.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product mainly for my wife to warm her up a bit in the winter, and for overall thyroid health.  I&#x27;ve been using it as well at one drop per day, and while I can&#x27;t specifically say I&#x27;ve noticed any changes, I have noticed that my weight doesn&#x27;t fluctuate as much anymore in a good way.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on a timely basis--when promised--and was packaged safely.  No problems so far; would wait for follow-up blood test before commenting on its efficacy.</li>
            <li> Whenever I start to get cold easily, I know I need about a drop of this a day (in water).  It does the trick.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the medicine has changed my thyroid count until they do another blood test in 3 months.  It is very bad tasting if taken with water as directed.  If you have a weak stomach like I do can make you sick. Tried Sunny D seem to be better.</li>
            <li> Iosol has been a great help to me, in that, being a perimenopausal woman over 45, my periods, which used to be very heavy and somewhat prolonged, are now normalized.  I have used this product for a month, and am noticing improvements in hair loss (less than before), and energy levels (greater than before use). At first I didn&#x27;t much care for the flavor of the product, being unused to it, but have gradually adapted to it, and now I hardly notice it at all.  I started using this product at the dosage of 4 drops in 16 fluid ounces of bottled water, and now am gradually tapering down to two drops in the same amount of water, with no reduction of benefit.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is hypothyroid, since hormones can be expensive.</li>
            <li> I got instant  relief from migraines and that isn&#x27;t why I started taking the drops.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I found that gargling and ingesting this iodine pretty much rid me of sore throats and colds. For the 2 years I took this, I never got sick. I had to assume this was what prevented me getting sick since iodine kills germs, etc. Years ago, used a mouthwash for sore throat that I got from a Chiropractic Clinic where I was working in Arizona, and it was Iodine and Slippery Elm.  It was probably the iodine that soothed and cleared the sore throat.  One thing to be aware of, I did eventually get afib-rapid, irregular heart beat, I think it was caused by taking big doses of bromelain, or ginkgo biloba or another supplement I was taking for joints, but, must consider it could have been from too much iodine which is known to cause afib, I think. At least gargle it regularly for immune health.  Make sure you NEED iodine before ingesting it regularly, something I didn&#x27;t do. I just assumed I probably needed more.  This brand is way way more potent than others you may see in stores.  In the future, I will take a little less and I know it will boost my immunity.</li>
            <li> Great for anyone with low thyroid function. It says to take one drop with water. I use about 4-6. I feel great!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after I reviewed the positive reviews, It arrived on time, I started to take it as it mentioned on the lable, it tastes bad, made me sick, haven&#x27;t got any change on the temperture of my body, got very bad period side effects, I had to stop it after three weeks, didn&#x27;t work for me at all</li>
            <li> Not sure how badly I actually need this supplement, but it&#x27;s easy to take, cheap, and will probably last a lifetime. The taste is bearable, but don&#x27;t expect it to be good. If you use iodized salt and avoid chlorine for the most part, you may not need this.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for just one month now and I have already  noticed better appetite control, less stomach bulge, and more energy.  I know a lady who take this miracle tonic who has had her menopause reversed. It will put more speed in the metabolic system making you feel younger!</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly as does all things I order from Amazon. I was having a lot of trouble with feeling cold all the time when no one else in the house was. After taking the Iosol for only 3 days I noticed I wasn&#x27;t freezing like I had been. After 2 weeks I reduced the dosage &amp; would notice occasional days when I felt cold but would just take 1 or 2 drops more for a couple of days &amp; it seemed to take care of it. When the bottle is gone I will be ordering more. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> At the moment I have a fast heart rate. I have low thyroid. This is the closest I can get to help my thyroid. I will be seeing a rheumatologist June 9. I will ask him what should I do. It is a natural substance. It can not hurt you, but follow directions. Make sure you can take iodine and not allergic to it. Dulse is purple we dried it out in bags we liked it crisp. If you can find it in a health food store it is sealed and soft. It keeps goiters away. For the life of me I can not understand why sea salt has no iodine in it. Yes you can find it it costs more. When its teen pimple time it may inflame them, but I buy it with iodine my salt and sea salt. It seems amazon knows where I shop. I looked at a pair of sneakers that had like orthotics in them.  They were very expensive. I came on the next day or the same and they showed me a pair for over 60 dollars cheaper. I bought them and they are the same for over 90 dollars. lol. So shop at Amazon I do with free shipping and it comes quick. I am still waiting for my magnifying glasses so will not look like a freak when take out a round magnifying glass to read oracle angel cards. I see beneath the black. Sure so part medium and part Sherlock Holmes.</li>
            <li> delivered on time as advertised and fulfilled expectations</li>
            <li> My doctor put me on Iosol Formula II for my underactive thyroid.  Along with T3 daily, it&#x27;s made a huge difference in my thyroid function.  It&#x27;s not an easy product to find locally, so I buy through Amazon.com.  One bottle will last me quite a while (I used 4 drops daily).  My girlfriend uses the product too, and she is sold on it as well.</li>
            <li> Iosol keeps my thyroid functioning well.  This reduces fatigue.  I really l enjoy using it.  It&#x27;s so convenient.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been feeling warmer since starting taking it. Usually 2x a day</li>
            <li> Iodine has made the biggest impact out of all of my supplements so far, and I feel the biggest difference when I do not take it. This formula is great for anyone that is nervous about taking too much iodine as it is water soluble. I have now upgraded to a different type since I require more than most people, but this worked great when I first began supplementing</li>
            <li> Does help warm me up!</li>
            <li> I really am thankful for this product. I had a low body temperature at around 97.2 and had dry itchy skin with red patches,was irritable,had magnified allergic reactions, got cold easily,my eyes were getting worse (reading), didn&#x27;t sleep well. After 5 days of taking 1 drop of this stuff 2 to 3 times a day I feel warm inside, my skin looks great (no red patches and velvety smooth with really good color) feel nice and warm, am sleeping so well, and took off my reading glassses!. When I look in the mirror I almost tear up because I finally feel good again after 20 years. Even, for some reason the definition around my lips and nose are much nicer. I look and feel great! My mother has hypothyroid, and her mother did too. I can&#x27;t believe how much better and relaxed I feel. Everyone has really noticed a big difference. I had almost given up and now I am thankful indeed. Wow! What a difference...&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps others too...I feel so nice and warm..and feel warmer toward others as well...ok..I&#x27;ll end it here  :O)</li>
            <li> This product has been wonderful.  I have been struggling with slow Thyroid function for awhile now, and unable to take the pharmaceuticals prescribed to treat this problem.  I began taking Thytrophin PMG which was helping some, but I just couldn&#x27;t quite get to where I needed to be fully by taking this product soley.  I read about the Iosol from several different internet sites, stating that it was a water soluble product and didn&#x27;t need to worry about it storing up dangerously in our organs and tissues, so I gave it a go.  It did the trick!  I even backed off of the Thytrophin PMG (1-2 a day now) and take 2-3 drops of the Iosol daily.  In the first several weeks, I was taking 3-4 drops per day of Iosol along with the full recommended dose of Thytrophin (3 per day), until my morning basal temp (taken under the arm before ever getting out of bed) finally came up and over the minimum 97.2° mark. (Please read up on how to take your basal temp in connection with Thyroid. There is a ton of info on the &#x27;net).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am no longer depressed, swollen, my weight quit climbing and I&#x27;m no longer feeling cold all the time.  I even sleep without covers a lot of the time whereas before I&#x27;d have two comforters on top of me.  I lost a few pounds too, however there is still another 15 to come off that was put on due to my Thyroid not functioning well.  But, at least it isn&#x27;t climbing anymore for no good reason!... That is a relief :</li>
            <li> It is great and I really think I have more energy!</li>
            <li> Cause after taking one drop per day for several days, that&#x27;s what I experienced: dizziness, light-headedness, so much so that I had to grab my cart at Target to make sure I didn&#x27;t pass out. Stopped taking it immediately and am now spending the weekend in recovery. Anyone know how/why this might have happened? I understand that it may have been the Iodine.</li>
            <li> Yup...time to start taking the ol&#x27; iodine supplements....(way past time) with things blowing in from the West. Decent price and fast shipping...hope it works</li>
            <li> Been using this brand for several years and it is a really good iodine supplement.  I put a few drops in a glass of water every morning to help nourish my thyroid.  The manufacture is very consistent.</li>
            <li> Unless you eat a lot of shell fish or seaweed you don&#x27;t get enough of iodine which is Iosol.  This is great for your thyroid.  I was losing hair, energy, and memory.  Get Iosol from Amazon.com  I&#x27;m totally back to normal.  It&#x27;s usually not the Iodine people are allergic to, it&#x27;s the protein in the shell fish.  And it doesn&#x27;t have salt in it.</li>
            <li> I had read about this in a newsletter I receive from Dr. Williams,  so far I am pleased with the results that I have recieved by using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it. one two three four five six seven eight nine one two three four five six seven eight nine</li>
            <li> With regard to the bottle, the dropper leaks and the solution gets all over your hands. As for the effectiveness of the product, I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say. I just hate having to cover the dropper with plastic to avoid getting the solution on my hands.</li>
            <li> I am feeling better already. My thyroid test showed  it wasn&#x27;t functioning correctly.  I was taking  pill supplements that were useless.</li>
            <li> Lots of good uses. Good product.</li>
            <li> Because I have nodules around my thyroid gland, my doctor thinks I have an iodine deficiency.  At her suggestion, I am now using 22 drops a day.  I am somewhat concerned that I really need to be tested to make sure I&#x27;m taking the right amount.  I cycled up to 22 drops, starting at 4 drops a day, then 5, 6, etc.  According to the doctor, you must take a combination of iodine and iodide, which this product contains.  However, I&#x27;ve read that there is no way to determine how much iodide is in this formula.  It is water soluble and relatively easy to take, except, when you get in the amount I&#x27;m taking, the taste isn&#x27;t going to win any awards.</li>
            <li> need it for energy in my smoothie, just one drop</li>
            <li> Iosol was recommended to me by my healer and I believe it is playing a huge role in my recovery from Adrenal Fatigue and helping me to overcome Hashimoto&#x27;s.  Only time will tell.  I go back and forth between using Iosol &amp; Lugol&#x27;s because Iosol seems gentler.  However, Iosol does not saturate the tissues but I need saturation in order to treat the Hashimoto&#x27;s.  It may be safer for those concerned about saturation so I bought it as gifts and give it to my son.  I feel better each week since starting it less than a month ago.  A naturopath I was seeing advised me against taking iodine because of my Hashi&#x27;s.  I wish I had not listened and took so long to try this product. I rub mine on my wrists and rub them together.  I don&#x27;t think I could get thru cold winter days without it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great if you don&#x27;t get enough iodine in your diet. It is not too bad when diluted in water. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Was told this is like a detox, &amp; weep help lose weight.  I didn&#x27;t lose anything, inches or pounds.</li>
            <li> Sea salt does not have iodine.  This product helps to safely replenish this necessary substance.  ALWAYS read and follow directions - and - consult your physician IF taking prescription medication or OTC drugs.</li>
            <li> Does all the stuff other reviewers say it does.</li>
            <li> I am using this iodine for my sluggish thyroid.  It is working well so far, and I expect to be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> I went with a three star because not everything works the same for each person.  Not saying it was bad, just didn&#x27;t have the affect others have experienced</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time and really trust it for my health.  It came recommended highly a few years ago and we have been using it satisfactorily ever since.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years.  All our body tissues need Iodine and I know when I&#x27;ve skipped my dosing for a time, I would get breast pains.....I no longer skip a day.</li>
            <li> this review is no reflection on the quality of this product as it did to a large extent clear up my psoriasis and my other skin problems.  However I wanted to warn everyone that if you develop a persistent, strong cough with this, you really must stop taking it immediately as that is a sign of allergic reaction to either the iodine or the suspense it is in.  Really wish I could take this, because it did clear up my psoriasis, but the cough was bad news.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with low thyroid for over 10 years. No matter the medication (synthroid, thyroxine, armour, etc..) I always felt so very tired. My hair and skin was a mess and no matter how many calories I cut, or how many aerobic classes I teach, I still gain weight.&lt;br /&gt;The first week I used two drops in water morning and night. I have never slept better! Each week I would increase one drop. By week three, I stopped taking the drops at night as I was not sleeping as well and now I only take the drops in the morning ( average 3 - 4 drops in 2 - 3 ounces of water).&lt;br /&gt;I sleep great. The fog over my brain is lifted. My skin and hair are Awesome! I have been loosing weight (about a pound a week) and have lost 1.5 inches off my waist after one month. I don&#x27;t have cravings and I don&#x27;t feel hungry because I am tired like I use to.&lt;br /&gt;For those out there looking for something that may help. Use caution and good sense, I would hate to see anyone get sick. If you are not sure about a product see your doctor first.&lt;br /&gt;For me, this product is a God send and has improved my energy, focus, skin, hair (I have new growth coming in), sleep, and has helped with my weight.</li>
            <li> Under my doctors advice I began supplementing with this product. I use less than what others use because I&#x27;d hate to take in too much. But from my research it seems that this is a very safe product. The taste isn&#x27;t awesome but barely noticeable. Great to have on hand in case of an emergency.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the size of the particles of iodine. They are easier for the thyroid to use. Otherwise, your body will absorb it but it will eventually clog up your thyroid and cause problems. This brand promises not to do that because the thyroid can use it and get rid of it, like it&#x27;s supposed to. I would get this instead of Lugols.</li>
            <li> Best iodine formula I could find on the market.  Bottle last a long time.  Use it both topically and internally as I have a thyroid problem and want to make sure I am getting enough iodine. If you read up on the benefits of iodine, it is a no brainer to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a nutritional supplement. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s doing anything positive but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything negative.</li>
            <li> I emailed and asked for some research data for safety and usefulness.  I was told it would be in the shipment.  Not much really there.  I don&#x27;t trust it as a legitimate tool to help low iodine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not feeling much more energy, which I expected to.  I will try upping the recommended dose and see if that helps.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I take 5 drops a day.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, works good for my condition of hypothyroid! I am being taking it for only two weeks, and I can feel the difference...</li>
            <li> I recently ordered a new bottle after using Iosol after a few years. I am so glad to be able to get this small bottle that will last for quite some time. I pretty much stick to one drop for now.  It is better to make increases slowly.  I like the flexibility of using a liquid.  I recommend supplementing with 200 mcg of selenium when taking iodine supplements. Selenium is essential for proper thyroid function as well as iodine.</li>
            <li> It does help with my Hypothyroidism, but it does have a bitter taste. I would use orange juice or whatever juice you like to be able to take this without the bitterness.</li>
            <li> easy to take and not bad in water, came fast!</li>
            <li> Currently working on boosting testosterone as natural as possible. So far so good. In combination with other things that I am doing, not feeling as tired as before. More energetic. See anabolicmen.com</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this for my thyroid. I use it in water and it helps boost my metabolism</li>
            <li> I have low thyroid levels on my tests but my doctors were nervous about increasing my thyroid medication because I have heart failure.  I decided to try Iosol to see if it would help.    I have always been allergic to iodine in seafood, medications and topical disinfectants to I just started by rubbing a few drops into my skin.  Within a few days I was sleeping soundly after several years of severe insomnia.  My hayfever literally disappeared overnight and the best surprise was that my heart rate dropped and my oxygen saturation jumped to 98-100%.      I did a little research and found that decades ago iodine therapy had been used to treat congestive heart failure (some types are worsened by hypothyroidism).  I&#x27;ve had no indication of overstimulation of the thyroid and will just stick with my topical routine.      I haven&#x27;t had my repeat blood tests yet but am warmer and have more energy.  I highly recommend this particular product.  I have tried potassium iodide (Lugol&#x27;s solution) in the past and had unpleasant side effects and kelp did nothing for my symptoms. It&#x27;s a very cheap therapy compared to all the money I&#x27;ve spent on medication and supplements in the past!</li>
            <li> I take this daily as recommended by Dr. Williams to keep my thyroid functioning properly.  I used to buy it somewhere else before I was aware Amazon handled it, now I&#x27;m glad they do for it helps me get into the &amp;#34;Free Shipping&amp;#34; category as i aid my overall well-being.</li>
            <li> If you want an iodine supplement that is easy to use, this should work well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell a difference for my thyroid it really doesn&#x27;t make me have anymore energy or hasn&#x27;t changed my thyroid reading at all I was hoping for the best but it is good for me so I will continue to take it and no people it doesn&#x27;t help with weight loss that people with thyroid issues look for...don&#x27;t buy it if you want it for that.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been taking Iosol for years. No worries about nuclear power plant leaks, as the iodine plugs those radioactive chemical slots in your thyroid. Dissolves best if you add the drop to the empty glass prior to filling with water.</li>
            <li> Precautions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the potential for side effects and interactions with medications, you should take dietary supplements only under the supervision of a knowledgeable health care provider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High doses of iodine may block the production of thyroid hormones, causing hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels) in someone with otherwise normal thyroid function. Too much iodine can also increase the risk for other thyroid diseases, such as Hashimoto&#x27;s disease, Graves&#x27; disease, certain thyroid cancers, and thyrotoxicosis (a dangerous condition involving a large amount of thyroid hormones in the bloodstream). For these reasons, you should not take iodine supplements without first talking to your doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking more iodine per day than you usually get from table salt, or about 160 - 600 mcg (micrograms), may be harmful. Daily intake of 2,000 mcg iodine may be toxic, particularly in people with kidney disease or tuberculosis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Routine thyroid function tests should be done on infants treated with topical iodine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People with thryoid disease may be particularly susceptible to ill effects of iodine. People with dermatitis herpetiformis can have a worsening of symtoms when taking iodine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possible Interactions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are currently being treated with any of the following medications, you should not take iodine without first talking to your health care provider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Antithyroid Drugs -- Use of antithyroid drugs, including propylthiouracil (PTU), and iodide may increase the hypothyroid effect of iodides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lithium -- Use of potassium iodide and lithium (Lithobid) may cause hypothyroidism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warfarin -- Use of potassium iodide (for hyperthyroidism) and warfarin (Coumadin, a blood thinning drug) may make warfarin less effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High blood pressure medication (ACE inhibitors and ARB&#x27;s (Angiotensin Receptor Blockers)) -- Many iodine supplements contain potassium. When used with ACE inhibitors and ARB&#x27;s, iodine may result in an increased level of potassium in the body, which may be dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potassium sparing diuretics -- Since many iodine supplements contain potassium, concurrent use may result in dangerously high levels of potassium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amiodorone -- Concurrent use with iodine supplements may result in dangerously high levels of iodine.d with ACE inhibitors and ARB&#x27;s, iodine may result in an increased level of potassium in the body, which may be dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potassium sparing diuretics -- Since many iodine supplements contain potassium, concurrent use may result in dangerously high levels of potassium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amiodorone -- Concurrent use with iodine supplements may result in dangerously high levels of iodine.</li>
            <li> Great product that we use daily!</li>
            <li> I take Iosol Formula li every day, and during the winter I take more of it, as it helps me keep the cold and flu bugs away!</li>
            <li> I had the greatest- - deepest sleep ever!&lt;br /&gt;But I was concerned that it might be shutting down Thyroid- - otherwise I love the sleep.&lt;br /&gt;HATE THE AMAZON DELIVERY SERVICE!!</li>
            <li> WE HAVE PURCHASED THIS SAME PRODUCT SEVERAL TIMES AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.&lt;br /&gt;IOSIL IODINE IS RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> Maybe it wasn&#x27;t what I needed.  I&#x27;ve noticed no difference with it, but of course it might be just the right thing for someone else.</li>
            <li> I found out that mixing it with hazelnut-almond milk results in a very pleasant combination.&lt;br /&gt;It is only useful for drinking, not fot applying topically.</li>
            <li> I have been hypothyroid for years, the medication given to me by the doctors was not helping because I just kept getting weaker.  Finally after a lot of research, I started taking Iodine supplements.  I saw a great improvement.  This is one of the forms of iodine supplement I used.  A few drops on my cereal in the morning and I can feel improvement. I am stronger now, by heart is stronger, I am still cold all the time during the winter months, but am sleeping much better.  This is a must product for anyone showing signs of hypothyroidism.  I am convinced, people are not getting enough iodine in their diets. They have signs of hypothyroidism but the doctors are treating for depression instead.  Iodine use to be added to our salt and other food products, but it is hard to find it in anything other than Sea Salt nowdays.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product because my hands and feet always seemed to be cold.  One of the possible reasons for this could be a low functioning thyroid gland. Short story, I read of few articles online and they all suggested trying a liquid losol idoine solution in water daily.  You don&#x27;t need very much, just 3 drops in 8-10 oz. of water.  After a few days my hands and feet were noticeably&lt;br /&gt;warmer.  It has been several weeks now (about 4-5) and I still take 3 drops every day in water and no more cold feet or hands.&lt;br /&gt;So for me it seems to work and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It was just right thank you</li>
            <li> ordered for my sister in law and she loves it...has been using this for quite a while</li>
            <li> I decided to go to wellness resources and buy iosol iodine I think is the same that this one I&#x27;ve been taking it for like a week and a half.I am self-treating myself since the tests always come back on the normal range My simptoms are Tiredness wanting to sleep all the time lethargy wrinkly skin on my fingers and Im only 34. So somedays it give me more energy but like today I feel like flu-symptoms I feel my neck kind of hurts and very tired so I don&#x27;t know if is this or what</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions and after about a week felt like I had more energy. Didn&#x27;t get tired in the afternoon and have stopped taking naps. They are correct about the taste but what the heck, it works.</li>
            <li> After taking one drop of this stuff, I felt foolish for listening to all those positive reviews. This stuff will make you sick. I do not recommend taking this. Instant regret for anyonw who does.</li>
            <li> i tried this and found i was avoiding it: turns out i don&#x27;t like to drink iodine. i switched to a pill form and it works better for me, just because i take it more regularly!</li>
            <li> it is good. it is helping me a lot. It is helping my thyroid and muscle aces in my neck.</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to take. At one drop/day I am having no I&#x27;ll effects.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Mom so that she can try it to control her thyroid naturally. So far it working good!</li>
            <li> Iodine is essential for a healthy thyroid function. Bring Hypo for 5 years I really wish I&#x27;d had this supplement years ago. I&#x27;ve been taking this for two weeks, approximately 3 times a day, and I honestly feel so much more awake in the afternoons and that hasn&#x27;t been the case for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying this and have already recommended to my mother and a friend who both have Hypothyroidism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness I found this.</li>
            <li> The product is great! It heals, gives energy, and helps with weight loss.</li>
            <li> probably the most absorbable iodine on the market</li>
            <li> Good alternative to medicine</li>
            <li> This formula quickly increased the iodine in my body.  I used too much of it and had to stop, but I will continue again with one drop a day.</li>
            <li> Cannot say if this works or not. I think I would need to do more trials to see the results. There is a lot of use in a single bottle though.</li>
