            <li>Great Product !</li>
            <li>This is the best cleanser I have ever EVER used for my acne.</li>
            <li>This is a great cleanser that makes my face &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34; when I use it.</li>
            <li>This face scrub is great, I am so happy I found it.</li>
            <li>It works great with my scrub brush or by itself.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, and helps with my breakouts....</li>
            <li>But when used sparingly it&#x27;s been very effective.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think using it every day is a good idea, and I don&#x27;t use it at all if I&#x27;ve been in the sun, or have wind burn or anything.</li>
            <li>Boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>Great product that gets your face very clean but is still mild.</li>
            <li>I went looking for a GOOD face wash, not being fully satisfied w/my Clean&amp;Clear Advantage oil free face wash.</li>
            <li>Well, here&#x27;s another thing that&#x27;s been discontinued on the shelves, so I had to turn to Amazon to order more when I ran out.</li>
            <li>I like most things on the Neutrogena Naturals line, but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>the smell is overwhelmingly strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face scrub.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to clean OK, but I dislike the lingering scent</li>
            <li>As much as I enjoy the St.</li>
            <li>Skin feels clean and polished.</li>
            <li>I also love that is it mostly all natural and still has salicylic acid in it.</li>
            <li>There must be some special ingredient that makes this stuff work so well.</li>
            <li>The two start are because I like the light fresh scent and because my face felt clean after.</li>
            <li>but then decided to try using it for a full week.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amaaaazing, not only at cleaning out blackheads and oily skin but at leaving you with a gorgeous smooth complexion, that natural rosy glow that comes from truly well balanced healthy skin.</li>
            <li>It keeps my face fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>so I rarely use it.</li>
            <li>You can tell right off the bat that this is really gentle!  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena needs to make it more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and do away with the fragrance and preservatives but overall it&#x27;s the bomb.com</li>
            <li>Ships fast!</li>
            <li>A nicely sudsing facial wash with enough scrubbing to help your face be clean and clear.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery .</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>otherwise it is way too much.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using the entire line.</li>
            <li>This product does not foam much at all.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>It is extremely gentle and great at cleansing pores without irritating skin.</li>
            <li>Well I have had trouble for many years trying to find the a product with the right balance for my face, and I guess I will have to keep searching because this product does not work for me.</li>
            <li>After first use my skin looked red, blotchy and super oily.</li>
            <li>Also, there are not many microbeads for this to be an effective exfoliator.  </li>
            <li>Fresh scent, might be too fruity for some but the scent doesn&#x27;t linger as long as the grapefruit face scrub (which I like a lot) highly recommended</li>
            <li>bit more abrasive than other facial scrubs I&#x27;ve used, and it doesn&#x27;t actually foam that much.</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon this and decided to give it a whirl despite price tag and the tube being less than full.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough for daily use and keeps my face clear.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; or whatever are very gentle as well in comparison to their other face washes.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little turned off by how much wash actually comes in the bottle</li>
            <li>So, of course, the major retailers are no longer carrying it.</li>
            <li>The whole bottle has lasted me a very long time, longer than regular face wash bottles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not irritating, nor does it dry my face out or turn it red when I use it.</li>
            <li>This stuff has just the right amount of Salycilic acid without being harsh.</li>
            <li>The first few days it was basically de-toxing my face by getting rid of all the excess dirt and oil underneath the surface.</li>

            <li> but it turns out you only need just a little bit per face wash.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t usually break out and part of the reason is using this facial scrub faithfully every morning.</li>
            <li> I gave it a month, thinking it was just getting things clean and making the acne come out from under the surface so it could stop it from happening, but after a month of use my face has broken out worse than it was when I started using this product</li>
            <li> Even in the shower it is hard to rinse it all off.  </li>
            <li> Like others, I ordered this and received the wrong product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this item.</li>

            <li> Well, here&#x27;s another thing that&#x27;s been discontinued on the shelves, so I had to turn to Amazon to order more when I ran out. This is a great cleanser that makes my face &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34; when I use it. It&#x27;s not irritating, nor does it dry my face out or turn it red when I use it. A little bit goes a long way too. I like most things on the Neutrogena Naturals line, but this one is my favorite. So, of course, the major retailers are no longer carrying it.</li>
            <li> Great Product ! Fast Delivery . Thanks</li>
            <li> At first I was a little turned off by how much wash actually comes in the bottle but it turns out you only need just a little bit per face wash. The whole bottle has lasted me a very long time, longer than regular face wash bottles.</li>
            <li> I went looking for a GOOD face wash, not being fully satisfied w/my Clean&amp;Clear Advantage oil free face wash. I stumbled upon this and decided to give it a whirl despite price tag and the tube being less than full. Neutrogena being stingy I thought to myself. After first use my skin looked red, blotchy and super oily. it felt like oil was literally coming out of my pores. I was set to return it but then decided to try using it for a full week. Boy am I glad I did! This stuff is amaaaazing, not only at cleaning out blackheads and oily skin but at leaving you with a gorgeous smooth complexion, that natural rosy glow that comes from truly well balanced healthy skin. The first few days it was basically de-toxing my face by getting rid of all the excess dirt and oil underneath the surface. I use a tiny amount enough to cover the tip of my index finger and the scrub works miracles in this tiny amount. otherwise it is way too much. This stuff has just the right amount of Salycilic acid without being harsh. There must be some special ingredient that makes this stuff work so well. For people on a budget St.Ives green tea scrub is very similar in clearing skin and a tube costs less than 4 bucks at Walmart. As much as I enjoy the St.Ives micro scrub I cannot stop using this stuff. it makes me feel like a million bucks.</li>
            <li> Skin feels clean and polished.</li>
            <li> Like others, I ordered this and received the wrong product. This is a review for the listed product (foaming scrub).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit more abrasive than other facial scrubs I&#x27;ve used, and it doesn&#x27;t actually foam that much. I don&#x27;t think using it every day is a good idea, and I don&#x27;t use it at all if I&#x27;ve been in the sun, or have wind burn or anything. But when used sparingly it&#x27;s been very effective.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I have ever EVER used for my acne. I enjoy using the entire line. Neutrogena needs to make it more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and do away with the fragrance and preservatives but overall it&#x27;s the bomb.com</li>
            <li> This product does not foam much at all.&lt;br /&gt;For a &amp;#34;naturals&amp;#34; product the smell is overwhelmingly strong.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to clean OK, but I dislike the lingering scent so I rarely use it.</li>
            <li> This face scrub is great, I am so happy I found it. I pay half the price for it on subscribe and save then I do in our local drugstore. It keeps my face fresh and clean. It works great with my scrub brush or by itself. I also love that is it mostly all natural and still has salicylic acid in it.</li>
            <li> My face still breaks outs .</li>
            <li> A nicely sudsing facial wash with enough scrubbing to help your face be clean and clear. I don&#x27;t usually break out and part of the reason is using this facial scrub faithfully every morning. I use a moisturizing scrub for evening. Great product that gets your face very clean but is still mild.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been clearer since I started using this as a facial wash every day. It is extremely gentle and great at cleansing pores without irritating skin. My breakouts have literally stopped since I started using this. It is amazing.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Acne foaming scrub and received the Cream Cleanser instead.  I will just go to the drugstore and get the correct one.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, and helps with my breakouts.... Ships fast!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face scrub.  It is gentle enough for daily use and keeps my face clear.  Trouble is that big box retailers seem to rotate the products they carry and I can&#x27;t find this locally.  I&#x27;ll be ordering these from Amazon from now on.</li>
            <li> Fresh scent, might be too fruity for some but the scent doesn&#x27;t linger as long as the grapefruit face scrub (which I like a lot) highly recommended and I think it does help manage breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this item. I read the reviews that people left claiming that this stuff helped them when nothing else did. Well I have had trouble for many years trying to find the a product with the right balance for my face, and I guess I will have to keep searching because this product does not work for me. I gave it a month, thinking it was just getting things clean and making the acne come out from under the surface so it could stop it from happening, but after a month of use my face has broken out worse than it was when I started using this product</li>
            <li> You can tell right off the bat that this is really gentle!  Does not over dry my skin whatsoever.  The &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; or whatever are very gentle as well in comparison to their other face washes.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not a foaming wash.  As much as I tried to lather it, the thick gel consistency remained. Even in the shower it is hard to rinse it all off.  Also, there are not many microbeads for this to be an effective exfoliator.  The two start are because I like the light fresh scent and because my face felt clean after.</li>
