            <li> Pleasant smell.  Always had good luck with this and detangling.  Long fine hair, so detangling conditioner is key!</li>
            <li> Pentene products are costs in mind&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is more good&lt;br /&gt;The hair is a bad person recommended</li>
            <li> This conditioner works better than a lot of higher end brands. The Pantene moisturizing shampoos make my scalp break out and some drugstore conditioners have the same effect, but this conditioner is superb without any bad effects. Smells great, very affordable, excellent if you heat-style your hair, but also good naturally dried. It has stood the test of time for me. Also, I don&#x27;t use it daily (I don&#x27;t shampoo my hair that often) and I still find it to be moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I do a number on my hair: blow drying, straightening, hair color, etc. Mostly the heat styling. I use this in my hair almost every time I wash it, and it&#x27;s amazing! My hair is soft and looks healthy after I use it. Just buy it.</li>
            <li> Helps keep hair healthy.</li>
            <li> Smells great and hydrates really well.</li>
            <li> It smells great and really smoothes out my hair.</li>

            <li> My favorite condition. I don;t use shampoo on my hair since its too drying and I used this as my shmpoo and I love it. My hair is very soft and manageable with it.</li>
            <li> Both my hairdresser and my husband have commented on the condition of my hair after using this for about a month.  My hair seems to be as strong as it ever was, in spite of decades of color treatment and the ravages of age.</li>
            <li> Good! Just a normal conditioner. Don&#x27;t expect miracles. If your hair is bad it won&#x27;t be fixed to smooth and silky. Solution&#x3D; haircut.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived busted open, but I scooped some of it up and used it anyway.  It&#x27;s great and doesn&#x27;t give me dandruff like my last hair conditioner would.</li>
            <li> Used on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair. Very nice product.</li>
            <li> silky smooth hair can only be achieved with a moisturizer like this</li>
            <li> my favorite hair product has always been pantene. this product helps make my hair smooth &amp; healthy. you can used it at night as well while you sleep as a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> Really gives my hair a lot of body and lift.</li>
            <li> This was a super score from Amazon, I got it for a great price and it is an amazing product, I have very long hair it goes past my bottom lol and it is SUPER thick so for me conditioner is  a MUST-HAVE! I&#x27;ve used other Pantene products in the past but so far this one is definately my favorite! A little goes a long way and it leaves your hair smooth as silk, easy to brush, shiny and BEAUTIFUL! I love my hair therfore I have to care for it andmanage it! It says that it can erase the damage of 100 blow drys :)  I think it does! This bottle was also enough for me to share some with my mom,who has shoulder length thin hair and blow drys ALOT. She was very pleased with it and loved the way it made her hair look and feel. 2 thumbs up from each of us. Now go ahead and add it to your cart, you know you want to!!</li>

            <li> I was using the Tresemme Keratin Smooth and will go back to that. This left my hair feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and I am very happy with it.  I have tried others but always come back to Pantene.  I love the way it glides through my hair leaving no tangles whatsoever!  Moisturizes well and leave my hair clean.</li>
            <li> Finally got to try this product provided to me by influenster free for testing purposes I was able to use this product for Valentine&#x27;s Day! Not only was the shampoo great and moisturizing but the conditioner also added more moisture and volume to my hair! I Also tried the dry shampoo which works great and I carry it with me just in case I need a little boost! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> A Poor Moisturizer and a Chemical feeling</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner. It is very thick and hydrating. It feels like something you would pay 10 times the price for in a salon. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is Pantene. There is no complain I can think about.</li>
            <li> Personally I don&#x27;t like this conditioner.  It leaves my hair feeling kinda sticky and like someone poured wax in my hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! Love it! Great price for the size.</li>
            <li> The price can&#x27;t be beat and I even received a coupon.</li>

            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t know why I buy anything else anymore.  I experiment with other more expensive brands on occasion, but I am usually disappointed with them.  And the more expensive ones I do like, I can&#x27;t justify spending the money on them when this conditioner works just as well for a fraction of the price.  I have dry hair, a dry scalp, graying, non-colored, medium coarse, straight hair (that&#x27;s a mouthful!).  This conditioner does a great job at keeping my locks hydrated without the weigh-down of other hydrating conditioners.  And as a bonus, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Yea!</li>
            <li> I have a subscription and love that this shows up at my door every 2 months. It is a great conditioner!</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compare it to the conditier you get in a box of hair dye. Which I love! It works so well</li>
