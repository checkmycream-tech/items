            <li>This was perfect for my husband.  </li>
            <li>I thought that this would be an ideal product for my aging father as both his sight and his dexterity are somewhat impaired.</li>
            <li>works for my dad great.</li>
            <li>Works great, dimensions and button sizes are as described by seller.  </li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been a great help to her.</li>
            <li>The problems started after successfully programming my dad&#x27;s satellite receiver.</li>
            <li>Once we got it programed it works good.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased about the service,thanks.</li>
            <li>This is great for low-vision old-timers who mostly want to just change stations and adjust volume.  </li>
            <li>but this is more an issue of the difficulty of getting the TV and cable to work together smoothly.</li>
            <li>The unit comes well packaged with easy to follow instructions.</li>
            <li>I have cable, and it was an easy 3-step programming.  </li>
            <li>It was great the in-laws love it larger numbers and makes it easy to see.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The purchasing process was quick and easy and delivery form Amazon&#x27;s agent was about 5 days, more than acceptable.</li>
            <li>but I  can only say it&#x27;s great for Cable.</li>
            <li>One of the questions that I asked originally was \\&quot;</li>
            <li>Remote works great.</li>
            <li>If they had bothered to respond to my original inquiry in the first place, I would never have purchased this substandard piece of equipment and wouldn&#x27;t have been out the freight charges.</li>
            <li>First code that was put in for the TV brand was the right one!</li>
            <li>At first i loved this remote -</li>
            <li>This remote is the best remote I have found for a low-vision family member.</li>
            <li>Exactly what he needed.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my granma needed.</li>
            <li>it has big buttons, was easy to program and lights up</li>
            <li>I could not get the right code numbers to work with my new TV/DVD set.....</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much more to say other</li>
            <li>But the company was very helpful and quick to let me send it back and refunded me my money.</li>
            <li>and he is not able to reprogram it all the time on his own.</li>
            <li>The main menu could not be accessed, the information button was non-functional and two of the numeric keys did not work.</li>
            <li>will it access the main menu?</li>
            <li>She loves it especially that the back buttons light up</li>
            <li>This product is EXACTLY what we needed ... easy to see and hard to lose.</li>
            <li>too bad, I liked the large numbers and light.</li>
            <li>Even simple, necessary functions like menu and numbers may not be accessible.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t light up half the time.</li>
            <li>We will send it back but certainly can not recommend it.</li>
            <li>Instructions are large-print and clearly stated.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to make it easier for my 95 yr old father to watch TV.</li>
            <li>Does not work with Direct TV Genie</li>
            <li>My 94-year old mother likes it.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 93 year old dad who has Macular Degeneration.  </li>
            <li>The product does function mechanically, and my 84 year old mother in law doesn&#x27;t have a problem seeing the buttons anymore.</li>
            <li>Actual programming is simple and very straight forward.</li>
            <li>&gt; Be aware that this remote will not work with all devices.</li>
            <li>Remotes for cable boxes and televisions are getting more complicated with the addition of new buttons to control new features.</li>
            <li>I sent a second email but it was completely ignored.</li>
            <li>My first thought was to contact the parent company, Hy-Tek Manufacturing, to ask for a dealer referral and to get some answers to a few simple operations questions.</li>
            <li>I read the description, but guess I expected something with just large buttons and not an actual remote for Paul Bunyan.</li>

            <li> This &#x27;universal&#x27; remote was not compatible with DISH.  </li>
            <li> My mother is visually impaired , I purchased the remote for her .</li>
            <li> all were unsuccessful and often did some other entirely different function.    </li>
            <li> If you are using Dish Network satellite TV, do not purchase this remote.  </li>
            <li> Would I recommend or purchase this item again, absolutely not.</li>
            <li> This remote is a bit cumbersome for her to hold.</li>

            <li> When they say, &amp;#34;Big Button&amp;#34; they really mean big button/huge remote.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the size of the remotes remain the same, making buttons smaller and harder to find for low-vision television watchers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this remote for my mother in law who is vision impaired and was having a hard time seeing the buttons on the remote that came with the Dish Network system.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sorry, but the universal remote control was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer is slow to respond to customer inquiries and less than helpful if and when they do.</li>

            <li> Then after a week it stopped working and the codes had to be redone at least once a day.</li>

            <li> I purchased this remote for my mother in law who is vision impaired and was having a hard time seeing the buttons on the remote that came with the Dish Network system.  This &#x27;universal&#x27; remote was not compatible with DISH.  If you are using Dish Network satellite TV, do not purchase this remote.  It will not work.</li>
            <li> Remotes for cable boxes and televisions are getting more complicated with the addition of new buttons to control new features. Unfortunately the size of the remotes remain the same, making buttons smaller and harder to find for low-vision television watchers. This remote is the best remote I have found for a low-vision family member.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to make it easier for my 95 yr old father to watch TV. With some effort I managed to get it to control both the TV and the cable box. It is not a perfect solution but this is more an issue of the difficulty of getting the TV and cable to work together smoothly.</li>
            <li> I thought that this would be an ideal product for my aging father as both his sight and his dexterity are somewhat impaired. My first thought was to contact the parent company, Hy-Tek Manufacturing, to ask for a dealer referral and to get some answers to a few simple operations questions. After 3 days they did get back to me, recommending Amazon as a purchase source but ignoring my request for operations information. I sent a second email but it was completely ignored. Maybe this should have been a warning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I decided to go ahead and order one anyway. The purchasing process was quick and easy and delivery form Amazon&#x27;s agent was about 5 days, more than acceptable. The unit comes well packaged with easy to follow instructions. Actual programming is simple and very straight forward. The problems started after successfully programming my dad&#x27;s satellite receiver. The main menu could not be accessed, the information button was non-functional and two of the numeric keys did not work. I tried all of the codes listed for the manufacturer of that receiver, none of them made any difference. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Another email to Hy-Tek, and another 3 day wait, produced the response \\&quot; it doesn&#x27;t work with all devices and I guess it just won&#x27;t work with your receiver, you&#x27;ll have to send it back to the supplier. We will make note of this and maybe we can add this receiver in a future update. \\&quot; No help at all and no concern or consideration expressed on the part of the manufacturer. If they had bothered to respond to my original inquiry in the first place, I would never have purchased this substandard piece of equipment and wouldn&#x27;t have been out the freight charges. One of the questions that I asked originally was \\&quot; will it access the main menu? \\&quot;, but they didn&#x27;t have the common courtesy to respond. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Be aware that this remote will not work with all devices. Even simple, necessary functions like menu and numbers may not be accessible. The manufacturer is slow to respond to customer inquiries and less than helpful if and when they do. Would I recommend or purchase this item again, absolutely not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sorry, but the universal remote control was not what I expected.Like, when I want to turn on my tv. the vcr came on and visa versa.  But the company was very helpful and quick to let me send it back and refunded me my money.Very pleased about the service,thanks.Regards Yoka van Dijk.</li>
            <li> Does not work with Direct TV Genie</li>
            <li> This product is EXACTLY what we needed ... easy to see and hard to lose. Unfortunately, even after we &#x27;taught&#x27; it to turn on and off three of our four components*, that&#x27;s all it would do. Channel changing, menu selections, any other functions ... all were unsuccessful and often did some other entirely different function.    *fourth never learned.</li>
            <li> works for my dad great. big buttons and had no problem setting it up</li>
            <li> At first i loved this remote - it has big buttons, was easy to program and lights up so it is visible at night. Then after a week it stopped working and the codes had to be redone at least once a day. Now after about 3 weeks it stops working multiple times a day and it is very frustrating since I bought this for my handicapped father and he is not able to reprogram it all the time on his own. Also, it doesn&#x27;t light up half the time.</li>
            <li> Works great, dimensions and button sizes are as described by seller.  This is great for low-vision old-timers who mostly want to just change stations and adjust volume.  I have cable, and it was an easy 3-step programming.  Instructions are large-print and clearly stated.  All the low ratings seem to be related to problems with Dish/ Satellite TV....but I  can only say it&#x27;s great for Cable. My 94-year old mother likes it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 93 year old dad who has Macular Degeneration.  Once we got it programed it works good.  Finding the TV codes was a bit of a challenge but emails to the company help provide with codes.</li>
            <li> It was great the in-laws love it larger numbers and makes it easy to see.&lt;br /&gt; There isn&#x27;t much more to say other then it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I could not get the right code numbers to work with my new TV/DVD set.....too bad, I liked the large numbers and light. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> We ordered this online and when we tried to program it for our TV/DVD/VCR combo were not able to get it to don anything.  I finally found the manufacturers web site and read through the FAQ section.  Sorry but the device doesn&#x27;t work with DVD/VCR combos.  Worthless.  We will send it back but certainly can not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product. My mother is visually impaired , I purchased the remote for her . She loves it especially that the back buttons light up it&#x27;s been a great help to her.</li>
            <li> When they say, &amp;#34;Big Button&amp;#34; they really mean big button/huge remote. In length, it&#x27;s about the size of two remotes. I read the description, but guess I expected something with just large buttons and not an actual remote for Paul Bunyan. The product does function mechanically, and my 84 year old mother in law doesn&#x27;t have a problem seeing the buttons anymore. But...if you have arthritis like she does, you might want to look at something smaller. This remote is a bit cumbersome for her to hold.</li>
            <li> Remote works great. First code that was put in for the TV brand was the right one! No issues at all</li>
            <li> This was perfect for my husband.  Exactly what he needed.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my granma needed.</li>
    </ol>
