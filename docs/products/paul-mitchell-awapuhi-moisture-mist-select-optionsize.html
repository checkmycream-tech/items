            <li>love the nice, light scent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I love this product so.</li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Moisture Mist is a light yet effective Leave-In-Conditioner.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light fragrance that won&#x27;t clash with perfume.</li>
            <li>Grows hair love will keep buying this.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it takes away the friz and static cling in my hair after I wash it.</li>
            <li>Glad I did because purchasing it means going out of my way to find it in a salon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and love it.</li>
            <li>Most Dermatologists recomend it.</li>
            <li>was also pleased they sent me a free sm.</li>
            <li>It is light and refreshing on my face.</li>
            <li>my opinion, this is one of the best hygiene products around, hands down.</li>
            <li>Living and working in Europe means that not all products that we have become accustomed to are readily available.</li>
            <li>It smells fabulous too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is great in the morning as a facial moisturizer, specially when humidity means that your lotion or cream doesn&#x27;t absorb.</li>
            <li>I take a small bottle in my carryon when I fly and mist my face, too!</li>
            <li>Nothing significant</li>
            <li>When I start to get too hot or perspire, a couple of squirts on face, arms, shoulders and neck are very cooling and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I love this, makes my hair feel so soft!</li>
            <li>As a last hope I thought \\&quot;try Amazon.com\\&quot; and amazingly the product was in the inventory.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and the price is right with no shipping and handling.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly in my hair, but it is safe to use on your entire body, anywhere you need a little refreshing moisture.</li>
            <li>First time ordering online.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ordered this from Amazon.</li>
            <li>so ordering it online is VERY convenient!</li>
            <li>but this one smells different, and seems to be more like a  hair dentangle spray  </li>
            <li>Great for your face,body, especially on a plane ride when the air is so dry.</li>
            <li>This comes in handy when your hair needs a little taming and the price is right</li>
            <li>This is a bit thicker than the PM Lite Detangler spray, and can spray on a bit sticky if you use too much.</li>
            <li>you really should shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>Spraying a little mist right in my face always gives me a serge of energy, and I feel more awake.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of natural curl which tends to dry out easily</li>
            <li>and this works great to tame down frizz.</li>
            <li>I use it on sectioned hair, smooth it in, and follow with PM The Conditioner, and a tiny tiny dab of coconut oil on my ends.</li>
            <li>I was no longer able to find it in the store and so happy when I found it on Amazon - less expensive too!</li>
            <li>I use this constantly in the summer when it is hot.</li>
            <li>At first, he was too manly to try a Paul Mitchell product, but after lots of complaining and my answer being the same</li>
            <li>and I have soft curls.</li>
            <li>buy PM from an Ulta store or professional salons</li>
            <li>The product is all that I expected it to be, the price was right and I am again a satified Amazon customer.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shrink my hair and leaves my hair very soft, so I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li>I prefer the prior more subtle scent.  </li>
            <li>it is never sticky and helps with general styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells nice and its great for moisturizing hair AND skin!</li>
            <li> same product as it&#x27;s always been. love the nice, light scent. I kinda wish the scent was stronger. an all-over multi-purpose moisturizer. a little pricey but the bottle lasts a while.</li>
            <li> It seems that the scent has been changed.  I prefer the prior more subtle scent.  This one is too floral.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I love this product so. However, it seems to offer the benefits of water ... PLUS some other quality that seals in the moisturizing property. It smells delightful, too.</li>
            <li> This stuff will never go out of style!!</li>
            <li> Living and working in Europe means that not all products that we have become accustomed to are readily available. On my last visit to the US (NYC) I had hoped to find this product at a retail store, no luck. As a last hope I thought \\&quot;try Amazon.com\\&quot; and amazingly the product was in the inventory. I ordered it and a short time later it was delivered to my European APO address. The product is all that I expected it to be, the price was right and I am again a satified Amazon customer.</li>
            <li> I have been using Awapuhi Moisture Mist for decades. It is the best conditioner around. I use it mostly in my hair, but it is safe to use on your entire body, anywhere you need a little refreshing moisture. It smells fabulous too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like hairspray&#x27;s and gels that are sticky and result in build up in my hair. I have used the Awapuhi Moisture Mist instead of hairsprays and gels for that reason... it is never sticky and helps with general styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this is one of the best hygiene products around, hands down. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my purchase of Awapuhi moisture spray. It came in about 7or8 days like they said it would. was also pleased they sent me a free sm. bottle of shampoo no charge. will order from here again.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Moisture Mist is a light yet effective Leave-In-Conditioner. I use it to freshen up my hair and skin. It&#x27;s a great light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for hair and skin. I was no longer able to find it in the store and so happy when I found it on Amazon - less expensive too!</li>
            <li> Great for your face,body, especially on a plane ride when the air is so dry.</li>
            <li> I use this constantly in the summer when it is hot. It is great in the morning as a facial moisturizer, specially when humidity means that your lotion or cream doesn&#x27;t absorb. When I start to get too hot or perspire, a couple of squirts on face, arms, shoulders and neck are very cooling and refreshing.  It is also a great light conditioner for hair, and can even be used to as a setting spray for makeup. It has a nice light fragrance that won&#x27;t clash with perfume. Definitely a wonderful, multi-use beauty product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 15 yrs now... First time ordering online.  Product was watered down and is not 100% awapuhi mist... Wont buy from you again.</li>
            <li> Have used this stuff for over 20 years. I have a lot of natural curl which tends to dry out easily and this works great to tame down frizz. I take a small bottle in my carryon when I fly and mist my face, too! Does not leave any type of residue or weigh my hair down. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great Product - keep it at work , in the car and at the house. Great way to refresh during the day!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Amazing!!! Shines your hair gives moisture to your hair!! Grows hair love will keep buying this. Spray it on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of this product for several years now. It is light and refreshing on my face. I also use it on my hair before a sweaty workout.</li>
            <li> I drive a touring van across the country for a music group and do get sleepy at times. Spraying a little mist right in my face always gives me a serge of energy, and I feel more awake. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product because it takes away the friz and static cling in my hair after I wash it. This is the first time I have ordered this from Amazon. What prompted me to order it from Amazon is the larger size (16.9), I can&#x27;t find it in salons. Glad I did because purchasing it means going out of my way to find it in a salon so ordering it online is VERY convenient! It It arrived on time and the price is right with no shipping and handling. Just want to give a heads up though I can tell it leaked a little bit. Nothing significant but I would ask the seller to tape it with electrical tape in the future. I will order this again.</li>
            <li> Good as always. Usually buy at PM direct.</li>
            <li> I love this, makes my hair feel so soft!</li>
            <li> 3c/4a coily curly head here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a water replacement step in my liquid, cream, oil routine. I love it! I use it on sectioned hair, smooth it in, and follow with PM The Conditioner, and a tiny tiny dab of coconut oil on my ends. Good moisture from this combo. Neutral scent. This is a bit thicker than the PM Lite Detangler spray, and can spray on a bit sticky if you use too much. Once my hair dries with it in, the slight stickiness feeling is completely gone and I have soft curls. It doesn&#x27;t shrink my hair and leaves my hair very soft, so I will definitely repurchase. *Purchased from ULTA $13 for 17 ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Only buy PM from an Ulta store or professional salons PM.com lists. Otherwise you risk buying fake, old, or tampered product. Plus, these stores hijack the price....10oz bottle of Paul Mitchell is actually $9-10 retail in salons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and love it. This bottle was old and rancid as some others have complained. The smell was off from the start.</li>
            <li> Spray on, brush in a style and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find this. I don&#x27;t know why Paul Mitchell does not carry it anymore. Maybe a bunch of&lt;br /&gt;us can persuade them to resume its production.</li>
            <li> Always a fave but think the formula is a bit different???</li>
            <li> This comes in handy when your hair needs a little taming and the price is right</li>
            <li> I bought this product once before and loved it but this one smells different, and seems to be more like a  hair dentangle spray  then a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> great for your hair and skin!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for men ever. Spray it on after you shower ..... you really should shave in the shower. Most Dermatologists recomend it. Then spray it on your arms and chest and anywhere your skin shows and spray your face heavy twice.&lt;br /&gt;I have beenusing this product for years andbelieve me it has prevented ALOT of lines and puffy eyes</li>
            <li> This spray is a miracle on dry skin on your face. I&#x27;m so thankful for this product.  My boyfriend complains about dry skin on his eyebrows and nose area and I kept telling him to use this spray. At first, he was too manly to try a Paul Mitchell product, but after lots of complaining and my answer being the same every time \\&quot;try this spray\\&quot;! He finally tried it and now cannot get enough of it. This spray is excellent and once again I&#x27;m so thankful to Amazon for having this product so readily available !</li>
