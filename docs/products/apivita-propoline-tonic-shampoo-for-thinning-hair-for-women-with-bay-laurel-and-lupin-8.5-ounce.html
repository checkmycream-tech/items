            <li>Hair feels great, is thicker and is very shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair because of autoimmune issues was becoming hopeless.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair becoming thicker, etc.</li>
            <li>Liked it very much</li>
            <li>This stuff wasn&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the remainder of the bottle to clean make-up brushes.</li>
            <li>Due to age and medication I have lost a great deal of my baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I am still losing about as much hair or more since I started using it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and it really works -</li>
            <li>I do NOT recommend it, particularly for fine or thinning hair (which is what is is SUPPOSED to be for!).</li>

            <li>It smell fresh and clean.</li>

            <li>I have always had fine hair, so i don&#x27;t exect a full head of hair, but i am seeing a lot of new growth.</li>
            <li>In fairness nearly all shampoos have sulfates to this is probably not an issue for most people.</li>
            <li>It has her hair looking thick and absolutely beautiful.  </li>

            <li>Super fast delivery from Greece.</li>
            <li>Absolutely hands down the very Best and only shampoo I ever use (3 years now).</li>
            <li>I first used this shampoo as it was offered in &amp;#34;Soft Surrounding&amp;#34; catalog.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used hair products for thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Used only twice so far but seems great as far as cleaning the hair.  </li>
            <li>I feel that it is very over priced as well!</li>
            <li>The greek gods have done it again, I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it regrows hair, but it certainly makes your hair look and feel fuller.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it works, but it is a great product so far.</li>
            <li>Some people online have noted that they don&#x27;t like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather much.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice so much hair falling out when I am doing my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and the delivery</li>
            <li>Would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if it was really helping</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to two others - one of whom is really overwhelmed at the difference it is making.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and makes my hair feel thicker.</li>
            <li>This works very well.  </li>
            <li>Other products out there which I found to be much cheaper and work much better.</li>
            <li>Much better than any other products&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My edges and &amp;#34;kitchen&amp;#34; are now thick and full; my hair has never looked better</li>
            <li>You can alleviate that just by using a little more.  </li>
            <li>Maybe a little, but I for sure plan to order this again.</li>
            <li>Only used once so far so too early to see of there will be positive results, Received quickly</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair really shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair has quit falling out except for normal loss.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this long enough to tell whether or not it keeps hair from falling out; but I love the shine and body it provides.</li>
            <li>My hair has returned to its normal state.  </li>
            <li>and I have new growth already around the hairline where its thinning.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about a year and even have new growth.</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling funny</li>
            <li>I had lost a lot of hair, not sure if it was my age, meds or my mother and her mother, but as soon as I started using this shampoo it got better.</li>
            <li>I thought the shampoo was all natural...........</li>
            <li>So far, it seems to have stopped the hair from falling out so radically when I brush it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is soft and managable and I cannot say enough about the product.  </li>
            <li>( I actually bought it at Soft Surroundings)</li>
            <li>I used it hoping for better results than a scalp that felt as if it had been burnt - it was like my scalp had gotten a thin crust.</li>
            <li>I have dry, colored hair of a 59 year old,</li>

            <li> This lathers nicely, and a little goes a long way, even with our very hard water.</li>
            <li> or if I was just wishfully thinking when I noticed it wasn&#x27;t taking me as long to try to cover the thinning areas</li>
            <li> Several of my friends are also using it now because of what it&#x27;s done for me, and their hairdressers are recommending it to other clients.  </li>
            <li> hers is very long.  </li>
            <li> When i used it I noticed a burning sensation, and my hair was dry, tangled and did not look shiny at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen no new hair growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and have been amazed at the impact it&#x27;s had on my previously thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> I have numerous small hairs growing back in the bald spots on my head.</li>
            <li> Have not lost barely a single strand when washing with it!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it actually works.  </li>
            <li> Works extremely well with the Propoline conditioners.</li>
            <li> I was losing hair from stress and who knows what other causes and have used the shampoo and conditioner for over six months now.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see in time if it stops thinning hair due to aging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve run out before and used other shampoo and my hair felt lifeless.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is not exactly for the people who is loosing hair on that department no difference.</li>
            <li> Also I haven&#x27;t compared the ingredients against other shampoos for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Does seem to make hair a little dry -</li>
            <li> when I read the ingredients on this product I was not going to wash and rise them down the drain.  </li>
            <li> I seem to be losing less hair when I wash it.</li>
            <li> Even though it ships from Greece, the product arrived in less then two weeks.</li>
            <li> I been using this shampoo already for a while, I can truly tell little hairs in my temples are popping out.</li>
            <li> Waste of money if you want my opinion.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for a few minutes in the shower, sometimes I use conditioner after and sometimes not.  </li>
            <li> Would not buy again as it doesn&#x27;t deliver on its promise to slow down shedding.  </li>
            <li> so I am really sorry that I used it since I later ended up having to get treated for dermatitis.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to lather, and my hair just lies flat after use.</li>
            <li> At age 76, I thought it was just too late.  </li>
            <li> No more hair on the shower drain!  </li>
            <li> It ships from Greece, but I have not experienced undue delays in receiving it.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t so darned expensive.</li>
            <li> Or a transplant. :-(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used it now for about 3 weeks and there is no difference.  I am still losing about as much hair or more since I started using it.</li>
            <li> If your having autoimmune issues of any type this product is for you!  If you just want gorgeous hair, this product is for you. My hair because of autoimmune issues was becoming hopeless. I tried everything out there. Then came across this shampoo. Amazing, soft bouncy beautiful curls again. I also use their conditioners. A great, wholesome product!  Love,love,love!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Left my hair feeling funny</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel it worked to my expectations considering the cost.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years.  I would suggest you stop using it a couple of washings before getting a perm though. Per my hairdresser!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and have been amazed at the impact it&#x27;s had on my previously thinning hair.  Several of my friends are also using it now because of what it&#x27;s done for me, and their hairdressers are recommending it to other clients.

It ships from Greece, but I have not experienced undue delays in receiving it.</li>
            <li> Not all it&#x27;s hyped up to be and  being that it takes a while to ship from greece I&#x27;ll stick with  something here in america.</li>
            <li> Due to age and medication I have lost a great deal of my baby fine hair.  This product is AMAZING - and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  Hair actually feels thicker.  Only thing I&#x27;ve ever used where results are actually noticeable within a couple of days.  Does seem to make hair a little dry - but that could be me.  I&#x27;ve ordered their conditioner and trying that next.</li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful!  I seem to be losing less hair when I wash it.</li>
            <li> I first used this shampoo as it was offered in &amp;#34;Soft Surrounding&amp;#34; catalog.  Liked it very much</li>
            <li> I started using this about 2 months ago and I have new growth already around the hairline where its thinning. No more hair on the shower drain!  It also makes my hair really shiny and soft.  I will definitely keep buying it!</li>
            <li> Seems to help give extra body for my hair and I love the smell of this shampoo. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great scent.  Not sure if it actually works.  Maybe a little, but I for sure plan to order this again.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this shampoo to anyone with thinning hair. I had been using it and then tried another product only to find myself going back to the Propoline. I feel it has made a difference in my hair. I don&#x27;t notice so much hair falling out when I am doing my hair. I really like this product and the delivery was good. Glad I found this</li>
            <li> A product that does what it&#x27;s marketing say it does. Amazed...recommend it. My hair has quit falling out except for normal loss. Very glad I risked purchase, had hesitated because of price.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Other products out there which I found to be much cheaper and work much better.</li>
            <li> This product does make ur hair feel fuller. Rich lather and great clean smell. Works extremely well with the Propoline conditioners. Will definitely buy this product again.....</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve ordered it before but this distributor sent it faster than any other one it came through.</li>
            <li> Apivita Propoline Tonic Shampoo Has helped my thinning hair. I have numerous small hairs growing back in the bald spots on my head.</li>
            <li> Hair looks and feels fuller after each use--but don&#x27;t know how it will be in the long-run. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this long enough to tell whether or not it keeps hair from falling out; but I love the shine and body it provides. This lathers nicely, and a little goes a long way, even with our very hard water. It smells good, too -- fresh and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used hair products for thinning hair. After reading a lot of reviews, I chose this brand. I couldn&#x27;t find a conditioner from Propoline, so I got Tricomin conditioner. After the 2nd or 3rd use I saw a big change. I only have about 1/3 of hair in the drain (I know, it&#x27;s gross) than I had when I washed with regular shampoo and conditioner. My hair feels dryer though. Overall, I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Finally, something that actually works as advertised. I don&#x27;t know if it regrows hair, but it certainly makes your hair look and feel fuller. Even though it ships from Greece, the product arrived in less then two weeks. Would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> I would give this product a 5 star rating!  I was losing hair from stress and who knows what other causes and have used the shampoo and conditioner for over six months now.  My hair has returned to its normal state.  It is soft and managable and I cannot say enough about the product.  I even buy it for my daughter who has gray hair also --only hers is very long.  It has her hair looking thick and absolutely beautiful.  Thank the makers of the shampoo and conditioner for me.</li>
            <li> I like the scent but haven&#x27;t noticed any decrease in hair loss which is the reason for which I bought it.  Would not buy again as it doesn&#x27;t deliver on its promise to slow down shedding.  Save your money for a hat.  Or a transplant. :-(</li>
            <li> Used only twice so far but seems great as far as cleaning the hair.  We&#x27;ll see in time if it stops thinning hair due to aging.</li>
            <li> DId not do anything at all for my hair. Waste of money if you want my opinion.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended trying Propoline ant first I wasn&#x27;t sure this shampoo was really doing anything for my thinning hair.  At age 76, I thought it was just too late.  I didn&#x27;t know if it was really helping or if I was just wishfully thinking when I noticed it wasn&#x27;t taking me as long to try to cover the thinning areas and I was not using a &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; product to disguise the problem.  I have recommended this product to two others - one of whom is really overwhelmed at the difference it is making.  I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair becoming thicker, etc. I also don&#x27;t like the ingredients in it.  Won&#x27;t buy again.  I thought the shampoo was all natural...........NOT.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I&#x27;ve run out before and used other shampoo and my hair felt lifeless.  Does a great job. Fast shipping.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair in improved condition both texture and gloss.  Will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product! I&#x27;ve seen no new hair growth. I do enjoy the smell-but that&#x27;s all! I will use up the bottle but never buy it again! I feel that it is very over priced as well! I&#x27;m better off using Nioxin!</li>
            <li> This product is truly a great shampoo. I bought it for thinning hair and it has helped with that problem better than I thought. I have been using this for about a year and even have new growth. It has a wonderful herbal smell to it. I do not use the conditioner because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot and using it now for 4 years. I credit this as slowing thinning hair, now negligible.</li>
            <li> Feels good and smells good.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it works, but it is a great product so far.</li>
            <li> Absolutely hands down the very Best and only shampoo I ever use (3 years now). My edges and &amp;#34;kitchen&amp;#34; are now thick and full; my hair has never looked better (I&#x27;m almost 60).</li>
            <li> I used this product for a month, and found NO CHANGE in my hair. It is difficult to lather, and my hair just lies flat after use. I do NOT recommend it, particularly for fine or thinning hair (which is what is is SUPPOSED to be for!).</li>
            <li> This shampoo is absolutly the best I have ever used for thinning hair.It works almost instantly.It smell fresh and clean.I will continue to use it for sure.If you are fighting thinning hair.BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful shampoo. It&#x27;s gentle and makes my hair feel thicker.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any of the promised results from this shampoo, and found it to be somewhat drying -- making my wavey hair appear frizzy. I&#x27;m using the remainder of the bottle to clean make-up brushes.</li>
            <li> I have dry, colored hair of a 59 year old, when I read the ingredients on this product I was not going to wash and rise them down the drain.  I leave it on for a few minutes in the shower, sometimes I use conditioner after and sometimes not.  This product is great, my hair feels soft and healthy again, not hard, dried out and like wire.  It comes well wrapped and ships from Greece.  The greek gods have done it again, I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> This is my third purchase from this vendor. Both shampoo and conditioner are fab. Super fast delivery from Greece. I always get an extra treat in my package. Wonderful</li>
            <li> So far, it seems to have stopped the hair from falling out so radically when I brush it.&lt;br /&gt;I need more time to really be sure.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t so darned expensive. I&#x27;ve used it before and always loved the results. The scent is very nice and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li> This shampoo delivers all it promises, my hair feels thicker and healthier and along with the conditioner I&lt;br /&gt;am beyond pleased, I have already reordered so that I don&#x27;t run out. Much better than any other products&lt;br /&gt;I have tried.</li>
            <li> I been using this shampoo already for a while, I can truly tell little hairs in my temples are popping out. I am also taking a hair biotin vitamin , I don&#x27;t know if is the combination or just the shampoo . This shampoo is not exactly for the people who is loosing hair on that department no difference. Just give it a try you might be surprise :)</li>
            <li> This works very well.  Hair feels great, is thicker and is very shiny.</li>
            <li> This does work!  Have not lost barely a single strand when washing with it!</li>
            <li> Propoline Did not make my thinning hair grow back but it is great shampoo. Think my problem is the medicine I take.</li>
            <li> Seems to help with thinning hair; nice scent, lower lather but cleans well.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo, but the #2 ingredient is sodium laureth sulfate, which I try to avoid. In fairness nearly all shampoos have sulfates to this is probably not an issue for most people. Also I haven&#x27;t compared the ingredients against other shampoos for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I used it hoping for better results than a scalp that felt as if it had been burnt - it was like my scalp had gotten a thin crust. When i used it I noticed a burning sensation, and my hair was dry, tangled and did not look shiny at all. This stuff wasn&#x27;t cheap ( I actually bought it at Soft Surroundings) so I am really sorry that I used it since I later ended up having to get treated for dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I had lost a lot of hair, not sure if it was my age, meds or my mother and her mother, but as soon as I started using this shampoo it got better. I have always had fine hair, so i don&#x27;t exect a full head of hair, but i am seeing a lot of new growth. so I am happy with the results</li>
            <li> Only used once so far so too early to see of there will be positive results, Received quickly</li>
            <li> I am pleased to have this excellent shampoo. My hair is healthier, more beautiful and have a great volume. It is a good choice for healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and it really works - I have been using it for a couple of years now</li>
