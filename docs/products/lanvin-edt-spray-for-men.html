            <li>Fast and easy!</li>
            <li>People seemed to really enjoy this product and one comment was that it left a good lingering fragrance in the air.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>: This fresh son of a gun can get a tad OP(cloying), so 2 sprays MAX.</li>
            <li>Otherwise you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li>Fast, easy, and exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>My layman description of this cologne would be not too strong, mild, and definitely classy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a clean fragrance very manly.</li>
            <li>Amazing price through amazon, very nice perfume, long lasting, and light not too heavy.</li>
            <li>I first started using it 10 years ago when I worked at Saks 5th Avenue.</li>
            <li>Super fresh smelling; almost like clean linen sheets/O.G gain.fresh open fields</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this cologn for years but the this is the first from Amazon</li>
            <li>Now, I buy for my son, this is the first of his Christmas</li>
            <li>And this is why I wear it.  ; )</li>
            <li>I purchased this fragrance in January 2010 after having used the same for more than two years.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it!</li>
            <li>I am only writing to say that this is the authentic Lanvin.</li>
            <li>This scent is timeless, and definitely one one the guys and gals remember for its clean, crisp smell.</li>
            <li>honestly this is a safe blind buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and masculine.</li>
            <li>She always wants me to wear it.  </li>
            <li>Everybody wants to know what this scent is.  </li>
            <li>This is a cologne for a REAL man.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Only down side is that it doesnt last too too long but still smells real great.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with this, and it&#x27;s at a great price too.  </li>
            <li>This is a serious quality issue, and I guess I&#x27;ll switch to something else, even though I really liked this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very very very old stock.</li>
            <li>My first experience with this cologne was in the south of France and it finally made it&#x27;s way to the USA.  </li>
            <li>Smell same as the first time I bought in1998.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for almost a decade and for the first time I thought to avail myself of the low price online.</li>
            <li>I bought this directly from Amazon, not from a third-party dealer, and I&#x27;d like to think that Amazon does not sell fakes.</li>
            <li>I still had some of the old one left, and only got to open this in May.</li>

            <li> I still had some of the old one left, and only got to open this in May.</li>
            <li> other words, smelled a little too much like those licensed colognes created for Hollywood&#x27;s B movie stars.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s either that (which means that some wholesaler distributes fakes to Amazon&#x27;s warehouse) or Lanvin has gone down the hill big time.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this fragrance, but I was disappointed that Lanvin came up with a rather generic, &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent.  </li>
            <li> It smells like alcohol, and after a minute or two it has a faint but strange chemical smell, which is completely different from what Lanvin L&#x27;Homme used to be.</li>
            <li> It was a little powdery, a little citrusy, a little bit of ozone, a little minty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not sure if i will purchase again</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend this past Christmas</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for a very long while, and I was skeptical about buying it online for this unbearable price.</li>
            <li> Smell like a heaven if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Make me wonder if it&#x27;s a fake brand.</li>
            <li> Clearly a fake</li>
            <li> I keep it my secret though!!!</li>
            <li> Bad idea!</li>

            <li> My wifes favorite aftershave.  She always wants me to wear it.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this, and it&#x27;s at a great price too.  I&#x27;ve priced it at &amp;#34;Duty Free&amp;#34; and this beats their prices.</li>
            <li> I have known Lanvin for some time now and thats why i knew it was a great deal. Only down side is that it doesnt last too too long but still smells real great. i would recommend it</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this cologn for years but the this is the first from Amazon and it doesn&#x27;t have the same fragrance. Make me wonder if it&#x27;s a fake brand.</li>

            <li> Fast and easy! Happy with purchase</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s plenty of colognes out there but this is one of my favorites.  My first experience with this cologne was in the south of France and it finally made it&#x27;s way to the USA.  My layman description of this cologne would be not too strong, mild, and definitely classy.  This is a cologne for a REAL man.  And this is why I wear it.  ; )</li>
            <li> They should call this a Unusex fragrance! It is great! I am getting one for myself and I am a woman.</li>
            <li> Fast, easy, and exactly what I wanted.  I will definitely reorder from them again.  This scent is timeless, and definitely one one the guys and gals remember for its clean, crisp smell.</li>
            <li> A1 Excellent, very good buy, satisfied with all the logistics of handing a good product made with good materials A1</li>
            <li> I purchased this fragrance in January 2010 after having used the same for more than two years. I still had some of the old one left, and only got to open this in May. To my greatest shock, it absolutely doesn&#x27;t smell like the Lanvin I was used to. It smells like alcohol, and after a minute or two it has a faint but strange chemical smell, which is completely different from what Lanvin L&#x27;Homme used to be. I bought this directly from Amazon, not from a third-party dealer, and I&#x27;d like to think that Amazon does not sell fakes. Still, it&#x27;s either that (which means that some wholesaler distributes fakes to Amazon&#x27;s warehouse) or Lanvin has gone down the hill big time. This is a serious quality issue, and I guess I&#x27;ll switch to something else, even though I really liked this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Designer impostor. That&#x27;s what I get for thinking Lanvin would be sold at this price.</li>
            <li> Awesome colone. I really recommend it! It smells really good. Besides, I got it fast, very good service. It is worth it!</li>
            <li> Good price and smells good. Excellent buy.</li>
            <li> The best fragrance for men, in my opinion!</li>
            <li> Smell same as the first time I bought in1998. Thanks</li>
            <li> Very very very old stock. I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for almost a decade and for the first time I thought to avail myself of the low price online. Bad idea! All that remain in this bottle are rubbing alcohol fumes. Better off buying from the store.</li>
            <li> Awesome, my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as potent as the original. seems like more alcohol content. not sure if i will purchase again</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected. Ok, for the price.</li>
            <li> No fragrance or attempt of any fragrance. Clearly a fake</li>
            <li> Perfect . Delivered in five days in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again.&lt;br /&gt;Rick</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the price. It definitely exceeded my expectations. I will be re-ordering more when it runs out.</li>

            <li> It is obsolete to judge or even give the opinion about the smell. This is a very personal taste related matter. I am only writing to say that this is the authentic Lanvin. I have been using this perfume for a very long while, and I was skeptical about buying it online for this unbearable price.</li>
            <li> This has been my preferred brand for 20 years.</li>
