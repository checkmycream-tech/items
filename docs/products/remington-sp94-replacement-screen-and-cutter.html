            <li>what type of security they employee to keep my information safe, as well as the Amazon return policy for piece of mind I ordered through Amazon, this piece of mind was and is well worth those few extra dollars.</li>
            <li>Razor is just like new again, and considering the blades and screens are what do the shaving, it is new again.  </li>
            <li>Items were exactly as ordered; and received quicker than expected.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>

            <li> If you own an aging Remington razor and have difficulty finding replacement screens and cutters for it, this is the perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;The same article cannot be found in most stores and even Remington stores may not stock it. Be sure it fits your particular razor.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly and was as advertised, fit my MS3-1000 shaver like a charm. I&#x27;ve used these same cutters for years, they wear out after about a year of use for me. I would recommend purchasing from amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a genuine OEM replacement for Remington shavers.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to change blades and cheaper than buying a&lt;br /&gt;new shaver!</li>
            <li> Came fast.  Just what I wanted.  Fair price.  All good.</li>
            <li> I used the Remington sp94 replacement screen &amp; cutter on my Remington electric shaver and it is performing and giving me a good shave</li>
            <li> I have ordered replacements for my electric razor via Amazon and have not been disappointed. Remington suggests replacing the razor every 3-4 months, but I have replaced mine every 6 months without a problem. Good routine maintenace, cleaning and use of Remington&#x27;s lube spray called \\&quot;Shaver Saver\\&quot; will extend the cutters and foils life out to six months. I&#x27;ve gone as long as 8 months a couple times. I gave it only four stars because it is still too expensive and in my opinion should sell around 11.95.</li>
            <li> great for the pice, fits my shaver</li>
            <li> Nice doing business with you. Product was excellent and shipment was fast. It was all that it was advertised, kudos!!!!</li>
            <li> Completely pleased with the purchase. Items were exactly as ordered; and received quicker than expected. Would order again. Thank You</li>
            <li> Here is another set of outstanding replacement screen cutters from Remington that you can put in your electric razor, but you have to be quick to get one for yourself, because their are only two left on Amazon.com so go get yourself a pair.</li>
            <li> The perfect replacement blades for my electric razor. Seller info was right on the mark ... and so was the price. A+++ rating</li>
            <li> works good, fast service, would order again.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work great in my Remington shaver.</li>
            <li> Received product exactly as pictured.  Fit my shaver perfectly and works great.  Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to replace their foil and blades.</li>
            <li> Seems to work just like or as well as the original.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like these are as good as the original...I&#x27;m sorry.  I admit I was a bit disappointed.  Tried a couple of new razors out there that shaved much better than this and I probably will just buy a new razor next time.  Seller&#x27;s service &amp; shipping was great, though...would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This is the factory set and fits perfectly in my MS3-2700 razor.  Changing the parts is very simple and allows for a complete cleaning of the housing too.</li>
            <li> Remington had been in my family for years.&lt;br /&gt;we are very please with the replacement screen. a good collects product</li>
            <li> The exact parts, timely delivery. Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works as described. Much more affordable way to have an electric razor... repairing the old one as opposed to buying a new unit. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> The parts were all separate so it was a little more trouble to install, but the smoothness is great. It has made a huge improvement in my razor and the way it shaves. It shaves like a new razor, almost seems better than the original. But, I probably waited way too long to replace, so I&#x27;ve been shaving with a really bad razor for a long time. Maybe that&#x27;s why this seems so good. :-)</li>
            <li> I am glad they are still available. I love my shaver and I have it for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> They were great. Open them as soon as I got them home. Best shaver ever. and the blades are a great price.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted and expected. Excellent transaction from start to finish!</li>
            <li> I was looking for this replacement part and I found it at best price it was on line with my expectations</li>
            <li> No problems with this replacement. I would recommend to all. Easy order. Quick shipping. These parts are same as original.</li>
            <li> This product must work well.  My Daddy (86 year old) keeps asking me to reorder when they get dull.  He&#x27;s a master a shaving.</li>
            <li> Tough to find in the store.  It was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> to replace the head on his Remington Electric Shaver.  The fit perfectly and saved us from having to buy an entirely new shaver.  They&#x27;re still going strong a year later.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely.  Well packed.  It was exactly what I needed.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for replacement parts for their razor.</li>
            <li> I have only used the product once since I received it, but the shave was great and it was just like a new product. I&#x27;m glad I bought the replacement screen and cutter. Now I have an extra razor.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my fater in law.  He&#x27; s very pleased</li>
            <li> liked the price and quality. worked out great!!! perfect fit for my remington shaver. glad i bought two of them.</li>
            <li> These damn things wear out after 6 months or so...buy a Braun razor and scrap Remington.</li>
            <li> Ordered wrong product.</li>
            <li> Just wish they would also make a replacement for the pop-up trimmer.  Have had razor for probably ten years now and have gone through three of these replacement kits.  Even accidentaly connecting the razor to 240vac in Fiji didn&#x27;t kill it. So as long as the razor lasts, I will keep buying the replacement kit.</li>
            <li> FIVE STARS - the removal tool provided works perfectly and makes it so simple to remove the screens.  Instructions were complete, with pictures, and easy to understand.  Razor is just like new again, and considering the blades and screens are what do the shaving, it is new again.  I WILL purchase again when needed and would recommend to anyone needing to put life back into an excellent shaver.  I did not find any downside or cons to the product, I will mention that I did find the same product just a few dollars cheaper but for the convenience and security offered by Amazon, and not having to expose my credit card to an unknown company and what type of security they employee to keep my information safe, as well as the Amazon return policy for piece of mind I ordered through Amazon, this piece of mind was and is well worth those few extra dollars.</li>
