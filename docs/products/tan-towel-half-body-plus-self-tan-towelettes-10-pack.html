            <li>To maintain your gorgeous color, use every couple of days.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and have lots of freckles.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and thought it would be good.</li>
            <li>Really good if you use 4 towels.</li>
            <li>I got this based on the good reviews &amp; ease of use.  </li>
            <li>decided that this was a good thing though.</li>
            <li>One towel is good for my face, neck, arms and shoulders.</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of the process, these towels give me good coverage and</li>
            <li>Definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li>It does take a couple applications to see some noticeable color, but it lasts a fair amount of time.</li>
            <li>and I have no issues good looking</li>
            <li>I am fair with freckles and auburn hair and can tan, but now stay out of the sun.  </li>
            <li>The color was Orange tones, not brown, on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t look good in orange</li>

            <li>Good color and no streaking.</li>
            <li>A good way to get a tan without the sun.  </li>
            <li>They work good and give me color.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, great product!</li>
            <li>Love  them,  they work great</li>
            <li>but the plus is perfect ( and I am pretty fair).</li>
            <li>The color is great, but you do not need to apply more than twice a week.</li>

            <li>I love these towels.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that using two half-body towelettes instead of one full-body works a lot better.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love tan towels.</li>
            <li>Best price on this item is here at Amazon, paid around 18.00 for 10 compared to ULTA here locally which</li>
            <li>I love the color they give me and they do not streak or get on my clothing.  </li>

            <li>I love tan towels.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought so many.</li>
            <li>I think I would buy more of them if they were cheaper.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Will let you know more after I have used it for a while .</li>
            <li>Love tantowel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and plan on re-ordering this product in the future.</li>
            <li>sure to wash your hands immediately afterward with soap and</li>
            <li>sure to pick the correct shade as if you pick one a lot darker than yours, there is a chance of getting that orange-y color.</li>
            <li>but it does not have the smell that most self tanners have.</li>
            <li>Always a streak free aplication giving me and even tone all around!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice light tan.</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a nice even color to my light skin.  </li>
            <li>so many self tanners leaves you with.  </li>
            <li>These towelettes give me a nice, light, even tan.  </li>
            <li>I love the ease of application and the eveness of the color.</li>
            <li>great looks like a real tan</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I did do the top of my feet, but I guess I thought the product would distribute itself evenly -</li>
            <li>(which I imagine is the case  :)</li>
            <li>okay though, I wear knee length shorts so....</li>
            <li>Love these...</li>
            <li>Definitely one of the best ones out there.</li>
            <li>I must say that this product looks alot better than any of the creams.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re applying more than that, your skin exfoliates at differing degrees</li>
            <li>When used inconjuction with the 8 ounce tanning mist...even better.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>Love these...</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S MORE ORANGE THAN TAN</li>

            <li>LOVE LOVE this stuff...</li>
            <li>I love these towels, no need for me to sit in the sun .  </li>
            <li>I have tried many many sunless tanners.  </li>
            <li>Simply the best tanning product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I love the price as well.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am able to keep my summer tan though out the winter months</li>
            <li>It was also more orange than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>just make sure that you spread them evenly.  </li>

            <li>love these.  </li>
            <li>I could actually classify this as the best self tanner in a towelette form I have ever used, but let me explain why.</li>
            <li>it makes the skin look so much more healthy.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>Maybe this would be better for someone just trying to enhance a tan.</li>

            <li>and I don&#x27;t tan easily</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use</li>
            <li>&amp; its not as easy to use as it says.</li>
            <li>they are soooo easy to use and not too smelly.  </li>
            <li>easy to match any existing tan.  </li>
            <li>I had a business trip to San Diego that I would be leaving for in a week and needed a tanning product that would be easily portable.</li>
            <li>Tan towels are easy to apply, not to drastic and never streak.  </li>
            <li>The packets are also easy to carry with you traveling.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use</li>
            <li>And easy to apply with no smell.</li>
            <li>Easy to take along on trips for a touch up.  </li>
            <li>So easy to apply and</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The TanTowel applies easily and leaves no noticeable smell.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t strong at all</li>
            <li>Just make sure you get the right color!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied, easy to use and works very well.  </li>
            <li>The product dries super quick and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Be sure your skin is as clean and smooth to ensure an even tan.</li>
            <li>This is, hands down, the best product I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t have the strong smell that most of the tanning products have.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to use and the color comes out smooth without and</li>
            <li>but that is just something that you have to fine  tune.</li>
            <li>I think it will be just fine, or I will use two at a time.</li>
            <li>My best tip is to start in the larger areas first.  </li>
            <li>Tantowel works fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different self tanning products from lotions to sprays to foam, drug store to high end brands and Tan Towel is the best.</li>
            <li>the tan looks very authentic and works pretty quickly but not immediately like stains.  </li>
            <li>I applied the product right after getting a very light tan and it seemed to retain the tan and enhance it.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy your TanTowels...</li>
            <li>Does have a light scent of sunless tanner, but nothing overpowering.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very light.</li>
            <li>So if you have any sort of color already or if you are looking for a darker golden color, you will surely need to do two</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use one on Wednesday and another on Saturday morning so that I&#x27;ll look lightly tanned for a Saturday night date.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li>No streaking- just a smooth light tan.</li>
            <li>I was not seeing results from the light to medium skin tan towels.  </li>
            <li>While this works for my mom and she loves it and it looks great, I broke out in hives and it took 3 days to stop the itching and that was only one application.</li>
            <li>They work fantastic</li>
            <li>These totally work,  great to add some color for the Summer.</li>
            <li>Amazon price is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and it looked natural on me.</li>
            <li>Good natural tan color with no streaking.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and gets me to a tan that always looks natural.  </li>
            <li>I especially love them in winter when I&#x27;m looking a bit pale.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>They work real well!!!</li>
            <li>I had bought these several years ago and although you have to learn how to use them after a couple of trial runs, the color is fantastic!!!</li>
            <li>Does not turn your skin yellow but tans very nice.  </li>
            <li>very worth it</li>
            <li>#4 easy ,no squeezing out, convenient folded wet towel with perfect amount for entire body# 5 cheap and 1/3 price of Versa tan and can be done in privacy of my own home # 5 results look</li>
            <li>This product does give a nice, realistic, smooth color.</li>
            <li>but Im older and tend to notice pores and imperfections more if I use these more than once on the face</li>
            <li>wonderful, clean solution for pale skin.</li>
            <li>product is easy to apply and the tan appears rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I am fair and have did some major sunning in my teens.  </li>
            <li>It is the most natural tan and soooo easy to apply!</li>
            <li>These go on so easy and give me a nice, natural glow without looking orange.</li>
            <li>So easy, fast and safe.</li>
            <li>Small price to pay for a perfect tan.</li>
            <li>in all, this is a unique, well-working product - but it&#x27;snot without its flaws.</li>
            <li>Always worth it!</li>
            <li>&amp; it dries super quick!</li>
            <li>I find the Tan Towels to have great coverage, no streaking, no odor and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect self-tanner since I was in High School starting with &amp;#34;Q.T. Quick Tan&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>We have not had sun for 5 months, so a little &#x27;pick-me-up tan looks great and makes me feel better.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other products but this one works best and looks the most natural for my skin.  </li>
            <li>It looked so easy, and they kept talking about how the smell was so fresh.</li>
            <li>I have been using Tan Towels now (medium-dark shade) for almost a year, and I think they are by far the best solution for tanning as an alternative to going outside, tanning beds, and spray tans.</li>
            <li>I have tried tons of different self tanners and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I think that looks more natural and healthy</li>
            <li>Is there any way to clean my palms? 5</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several brands and this one is by far the best!!</li>
            <li>If you are careful and make sure to apply evenly, the result is good.  </li>
            <li>They are quick, easy, mess-free, and super inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I use a little moisturizer around my knees and ankles right after application and it blends flawlessly.</li>
            <li>I think the color adapts to the heat of the skin temperature to provide you with a natural looking tan :) &amp; honestly it leaves such a nice tan &amp; radiant glow</li>
            <li>I start rubbing the pleasantly smelling citrus-scented towelette in circular motions at the top of my legs just under my bikini bottoms, working my way down through all areas of the leg.</li>
            <li>I save them to use for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>This product gives you the right amount of sunkissed glow!</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re quick and easy, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Saw the box and went &amp;#34; oh no&amp;#34;!  am very fair Swedish, green eyes...</li>
            <li>these tan towels worked really great and the color was awesome, I still had it a little heavy around the ankles</li>
            <li>I think this product would be good to use for a wedding, special event, or a weekend vacation where you simply want to look tan for a couple days.</li>
            <li>Great product, worked like expected.</li>
            <li>Tan towels do an amazing job at giving you a natural tan without being orange or streaky at all.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than these towels &amp; in my opinion, work MUCH better.</li>
            <li>these are really cool self-tan options.  </li>
            <li>Creates a nice natural color.  </li>
            <li>I use two instead of one, and it lasts almost a full week.</li>
            <li>Both of these are true.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it created a fast tan</li>
            <li>Love them, really work.</li>
            <li>She suggested that even though I am fair and only burn to use the medium/dark color.  </li>
            <li>I have rated this product before on the full body towel pack.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice, natural tan to my face and legs.</li>
            <li>Avoid too much pressure on knees and elbows as they tend to absorb the coloring more.</li>
            <li>No bad smell or staining.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply,  leaves an even natural looking tan and mostly ~ no disgusting smell that lingers.  </li>
            <li>No streaks, no mess, amazing color.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and fast!</li>
            <li>Subtle, I didn&#x27;t look orange, but great!  </li>
            <li>but it fads rather quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second - Be Quick.</li>
            <li>and here&#x27;s why #1 no awful smell like most, actually mimics a spa product</li>
            <li>I wake up take a quick shower and dont exfoliate or moisturize and apply another TanTowel...</li>
            <li>Quick tan</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and has no lingering odor.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, natural looking glow.  </li>
            <li>I was that sure I was going to love these little towels like most everyone else.</li>
            <li>Also I try to do everything else first and then lightly cover knees and elbows.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>They were easy to pack and the half body size is good.</li>
            <li>Easy enough to do on your own and go on very evenly!</li>
            <li>Brought these at my dermatology office first time Really love them thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>The application is easy and fast, not like creams or lotions which I find to be time consuming.</li>
            <li>Awesome and long lasting tan without streaks!</li>
            <li>Exactly as ordered!</li>
            <li>It is simple and easy to use, I am able to use one towelette on my face,throat and arms.</li>
            <li>Smells a little, but the color is great and it doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li>I get compliments constantly on how nice and golden my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>the look is worth</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t yet used these, it&#x27;s absolutely worth a try.</li>
            <li>In addition, one half-body towelette doesn&#x27;t provide as much color as I would like to achieve - even though I have fair skin, I&#x27;m only five feet tall -</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The smell is distinct so I use them at night and shower in the morning.</li>
            <li>Many compliments on my \\&quot;natural tan\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Gives off a non-streaky, golden tan.</li>
            <li>The most natural color I have found.</li>
            <li>by lunch time I have a golden tan.  </li>
            <li>I used these last spring/summer and really liked them.  </li>
            <li>I think a pretty tan makes you look nice and healthy, but I am not willing to increase my risk of cancer to lay in a tanning bed or the sun to get the pretty tan.  </li>
            <li>Saw Tan Towel advertised on HSN and was very excited for a self tanner that looks natural and does not streak.  </li>
            <li>I have used other products that have worked so much better and smelled better also.</li>
            <li>super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Tan towels make me look live I have been sunbathing before a special occasion!</li>
            <li>You can put your clothes on right away and doesn&#x27;t smell or streak .</li>
            <li>I can lotion up right after, where with spray tan you can&#x27;t put lotion on right away.</li>
            <li>It says to wash hands right after, &amp; I do.</li>
            <li>Pretty amazing actually...</li>
            <li>Used them and on the first warm day wore a white mini and kept getting compliments on my tan.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and very natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and looks natural!</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad at all and my favorite thing about this product is how quickly they dry.  </li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and the spray tans always turn out a bit too dark for me.</li>
            <li>I chose the dark tone and it looks so good on my legs..  </li>
            <li>I use them when I feel like I need to have a little tan and want to smooth out my own skin tone.</li>
            <li>I love how TanTowels give me a little bit of healthy glow.</li>
            <li>they turn out naturally and are easy to apply.</li>
            <li>so easy, and it does look natural</li>
            <li>at regular price, THIS PRODUCT IS MORE THAN WORTH</li>
            <li>Dries super fast too</li>
            <li>The next night I applied another round and had a perfect amount of color.</li>
            <li>These Tan Towels work great, need only apply every third day.&lt;br /&gt;Better</li>
            <li>Super fast delivered.</li>
            <li>One Positive; would be great for travel with small size.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li>; I used ONE towel over full body (5&#x27;4&amp;#34; 140) &amp; felt like I got a decent, not 5 star result.</li>
            <li>They dry super fast and are very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I found the classic is too light and doesn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li>Very natural looking tan!!!</li>
            <li>😝 My point is, I&#x27;ve been used countless self-tanners for a lot of years &amp; always felt like there could be something better out there.</li>
            <li>First use</li>
            <li>i really like it!</li>
            <li>Pretty even tanning.</li>
            <li>As an avid used of self tanning products, I think I have tried everything on the market.</li>
            <li>eventually smell funny like any self-tan lotion but not when you first use them.  </li>
            <li>i have to order more next month.. got to get my tan on</li>
            <li>First of all, props for no animal testing.</li>
            <li>I had higher hopes for the tan towel....</li>
            <li>still looking for the best fake tan...</li>
            <li>I will say that it does have that self tanner smell at first</li>
            <li>brown the first shower/night.</li>
            <li>I was able to tan my entire body with one towel.</li>
            <li>you apply tan towels correctly, you should achieve a pretty even tan.</li>
            <li>I will order more towels in the future.</li>
            <li>I did my lower legs first, then went up to thighs, it may be that I should used one towel per leg (its</li>
            <li>They are simple to use, safe for skin and clothing.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>They do get a bit streaky looking when they start to wear off, but it&#x27;s still better than being fish belly white while sunning myself on the beach.</li>
            <li>this every other day, and it does not turn orange, but a lovely tanned glow!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Sun is not an option any longer but looking healthy and glowing is possible with Tan Towel!!!!</li>
            <li>These worked very well; I would order them again!</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy more in the future!&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>Be aware though</li>
            <li>Lasts a few days, and one towels is good for both legs and arms.</li>
            <li>They add just the right amount of color without being too much.</li>
            <li>When I woke up the next morning, my white sheets had zero trace of tanner and my tan looked beautiful and natural.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to use, dry quickly</li>
            <li>After having several spots removed by my Dermatologist I got wise to getting an actual sun tan.  </li>
            <li>As the towel gets drier then finish with your feet (less product is needed around the ankles… remember the drier skin absorbs more!).  </li>
            <li>It also gives me a little instant makeover and looks good under my makeup!  </li>
            <li>this really picks up too much color!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this tanning product to anyone who wants a consistent method, washout streaks.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, use all year long just to bring color to my face!</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this from my salon ($10 more expensive than Amazon) Love these tan towels.</li>
            <li>These little guys are magic!</li>
            <li>It tans quickly and looks natural.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and dries instantly.  </li>
            <li>Easy, simple.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply via the towetets, plus can cut towels up to do smaller areas.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I take a shower, exfoliate and apply Pure Aloe Vera Gel or Lotion whatever I have in the morning</li>
            <li>What I love most about this product is that it hardly has the self-tanner smell!  </li>
            <li>Simple, fast and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I am a red head who does not tan very well, but instead burns easily.</li>
            <li>Ok for a quick tan  if you are only needing it to last for the weekend.</li>
            <li>Decent smell, too!</li>
            <li>and the result is a glowing golden natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>No smudging or staining of clothing, it absolutely WILL NOT rub or flake off if you sweat..</li>
            <li>I was hoping these wouldnt be stinky, but they really are.</li>
            <li>Also, if you use creams, gently wipe off knees and elbows which for some reason, tan darker.  </li>
            <li>Also, I use the half-body on my whole body and it is sufficient.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping made it very convenient.</li>
            <li>I have used tanning lotions and they really don&#x27;t hold a candle to tan towels.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very convenient for travel.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but this stuff really works and</li>
            <li>received these towels 2 days after ordering, thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It worked really well.  </li>
            <li>I still really like this product.  </li>
            <li>The self tanner really has a neutral smell to it.</li>
            <li>it also helps to achieve very even color all over the body.</li>
            <li>This is convenient for travel and it seems to add some color but not too much really.  </li>
            <li>I am very please with the product.</li>
            <li>It was much cheaper to buy the product on amazon</li>
            <li>so I bought a whole box.</li>
            <li>I really like Tan Towels</li>
            <li>My legs do not get tan as fast as the rest of body and these do the trick.</li>
            <li>This week I bought &amp; used several times, JERGENS INSTANT SUN MOUSSE &amp; really liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>I thought a fancier brand would be better, but they are certainly not.</li>
            <li>but these give me the right amount of tan to look natural...</li>
            <li>Very easy to use one of our favorite fake bake products to date.</li>
            <li>I was expecting better results though after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li>MUCH better than the creams, by a long shot...as far as rub-off, for one.  </li>
            <li>I have used the full body ones and never ran out of enough for my whole body.</li>
            <li>These are super easy and fast to achieve a nice color other than my PALE white...</li>
            <li>Works pretty well and color seems natural looking.</li>
            <li>Good Naked Self-Tan Towelettes create the most natural-looking fake tan I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>The next morning I was expecting a nice golden glow &amp; a noticeable difference, but I was just as pale as before I applied it.  </li>
            <li>One towel handles legs while you will need another for the top half.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I bought the half plus by accident, Glad I got the spray.</li>
            <li>It takes two of these towels to cover my entire body, but I see that there are larger ones that may work better.</li>
            <li>they do a half-way decent job if you&#x27;re in a pinch.</li>
            <li>Low odor and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of the Kate Somerville Tan Towels a few weeks back and loved them.</li>
            <li>They are super convenient and don&#x27;t have any gross color guides to stain your clothing and bedding.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I think they have such high reviews is because people paid more money for something that you can get at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying that.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them if you are looking for a self-tanner.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and no odor like some other suntan creams.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this productvfor any one who wants a natural looking tan while avoiding the tanning beds.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t once gotten a bad result after months of using them, so I&#x27;m very impressed with the product innovation!</li>
            <li>Color is closest to a real tan that I&#x27;ve tryed so far.</li>
            <li>They give me a very even natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>If you apply this correctly and don&#x27;t miss any spots you will have a very even, natural, looking color.</li>
            <li>it looks very uniform and natural...</li>
            <li>I used them as instructed hoping to see a golden tan by the next day, and saw no results at all.</li>
            <li>Smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and the color isn&#x27;t orange or uneven.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fades like a normal tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>My mom is normally orange by this time of year with all her creams</li>
            <li>/&gt;It definitely helped even out my skin tone and made my skin look bronze / golden.  </li>
            <li>The towels were also kind of dry and not very moist.</li>
            <li>I wrote the company and they stated the product was new from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>They did not offer a refund or a new replacement product.</li>
            <li>I live in Louisiana</li>
            <li>I have been using them for years and wanted to try something new,  </li>
            <li>Your tan will last about 3 days and doesn&#x27;t peel off, it gently fades like a real tan.</li>
            <li>applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towels dry too quickly.</li>
            <li>The next day she went back over her missed parts and it looked fantastic.</li>
            <li>I use vinyl gloves to apply this product and then do my hands last and make sure my palms are carefully washed.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to rub the towels into your skin, firmly and allow the towel to exfoliate some of the old tan off...</li>
            <li>Use lots of broad circular strokes so color doesn&#x27;t distribute too much in one area.</li>
            <li>The tan however, does not last long and you will most likely need to use 3-4 towels to do your whole body and achieve the desired color.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>Very natural look.</li>
            <li>It goes on evenly and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural and not orangy.</li>
            <li>No streak and very natural looking.</li>
            <li>on easily, without the mess of a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One towelette is enough for your whole body!</li>
            <li>I used two the first day and two the second.</li>
            <li>This is the first tannning product that actually works for me......</li>
            <li>It looked natural and wasn&#x27;t streaky at all!</li>
            <li>the color looks natural, but noticeable!</li>
            <li>The first time I used the product I left it on for the suggested 4 hours</li>
            <li>and although I could see a difference, it became apparent that the 4 hour timing worked much</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time several weeks ago.</li>
            <li>While I love this product, I was surprised when I bought 10 that they did not come in the box like others I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>very soft natural look.</li>
            <li>My first application was fast, no steaks and no funny smell.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have have that strong self tanner odor, there&#x27;s very, very slight odor</li>
            <li>That being said, these little towels aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>I love it because if there is areas that are hard to tan or not as evenly tanned, I use it there.</li>
            <li>As soon as you rip open the packaging, unwrap the towel, lay the sheet flat against your palm and go for the largest areas and move quickly in a circular motion, never letting your hand rest in one area for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>smell#2 goes on clear</li>
            <li>For those to young to remember QT, that&#x27;s about 30 years.</li>
            <li>Gives a natural look</li>
            <li>I applied the towlette to my whole body, including my face (I recommend doing your face last) and got into bed immediately after.</li>
            <li>They also blend well with my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li>Not messy.</li>
            <li>it sells them for 27.00 a Ten pack, way to much.</li>
            <li>Never messy.</li>
            <li>Color is even and natural with no lingering chemical odor</li>
            <li>no streaking...just a natural glow....</li>
            <li>Natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Ran looks natural.</li>
            <li>color is natural.  </li>
            <li>The color looks natural, not orange-fake.</li>
            <li>Looks so natural.</li>
            <li>My skin had a fairly natural tan look to it</li>
            <li>The only recommendation I have is to scrub your hands after use, as with all self tanners that you use your hands to apply, the solution gets concentrated on your hands and can make them much darker.  </li>
            <li>so no messy brown on sheets#3 dries on in about 3 minutes</li>
            <li>But so far I don&#x27;t see any of that.  </li>
            <li>This will keep the tan looking natural and not splotchy.</li>
            <li>Try it you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Completely blended in with her natural tan.</li>
            <li>I always wear triple digit SPF sunscreen but one day I got lost while hiking in the hot sun and ended up out for three times as long as I thought I would be.  </li>
            <li>Natural and not orange.  </li>
            <li>But it takes nearly 10 of them to achieve this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to using L&#x27;oreal Sublime, and it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li>The tanning product itself does not give much color, especially since they are &amp;#34;Plus&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>i use these instead-so natural looking too-</li>
            <li>I completely exfoliate my skin and shave, then I use it as it says in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve tried baking soda, lemon juice, and windex.</li>
            <li>Color is ver natural.</li>
            <li>OLD BATCH.</li>
            <li>I am guessing that the batch is old.</li>
            <li>I bought just one towel to try and wow-</li>
            <li>The color for me was a natural looking tan shade as I bought the lighter color to try.</li>
            <li>The color is natural and comes up within hours.  </li>
            <li>and then I&#x27;m ready to go the next day.</li>
            <li>THe color looks natural and one application lasted close to two weeks.  </li>
            <li>My 14 year old daughter used it and just lightly wiped the product on and ended up missing spots.  </li>
            <li>Of all the products I&#x27;ve tried, I do rank the Tan Towel as one of the best.  </li>
            <li>Using another towelette does the trick, but again, it comes down to a matter of how much you&#x27;re willing to pay for the convenience and streak-free</li>
            <li>no mess, even color and soft skin.  </li>
            <li>I did my feet very lightly and my toes look ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of leg to cover, and it&#x27;s still not dark enough!</li>
            <li>Any places that crease, gets super dark and looks foolish.  </li>
            <li>No mess,</li>
            <li>but they have been the same as the classic: no visible change in my tan.</li>
            <li>After using the Plus I would not bother with ever using the classic again just because my natural skin tone has a base color and the half body or whole body are the best way to go.</li>
            <li>I have used for last two years and I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>The selling points for me were that they claimed to have very little smell and were streak free.</li>
            <li>They usually last a few days and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>They apply easily, and last for a few days.</li>
            <li>Spent less money on Jergen&#x27;s and it works much better.</li>
            <li>I am wiping around my belly button (which hasn&#x27;t seen the light of day in a few years ! )</li>
            <li>They really need to warn dummies like me to use a glove when handling the towelette.&lt;br /&gt;It would also help if they gave a hint as to how long you should wait before putting on clothes.</li>
            <li>I have medium dark skin and these are a sure bet for color, where as some seem to not really show up since I&#x27;m already pretty dark.</li>
            <li>I often use it a day or two in advance for a wedding or special event and people usually assume it&#x27;s a natural tan from a vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without Tan Towels, especially in the winter in Chicago!  </li>
            <li>So anywhere you have really dry spots the product will be darker and really noticeable.  </li>
            <li>This is the third or fourth order of the Tan Towels and they work really well for me.  </li>
            <li>, if your skin is not prepped properly (i.e. scrubbed and free of dead skin) you will end up with patches that are darker.  </li>
            <li>I am white, pale, natural blonde, cotton top, green-eyed, American Honky.</li>
            <li>I have used the Tan Towels for several years and the application looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Third - Broad strokes.</li>
            <li>Tip - if you want just a touch of color on your face, use a towel you have already used to do your upper body as the tanner is mostly used up and will only deposit a small amount on your face.  </li>
            <li>Only a knowledge of the square full body packettes vs the rectangle half body are any indication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am blonde with medium/light olive skin naturally.</li>
            <li>Check first the one I got was for med to dark skin....</li>
            <li>I was nervous when I first purchased them because they were meant for medium to dark skin tone or for a deeper tan.</li>
            <li>Once you open the pack you have about 2 minutes to use the towel before it completely dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really made my legs look like I had spent time at the beach.  </li>
            <li>these last and look natural.</li>
            <li>I do use one complete towelette for my entire body-</li>
            <li>The tan is somewhat \\&quot;orange\\&quot; but that is also more my usual color rather than pink.  </li>
            <li>I have a nice color that does not look fake.</li>
            <li>They are really easy to use, especially if you have someone to wipe the towels on hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I still had my previous now empty box to store these.</li>
            <li>Easy, natural looking, and without the bad smell that comes along with most other self-tanning products or lotions.</li>
            <li>Then with the same size towel, do the other leg in the exact same order.  </li>
            <li>My \\&quot;hint\\&quot; to applying any tan potion on your face is, once applied, use a tissue or Q-tip to gently remove tan potion from nose folds and under your eyes (don&#x27;t want to enhance any dark circles you may have).</li>
            <li>I will go back to using Bare Essentials, Faux Tan...</li>
            <li>The next morning I crawled out of bed and was disappointed/glad to see that I barely had any color.</li>
            <li>I have used Tan Towels for a few years and usually buy them on HSN because of the price difference for the packages but this was a good deal for the plus half body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ridiculously pale and this is the only product I can actually get a great tan and actually look tan, without that fake orangey tint</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;3&amp;#34;, I can use a half body towel for my whole body.</li>
            <li>The palms of your hands might get a little blotchy, but it&#x27;s really nothing too noticable.</li>
            <li>I have used it for several years and I&#x27;ve found it to be less messy and a better quality &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; than other products.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Really good if you use 4 towels.</li>
            <li> I got this based on the good reviews &amp; ease of use.  </li>
            <li> decided that this was a good thing though.</li>
            <li> One towel is good for my face, neck, arms and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of the process, these towels give me good coverage and</li>
            <li> Definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li> It does take a couple applications to see some noticeable color, but it lasts a fair amount of time.</li>

            <li> Love  them,  they work great</li>
            <li> but the plus is perfect ( and I am pretty fair).</li>

            <li> Tried many self tanners and these are by far the best out there.  </li>
            <li> Great product very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Had to touch up after the first day to correct some streaks but worked great.</li>

            <li> I should mention I have very light skin.</li>
            <li> The tan you get from one use is a very light tan.</li>

            <li> I love these towels.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that using two half-body towelettes instead of one full-body works a lot better.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love tan towels.</li>
            <li> Best price on this item is here at Amazon, paid around 18.00 for 10 compared to ULTA here locally which</li>
            <li> I love the color they give me and they do not streak or get on my clothing.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> Favorite self tanning towels.</li>
            <li> am absolutely IN LOVE with this product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love tan towels.</li>
            <li> Just use gloves to apply and use more than one towelette on the area.</li>

            <li> Favorite self tanner ever.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love tan towels.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought so many.</li>
            <li> I think I would buy more of them if they were cheaper.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Will let you know more after I have used it for a while .</li>
            <li> Love tantowel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and plan on re-ordering this product in the future.</li>
            <li> sure to wash your hands immediately afterward with soap and</li>
            <li> sure to pick the correct shade as if you pick one a lot darker than yours, there is a chance of getting that orange-y color.</li>
            <li> but it does not have the smell that most self tanners have.</li>
            <li> Always a streak free aplication giving me and even tone all around!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice light tan.</li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a nice even color to my light skin.  </li>
            <li> so many self tanners leaves you with.  </li>
            <li> These towelettes give me a nice, light, even tan.  </li>
            <li> I love the ease of application and the eveness of the color.</li>
            <li> great looks like a real tan</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I did do the top of my feet, but I guess I thought the product would distribute itself evenly -</li>
            <li> (which I imagine is the case  :)</li>
            <li> okay though, I wear knee length shorts so....</li>
            <li> Love these...</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the best ones out there.</li>
            <li> I must say that this product looks alot better than any of the creams.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re applying more than that, your skin exfoliates at differing degrees</li>
            <li> When used inconjuction with the 8 ounce tanning mist...even better.</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> Love these...</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S MORE ORANGE THAN TAN</li>

            <li> So much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Love the tan towel.</li>

            <li> GLAD I did.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE this stuff...</li>
            <li> I love these towels, no need for me to sit in the sun .  </li>

            <li> I love the price as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I am able to keep my summer tan though out the winter months</li>
            <li> It was also more orange than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> just make sure that you spread them evenly.  </li>
            <li> I have used TanTowels for a couple years now and love them.  </li>
            <li> The TanTowels work well for me:)</li>
            <li> What more can words say-</li>
            <li> Does not have the smell so many sunless tan products have.</li>
            <li> love these.  </li>
            <li> I could actually classify this as the best self tanner in a towelette form I have ever used, but let me explain why.</li>
            <li> it makes the skin look so much more healthy.</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> Maybe this would be better for someone just trying to enhance a tan.</li>
            <li> and I like them much better than creams, sprays or lotions.  </li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the customer service  also.</li>
            <li> I love tan towels for my legs in the summer.</li>
            <li> I was generally pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> so I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Pleased and will keep using these from now on.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used other self tanning products but find this is the best one for my life style.</li>
            <li> I am now a true fan of Tan Towels!</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Any time of year, and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Really easy to</li>

            <li> Application is easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Fades in about 3 days, but easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are easy to apply.</li>
            <li> easy to use</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t tan easily</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use</li>
            <li> &amp; its not as easy to use as it says.</li>
            <li> they are soooo easy to use and not too smelly.  </li>
            <li> easy to match any existing tan.  </li>
            <li> I had a business trip to San Diego that I would be leaving for in a week and needed a tanning product that would be easily portable.</li>
            <li> Tan towels are easy to apply, not to drastic and never streak.  </li>
            <li> The packets are also easy to carry with you traveling.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> So easy to use</li>
            <li> And easy to apply with no smell.</li>
            <li> Easy to take along on trips for a touch up.  </li>
            <li> So easy to apply and</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The TanTowel applies easily and leaves no noticeable smell.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t strong at all</li>
            <li> Just make sure you get the right color!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, easy to use and works very well.  </li>
            <li> The product dries super quick and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Be sure your skin is as clean and smooth to ensure an even tan.</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the best product I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t have the strong smell that most of the tanning products have.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to use and the color comes out smooth without and</li>
            <li> but that is just something that you have to fine  tune.</li>
            <li> I think it will be just fine, or I will use two at a time.</li>
            <li> My best tip is to start in the larger areas first.  </li>
            <li> Tantowel works fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different self tanning products from lotions to sprays to foam, drug store to high end brands and Tan Towel is the best.</li>
            <li> the tan looks very authentic and works pretty quickly but not immediately like stains.  </li>
            <li> I applied the product right after getting a very light tan and it seemed to retain the tan and enhance it.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy your TanTowels...</li>
            <li> Does have a light scent of sunless tanner, but nothing overpowering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very light.</li>
            <li> So if you have any sort of color already or if you are looking for a darker golden color, you will surely need to do two</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use one on Wednesday and another on Saturday morning so that I&#x27;ll look lightly tanned for a Saturday night date.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> No streaking- just a smooth light tan.</li>
            <li> I was not seeing results from the light to medium skin tan towels.  </li>
            <li> While this works for my mom and she loves it and it looks great, I broke out in hives and it took 3 days to stop the itching and that was only one application.</li>
            <li> They work fantastic</li>
            <li> These totally work,  great to add some color for the Summer.</li>

            <li> Good natural tan color with no streaking.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and gets me to a tan that always looks natural.  </li>
            <li> I especially love them in winter when I&#x27;m looking a bit pale.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> They work real well!!!</li>
            <li> I had bought these several years ago and although you have to learn how to use them after a couple of trial runs, the color is fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> Does not turn your skin yellow but tans very nice.  </li>
            <li> very worth it</li>
            <li> #4 easy ,no squeezing out, convenient folded wet towel with perfect amount for entire body# 5 cheap and 1/3 price of Versa tan and can be done in privacy of my own home # 5 results look</li>
            <li> This product does give a nice, realistic, smooth color.</li>
            <li> but Im older and tend to notice pores and imperfections more if I use these more than once on the face</li>
            <li> wonderful, clean solution for pale skin.</li>
            <li> product is easy to apply and the tan appears rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I am fair and have did some major sunning in my teens.  </li>
            <li> It is the most natural tan and soooo easy to apply!</li>
            <li> These go on so easy and give me a nice, natural glow without looking orange.</li>
            <li> So easy, fast and safe.</li>
            <li> Small price to pay for a perfect tan.</li>
            <li> in all, this is a unique, well-working product - but it&#x27;snot without its flaws.</li>
            <li> Always worth it!</li>
            <li> &amp; it dries super quick!</li>
            <li> I find the Tan Towels to have great coverage, no streaking, no odor and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect self-tanner since I was in High School starting with &amp;#34;Q.T. Quick Tan&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> We have not had sun for 5 months, so a little &#x27;pick-me-up tan looks great and makes me feel better.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products but this one works best and looks the most natural for my skin.  </li>
            <li> It looked so easy, and they kept talking about how the smell was so fresh.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tan Towels now (medium-dark shade) for almost a year, and I think they are by far the best solution for tanning as an alternative to going outside, tanning beds, and spray tans.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of different self tanners and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I think that looks more natural and healthy</li>
            <li> Is there any way to clean my palms? 5</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several brands and this one is by far the best!!</li>
            <li> If you are careful and make sure to apply evenly, the result is good.  </li>
            <li> They are quick, easy, mess-free, and super inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I use a little moisturizer around my knees and ankles right after application and it blends flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I think the color adapts to the heat of the skin temperature to provide you with a natural looking tan :) &amp; honestly it leaves such a nice tan &amp; radiant glow</li>
            <li> I start rubbing the pleasantly smelling citrus-scented towelette in circular motions at the top of my legs just under my bikini bottoms, working my way down through all areas of the leg.</li>
            <li> I save them to use for special occasions.  </li>
            <li> This product gives you the right amount of sunkissed glow!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re quick and easy, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Saw the box and went &amp;#34; oh no&amp;#34;!  am very fair Swedish, green eyes...</li>
            <li> these tan towels worked really great and the color was awesome, I still had it a little heavy around the ankles</li>
            <li> I think this product would be good to use for a wedding, special event, or a weekend vacation where you simply want to look tan for a couple days.</li>
            <li> Great product, worked like expected.</li>
            <li> Tan towels do an amazing job at giving you a natural tan without being orange or streaky at all.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than these towels &amp; in my opinion, work MUCH better.</li>
            <li> these are really cool self-tan options.  </li>
            <li> Creates a nice natural color.  </li>
            <li> I use two instead of one, and it lasts almost a full week.</li>
            <li> Both of these are true.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it created a fast tan</li>
            <li> Love them, really work.</li>
            <li> She suggested that even though I am fair and only burn to use the medium/dark color.  </li>
            <li> I have rated this product before on the full body towel pack.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice, natural tan to my face and legs.</li>
            <li> Avoid too much pressure on knees and elbows as they tend to absorb the coloring more.</li>
            <li> No bad smell or staining.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply,  leaves an even natural looking tan and mostly ~ no disgusting smell that lingers.  </li>
            <li> No streaks, no mess, amazing color.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and fast!</li>
            <li> Subtle, I didn&#x27;t look orange, but great!  </li>
            <li> but it fads rather quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second - Be Quick.</li>
            <li> and here&#x27;s why #1 no awful smell like most, actually mimics a spa product</li>
            <li> I wake up take a quick shower and dont exfoliate or moisturize and apply another TanTowel...</li>
            <li> Quick tan</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and has no lingering odor.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, natural looking glow.  </li>
            <li> I was that sure I was going to love these little towels like most everyone else.</li>
            <li> Also I try to do everything else first and then lightly cover knees and elbows.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> They were easy to pack and the half body size is good.</li>
            <li> Easy enough to do on your own and go on very evenly!</li>
            <li> Brought these at my dermatology office first time Really love them thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> The application is easy and fast, not like creams or lotions which I find to be time consuming.</li>
            <li> Awesome and long lasting tan without streaks!</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered!</li>
            <li> It is simple and easy to use, I am able to use one towelette on my face,throat and arms.</li>
            <li> Smells a little, but the color is great and it doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> I get compliments constantly on how nice and golden my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> the look is worth</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t yet used these, it&#x27;s absolutely worth a try.</li>
            <li> In addition, one half-body towelette doesn&#x27;t provide as much color as I would like to achieve - even though I have fair skin, I&#x27;m only five feet tall -</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The smell is distinct so I use them at night and shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> Many compliments on my \\&quot;natural tan\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Gives off a non-streaky, golden tan.</li>
            <li> The most natural color I have found.</li>
            <li> by lunch time I have a golden tan.  </li>
            <li> I used these last spring/summer and really liked them.  </li>
            <li> I think a pretty tan makes you look nice and healthy, but I am not willing to increase my risk of cancer to lay in a tanning bed or the sun to get the pretty tan.  </li>
            <li> Saw Tan Towel advertised on HSN and was very excited for a self tanner that looks natural and does not streak.  </li>
            <li> I have used other products that have worked so much better and smelled better also.</li>
            <li> super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Tan towels make me look live I have been sunbathing before a special occasion!</li>
            <li> You can put your clothes on right away and doesn&#x27;t smell or streak .</li>
            <li> I can lotion up right after, where with spray tan you can&#x27;t put lotion on right away.</li>
            <li> It says to wash hands right after, &amp; I do.</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing actually...</li>
            <li> Used them and on the first warm day wore a white mini and kept getting compliments on my tan.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and very natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and looks natural!</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad at all and my favorite thing about this product is how quickly they dry.  </li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and the spray tans always turn out a bit too dark for me.</li>
            <li> I chose the dark tone and it looks so good on my legs..  </li>
            <li> I use them when I feel like I need to have a little tan and want to smooth out my own skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love how TanTowels give me a little bit of healthy glow.</li>
            <li> they turn out naturally and are easy to apply.</li>
            <li> so easy, and it does look natural</li>
            <li> at regular price, THIS PRODUCT IS MORE THAN WORTH</li>
            <li> Dries super fast too</li>
            <li> The next night I applied another round and had a perfect amount of color.</li>
            <li> These Tan Towels work great, need only apply every third day.&lt;br /&gt;Better</li>
            <li> Super fast delivered.</li>
            <li> One Positive; would be great for travel with small size.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> ; I used ONE towel over full body (5&#x27;4&amp;#34; 140) &amp; felt like I got a decent, not 5 star result.</li>
            <li> They dry super fast and are very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I found the classic is too light and doesn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li> Very natural looking tan!!!</li>
            <li> 😝 My point is, I&#x27;ve been used countless self-tanners for a lot of years &amp; always felt like there could be something better out there.</li>
            <li> First use</li>
            <li> i really like it!</li>
            <li> Pretty even tanning.</li>
            <li> As an avid used of self tanning products, I think I have tried everything on the market.</li>
            <li> eventually smell funny like any self-tan lotion but not when you first use them.  </li>
            <li> i have to order more next month.. got to get my tan on</li>
            <li> First of all, props for no animal testing.</li>
            <li> I had higher hopes for the tan towel....</li>
            <li> still looking for the best fake tan...</li>
            <li> I will say that it does have that self tanner smell at first</li>
            <li> brown the first shower/night.</li>
            <li> I was able to tan my entire body with one towel.</li>
            <li> you apply tan towels correctly, you should achieve a pretty even tan.</li>
            <li> I will order more towels in the future.</li>
            <li> I did my lower legs first, then went up to thighs, it may be that I should used one towel per leg (its</li>
            <li> They are simple to use, safe for skin and clothing.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> They do get a bit streaky looking when they start to wear off, but it&#x27;s still better than being fish belly white while sunning myself on the beach.</li>
            <li> this every other day, and it does not turn orange, but a lovely tanned glow!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Sun is not an option any longer but looking healthy and glowing is possible with Tan Towel!!!!</li>
            <li> These worked very well; I would order them again!</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy more in the future!&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> Be aware though</li>
            <li> Lasts a few days, and one towels is good for both legs and arms.</li>
            <li> They add just the right amount of color without being too much.</li>
            <li> When I woke up the next morning, my white sheets had zero trace of tanner and my tan looked beautiful and natural.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to use, dry quickly</li>
            <li> After having several spots removed by my Dermatologist I got wise to getting an actual sun tan.  </li>
            <li> As the towel gets drier then finish with your feet (less product is needed around the ankles… remember the drier skin absorbs more!).  </li>
            <li> It also gives me a little instant makeover and looks good under my makeup!  </li>
            <li> this really picks up too much color!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this tanning product to anyone who wants a consistent method, washout streaks.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, use all year long just to bring color to my face!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this from my salon ($10 more expensive than Amazon) Love these tan towels.</li>
            <li> These little guys are magic!</li>
            <li> It tans quickly and looks natural.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and dries instantly.  </li>
            <li> Easy, simple.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply via the towetets, plus can cut towels up to do smaller areas.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> I take a shower, exfoliate and apply Pure Aloe Vera Gel or Lotion whatever I have in the morning</li>
            <li> What I love most about this product is that it hardly has the self-tanner smell!  </li>
            <li> Simple, fast and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I am a red head who does not tan very well, but instead burns easily.</li>
            <li> Ok for a quick tan  if you are only needing it to last for the weekend.</li>
            <li> Decent smell, too!</li>
            <li> and the result is a glowing golden natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> No smudging or staining of clothing, it absolutely WILL NOT rub or flake off if you sweat..</li>
            <li> I was hoping these wouldnt be stinky, but they really are.</li>
            <li> Also, if you use creams, gently wipe off knees and elbows which for some reason, tan darker.  </li>
            <li> Also, I use the half-body on my whole body and it is sufficient.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping made it very convenient.</li>
            <li> I have used tanning lotions and they really don&#x27;t hold a candle to tan towels.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very convenient for travel.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but this stuff really works and</li>
            <li> received these towels 2 days after ordering, thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It worked really well.  </li>
            <li> I still really like this product.  </li>
            <li> The self tanner really has a neutral smell to it.</li>
            <li> it also helps to achieve very even color all over the body.</li>
            <li> This is convenient for travel and it seems to add some color but not too much really.  </li>
            <li> I am very please with the product.</li>
            <li> It was much cheaper to buy the product on amazon</li>
            <li> so I bought a whole box.</li>
            <li> I really like Tan Towels</li>
            <li> My legs do not get tan as fast as the rest of body and these do the trick.</li>
            <li> This week I bought &amp; used several times, JERGENS INSTANT SUN MOUSSE &amp; really liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> I thought a fancier brand would be better, but they are certainly not.</li>
            <li> but these give me the right amount of tan to look natural...</li>
            <li> Very easy to use one of our favorite fake bake products to date.</li>
            <li> I was expecting better results though after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> MUCH better than the creams, by a long shot...as far as rub-off, for one.  </li>
            <li> I have used the full body ones and never ran out of enough for my whole body.</li>
            <li> These are super easy and fast to achieve a nice color other than my PALE white...</li>
            <li> Works pretty well and color seems natural looking.</li>
            <li> Good Naked Self-Tan Towelettes create the most natural-looking fake tan I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> The next morning I was expecting a nice golden glow &amp; a noticeable difference, but I was just as pale as before I applied it.  </li>
            <li> One towel handles legs while you will need another for the top half.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I bought the half plus by accident, Glad I got the spray.</li>
            <li> It takes two of these towels to cover my entire body, but I see that there are larger ones that may work better.</li>
            <li> they do a half-way decent job if you&#x27;re in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Low odor and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Kate Somerville Tan Towels a few weeks back and loved them.</li>
            <li> They are super convenient and don&#x27;t have any gross color guides to stain your clothing and bedding.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I think they have such high reviews is because people paid more money for something that you can get at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying that.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them if you are looking for a self-tanner.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and no odor like some other suntan creams.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this productvfor any one who wants a natural looking tan while avoiding the tanning beds.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t once gotten a bad result after months of using them, so I&#x27;m very impressed with the product innovation!</li>
            <li> Color is closest to a real tan that I&#x27;ve tryed so far.</li>
            <li> They give me a very even natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> If you apply this correctly and don&#x27;t miss any spots you will have a very even, natural, looking color.</li>
            <li> it looks very uniform and natural...</li>
            <li> I used them as instructed hoping to see a golden tan by the next day, and saw no results at all.</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and the color isn&#x27;t orange or uneven.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fades like a normal tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> My mom is normally orange by this time of year with all her creams</li>
            <li> /&gt;It definitely helped even out my skin tone and made my skin look bronze / golden.  </li>
            <li> The towels were also kind of dry and not very moist.</li>
            <li> I wrote the company and they stated the product was new from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> They did not offer a refund or a new replacement product.</li>
            <li> I live in Louisiana</li>
            <li> I have been using them for years and wanted to try something new,  </li>
            <li> Your tan will last about 3 days and doesn&#x27;t peel off, it gently fades like a real tan.</li>
            <li> applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towels dry too quickly.</li>
            <li> The next day she went back over her missed parts and it looked fantastic.</li>
            <li> I use vinyl gloves to apply this product and then do my hands last and make sure my palms are carefully washed.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to rub the towels into your skin, firmly and allow the towel to exfoliate some of the old tan off...</li>
            <li> Use lots of broad circular strokes so color doesn&#x27;t distribute too much in one area.</li>
            <li> The tan however, does not last long and you will most likely need to use 3-4 towels to do your whole body and achieve the desired color.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> Very natural look.</li>
            <li> It goes on evenly and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural and not orangy.</li>
            <li> No streak and very natural looking.</li>
            <li> on easily, without the mess of a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One towelette is enough for your whole body!</li>
            <li> I used two the first day and two the second.</li>
            <li> This is the first tannning product that actually works for me......</li>
            <li> It looked natural and wasn&#x27;t streaky at all!</li>
            <li> the color looks natural, but noticeable!</li>
            <li> The first time I used the product I left it on for the suggested 4 hours</li>
            <li> and although I could see a difference, it became apparent that the 4 hour timing worked much</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time several weeks ago.</li>
            <li> While I love this product, I was surprised when I bought 10 that they did not come in the box like others I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> very soft natural look.</li>
            <li> My first application was fast, no steaks and no funny smell.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have have that strong self tanner odor, there&#x27;s very, very slight odor</li>
            <li> That being said, these little towels aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> I love it because if there is areas that are hard to tan or not as evenly tanned, I use it there.</li>
            <li> As soon as you rip open the packaging, unwrap the towel, lay the sheet flat against your palm and go for the largest areas and move quickly in a circular motion, never letting your hand rest in one area for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> smell#2 goes on clear</li>
            <li> For those to young to remember QT, that&#x27;s about 30 years.</li>
            <li> Gives a natural look</li>
            <li> I applied the towlette to my whole body, including my face (I recommend doing your face last) and got into bed immediately after.</li>
            <li> They also blend well with my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> Not messy.</li>
            <li> it sells them for 27.00 a Ten pack, way to much.</li>
            <li> Never messy.</li>
            <li> Color is even and natural with no lingering chemical odor</li>
            <li> no streaking...just a natural glow....</li>
            <li> Natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Ran looks natural.</li>
            <li> color is natural.  </li>
            <li> The color looks natural, not orange-fake.</li>
            <li> Looks so natural.</li>
            <li> My skin had a fairly natural tan look to it</li>
            <li> The only recommendation I have is to scrub your hands after use, as with all self tanners that you use your hands to apply, the solution gets concentrated on your hands and can make them much darker.  </li>
            <li> so no messy brown on sheets#3 dries on in about 3 minutes</li>
            <li> But so far I don&#x27;t see any of that.  </li>
            <li> This will keep the tan looking natural and not splotchy.</li>
            <li> Try it you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Completely blended in with her natural tan.</li>
            <li> I always wear triple digit SPF sunscreen but one day I got lost while hiking in the hot sun and ended up out for three times as long as I thought I would be.  </li>
            <li> Natural and not orange.  </li>
            <li> But it takes nearly 10 of them to achieve this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to using L&#x27;oreal Sublime, and it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li> The tanning product itself does not give much color, especially since they are &amp;#34;Plus&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> i use these instead-so natural looking too-</li>
            <li> I completely exfoliate my skin and shave, then I use it as it says in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried baking soda, lemon juice, and windex.</li>
            <li> Color is ver natural.</li>
            <li> OLD BATCH.</li>
            <li> I am guessing that the batch is old.</li>
            <li> I bought just one towel to try and wow-</li>
            <li> The color for me was a natural looking tan shade as I bought the lighter color to try.</li>
            <li> The color is natural and comes up within hours.  </li>
            <li> and then I&#x27;m ready to go the next day.</li>
            <li> THe color looks natural and one application lasted close to two weeks.  </li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter used it and just lightly wiped the product on and ended up missing spots.  </li>
            <li> Of all the products I&#x27;ve tried, I do rank the Tan Towel as one of the best.  </li>
            <li> Using another towelette does the trick, but again, it comes down to a matter of how much you&#x27;re willing to pay for the convenience and streak-free</li>
            <li> no mess, even color and soft skin.  </li>
            <li> I did my feet very lightly and my toes look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of leg to cover, and it&#x27;s still not dark enough!</li>
            <li> Any places that crease, gets super dark and looks foolish.  </li>
            <li> No mess,</li>
            <li> but they have been the same as the classic: no visible change in my tan.</li>
            <li> After using the Plus I would not bother with ever using the classic again just because my natural skin tone has a base color and the half body or whole body are the best way to go.</li>
            <li> I have used for last two years and I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> The selling points for me were that they claimed to have very little smell and were streak free.</li>
            <li> They usually last a few days and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> They apply easily, and last for a few days.</li>
            <li> Spent less money on Jergen&#x27;s and it works much better.</li>
            <li> I am wiping around my belly button (which hasn&#x27;t seen the light of day in a few years ! )</li>
            <li> They really need to warn dummies like me to use a glove when handling the towelette.&lt;br /&gt;It would also help if they gave a hint as to how long you should wait before putting on clothes.</li>
            <li> I have medium dark skin and these are a sure bet for color, where as some seem to not really show up since I&#x27;m already pretty dark.</li>
            <li> I often use it a day or two in advance for a wedding or special event and people usually assume it&#x27;s a natural tan from a vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without Tan Towels, especially in the winter in Chicago!  </li>
            <li> So anywhere you have really dry spots the product will be darker and really noticeable.  </li>
            <li> This is the third or fourth order of the Tan Towels and they work really well for me.  </li>
            <li> , if your skin is not prepped properly (i.e. scrubbed and free of dead skin) you will end up with patches that are darker.  </li>
            <li> I am white, pale, natural blonde, cotton top, green-eyed, American Honky.</li>
            <li> I have used the Tan Towels for several years and the application looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Third - Broad strokes.</li>
            <li> Tip - if you want just a touch of color on your face, use a towel you have already used to do your upper body as the tanner is mostly used up and will only deposit a small amount on your face.  </li>
            <li> Only a knowledge of the square full body packettes vs the rectangle half body are any indication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am blonde with medium/light olive skin naturally.</li>
            <li> Check first the one I got was for med to dark skin....</li>
            <li> I was nervous when I first purchased them because they were meant for medium to dark skin tone or for a deeper tan.</li>
            <li> Once you open the pack you have about 2 minutes to use the towel before it completely dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really made my legs look like I had spent time at the beach.  </li>
            <li> these last and look natural.</li>
            <li> I do use one complete towelette for my entire body-</li>
            <li> The tan is somewhat \\&quot;orange\\&quot; but that is also more my usual color rather than pink.  </li>
            <li> I have a nice color that does not look fake.</li>
            <li> They are really easy to use, especially if you have someone to wipe the towels on hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I still had my previous now empty box to store these.</li>
            <li> Easy, natural looking, and without the bad smell that comes along with most other self-tanning products or lotions.</li>
            <li> Then with the same size towel, do the other leg in the exact same order.  </li>
            <li> My \\&quot;hint\\&quot; to applying any tan potion on your face is, once applied, use a tissue or Q-tip to gently remove tan potion from nose folds and under your eyes (don&#x27;t want to enhance any dark circles you may have).</li>
            <li> I will go back to using Bare Essentials, Faux Tan...</li>
            <li> The next morning I crawled out of bed and was disappointed/glad to see that I barely had any color.</li>
            <li> I have used Tan Towels for a few years and usually buy them on HSN because of the price difference for the packages but this was a good deal for the plus half body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ridiculously pale and this is the only product I can actually get a great tan and actually look tan, without that fake orangey tint</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;3&amp;#34;, I can use a half body towel for my whole body.</li>
            <li> The palms of your hands might get a little blotchy, but it&#x27;s really nothing too noticable.</li>
            <li> I have used it for several years and I&#x27;ve found it to be less messy and a better quality &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; than other products.</li>
            <li> but always order medium to dark, as this gives me just enough color to make it look natural.  </li>
            <li> These towels really do deliver a golden, realistic tan in the easiest, least messy, least smelly way possible.  </li>
            <li> The color developed quickly and didn&#x27;t look fake or orange.</li>
            <li> Let me first mention I order &amp; review at least 100 items a year.</li>
            <li> once the towel begins to dry, I glob on some of the local department store tanning lotion and redo.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it dry immediately</li>
            <li> I always wear the hair color gloves when applying especially if you have a pink and white manicure or gel or acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> I tested the tan towels a few weeks before my wedding and found that it enhanced my skin color in a very natural way without any streaking or splotches.</li>
            <li> Try to keep your skin dry for as long as possible so as not to disturb the tan that&#x27;s developing.</li>
            <li> You will love them, everyone that I introduce to this product is crazy about it.</li>
            <li> One of my friends shocked me when she told me that she&#x27;s been using them since forever, because I honestly believed that she does in fact have olive skin by default.</li>
            <li> ( I am normal sized and I found that it takes at least 3 towels to do my legs, arms, back, and chest.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no better product for a natural, lasting tan.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The color is not a natural looking tan, so save your money.</li>
            <li> use them all year long</li>
            <li> I have always been tan (and not naturally).</li>
            <li> I have been using tan towels for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive, pale skin</li>
            <li> This goes on with no streaking and very little odor and has a very natural color.  </li>
            <li> They do provide a very natural tan with no streaking so the smell is a small sacrifice for the look.</li>
            <li> i did one side of my body and waited till the next day to see results before doing my other side.</li>
            <li> After trying several other products over the years, I&#x27;ve found my \\&quot;go to \\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> If your skin is dry, chapped or peeling, chances are that the tan will be uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fourth - Let your skin dry.</li>
            <li> You are dry immediately</li>
            <li> my skin is dry and by the end of the day has skin drank up all the Aloe.  </li>
            <li> Wait a couple minutes til I feel dry then put on pj and to bed.  </li>
            <li> The tan only lasts 3 days, so it is expensive to keep my tan looking fresh all the time.  </li>
            <li> I just spent four hours on the beach (minus the red).</li>
            <li> I recommend using scissors to open the towelette, particularly if you have applied lotion on your hands prior to self-tanning, because the packaging is a teeny bit difficult to open.</li>
            <li> So, I bought a couple of the single use packets.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to order the medium to dark towels, even if you&#x27;re not fair skinned like me because the color you get is not intense but enough for a nice, natural look.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a yellow, olive, or even medium skinned person, go with the medium to dark color.</li>
            <li> On average the tan only lasts about two days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t that dark - I used a 3rd packet to achieve a darker color.  </li>
            <li> I recommend loose clothing.</li>
            <li> Here is my low down on this</li>
            <li> The only mistake I made was buying this without realizing it is a half tan towel.  </li>
            <li> Because these are half towels, I have to use two packets for my entire body.  </li>
            <li> My 15 year old did not read the directions and used the towelettes like a bath towel and ended up missing half her legs.</li>
            <li> They did not even make me look a little bit different.</li>
            <li> I used one towel last night on my legs, noticed a little something this morning</li>
            <li> , I think I&#x27;m starting to look a little orangey.</li>
            <li> I reorder it all summer long!!!</li>
            <li> but they have nothing bad to say when I use these tan towels :)</li>
            <li> I keep hoping for a better product that won&#x27;t smell so bad, but haven&#x27;t found anything yet.</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to them...and the price isn&#x27;t too bad either.  :)</li>
            <li> No streaking (just be careful around wrists and elbows-- as with all self tanners).</li>
            <li> The drying time for this product is minimal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for a few months now and can&#x27;t get enough!</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get any streaking and not much of a smell either.</li>
            <li> Just be careful to cover all areas.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO color....</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but I have never bought anything remotely close to this.</li>
            <li> Can see effect after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> When I went through airport security in Boston they pulled me aside and put the chemical detecter all over my body, searched my carry on bag carefully, all because of the smell from the tantowels used the day before.</li>
            <li> if you take your time to cover all areas evenly no one can tell that it is not a real tan</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy, but it does actually produce a tan.</li>
            <li> Be careful who you order from.</li>
            <li> Not much of a smell and even color.</li>
            <li> Because Im naturally Medium skin tone I like to use these to blend in a Tanning Mouse or spray like St Tropez or Fake Bake for some occasions which I find gives a darker natural bronze color without any orange.</li>
            <li> so I ordered the 25 half body pack for medium to dark skin &amp; then put the 100 pack in my Amazon cart for later</li>
            <li> Used 9 applications and realized only a very slight tanning.</li>
            <li> And because I am fairly pale currently, I thought I would get too dark or the tan would look unnatural and orange-y.</li>
            <li> Second use; 2 towels, no better than 1 towel.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> These have not worked as well as other tanning towels I have used.</li>
            <li> every other tanner that I have ever used has.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> There is no \\&quot;rub-off\\&quot; onto clothing, other than MAYBE a tad</li>
            <li> From the way the other reviewers were raving about this; I thought I have found the miracle to stop baking in the sun.</li>
            <li> I usually burn when tanning the traditional ways.</li>
            <li> The scent is not overwhelming and one towel will cover your entire body.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t leave my hands dyed at all like other self tanning creams</li>
            <li> I decided to look at other towel applicator options and came across the Tan Towel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> than any other product I have used,I will purchase them again</li>
            <li> They do give a glow that other tanners do not--</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t noticed any blotch spots that I have had with other tanners.</li>
            <li> I received the wrong color my first shipment and they did replace with correct order and return label.</li>
            <li> The small towels are enough for you to do your face, neck, arms and chest.</li>
            <li> TanTowels are the only solution I&#x27;ve found to achieve a streak-free fake tan on my naturally fair-skinned legs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too dark, and doesn&#x27;t have a smell like other self tanning products.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything and this is a significantly less expensive way to get a similar tan to a spray tan or natural tan without being too dark or getting burned.</li>
            <li> I wish I had only bought one of these as a test, because I hardly can see any difference.</li>
            <li> If you want to achieve a dark tan without going out in the sun, this product will work.</li>
            <li> I bought the dark ones because I am Latin and my skin is olive toned.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> You aren&#x27;t going to look dark, but you will look like you spend time in the sun with a some sunblock.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin but often get lighter than I would like in the wintertime.</li>
            <li> these aren&#x27;t as dark as id like them to be.</li>
            <li> My palms are dark.  </li>
            <li> love this product use it every year to get my base coast before getting out into the sun....</li>
            <li> Using lotion on legs: rub in thoroughly &amp; take it all the way down onto your foot but wipe off heel area...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, and narrowed it down to user error.</li>
            <li> and I still get them because they have yet to let me down.</li>
            <li> Hands down</li>
            <li> You rub them on, no worries about streaks, up or down, circles, whatever the motion.</li>
            <li> For example, for your legs start at the thigh and then move down the leg.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product!</li>
            <li> The towels tend to dry out if you unfold them all the way before applying, so use just small portions of the towel at a time.</li>
            <li> These are thin and somewhat difficult to use as they bunch up and dry up quickly.</li>
            <li> Though it is not unbearable, it has the typical self tanner smell.</li>
            <li> After you shower the smell reduces slightly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 and tanned up until about a year and a half ago (tanning beds).</li>
            <li> without issue in less than five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I typically use these once on Thursday and once Friday</li>
            <li> I tried using the product on half of my body to see if I could see a difference, and nothing.</li>
            <li> towel does not cover half the body.</li>
            <li> I also have some patches of skin that are slightly discolored.</li>
            <li> I did all the normal things when using fake tan and this was just a mess.  </li>
            <li> Yellow hue  not a good product</li>
            <li> There is a little odd smell to them though.</li>
            <li> so you get a little color</li>
            <li> Two days of use and you&#x27;re dark!</li>
            <li> trick is to know how to apply self-tanner, which some people are not familiar with.</li>
            <li> so she needed a little help before taking her Senior pictures.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years to put a little color on my legs.</li>
            <li> The towels gave a little color when I applied a few times in a row.</li>
            <li> I get VERY VERY dark in the summer..</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t smell like other tanning products!!</li>
            <li> I have friends and family that are brutally honest with me when I get a bad fake tan</li>
            <li> well..no messy bottles or tubes to take a chance on leaking in your luggage.  </li>
            <li> if want a self tan that lasts a few days for so.</li>
            <li> Waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Here are a few tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They say it takes a few hours to develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I will let you know in a few days if it streaks off like creams do on me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these things for a few years</li>
            <li> I use them year round a couple of nights a week just before I go to sleep.</li>
            <li> These were a waste of money.</li>
            <li> One hint is to use firm pressure when using the wipes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very careful about using sunscreen throughout the year, and as a result, I&#x27;m very pale.</li>
            <li> As a pale person who has used and abused self tanners for a couple of decades, I&#x27;ve learned a few things about how to apply it.</li>
            <li> im pale ....othereise</li>
            <li> I really like it but its really expensive!  </li>
            <li> Which means it was false advertising, or they were using something else to make them lay flat on your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and if it&#x27;s not easy I won&#x27;t do it .</li>
            <li> Also, they smell pretty bad after drying.</li>
            <li> At least down around the edge.  </li>
            <li> A little expensive but will last awhile.</li>
            <li> However, with the price what it is, I can not see using this product several times a week year round, as it would be way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Least odor of any sunless tanning towels I&#x27;ve used - and the half body covered my legs, arms, and face.  </li>
            <li> I can find them for a little bit cheaper!</li>
            <li> : you have to go all the way down to the bottom of your feet!!</li>
            <li> so small you need three to do the job of one and</li>
            <li> Was not really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It takes several applications, thus, expensive.</li>
            <li> And I am an Irish girl that always looks orange with fake tanner</li>
            <li> Never have to worry about going on vacation with pale skin!</li>
            <li> Was going on a cruise and wanted a base and used for several weeks prior.</li>
            <li> very pale and tried a sample packet of the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I use the darker towels even though I&#x27;m very pale</li>
            <li> negative, similar to but not as bad as my previous experience with liquid bottled lotion, DO STILL  GET SOME DISCOLORATION  OF HAIR.</li>
            <li> The towel bunches up &amp; is hard to apply evenly.  </li>
            <li> fairly natural looking and doesn&#x27;t smell bad</li>
            <li> You will need to use at least 3 of them.</li>
            <li> They work yet the color is subtle.</li>
            <li> I wish they were less expensive though.</li>
            <li> that wasn&#x27;t orange or any other artificial looking color.  </li>
            <li> would not use this on my face, at least not until I perfected the application technique!</li>
            <li> I got a nasty sunburn which faded to a tan with bad tan lines from my tank top and sports bra.  </li>
            <li> Not true, they smelled awful and the towelettes did not lay flat on your skin when applying like they showed on TV.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 2 times, and am not happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it does look orange-ie, not as bad as other self tanners, but you still get the orange hue.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how subtle the color appeared on my skin and without the stinky sunless tanner product smell!</li>
            <li> I use self tanning lotion regularly, but I&#x27;m very bad at preventing streaks from developing on my legs.</li>
            <li> , I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money here :(</li>
            <li> Mediocre results.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> This is the only self tanning product i found that doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes and doesn&#x27;t smell totally terrible.</li>
            <li> People don&#x27;t want to associate fake tans with the color orange.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> like I have a fake tan.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the expensive brands and they streak with leaving me look orange.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have been buying these ever since.</li>
            <li> Still being skeptical, I bought another towelette to try again and</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every lotion and spray with disappointing results</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go crazy tanning and 2 towels over 2 days</li>
            <li> Streaked like crazy</li>
            <li> it workd great.no orange color or bad smell</li>
            <li> Did not smell bad or leave streaks.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any sort of bad odor like some have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> Not orange or bad coloring.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in how streaky this came out.  </li>
            <li> I bought these through HS# because of all the reviews but was very much disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I hate paying for mystic at the salon, so I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t have a base tan at all.  </li>
            <li> I found it to streak very badly.  </li>
            <li> Please do not hesitate to try this product, you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Besides I always burn anyways and that makes me miserable</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is by far the best self tanner I have ever used. The color does not look orange. I buy a box of these about once a month</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I am fair skinned and the spray tans always turn out a bit too dark for me. This product gives you the right amount of sunkissed glow!</li>
            <li> I am white, pale, natural blonde, cotton top, green-eyed, American Honky. I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect self-tanner since I was in High School starting with &amp;#34;Q.T. Quick Tan&amp;#34;. For those to young to remember QT, that&#x27;s about 30 years. 😝 My point is, I&#x27;ve been used countless self-tanners for a lot of years &amp; always felt like there could be something better out there. So... I turned to Amazon &amp; relied on reviews. This product seemed to be the overwhelming favorite so I ordered the 25 half body pack for medium to dark skin &amp; then put the 100 pack in my Amazon cart for later cause I was that sure I was going to love these little towels like most everyone else. Let me first mention I order &amp; review at least 100 items a year. I admittedly tend to give 5 stars for products on Amazon (&amp;Yelp). This product is the exception&lt;br /&gt;&amp; hears why;&lt;br /&gt;1) First use; I used ONE towel over full body (5&#x27;4&amp;#34; 140) &amp; felt like I got a decent, not 5 star result. I was hopeful 2 towels would be a 5 star result.&lt;br /&gt;2) Second use; 2 towels, no better than 1 towel.&lt;br /&gt;3) Every Use After; Nothing amazing. Mediocre results. I won&#x27;t comment on streaking or consistency as I think any deficiency in the product is user error.&lt;br /&gt;4) One Positive; would be great for travel with small size.&lt;br /&gt;So... Dejected. I stopped using &amp; savedy tensing towels for travel. This week I bought &amp; used several times, JERGENS INSTANT SUN MOUSSE &amp; really liked it a lot. That will be my go-to sunless tanner. It&#x27;s a mousse with a bronzer so you get a little color while the tanner &amp;#34;blooms&amp;#34;. I highly recommend trying that. Much cheaper than these towels &amp; in my opinion, work MUCH better.</li>
            <li> These are the best i have used . Gives a natural look</li>
            <li> These have not worked as well as other tanning towels I have used. Also, they smell pretty bad after drying.</li>
            <li> I love these towels.  I actually wear rubber gloves when applying.  once the towel begins to dry, I glob on some of the local department store tanning lotion and redo.  color goes on beautifully too.  I get compliments constantly on how nice and golden my skin looks.  I use them year around.</li>
            <li> I swear by Tantowels...they turn out naturally and are easy to apply. I apply 1 half-body towel to my legs and stomach, then another half-body to my arms, back and chest. I&#x27;ve found that using two half-body towelettes instead of one full-body works a lot better. The towels tend to dry out if you unfold them all the way before applying, so use just small portions of the towel at a time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these towlettes! They are quick, easy, mess-free, and super inexpensive. If you are considering buying these, do not hesitate. They are AWESOME. A friend of mine purchased these through HSN and gave me one to try because she was obssessing over them. I finally tried it one night and I was so impressed. One towelette is enough for your whole body! Not to mention, you don&#x27;t get any streaks and the color pay-off is so amazing. I applied the towlette to my whole body, including my face (I recommend doing your face last) and got into bed immediately after. When I woke up the next morning, my white sheets had zero trace of tanner and my tan looked beautiful and natural. The palms of your hands might get a little blotchy, but it&#x27;s really nothing too noticable. Small price to pay for a perfect tan.</li>
            <li> this is the second time I ordered this season..i really like it! so easy, and it does look natural..definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> These are amazing tanning towels.  They provide just enough cover to look like you have been in the sun.  They also blend well with my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> Good product. Easier than creams or lotions. Not messy. Pretty even tanning. A little expensive but will last awhile. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this product, use all year long just to bring color to my face! Boyfriend introduced me to this product!</li>
            <li> Great! Exactly as ordered! Have been using tantowel for many years!</li>
            <li> Used 9 applications and realized only a very slight tanning.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.  I&#x27;ve used for two years and the end results are great.</li>
            <li> so small you need three to do the job of one and im skinny! and it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> By far, the best tanning choice in the ever increasing tanning market.  Easy to use and the result is a glowing golden natural looking tan.  An excellent product.  Buy it !!!</li>
            <li> Best natural looking, easiest to apply tan on the market</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I love tan towels. Never have to worry about going on vacation with pale skin! Any time of year, and so easy to use. Not a big fan of the scent, but the look is worth it&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> So far the best safe tanning item I&#x27;ve used. Go&#x27;s on even with no streaking. Color is closest to a real tan that I&#x27;ve tryed so far. Will continue to buy. Best price on this item is here at Amazon, paid around 18.00 for 10 compared to ULTA here locally which it sells them for 27.00 a Ten pack, way to much. Great item and the company is great.</li>
            <li> Does not turn your skin yellow but tans very nice.  It is simple and easy to use, I am able to use one towelette on my face,throat and arms.</li>
            <li> I always have Tan Towels on hand.  I love the color they give me and they do not streak or get on my clothing.  They usually last a few days and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> I applied the product right after getting a very light tan and it seemed to retain the tan and enhance it.  The tan is somewhat \\&quot;orange\\&quot; but that is also more my usual color rather than pink.  I&#x27;ll probably continue to use it the rest of the winter but I don&#x27;t expect it will appear too deep a color.  But that&#x27;s okay.  So if you want a glow, buy this.</li>
            <li> Was not really pleased with this product. I gave it away. My friend likes them though. It didn&#x27;t work very good on me.</li>
            <li> Brought these at my dermatology office first time Really love them thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> No streaks, no mess, amazing color. The only downside, the smell. Though it is not unbearable, it has the typical self tanner smell. However, for the results, I do not mind. You can wear it at night, and be tanned in the morning. After you shower the smell reduces slightly.</li>
            <li> These are so great and produce a beautiful tan that does not cause any danger to your skin!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Favorite self tanning towels. No streaking and pleasant smell.  I especially love them in winter when I&#x27;m looking a bit pale.</li>
            <li> The best thing since the tanning bed! Even better!! I&#x27;m 26 and tanned up until about a year and a half ago (tanning beds). I came across Tan Towels on a clearance rack at Ulta, and thought.. \\&quot;hmm.. it&#x27;s worh a shot!\\&quot; So, I bought a couple of the single use packets. I couldn&#x27;t believe the results!! One of my girlfriends was with me and she had bought a couple too. I came into work the next day and she asked me if I had been in the tanning bed. I said.. \\&quot;TAN TOWEL!!\\&quot;.. She couldn&#x27;t believe the beautiful shade of my skin! I am blonde with medium/light olive skin naturally. I get VERY VERY dark in the summer.. and I use the medium/dark tan towels. Now, remember.. it&#x27;s just now spring.. and I had gone MONTHS without any exposure to the sun.. etc. I used the dark/medium shade and it gave me the perfect coloring! If you&#x27;re a yellow, olive, or even medium skinned person, go with the medium to dark color. I cannot say it enough.. the product is WONDERFUL!!! I have used probably 30 different self tanners in the winter when I wasn&#x27;t tanning and NOTHING compares to this. No streaking (just be careful around wrists and elbows-- as with all self tanners). No smudging or staining of clothing, it absolutely WILL NOT rub or flake off if you sweat.. every other tanner that I have ever used has.&lt;br /&gt;Even at regular price, THIS PRODUCT IS MORE THAN WORTH IT!! Two days of use and you&#x27;re dark! What I do is shower and then apply the tan towels. It works best on super clean skin (no lotions). To maintain your gorgeous color, use every couple of days. These things are the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely IN LOVE with this product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ericka Ashley</li>
            <li> I used tan towels for my February destination wedding. I am fair skinned and have lots of freckles. I considered spray tanning but then I heard about tan towels. I tested the tan towels a few weeks before my wedding and found that it enhanced my skin color in a very natural way without any streaking or splotches. I applied tan towels twice just before my wedding and felt like I looked glowing. They are really easy to use, especially if you have someone to wipe the towels on hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> I was hoping these wouldnt be stinky, but they really are. I asked friends if they could smell it. They said no. But when I asked my mom she said &amp;#34;ummm yeah your reak!&amp;#34;. I noticed the smell always when i have used them. BLAH!  the color is nice so if you dont mind smelling like spray tan go for it! Really easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest Sally Hansen&#x27;s spray on nylons. THEY ARE A LIFE SAVER!!! they dont wash off unless you use soap annnnd they do not smell, at all!</li>
            <li> We have not had sun for 5 months, so a little &#x27;pick-me-up tan looks great and makes me feel better.  This is easy, quick and looks great.</li>
            <li> These wipes work well for me.  I use them when I feel like I need to have a little tan and want to smooth out my own skin tone.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve found. Smells a little, but the color is great and it doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> Love tan towels. Never messy.</li>
            <li> Tried many self tanners and these are by far the best out there.  Color is even and natural with no lingering chemical odor</li>
            <li> TAN TOWELS ARE THE ONLY SUNLESS SKIN CARE I USE</li>
            <li> Tan Towels are a must they give a a nice bronzed glow, they are easy to use and have a light pleasant scent...received great compliments on my tan!</li>
            <li> As an avid used of self tanning products, I think I have tried everything on the market. These were recommended to me and I&#x27;m sold! They&#x27;re easy to use and the color comes out smooth without and obvious discolorations (ankles, wrists, etc.) It takes two of these towels to cover my entire body, but I see that there are larger ones that may work better. No smell, and washes off your hands easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Tan Towels for several years. They&#x27;re easy to use, dry quickly so you can get dressed without waiting around.  There is no \\&quot;rub-off\\&quot; onto clothing, other than MAYBE a tad but it will be gone once you launder. MUCH better than the creams, by a long shot...as far as rub-off, for one.  I&#x27;m very fair but always order medium to dark, as this gives me just enough color to make it look natural.  I like to get the smaller towels...the larger ones seem a waste b/c I can cover my whole body (I am size 2) with one, plus do my face. Sometimes I will wait til it dries and use another Towel or some of their lotion.  I&#x27;ve used the TanTowels cream and spray, as well. Great to use in between or if you run out of TanTowels. The Tan Towels \\&quot;travel\\&quot; well..no messy bottles or tubes to take a chance on leaking in your luggage.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to order the medium to dark towels, even if you&#x27;re not fair skinned like me because the color you get is not intense but enough for a nice, natural look. My \\&quot;hint\\&quot; to applying any tan potion on your face is, once applied, use a tissue or Q-tip to gently remove tan potion from nose folds and under your eyes (don&#x27;t want to enhance any dark circles you may have). Also, if you use creams, gently wipe off knees and elbows which for some reason, tan darker.  Using lotion on legs: rub in thoroughly &amp; take it all the way down onto your foot but wipe off heel area...this really picks up too much color!  Enjoy your TanTowels...they&#x27;re quick and easy, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> You definitely need to wear gloves when applying the towelette. It will also streak if you try to cover every part of your body which means one towelette just is not enough to do the job. You will need to use at least 3 of them. If you want to achieve a dark tan without going out in the sun, this product will work. Just use gloves to apply and use more than one towelette on the area.</li>
            <li> these are really cool self-tan options.  eventually smell funny like any self-tan lotion but not when you first use them.  wont stain hands.  the tan looks very authentic and works pretty quickly but not immediately like stains.  very worth it if want a self tan that lasts a few days for so.</li>
            <li> Works great - looks like a natural tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years...people think I sunbathe....which I haven&#x27;t done in decades...but these give me the right amount of tan to look natural...no streaking...just a natural glow....love them</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought it would be good. However, I see no benefit in using this item.  I got no tan from it.  I recently saw a website that reviews tan products and their review was the same as my experience. It goes on easy but you get no noticeable tan. I only wished I had seen that website before I ordered this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great self tanning product.  It goes on evenly with no streaks.  I always use medical gloves to avoid any extra color on my hands.  It tans quickly and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Natural looking tan. Easy to apply. Does not smear or bleed. Will definitely buy this product again. Reapply ever 3-5 days depending on intensity of tan desired. Favorite self tanner ever.</li>
            <li> i have to order more next month.. got to get my tan on</li>
            <li> First of all, props for no animal testing. If you haven&#x27;t yet used these, it&#x27;s absolutely worth a try. I use self tanning lotion regularly, but I&#x27;m very bad at preventing streaks from developing on my legs. I&#x27;ve tried everything, and narrowed it down to user error. TanTowels are the only solution I&#x27;ve found to achieve a streak-free fake tan on my naturally fair-skinned legs. I haven&#x27;t once gotten a bad result after months of using them, so I&#x27;m very impressed with the product innovation! That being said, these little towels aren&#x27;t cheap. Compared to most self-tanning lotions available to U.S. customers, you&#x27;re going to pay a markup for TanTowels, no matter who your vendor is. In addition, one half-body towelette doesn&#x27;t provide as much color as I would like to achieve - even though I have fair skin, I&#x27;m only five feet tall - I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of leg to cover, and it&#x27;s still not dark enough! If I had to judge, I&#x27;d say application of one half-body towelette makes my skin one shade darker. Using another towelette does the trick, but again, it comes down to a matter of how much you&#x27;re willing to pay for the convenience and streak-free look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of application, the instructions - found on the box and on the back of each towelette - are fairly simple. I recommend using scissors to open the towelette, particularly if you have applied lotion on your hands prior to self-tanning, because the packaging is a teeny bit difficult to open. I start rubbing the pleasantly smelling citrus-scented towelette in circular motions at the top of my legs just under my bikini bottoms, working my way down through all areas of the leg. I rub the towelette, again in circular motions, along the tops of my feet, but I avoid tanning the sides of my feet or the toes. The drying time for this product is minimal. You can come in contact with furniture, clothes, etc. without issue in less than five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a unique, well-working product - but it&#x27;snot without its flaws. I give this 4 stars, not because of the price, but because of the insufficient color deposit.</li>
            <li> I had higher hopes for the tan towel....streaks  just like all the others but it doesn&#x27;t have an orange glow..still looking for the best fake tan...</li>
            <li> Work great! I buy these all the time!</li>
            <li> Check first the one I got was for med to dark skin....im pale ....othereise it workd great.no orange color or bad smell</li>
            <li> These Tan Towels are amazing!  One towel does my face and body.  The product dries super quick and smells nice. In a couple of hours I have a very nice, natural looking tan.  I took them traveling recently, no worries about something spilling.&lt;br /&gt;I will only be buying Tan Towels from now on.</li>
            <li> I love these! They add just the right amount of color without being too much. Easy enough to do on your own and go on very evenly! Be sure to wash off your hands immediately!</li>
            <li> This is the only self tanning product i found that doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes and doesn&#x27;t smell totally terrible. Your tan will last about 3 days and doesn&#x27;t peel off, it gently fades like a real tan. You can also apply back to back days to deepen the color.</li>
            <li> I first saw these on one of the shopping channels and thought what a great idea! It looked so easy, and they kept talking about how the smell was so fresh. Not true, they smelled awful and the towelettes did not lay flat on your skin when applying like they showed on TV. Which means it was false advertising, or they were using something else to make them lay flat on your skin. I bought the dark ones because I am Latin and my skin is olive toned. They did not even make me look a little bit different. I have used other products that have worked so much better and smelled better also. I will go back to using Bare Essentials, Faux Tan...not that works great,</li>
            <li> super fast shipping! great price too!!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of self tanner products and this is the best one I have ever tried!  I do love this product!  I will say that it does have that self tanner smell at first but it fads rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tan Towels now (medium-dark shade) for almost a year, and I think they are by far the best solution for tanning as an alternative to going outside, tanning beds, and spray tans. I have tried everything and this is a significantly less expensive way to get a similar tan to a spray tan or natural tan without being too dark or getting burned. I typically use these once on Thursday and once Friday so I can be tan for the weekend. Also, I use the half-body on my whole body and it is sufficient.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is easy to apply and dries instantly.  Creates a nice natural color.  Fast shipping made it very convenient.</li>
            <li> Has an unpleasent smell</li>
            <li> Easy, simple.  The color lasts about three days.  It&#x27;s not too dark, and doesn&#x27;t have a smell like other self tanning products.</li>
            <li> Great product, worked like expected. Goes on easy, nice scent.</li>
            <li> I love tan towels.  They give me a very even natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Love  them,  they work great</li>
            <li> From the way the other reviewers were raving about this; I thought I have found the miracle to stop baking in the sun. I have used it twice and found it to be just &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;.  Yes, it does look orange-ie, not as bad as other self tanners, but you still get the orange hue. Any places that crease, gets super dark and looks foolish.  i did one side of my body and waited till the next day to see results before doing my other side. I did my feet very lightly and my toes look ridiculous. I may give another coat to see if it helps to &amp;#34;Blend&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Ran looks natural. Application is easy.</li>
            <li> Have used for years. Great product.</li>
            <li> Use all the time.  Covers evenly....color is natural.  No greasy residue.  Can put on clothes immediately.  This is a great product</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with this product. I used them as instructed hoping to see a golden tan by the next day, and saw no results at all. I was nervous when I first purchased them because they were meant for medium to dark skin tone or for a deeper tan. And because I am fairly pale currently, I thought I would get too dark or the tan would look unnatural and orange-y. Instead, I saw no results whatsoever. I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought so many. Waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Easy to apply. Great color quickly! Smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming and the color isn&#x27;t orange or uneven.</li>
            <li> This tan towel does not make you orange. However it will turn your white towel brown and your sheets brown the first shower/night. I got a brown towel and a brown sheet to cover the bed to solve that problem. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> streaky &amp; they do leave an odor. they do a half-way decent job if you&#x27;re in a pinch. now that I&#x27;ve tried them, I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have used it for several years and I&#x27;ve found it to be less messy and a better quality &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; than other products.</li>
            <li> If  you can&#x27;t get in the sun, this is the best suntan you can get.  Easy to apply and no odor like some other suntan creams.</li>
            <li> I really like it but its really expensive!  I think I would buy more of them if they were cheaper.</li>
            <li> I never thought that I would ever use a product like this, but it is very easy. I use two instead of one, and it lasts almost a full week. The color looks natural, not orange-fake.</li>
            <li> wonderful, clean solution for pale skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! Looks so natural. My friends thought I went away.</li>
            <li> Really good if you use 4 towels. I used two the first day and two the second. Fades in about 3 days, but easy to use. I should mention I have very light skin. I usually burn when tanning the traditional ways.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with this product. Will let you know more after I have used it for a while . Thank You</li>
            <li> I wont use anythibg else. This product has kept me OUT of the Sun and yet i can still maintain a&lt;br /&gt;beautiful bronze glow!!!</li>
            <li> Love getting a tan for special occasions and not have to sit in the sun to do it!  Tan towels make me look live I have been sunbathing before a special occasion!</li>
            <li> Ordered these to use before a trip to Nuevo Vallarta.  I was so impressed with how they went on so easily and did such a great, job.  Subtle, I didn&#x27;t look orange, but great!  I did wash my hands really well each time after using and never had a problem with them staining my hands - an awesome product!</li>
            <li> Love tantowel. Does have a light scent of sunless tanner, but nothing overpowering. These go on so easy and give me a nice, natural glow without looking orange.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these! I&#x27;ve been using them for a few months now and can&#x27;t get enough! I&#x27;m ridiculously pale and this is the only product I can actually get a great tan and actually look tan, without that fake orangey tint, it&#x27;s wonderful. I have friends and family that are brutally honest with me when I get a bad fake tan but they have nothing bad to say when I use these tan towels :)</li>
            <li> I would recommend this tanning product to anyone who wants a consistent method, washout streaks.  The color is not orange when your done!</li>
            <li> Followed the directions and applied the product.  My skin had a fairly natural tan look to it that wasn&#x27;t orange or any other artificial looking color.  The &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; lasted about a week so if you want to keep up appearances over the summer, buy in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints is that you change the color of this box.  Why is it orange?  People don&#x27;t want to associate fake tans with the color orange.</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as I expected. Had to use multiple towels to get an even tan on entire body. Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> use them for over 20 years!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different self tanning products from lotions to sprays to foam, drug store to high end brands and Tan Towel is the best. The application is easy and fast, not like creams or lotions which I find to be time consuming. It doesn&#x27;t have have that strong self tanner odor, there&#x27;s very, very slight odor but it&#x27;s not unpleasant. I followed the directions and it dried fast. I was able to tan my entire body with one towel. The color developed quickly and didn&#x27;t look fake or orange. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and plan on re-ordering this product in the future. It came quickly, undamaged, and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a quick, pretty even, and cheap tan, Tan Towels is a great option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to know how to apply self-tanner, which some people are not familiar with. As a pale person who has used and abused self tanners for a couple of decades, I&#x27;ve learned a few things about how to apply it. Here are a few tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First - Cleanse and Exfoliate. Be sure your skin is as clean and smooth to ensure an even tan. Also be sure your skin is moisturized! If your skin is dry, chapped or peeling, chances are that the tan will be uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second - Be Quick. As soon as you rip open the packaging, unwrap the towel, lay the sheet flat against your palm and go for the largest areas and move quickly in a circular motion, never letting your hand rest in one area for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third - Broad strokes. Use lots of broad circular strokes so color doesn&#x27;t distribute too much in one area. Remember to keep that hand moving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth - Let your skin dry. Some people only wait 5-10 minutes and then put their clothes on. Wait longer and let the skin absorb the product before putting on clothes. I recommend loose clothing. Try to keep your skin dry for as long as possible so as not to disturb the tan that&#x27;s developing. They say it takes a few hours to develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to wash your hands immediately afterward with soap and water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you apply tan towels correctly, you should achieve a pretty even tan. I often use it a day or two in advance for a wedding or special event and people usually assume it&#x27;s a natural tan from a vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to pick the correct shade as if you pick one a lot darker than yours, there is a chance of getting that orange-y color.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of different self tanners and this one is by far the best. Not only does it dry immediately but it does not have the smell that most self tanners have. I found the classic is too light and doesn&#x27;t do much but the plus is perfect ( and I am pretty fair).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this several times now, and have not noticed a change in my skin color. I tried using the product on half of my body to see if I could see a difference, and nothing. I wrote the company and they stated the product was new from the manufacturer. They did not offer a refund or a new replacement product. I will not be ordering again.</li>
            <li> We love tan towels! They work yet the color is subtle. They are easy to apply. Since I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;3&amp;#34;, I can use a half body towel for my whole body. The smell is distinct so I use them at night and shower in the morning. Always worth it!</li>
            <li> Ok for a quick tan  if you are only needing it to last for the weekend. I was expecting better results though after reading other reviews. Here is my low down on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Goes on easily, without the mess of a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fades like a normal tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Does not last. On average the tan only lasts about two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One towel does not cover half the body. ( I am normal sized and I found that it takes at least 3 towels to do my legs, arms, back, and chest.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive. If you only had to use one towel each time, the price might be affordable, but since you must use several towels each time and the tan only lasts about 2 days, it can be quite expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very light. The tan you get from one use is a very light tan. So if you have any sort of color already or if you are looking for a darker golden color, you will surely need to do two applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towels dry too quickly. Once you open the pack you have about 2 minutes to use the towel before it completely dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;This product is easy to apply and the tan appears rather quickly. The tan however, does not last long and you will most likely need to use 3-4 towels to do your whole body and achieve the desired color. I think this product would be good to use for a wedding, special event, or a weekend vacation where you simply want to look tan for a couple days. However, with the price what it is, I can not see using this product several times a week year round, as it would be way too expensive.</li>
            <li> These are truly amazing.  I have used tanning lotions and they really don&#x27;t hold a candle to tan towels.  I have been using these for 3 years and I still get them because they have yet to let me down. Always a streak free aplication giving me and even tone all around!  The only recommendation I have is to scrub your hands after use, as with all self tanners that you use your hands to apply, the solution gets concentrated on your hands and can make them much darker.  Or wear gloves when applying!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this from my salon ($10 more expensive than Amazon) Love these tan towels. Read the directions on application. My 15 year old did not read the directions and used the towelettes like a bath towel and ended up missing half her legs. The next day she went back over her missed parts and it looked fantastic. Does not leave you looking like you got a spray tan or a baked dorito (tanning bed) it&#x27;s a nice light tan. Lasts almost a week. I&#x27;m fair skinned and it looked natural on me. Takes 24 hours to truly develop. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I love these.  Safer than the sun and in 2 uses I noticed a nice even color to my light skin.  There is a little odd smell to them though.</li>
            <li> These towels really do deliver a golden, realistic tan in the easiest, least messy, least smelly way possible.  One towel handles legs while you will need another for the top half.  Tip - if you want just a touch of color on your face, use a towel you have already used to do your upper body as the tanner is mostly used up and will only deposit a small amount on your face.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I got these in a timely manner and they were wrapped up great...love this product use it every year to get my base coast before getting out into the sun....easy to use</li>
            <li> Great product very fast shipping. Best price</li>
            <li> I am very white and I don&#x27;t tan easily so I have always used tanning products.  This is, hands down, the best product I&#x27;ve found.  It is so easy to use and I actually get compliments on my tan!</li>
            <li> These are my fave... You can put your clothes on right away and doesn&#x27;t smell or streak . I&#x27;ve tried everything and if it&#x27;s not easy I won&#x27;t do it . I&#x27;d get these auto delivered and for me that says a lot</li>
            <li> Just try them. You will love them, everyone that I introduce to this product is crazy about it. Just make sure you get the right color!</li>
            <li> I got this based on the good reviews &amp; ease of use.  I used this according to directions &amp; rubbed the towel in circular motions on my legs.  The next morning I was expecting a nice golden glow &amp; a noticeable difference, but I was just as pale as before I applied it.  Saw no difference whatsoever.  Waste of money.  &amp; its not as easy to use as it says. The towel bunches up &amp; is hard to apply evenly.  Will not use again &amp; would not recommend.  I&#x27;ll stick with self tanning lotion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years. Never streaks or turns orange. Many compliments on my \\&quot;natural tan\\&quot;. After trying several other products over the years, I&#x27;ve found my \\&quot;go to \\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> After trying several self tanners last summer, I ran across these on MSN and decided to try them.  The selling points for me were that they claimed to have very little smell and were streak free. Both of these are true. Found them on Amazon and ordered the towelettes and the spray.  The towels will cover the face, arms and torso nicely.  I use the spray to re-wet the towel and finish up on my legs.  The tan isn&#x27;t instant because there is no bronzer in this product.  Of all the products I&#x27;ve tried, I do rank the Tan Towel as one of the best.  Easy to apply,  leaves an even natural looking tan and mostly ~ no disgusting smell that lingers.  The scent is very light that has citrus notes but after applying it, you honestly don&#x27;t smell like you&#x27;ve come from the gym with that sweaty smell so many self tanners leaves you with.  I&#x27;ve re-purchased for the 3rd time and will recommend these towels to anyone using self tanners.  They&#x27;re very convenient for travel.  I use vinyl gloves to apply this product and then do my hands last and make sure my palms are carefully washed.  Works great!</li>
            <li> These towelettes give me a nice, light, even tan.  It looks very natural.  There is no fragrance.  The tan only lasts 3 days, so it is expensive to keep my tan looking fresh all the time.  I save them to use for special occasions.  I&#x27;ll use one on Wednesday and another on Saturday morning so that I&#x27;ll look lightly tanned for a Saturday night date.</li>
            <li> These little guys are magic! The scent is not overwhelming and one towel will cover your entire body. I&#x27;ve used on my face and have never had a problem with breakouts. They apply evenly and last. Great delivery timing as well. I am very pleased!!! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I love the ease of application and the eveness of the color. I chose the dark tone and it looks so good on my legs..  Great product! I&#x27;m not going back to the cream or the spray.  Dries super fast too</li>
            <li> While this is not messy and order free, the color is to too faint. It takes several applications, thus, expensive.</li>
            <li> Nice tan that doesn&#x27;t wash away</li>
            <li> Quick easy way to get a non streaky glowing tan!  Recommend to people best tan towel on market. No need for tanning booth</li>
            <li> Easy to use and looks natural! Lasts a few days, and one towels is good for both legs and arms. Decent smell, too! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Only product that doesn&#x27;t break my face out</li>
            <li> From someone who has tried every kind of spray tan or tanning lotion there is.......Hands down they are the best and here&#x27;s why #1 no awful smell like most, actually mimics a spa product smell#2 goes on clear so no messy brown on sheets#3 dries on in about 3 minutes #4 easy ,no squeezing out, convenient folded wet towel with perfect amount for entire body# 5 cheap and 1/3 price of Versa tan and can be done in privacy of my own home # 5 results look great looks like a real tan</li>
            <li> I am ordering more!  Very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, pale skin and I never go out in the sun, so these towels work great. I don&#x27;t get any streaking and not much of a smell either.</li>
            <li> This is the third or fourth order of the Tan Towels and they work really well for me.  I will order more towels in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve introduced several friends to Tan Towels and I like them okay but I don&#x27;t enjoy the smell. They do provide a very natural tan with no streaking so the smell is a small sacrifice for the look.</li>
            <li> I used one towel last night on my legs, noticed a little something this morning so I decided to use another towel.  Note to self: you have to go all the way down to the bottom of your feet!! At least down around the edge.  (I just looked and my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; stops about 1/4 inch from the bottom of my foot! It&#x27;s noticeable but can be dealt with) Don&#x27;t forget to go in between your toes also!! I did do the top of my feet, but I guess I thought the product would distribute itself evenly - it doesn&#x27;t, so you have to get all the nooks and crannies of your feet if you plan on wearing sandals etc. (which I imagine is the case  :)&lt;br /&gt;Now that I look again, I think I&#x27;m starting to look a little orangey. Probably didn&#x27;t need that second towel....&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be working best on my lower legs. I did my lower legs first, then went up to thighs, it may be that I should used one towel per leg (its okay though, I wear knee length shorts so....) I am wiping around my belly button (which hasn&#x27;t seen the light of day in a few years ! ) just to see.....haven&#x27;t seen anything there yet. I haven&#x27;t used it on my arms or anywhere else because I&#x27;m in the testing phase.&lt;br /&gt;I would not use this on my face, at least not until I perfected the application technique!</li>
            <li> Love these... they are soooo easy to use and not too smelly.  Definitely one of the best ones out there.</li>
            <li> I must say that this product looks alot better than any of the creams.  I applied one towel yesterday and another today and am happy with the touch of color I have for my upcoming vacation.  My mom is normally orange by this time of year with all her creams and I had to tell her this year that she looked great...she was using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So 2 reviews in this one of 5 starts.  I will let you know in a few days if it streaks off like creams do on me.  But so far I don&#x27;t see any of that.  Very easy to apply...didn&#x27;t leave my hands dyed at all like other self tanning creams do at times.  I like it for the money and the quickness and the NON orange color!</li>
            <li> it was great, and easy. gives you some color.</li>
            <li> This is my second season using tan towels.  They are simple to use, safe for skin and clothing.  easy to match any existing tan.  I use them to even out golf tan.</li>
            <li> Smells good, easy to use, just a bit on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> Like this product very much!!!!  I reorder it all summer long!!!</li>
            <li> Saw these on HSN I believe, and wanted to try them. Basically, I buy everything on amazon and when I found them here I bought. The color is great, but you do not need to apply more than twice a week. If you&#x27;re applying more than that, your skin exfoliates at differing degrees and you get the splotchy look. Make sure to rub the towels into your skin, firmly and allow the towel to exfoliate some of the old tan off... This will keep the tan looking natural and not splotchy.</li>
            <li> No streaking- just a smooth light tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a while. They do the job. When used inconjuction with the 8 ounce tanning mist...even better.</li>
            <li> This is a product I&#x27;ve used before.  I&#x27;ve used other self tanning products but find this is the best one for my life style.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
            <li> I was a bit Leary but this stuff really works and you can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s fake. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these things for a few years and I love them. They apply easily, and last for a few days. They do get a bit streaky looking when they start to wear off, but it&#x27;s still better than being fish belly white while sunning myself on the beach. You still need sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Wore the stuff on a trip to Jamaica.  I found it to streak very badly.  Spent less money on Jergen&#x27;s and it works much better.</li>
            <li> This is the first tannning product that actually works for me......no mess, even color and soft skin.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very natural look. Just be careful to cover all areas. Low odor and dries quickly. Best tanning product I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> Above my expectations!iuse this every other day, and it does not turn orange, but a lovely tanned glow! Buy it.</li>
            <li> These give your skin a nice glow without looking orange or self tanned. I use a little moisturizer around my knees and ankles right after application and it blends flawlessly. You aren&#x27;t going to look dark, but you will look like you spend time in the sun with a some sunblock. I think that looks more natural and healthy so I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I have been using these Tan Towels for years. These are super easy and fast to achieve a nice color other than my PALE white...&lt;br /&gt;One towel can cover my arms, legs and chest area. I don&#x27;t do my entire body only what is visable when wearing clothes (Dresses, shorts etc)</li>
            <li> Works great when used as directed.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it created a fast tan and I look like I was at the beach. Nobody would ever know. I use it once a week so it lasts a long time. Try it you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Love these...they are the best!</li>
            <li> I DID NOT LIKE THE COLOR THAT THIS PRODUCT LEFT YOUR SKIN IT&#x27;S MORE ORANGE THAN TAN AND IT STREAKS NOT A EVEN APPLICATIONS ALSO SMELLS AFTER PRODUCT DRIES.SHOULD OF KNOWN NOT TO TRY IT DID THE SAME THING LAST TIME WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I would consider myself and &amp;#34;Experienced&amp;#34; self-tanner. I have tried a TON of different products. I received a sample of the Kate Somerville Tan Towels a few weeks back and loved them. They are pricey though! I had a business trip to San Diego that I would be leaving for in a week and needed a tanning product that would be easily portable. I decided to look at other towel applicator options and came across the Tan Towel.&lt;br /&gt;I&lt;br /&gt; received these towels 2 days after ordering, thanks Prime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I packed a few in my luggage, and did a very risky thing and used 2 of the towels to do a fully body application...the night before my trip...RISKY. The next morning I crawled out of bed and was disappointed/glad to see that I barely had any color. (FYI: I have a very fair skin tone.)&lt;br /&gt;I decided that this was a good thing though. The next night I applied another round and had a perfect amount of color. It looked natural and wasn&#x27;t streaky at all! I am now a true fan of Tan Towels! They are super convenient and don&#x27;t have any gross color guides to stain your clothing and bedding. I will purchase these again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very careful about using sunscreen throughout the year, and as a result, I&#x27;m very pale. I love how TanTowels give me a little bit of healthy glow. I use them year round a couple of nights a week just before I go to sleep. I&#x27;ve never had problems with blotchy color or staining on my clothing. Using an exfoliant first works best. I do use the darker color even though I&#x27;m very light. One towel is good for my face, neck, arms and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of the process, these towels give me good coverage and the color looks natural, but noticeable!</li>
            <li> These Tan Towels work great, need only apply every third day.&lt;br /&gt;Better than any other product I have used,I will purchase them again</li>
            <li> Looks like you just got back from that Hawaiian vacation, without the air fare and hotel.  Vey safe and the tan looks good and is easy to refresh.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see where they are giving me any color.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products. So much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and they don&#x27;t smell like other tanning products!! No streaks! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love the tan towel. It goes on evenly and looks very natural. It smells good too!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must have! Love it</li>
            <li> Good natural tan color with no streaking.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO color....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pale and tried a sample packet of the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; tan towel and saw almost no change in color but I liked the concept, so I ordered the &amp;#34;plus&amp;#34; version expecting more of a tan but they have been the same as the classic: no visible change in my tan. Total scam. Won&#x27;t be buying again, I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money here :(</li>
            <li> These towelettes work as well as anything else. I use gloves to apply, as the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; will build up on your hands. I keep hoping for a better product that won&#x27;t smell so bad, but haven&#x27;t found anything yet.</li>
            <li> Easy, natural looking, and without the bad smell that comes along with most other self-tanning products or lotions. I love these! For me, the maximum color comes through about 24 hours after application, with a gradual darkening over the day/night. Definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li> These really work great.  No mess, no smell, no streaking!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife. While she felt the were acceptable she noted that the use of two packages were needed which made the price prohibitive. She will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time and love them.  No streaking</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, easy to use and works very well.  I would order this product again.  Great price too.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Gives off a non-streaky, golden tan. Starts to fade in about a week. The scent isn&#x27;t strong at all &amp; it dries super quick!</li>
            <li> O.M.G.  I have used it and done it ALL in terms of tanning ( for 50+ years). Baby oil, Sun, beds, Tan lotions, sprays, salon treatments, you name it, I have done it.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered by accident the &amp;#34;plus&amp;#34; for medium skin. Saw the box and went &amp;#34; oh no&amp;#34;!  am very fair Swedish, green eyes... you get it&lt;br /&gt;SO GLAD I did.These towels are freakishly awesome. You rub them on, no worries about streaks, up or down, circles, whatever the motion. I can get nice tan every-time!!!&lt;br /&gt;Since I bought the half plus by accident, Glad I got the spray. I use the towel, then add spray to the towel. I&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE LOVE this stuff... Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but I have never bought anything remotely close to this.</li>
            <li> I did not realize there were different  types for different  skin colors but I will remember this next time... Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love these towels, no need for me to sit in the sun .  I am always told I am glowing when I use these towels. Thanks</li>
            <li> these tan towels worked really great and the color was awesome, I still had it a little heavy around the ankles but that is just something that you have to fine  tune.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many sunless tanners.  Tan towels are easy to apply, not to drastic and never streak.  The smell is not bad at all and my favorite thing about this product is how quickly they dry.  I can lotion up right after, where with spray tan you can&#x27;t put lotion on right away. I have a medium complextion so the tan towels PLUS work best.  I was not seeing results from the light to medium skin tan towels.  It does take a couple applications to see some noticeable color, but it lasts a fair amount of time.</li>
            <li> Love them, really work. You must know how to apply to avoid blotches and streaks. Read the directions.</li>
            <li> My favorite fake tan. I have medium dark skin and these are a sure bet for color, where as some seem to not really show up since I&#x27;m already pretty dark. Never have streaks with these and don&#x27;t have to worry about a gel balling up and rolling off if you go over the same area twice.</li>
            <li> Simply the best tanning product I have ever used. I love the price as well. If you apply this correctly and don&#x27;t miss any spots you will have a very even, natural, looking color. The most natural color I have found. Not orange at all if you are a light/medium skin tone.</li>
            <li> Great tan and goes on evenly - never too much!!!  I have used for last two years and I highly recommend this product.  Sun is not an option any longer but looking healthy and glowing is possible with Tan Towel!!!! yeah!</li>
            <li> Perfect, natural looking tan -- no streaks.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY way to tan! Awesome and long lasting tan without streaks! I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I bought it to help my daughter, who is a golfer, with her golfers tan.  She has white feet and a white torso so she needed a little help before taking her Senior pictures.  Amazing results.  She is all one color!!  Completely blended in with her natural tan. I have been using them as well to extend my summer glow.  Very happy and I will continue to use the product.  You are dry immediately and there truly is no streaking.  I even used it on my face.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin but often get lighter than I would like in the wintertime. I also have some patches of skin that are slightly discolored. I thought I would try this product to see if it would help even out the skin tone.  It worked really well.  The first time I used the product I left it on for the suggested 4 hours and I definitely could see a difference.  The second time I used the product, I left it on for 2 hours and although I could see a difference, it became apparent that the 4 hour timing worked much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely helped even out my skin tone and made my skin look bronze / golden.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well and color seems natural looking.Just wish there was a way to reach my back.Maybe they can come up with a device to attach  the tan towel to so you can apply it to your back by yourself</li>
            <li> Tan towels are great.  I am a self tan junkie.  I have tried all kinds of products.  I find the Tan Towels to have great coverage, no streaking, no odor and lasts a long time.  The only mistake I made was buying this without realizing it is a half tan towel.  I think it will be just fine, or I will use two at a time.</li>
            <li> While this works for my mom and she loves it and it looks great, I broke out in hives and it took 3 days to stop the itching and that was only one application.</li>
            <li> One of the best self-tan products I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Worked well, provided even natural tan, delightful smell.</li>
            <li> I have used thisroorduct for years and am very satisfied with the results it gives me.  I am able to keep my summer tan though out the winter months</li>
            <li> I always wear triple digit SPF sunscreen but one day I got lost while hiking in the hot sun and ended up out for three times as long as I thought I would be.  I got a nasty sunburn which faded to a tan with bad tan lines from my tank top and sports bra.  I had to wear a strapless dress as a bridesmaid in my SIL&#x27;s wedding so I bought this in hopes of evening my skin tone.  It took me two applications but these did the trick and worked wonderfully.  I even had people complimenting me on my tan.  No bad smell or staining.</li>
            <li> FIANLLY!!!! A self tanner that works!!! I have tried just about every lotion and spray with disappointing results and I hate paying for mystic at the salon, so I decided to give this product a try. My first application was fast, no steaks and no funny smell. I re-applied the next day, same results. I have a nice color that does not look fake. One towel covers my entire body and they stay moist until covered. Please do not hesitate to try this product, you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use one of our favorite fake bake products to date.</li>
            <li> Nice, easy, even tanning.</li>
            <li> This is the only self tanner that I will use. Tan towels do an amazing job at giving you a natural tan without being orange or streaky at all. They dry super fast and are very easy to apply. I can use one towel for my arms, legs, and face. I use the darker towels even though I&#x27;m very pale and I have no issues good looking like I have a fake tan. This is the best price I could find on them.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in how streaky this came out.  I did all the normal things when using fake tan and this was just a mess.  It was also more orange than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> The best Tanning Towels out there!!!!  Natural and not orange.  I have tried all the expensive brands and they streak with leaving me look orange.  This product is amazing.  I have fair skin and gets me to a tan that always looks natural.  It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t have the strong smell that most of the tanning products have.  I cannot say enough about this product.  I am so happy that I can get this through Amazon because I could not find at Sephora anymore.  Love this so much!!!  It works great on your face too.</li>
            <li> I would say TanTowel Look Good Naked Self-Tan Towelettes create the most natural-looking fake tan I have ever seen. One of my friends shocked me when she told me that she&#x27;s been using them since forever, because I honestly believed that she does in fact have olive skin by default. She showed my her &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; pictures - and she was like a snowflake! Needless to say, I have been buying these ever since.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. No streaking. Tan last about a week on me. Looks very natural and not orangy. Will be re-purchasing soon this item soon.</li>
            <li> Since we are supposed to avoid over doing in the sun Tan Towel is perfect!</li>
            <li> Got a tip to try these towels from a patient at work.  She suggested that even though I am fair and only burn to use the medium/dark color.  Used them and on the first warm day wore a white mini and kept getting compliments on my tan.  They work fantastic just make sure that you spread them evenly.  Had to touch up after the first day to correct some streaks but worked great.</li>
            <li> Best self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. Can see effect after only a few uses. Did not smell bad or leave streaks.</li>
            <li> Nice tan no orange ...</li>
            <li> I am fair and have did some major sunning in my teens.  After having several spots removed by my Dermatologist I got wise to getting an actual sun tan.  I have tried other products but this one works best and looks the most natural for my skin.  The packets are also easy to carry with you traveling.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking tan!!! And I am an Irish girl that always looks orange with fake tanner this is great!</li>
            <li> No mistakes ever!! always gives an even glow</li>
            <li> These are thin and somewhat difficult to use as they bunch up and dry up quickly. They do give a glow that other tanners do not-- it looks very uniform and natural... Pretty amazing actually... But it takes nearly 10 of them to achieve this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had skin cancer, so I don&#x27;t tan anymore.I&#x27;ve used this product for years to put a little color on my legs.It is the best product out there.</li>
            <li> This product will give you the glow that your skin needs...and does NOT get on your clothing.  Simple, fast and easy to use.  I have been using these toilettes for years. Nothing compares to them...and the price isn&#x27;t too bad either.  :)</li>
            <li> Saw Tan Towel advertised on HSN and was very excited for a self tanner that looks natural and does not streak.  I am fair with freckles and auburn hair and can tan, but now stay out of the sun.  I&#x27;ve used this 2 times, and am not happy with the results.  On my skin it has more orange than bronze color and looks fake.  I&#x27;ll go back to using L&#x27;oreal Sublime, and it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I bought these through HS# because of all the reviews but was very much disappointed. The color was Orange tones, not brown, on my fair skin. Was going on a cruise and wanted a base and used for several weeks prior. When I went through airport security in Boston they pulled me aside and put the chemical detecter all over my body, searched my carry on bag carefully, all because of the smell from the tantowels used the day before. I had showered that morning but still the smell came through. The color is not a natural looking tan, so save your money.</li>
            <li> Best self tanner ever!</li>
            <li> What I love most about this product is that it hardly has the self-tanner smell!  Because these are half towels, I have to use two packets for my entire body.  The color isn&#x27;t that dark - I used a 3rd packet to achieve a darker color.  I still really like this product.  The color isn&#x27;t orange-y.  I use to use Clarins self-tanner.  Loved the color it gave but didn&#x27;t love the self-tanner smell it gave off.</li>
            <li> These worked very well; I would order them again!</li>
            <li> These are awesome.  They do not leave you streaked or orange.  It really made my legs look like I had spent time at the beach.  I highly recommend them if you are looking for a self-tanner.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to take on a trip. They were easy to pack and the half body size is good. The tanning product itself does not give much color, especially since they are &amp;#34;Plus&amp;#34;. The towels gave a little color when I applied a few times in a row. I have a few Comodynes tanning wipes from at least a year ago that give better color.</li>
            <li> I have used TanTowels for a couple years now and love them.  I take a shower, exfoliate and apply Pure Aloe Vera Gel or Lotion whatever I have in the morning then before I go to bed apply the TanTowel.... my skin is dry and by the end of the day has skin drank up all the Aloe.  I use these TanTowels on my face, neck, ears... head to toe.  Wait a couple minutes til I feel dry then put on pj and to bed.  I wake up take a quick shower and dont exfoliate or moisturize and apply another TanTowel... by lunch time I have a golden tan.  I don&#x27;t go crazy tanning and 2 towels over 2 days gives me a nice tan color glow.  It also gives me a little instant makeover and looks good under my makeup!  The tan fades gradually and I moisturize with Aloe Vera daily, I haven&#x27;t noticed any blotch spots that I have had with other tanners. The TanTowels work well for me:)</li>
            <li> worked well for what I needed them for.  Quick tan</li>
            <li> They work real well!!!</li>
            <li> What more can words say-these are the greatest product ever-i live in florida and rather than go out into the sun and ruin my skin-i use these instead-so natural looking too-</li>
            <li> Easy to use and fast! Does not have the smell so many sunless tan products have. Two to three times a week will do it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this productvfor any one who wants a natural looking tan while avoiding the tanning beds. No streak and very natural looking.</li>
            <li> Fantasic tanning towels</li>
            <li> love these.  use them all year long</li>
            <li> these aren&#x27;t as dark as id like them to be.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and speedy service!!!  Would definitely buy more in the future!&lt;br /&gt;Wish I can find them for a little bit cheaper!</li>
            <li> Great product.  No streaking and great tanned look results.  Easy to use.  I recommend this product.  I use the tan towels for darker skin - both are similar</li>
            <li> I have ordered twice from amazon (burn cosmetics) and have been very pleased with the results. You have to apply 2-4 times a week to get and maintain a tan but it doesn&#x27;t orange your skin. Easy to use too!</li>
            <li> Love these! So easy to use and you get great color!</li>
            <li> I could actually classify this as the best self tanner in a towelette form I have ever used, but let me explain why. This size of towel will be enough to do your face, neck, arms hands, chest &amp; tops of feet. I have used the full body ones and never ran out of enough for my whole body. The self tanner really has a neutral smell to it. I completely exfoliate my skin and shave, then I use it as it says in a circular motion. I have never had any streaking. I love it because if there is areas that are hard to tan or not as evenly tanned, I use it there. It says to wash hands right after, &amp; I do. I have no orange tint at all. I think the color adapts to the heat of the skin temperature to provide you with a natural looking tan :) &amp; honestly it leaves such a nice tan &amp; radiant glow it makes the skin look so much more healthy.</li>
            <li> I had bought these several years ago and although you have to learn how to use them after a couple of trial runs, the color is fantastic!!! I got a very deep tan that does not look orange and if you take your time to cover all areas evenly no one can tell that it is not a real tan (although I have to admit it does look darn near perfect).  Be aware though, if your skin is not prepped properly (i.e. scrubbed and free of dead skin) you will end up with patches that are darker.  So anywhere you have really dry spots the product will be darker and really noticeable.  My best tip is to start in the larger areas first.  For example, for your legs start at the thigh and then move down the leg.  As the towel gets drier then finish with your feet (less product is needed around the ankles… remember the drier skin absorbs more!).  Then with the same size towel, do the other leg in the exact same order.  You may have to do some trial and error but I am an expert at these now and they are better than a tan from the harmful sun and do not smell! Good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivered. Great packaging. Great product. I been using it for years now. And this price is amazing!!!! I would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> While I love this product, I was surprised when I bought 10 that they did not come in the box like others I have purchased in the past. Fortunately I still had my previous now empty box to store these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tan Towels once a week for over a year now. They provide a natural looking tone that looks and great and lasts about 3 days. Great and affordable product.</li>
            <li> I wish I had only bought one of these as a test, because I hardly can see any difference. It would be a great concept, but so far I&#x27;ve had the best results with sun laboratories rub in tanner.  It&#x27;s messy, but it does actually produce a tan.</li>
            <li> Great product and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great product!</li>
            <li> These totally work,  great to add some color for the Summer.</li>
            <li> I forgot to thoroughly wash my hands after applying. My palms are dark.  Is there any way to clean my palms? 5</li>
            <li> A co-worker introduced me to these and I am hooked.  One tan towel leaves me feeling/looking like I just spent four hours on the beach (minus the red).</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very natural looking tan. I&#x27;ve used several brands and this one is by far the best!!</li>
            <li> I used these last spring/summer and really liked them.  I did not notice any sort of bad odor like some have mentioned.  Dries fast, works great!</li>
            <li> Love this product and I got it in one day not 2 with my Amazon prime shipping!! Amazing!</li>
            <li> This product does give a nice, realistic, smooth color. However, and I should have known this anyway, never, never, never apply it without gloves! Even though it says to wash your hands immediately after applying, which I did, the palms of your hands will be 10 times darker than the rest of you. So far I&#x27;ve tried baking soda, lemon juice, and windex. None of which put a dent in this stuff. They really need to warn dummies like me to use a glove when handling the towelette.&lt;br /&gt;It would also help if they gave a hint as to how long you should wait before putting on clothes.</li>
            <li> I have used the Tan Towels for several years and the application looks very natural.  No streaking or &amp;#34;mess&amp;#34; around the ankles, knees or elbows.  Color is ver natural.</li>
            <li> I just love these and a such great deal  for a superior tanning option !!! these last and look natural.</li>
            <li> This is not indicated anywhere in the description.  Only a knowledge of the square full body packettes vs the rectangle half body are any indication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deceptive advertising by seller, not Amazon and no reflexion on the product itself, which I consider excellent.  But I had to give a star.  I have rated this product before on the full body towel pack.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these Tan Towels for 2 years now.  There is no better product for a natural, lasting tan. And easy to apply with no smell.</li>
            <li> Gives you great color, no mess, no hustle. it also helps to achieve very even color all over the body.</li>
            <li> works great  going to place another order when my tan fades</li>
            <li> fairly natural looking and doesn&#x27;t smell bad</li>
            <li> Really liked it but don&#x27;t want to keep spending the money on it.</li>
            <li> they work awesome the best I have found in self tanning.</li>
            <li> Streaked like crazy but I didn&#x27;t have a base tan at all.  Maybe this would be better for someone just trying to enhance a tan.</li>
            <li> Have been using for years!  Great color just wish it had no scent.</li>
            <li> What a great product!</li>
            <li> I NEVER write reviews but I have to for this product. I have always been tan (and not naturally). I live in Louisiana so I am always out in the sun during the summer and tanning beds during winter. That is until I tried this product! It is the most natural tan and soooo easy to apply! You wouldn&#x27;t be able to get streaks or orange if you tried! I have tried every self tanner out there and this is BY FAR the best! It has kept me out of the sun and away from tanning beds! 5 stars all the way!!!</li>
            <li> Yellow hue  not a good product</li>
            <li> This is convenient for travel and it seems to add some color but not too much really.  It can definitely cause an orange line on your hands or places where you stop using.  It is a great alternative to tanning which I am trying to give up.  I will keep using this.</li>
            <li> My sister told me about these and I like them much better than creams, sprays or lotions.  They are easy to use, and I can get the color distributed more evenly.  Nice, very light scent.  Does not look orange to me.  Easy to take along on trips for a touch up.  I wish they were less expensive though.</li>
            <li> I love these!  So easy to apply and the tanned look is perfect.  It lasts about a week then fades gradually.</li>
            <li> These towels are GREAT and NO STREAKING!</li>
            <li> OLD BATCH. Be careful who you order from. I ordered from Beauty It Is and none of the towels produced any color. I tried several towels and none of them worked.  I am guessing that the batch is old. The towels were also kind of dry and not very moist. I would order from a seller that you can return them or from a different company.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time several weeks ago. It gives a nice, natural tan to my face and legs. It dries quickly and has no lingering odor. I am very please with the product. It is very easy to apply. I get the benefits of a nice tan without the sun damage to my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a red head who does not tan very well, but instead burns easily. I think a pretty tan makes you look nice and healthy, but I am not willing to increase my risk of cancer to lay in a tanning bed or the sun to get the pretty tan.  Besides I always burn anyways and that makes me miserable and then I peel and still no tan... until I found this product. I bought just one towel to try and wow- I was amazed!  I could not believe how subtle the color appeared on my skin and without the stinky sunless tanner product smell! Still being skeptical, I bought another towelette to try again and this time I used it all over my entire body. It really looked good! Even my husband thought I had went to the tanning bed. The color for me was a natural looking tan shade as I bought the lighter color to try. It was much cheaper to buy the product on amazon so I bought a whole box. I do use one complete towelette for my entire body- I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; size 10. If I just use on my legs I use the towelette and put into a baggie to use again the next day.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t look good in orange</li>
            <li> I really like Tan Towels but what this item doesn&#x27;t specify is that these are the medium-dark skin tone towels. One my fair skin they look orange. These were a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without Tan Towels, especially in the winter in Chicago!  The color is natural and comes up within hours.  It gives me a nice glow without having to visit a tanning booth.  Great price on these!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Good color and no streaking. A good way to get a tan without the sun.  I suggest trying these tan towels</li>
            <li> I have used the Tan Packets for about Three years now. So easy, fast and safe. I like to put it on at night  and then I&#x27;m ready to go the next day. A Even beautiful tan. At the end I do my face and just enough left on towel to give you just the color you need. Try and you never go back</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, natural looking glow.  I was satisfied with the customer service  also. I received the wrong color my first shipment and they did replace with correct order and return label. Very happy customer. Thank you for your help.</li>
            <li> Least odor of any sunless tanning towels I&#x27;ve used - and the half body covered my legs, arms, and face.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I love tan towels for my legs in the summer. My legs do not get tan as fast as the rest of body and these do the trick. Not much of a smell and even color.</li>
            <li> Buy the L&#x27;Oreal packets. They&#x27;re much more effective. Cover a larger part of your body. And give you great color. I have been using them for years and wanted to try something new,  I don&#x27;t see any color change what so ever. I thought a fancier brand would be better, but they are certainly not. The only reason why I think they have such high reviews is because people paid more money for something that you can get at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Love these things for looking tan without the sun damage!</li>
            <li> The TanTowel applies easily and leaves no noticeable smell. However, it did turn my skin orange which was the only thing I was trying to avoid.</li>
            <li> I was generally pleased with the product. THe color looks natural and one application lasted close to two weeks.  One hint is to use firm pressure when using the wipes.  My 14 year old daughter used it and just lightly wiped the product on and ended up missing spots.  If you are careful and make sure to apply evenly, the result is good.  Avoid too much pressure on knees and elbows as they tend to absorb the coloring more.</li>
            <li> does what it says it does</li>
            <li> Perfect glow without any orange!! I must in the winter!</li>
            <li> Have bought and used this for 3 years.  Drys almost instantly.  Not orange or bad coloring.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> My friend had me try one of her towels and I immediately ordered a box for myself.  After many fails in the 80&#x27;s and looking like a carrot I had sworn off self tanners.  This goes on with no streaking and very little odor and has a very natural color.  Amazon price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Tantowel works fine. Easy to apply via the towetets, plus can cut towels up to do smaller areas.&lt;br /&gt;Only negative, similar to but not as bad as my previous experience with liquid bottled lotion, DO STILL  GET SOME DISCOLORATION  OF HAIR. But this is easier to control with towelets than lotion.....unklmilty</li>
            <li> I really love these towels! They work good and give me color. There is no streaking either so I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> This product is the same as the tanning towels i buy at Wal-mart... maybe its just my skin but i will be buying mine at Wal-mart just to save $10.</li>
            <li> I have been using tan towels for a long time.  They are very easy to use and don&#x27;t leave you looking orange.  The small towels are enough for you to do your face, neck, arms and chest.</li>
            <li> No greasy feel, no smell...very soft natural look. Pleased and will keep using these from now on. Best I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I have used Tan Towels for a few years and usually buy them on HSN because of the price difference for the packages but this was a good deal for the plus half body. I always wear the hair color gloves when applying especially if you have a pink and white manicure or gel or acrylic nails. Because Im naturally Medium skin tone I like to use these to blend in a Tanning Mouse or spray like St Tropez or Fake Bake for some occasions which I find gives a darker natural bronze color without any orange. After using the Plus I would not bother with ever using the classic again just because my natural skin tone has a base color and the half body or whole body are the best way to go. Also I try to do everything else first and then lightly cover knees and elbows. These can be used on face but Im older and tend to notice pores and imperfections more if I use these more than once on the face so now I suggest Dr.Gross Glow Wipes for face if possible.</li>
