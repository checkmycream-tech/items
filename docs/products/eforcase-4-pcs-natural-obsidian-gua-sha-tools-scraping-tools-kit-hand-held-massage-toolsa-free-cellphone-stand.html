    <ol>
            <li>They work GREAT!  </li>
            <li>My PT recommended these and they are great!</li>
            <li>Great set!</li>
            <li>Great item and price!</li>
            <li>Wonderful assortment of shapes to get in where you need to work.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>A great deal and great shipping.</li>
            <li>Still learning how to use it, but great tools to enhance your health.  </li>
            <li>Well made and good price.</li>
            <li>these took some time to arrive, but they are good value</li>
            <li>I have another fish shape jade tool that is way better, this one is not the best shape, needs to be a bit more rounded.</li>
            <li>I have not found instructions to use them yet, but am very excited to try them!</li>
            <li>I washed them in Dawn then soaked them awhile longer in a warm Dawn bath.  </li>
            <li>They give great tissue feedback and clean up well.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>Now I can keep one of these at my home rooms and office and more convenient to do the massage.</li>
            <li>I love obsidian, so much better than horn or plastic!&lt;br</li>
            <li>they have no idea that it doesn&#x27;t take so much DAMAGE to the body to cause great healing.  </li>
            <li>These are nice ,smooth tools that have a coolness to the touch.</li>
            <li>I love this set.  </li>
            <li>Since it is cheap I will probably just leave the rest</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know how this is so cheap</li>
            <li>With 4 tools you can keep one in your gym bag, home and work and might even have a favorite tool for a certain area.  </li>
            <li>good product exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>Overall, these work very well and are pretty good size as well.</li>
            <li>I love these stones so much I&#x27;ve encouraged several others to buy a set.</li>
            <li>sometimes i find them too thin, but its a great tool for massage</li>
            <li>I really like these, but I am worried they will eventually shatter.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you keep them stored on a soft surface and wrap them individually if you transport them.</li>
            <li>and they still look like new.  </li>
            <li>These are real obsidian stone, so they can be fragile if you do not handle them with care.</li>
            <li>Fantastic tools for working with heavy energy.</li>
            <li>Obsidian is naturally brittle, so that is a risk you are taking.</li>
            <li>The fish piece broke in half the first time used.</li>

            <li> that looks like a bunny head came broken though it was wrapped well.</li>
            <li> It took 2 months to get here, and when i got it was a bunch or broken stones.</li>

            <li> Well made and good price.</li>
            <li> these took some time to arrive, but they are good value and I love them. Now I can keep one of these at my home rooms and office and more convenient to do the massage.</li>
            <li> These arrived with a somewhat petroleum scent.  I washed them in Dawn then soaked them awhile longer in a warm Dawn bath.  After drying a few hours I massaged coconut oil into them then used as with any traditional Gua Sha tool.  They work GREAT!  I love obsidian, so much better than horn or plastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find them so simple to use.  Just watch a few videos on gua sha or ASTYM though I never use them to the point of causing tiny red blood blisters like the ASTYM trained physical therapists are known for.. they have no idea that it doesn&#x27;t take so much DAMAGE to the body to cause great healing.  I massage these the length of the muscle fibers so the muscles are smoothed out and when they rebuild the tissue is in the proper direction. I love these stones so much I&#x27;ve encouraged several others to buy a set.</li>
            <li> A bargain at $8.99, but mine came broken, seller refunded full price immediately. I have another fish shape jade tool that is way better, this one is not the best shape, needs to be a bit more rounded.</li>
            <li> good product exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> My PT recommended these and they are great! They are solid and work well getting out the kinks in my back.</li>
            <li> I like i even tho sometimes i find them too thin, but its a great tool for massage</li>
            <li> One piece  that looks like a bunny head came broken though it was wrapped well. They probably broke it as they were wrapping it tight. Since it is cheap I will probably just leave the rest but I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything from this material. It is too fragile and hard to use on outcalls. I knew it was fragile as I was reading the reviews but I couldn&#x27;t imagine it being THAT fragile.</li>
            <li> It took 2 months to get here, and when i got it was a bunch or broken stones.</li>
            <li> Great product. These are real obsidian stone, so they can be fragile if you do not handle them with care. They give great tissue feedback and clean up well. Just make sure that you keep them stored on a soft surface and wrap them individually if you transport them. Overall, these work very well and are pretty good size as well.</li>
            <li> I guess I had envisioned obsidian as a polished stone, but this does state it&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. I have not found instructions to use them yet, but am very excited to try them!</li>
            <li> Fantastic tools for working with heavy energy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how this is so cheap but Ive had my tools for over a year and they still look like new.  With 4 tools you can keep one in your gym bag, home and work and might even have a favorite tool for a certain area.  Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Just like the ones at the doctors office</li>
            <li> Upon arrival, the fish piece (like another buyer) and the mickey-mouse piece were broken. Obsidian is naturally brittle, so that is a risk you are taking. Also, I am no obsidian expert, but this obsidian does not seem as glassy like other obsidian I have seen. It&#x27;s definitely stone, but I kinda doubt it&#x27;s obsidian. But again, I am no expert.</li>
            <li> These are nice ,smooth tools that have a coolness to the touch.</li>
            <li> A great deal and great shipping. Knocked it out of the park!!!</li>
            <li> I really like these, but I am worried they will eventually shatter. Then again, maybe they won&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> The fish piece broke in half the first time used.</li>
            <li> Broken when it showed up. Very low quality product. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this set.  Still learning how to use it, but great tools to enhance your health.  Just bear in mind that you have to be careful not to drop it on the floor.  Great set!</li>
            <li> Great item and price!</li>
            <li> Wonderful assortment of shapes to get in where you need to work.  Heatable too.</li>
