    <ol>
            <li>Works Absolutely Great!</li>
            <li>very good medicine for folliculitis</li>
            <li>No antibiotics and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Every thing was good and items were sent in good timing</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t work for me, in the end I found the cure in china they have Fu Li Kang and Li Kang Cream very strong read manual before use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to leave it in, that attribute alone makes it more effective than non leave-in products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy and surprised.</li>
            <li>so you might be better off just buying 10% sulfur cream or whatever..</li>
            <li>So F-that, my mom being awesome sent me some DEFENSE SOAP(and overall DEFENSE care package with all the goodies), great stuff, and I&#x27;ve been washing with it for months and its killing this off perfectly, slowly but perfectly.</li>
            <li>: I think this bacteria is living in my nose so try to eliminate any germs up there SAFELY.</li>
            <li>It gets so itchy that it&#x27;s best to wrap up your head, especially at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and right now you would never know I had severe folliculitus for many years!</li>
            <li>makes my hair look clean and shiny and healthy</li>
            <li>Overall I have been happy with the performance of the product.&lt;br /&gt;11/01/2015&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The situation got better right after I stopped using it.</li>
            <li>Pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li>drawback is the SMELL......and the cost, but if it continues to work it is worth it&lt;</li>
            <li>I am glad to have finally found something to help folliculitis.  </li>
            <li>The only change I would suggest is a better smell, but the product works well.</li>
            <li>So let me tell you what I was dealing with first.</li>
            <li>did find that the Walgreen&#x27;s brand of &amp;#34;Scalp Relief&amp;#34; helped the most this last time, though it contains alcohol, so is drying.  </li>
            <li>The main thing is NOT to scratch!  </li>
            <li>and it really helped.</li>
            <li>It took 4 weeks of use before I really seen the results so don&#x27;t give up its got to take time to work.</li>
            <li>Big bumps filled with a yellowish greenish whitish puss poke marked my scalp and it was killing off my hair follicules!</li>
            <li>One said I might have to live with this forever!</li>
            <li>However, I believe the main killing agent in this product is the sulfur</li>
            <li>It smells like an old ladies perm or some type of salon treatment.</li>
            <li>Take action and use this with DEFENSE SOAP, specifically the soap bars for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As of Feb 10th 5015 it has greatly reduced the swelling and painful bumps associated with my folliculitis.</li>
            <li>Though it has not cured my issue it has really calmed it down.</li>
            <li>but this, Bactine spray (has an tingling pain relieving additive) and Cetiphil antibacterial soap bar (scrubbing with washcloth) have cleared my head up to a few rare minor blemishes a week at max while training in gym 4 days a week.  </li>

            <li> It was a bit pricy, but Folliculitis is nasty and takes a long time to get rid of depending on the bacteria.  </li>

            <li> very good medicine for folliculitis</li>
            <li> Works well. Put it on before bed every night and it really helped.</li>
            <li> I waited 2 months to review this product. I cant say this alone is the singe thing but this, Bactine spray (has an tingling pain relieving additive) and Cetiphil antibacterial soap bar (scrubbing with washcloth) have cleared my head up to a few rare minor blemishes a week at max while training in gym 4 days a week.  I had this severe to the point putting my head on the pillow was painful. Nothing works for everyone but the combination of these have been a miracle for me. No antibiotics and my skin looks great. It took 4 weeks of use before I really seen the results so don&#x27;t give up its got to take time to work. Like I said mine was the worst case I had ever seen and right now you would never know I had severe folliculitus for many years!</li>
            <li> After 2 uses I see and feel a difference.  I am glad to have finally found something to help folliculitis.  The only change I would suggest is a better smell, but the product works well.</li>
            <li> I started using this lotion January 16th 2015 in conjunction with the daily shampoo. As of Feb 10th 5015 it has greatly reduced the swelling and painful bumps associated with my folliculitis. The downside to the lotion is the smell. It smells like an old ladies perm or some type of salon treatment. I was it out every morning yet the smell still lingers. Overall I have been happy with the performance of the product.&lt;br /&gt;11/01/2015&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use this product. Though it has not cured my issue it has really calmed it down. The inflammation and itching is at a minimum. When I don&#x27;t use the product for a few days the inflammation comes back. So it does help.</li>
            <li> I had to end up getting a topical from the doctor for my folliculitus.</li>
            <li> I like this treatment  makes my hair look clean and shiny and healthy but I still have folliculitis on my scalp sores that is what I&#x27;m trying to get rid of so I can stop losing my hair</li>
            <li> This is the only folliculitis medication that has worked. I&#x27;m very happy and surprised. I recommend this product for anyone with a stubborn case of scalp infections.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for me, in the end I found the cure in china they have Fu Li Kang and Li Kang Cream very strong read manual before use.</li>
            <li> So let me tell you what I was dealing with first. I got some BAD folliculitus from bmt, maybe it started at home IDK, but it got horribly out of control. Big bumps filled with a yellowish greenish whitish puss poke marked my scalp and it was killing off my hair follicules! Then it changed to small bumps on the skin instead of deep below that were so painful it hurt to wear my cap and it hurt to sleep. I went to the docs and was on antibiotics for around 28 days. It cleared it up a little but it came back. No surprise there since nothing actually killed the virus, bacteria, fungus? IDK, docs said they didn&#x27;t find bacteria in the puss nor did they think it was a fungus. Sounds like I was patient zero. So F-that, my mom being awesome sent me some DEFENSE SOAP(and overall DEFENSE care package with all the goodies), great stuff, and I&#x27;ve been washing with it for months and its killing this off perfectly, slowly but perfectly. Now I&#x27;ve added this lotion and it&#x27;s like the final push. These big bumps are rare to find and the folliculitus is slowly dying! Thank God and everyone who helped me cause the docs said they can&#x27;t do anything for me but keep giving me antibiotics that don&#x27;t work. One said I might have to live with this forever! Like I said F-that. Take action and use this with DEFENSE SOAP, specifically the soap bars for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I think this bacteria is living in my nose so try to eliminate any germs up there SAFELY. Antibiotics are known to cause tinnitus which believe me sucks horribly, another symptom that people on the internet said is permanent yet went away for me thank Jesus. So try a silver laced gel or tee tree oil like this product instead. God Bless and get well soon!</li>
            <li> Every thing was good and items were sent in good timing</li>
            <li> This is a soothing lotion that is invisible. It was a bit pricy, but Folliculitis is nasty and takes a long time to get rid of depending on the bacteria.  The main thing is NOT to scratch!  It gets so itchy that it&#x27;s best to wrap up your head, especially at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find that the Walgreen&#x27;s brand of &amp;#34;Scalp Relief&amp;#34; helped the most this last time, though it contains alcohol, so is drying.  That combined with daily shampooing with prescription shampoo, apple cider vinegar, and this product, it took about 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to anyone who gets this.  It&#x27;s happened twice after surgeries, so I am guessing mine was either staph bacteria or a reaction to some drug.  The first time it took failed trips to a dermatologist.  Combination of prescription shampoo, head coverings, oils and apple vinegar treatments and it eventually went away.</li>
            <li> Works Absolutely Great!</li>
            <li> This thing does not help, it postpones the healing process and gives you scurf. The situation got better right after I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using for 5 days now and I am noticing a difference!! finally!!!!  We will see if it continues.&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback is the SMELL......and the cost, but if it continues to work it is worth it&lt;br /&gt;Edit.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it works.  But it comes back.  But perhaps because i need to continue for a couple months after it &#x27;goes&#x27; away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The doctor said i had folliculitis, but they never took a sample or anything...on prescribed clyndomicin, and ketacolzale shampoo (which did nothing).  Two things have worked. This (within a few days) and Colodial silver (also within a few days).  I am  still trying to figure out what triggers it. I don&#x27;t know if it is food reaction, iodine perhaps in protein drinks, or something different.  It HURTS itches and is very difficult to sleep.  I wake itching my head.  It is a bump like a pimple, but if squeezed just &#x27;liquid&#x27; seems to come out, not white pus.  I am using this when it flair ups.  Or sometimes a couple times a week.  I have also got the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work with me.</li>
            <li> Works great. The next day I saw results. My only complaint is that the smell is horrendous.</li>
            <li> To date this is the only product I have found to help relieve my severe scalp Fungal issue</li>
