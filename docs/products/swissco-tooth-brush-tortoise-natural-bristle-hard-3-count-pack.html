            <li>The best toothbrush I have ever owned in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get these in the UK and the service was very good.</li>
            <li>These work great for my dogs.</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s great...</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These things work great.</li>
            <li>You could even use it without toothpaste if you wanted and it would still do a great job.</li>
            <li>but soften perfectly in a brush or two and settle in to a perfect fit to the teeth and between.</li>
            <li>The handle is a good design.</li>
            <li>LOOKS GOOD ,BUT I HAVENT USE IT YET</li>
            <li>I purchased these because I thought for 3 of them it was a good price</li>
            <li>For people with stains on the teeth or who want very clean teeth, these are very good.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with these toothbrushes</li>
            <li>very pleased with these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>These are nice toothbrushes</li>
            <li>Not going to give up my SoniCare, but for travel, these brushes will do quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is not Tooth Brush, it will be useful for carpet brush!!!</li>
            <li>If you have regular, uniform good teeth, they may be perfect; but for my teeth, they just didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Even though it seems to be a very strong and durable plastic handle, it is plastic.</li>
            <li>Might not be suitable for weiner boys.</li>
            <li>Then, about a month into it, they began to lose most of their sturdiness.  </li>
            <li>It seems to hold up as well or better than synthetic.  </li>
            <li>Gave up switched to a SoniCare which I love.  </li>
            <li>Without prejudice , I sincerely recommend its usage.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t care about the fossil fuels used to make plastic, and the toxic hormone-emulating chemicals in most plastics, and the ten-thousand-year landfill mountains of plastic we are leaving our grandkids</li>
            <li>and I love it and will use them from now on.</li>
            <li>But if you are still using toothpaste from the store then this brush is a win - I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to finish, because I&#x27;m sure all of you know.  </li>
            <li>I used it...out of fear, mostly.  </li>
            <li>But for the nonce, I&#x27;m beaming, because it&#x27;s so wonderful to have a toothbrush that actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>but I am glad they make these.</li>
            <li>Much better than those plastic bristle toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I found this one at Amazon and it more than suits the purpose.</li>
            <li>I love these, but I don&#x27;t buy them to brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>OK  </li>
            <li>These brushes are great and durable and gentle without feeling whimpy.</li>
            <li>May be because its natrual bristal t can not have consistancy - first 3 pack was good lasted almost a year</li>
            <li>But if you be sure to give the bristles a good soak under the faucet and use light pressure at first, they will soften over time.</li>
            <li>Cleans great old school style toothbrushes</li>
            <li>So... happy day they are natural bristles, but have you ever tried picking toothbrush fibers out of your teeth?  </li>
            <li>The bristles do come out easily after say about 10 uses???</li>
            <li>They clean much better than nylon toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>It works as I always suspected, feels like a WAY better clean, like orders of magnitude.</li>
            <li>These are nice large tooth brushes, but they start spreading sooner than I would like.</li>
            <li>but whatever was available @</li>
            <li>Feels like I get a really good job done, like no other plastic brush I ever used.</li>
            <li>I used them to clean my nails now.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if natural bristles are better than synthetic, but I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Mouth feels clean when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>I use them to clean around faucets in the kitchen and bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Nice firm bristles, good handle.</li>
            <li>I wish I could find a natural bristle/non-plastic handle toothbrush at this price (or better!).</li>
            <li>It has a full head of bristles but some of the bristles fall out in the 1st month of use.</li>
            <li>this time ended up with a mouth full of them.</li>
            <li>LOVE is not too strong a word to express my adoration of these natural brushes.</li>
            <li>What happened to the nice Colgate straight large tooth brush for 1.25???</li>
            <li>The very first time I tried brushing with it the bristles started falling out.</li>
            <li>Skipping to the second one for a minute, it was everything the 5-star comments promised, and I was SO glad!  </li>
            <li>They are very good for cleaning hard to reach areas, in my experience.  </li>
            <li>This is now my second try and so far it is super great</li>
            <li>only reason I gave these 4 stars is because I have since started making my own toothpaste using coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Worth the price and subscription.</li>
            <li>I am obsessive about my teeth, and I must have a toothbrush that REALLY CLEANS, and these brushes really do clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Also, they have a very strong odor of badger hair (similar to the smell of a badger brush used in men&#x27;s shaving).  </li>
            <li>However, the bristles are great; they are firm and secure and left my teeth squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt; is very gentle on teeth if you like a medium brush.</li>
            <li>but this cleans the tteth lot better than regular brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles on this first one even swayed and bent at the barest touch of a fingertip.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>My theory is: The do not sell them to the public anymore so dentist have more business removing accumulated tartar at a very high price.</li>
            <li>I have looked far and wide for a good brush.</li>
            <li>When I run my tongue over my teeth after brushing, I am confident all day long.</li>
            <li>I got the SOFT pack too, which are also great, with well packed bristles for a firm but gentle brushing.</li>
            <li>caution: Don&#x27;t buy these and then complain because they lose some bristles, because they do.&lt;br /&gt;Today&#x27;s all-plastic wonders last forever, but don&#x27;t clean worth a darn in comparison to these.</li>
            <li>Be aware that the handle on this is plastic but the bristles are natural, so a step in the right direction.</li>
            <li>Too many loose hairs.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this toothbrush when I first opened it.</li>
            <li>Too good to use, the brush is very soft when using on enamel as it possess no harm to any part of mouth/ teeth highly recommended for youngest and older ages most especially those who are having damage, trouble or fragile gum but friendly toughs in cleaning all mouth.</li>
            <li>does not feel like it is cleaning my teeth/gums very well.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I really care about my teeth</li>
            <li>Very good,cleans all your teeth.</li>
            <li>The two-star review is for the two reasons above, and because these only come in a 3-pack, and it would be nice to try one out without having to buy 3.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more and am pretty let down by these brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BUT the first one I opened, as eagerly as I&#x27;d ordered, was NOT hard.  </li>
            <li>i was so happy to find these toothbrushes online at a very reasonable price, but they only last about 8-10 days before the bristles begin coming loose as you brush.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s an odd smell at first, but they work better than nylon.</li>
            <li>Strong handle, sheds a few bristles but not bad.  </li>
            <li>This second brush is a 4-star brush but the first one was a dud so good luck on getting three firm ones.</li>
            <li>I wonder if the first one I tried was actually not a firm one but a mispackaged medium one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upped to three stars.  </li>
            <li>Most toothbrushes are angled upward towards the head;  this one dips down.  </li>
            <li>and I have heard that soft bristles arenâ€™t as good at cleaning as the hard bristles are.</li>
            <li>the positive side the bristles are apparently natural.</li>
            <li>Stiff bristles make it good for various cleaning jobs, not just teeth.</li>
            <li>even the medium are so soft that they simply dont clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li>These are the &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; bristles, and they&#x27;re going to be much firmer than the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; nylon bristles on your average cheap toothbrush.</li>
            <li>You really feel the natural bristles scrubbing while you</li>
            <li>Still looking for something to replace the firm toothbrushes I used to be able to buy at CVS.</li>
            <li>So I went back to a dentures toothbrush &amp; cut off the smaller amount of bristles on the one side &amp; everything is fine for me again.</li>
            <li>The swissco toothbrush has a noticeably larger head which may be uncomfortable at first to some, but i think it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>I love the tortoise and the idea of natural but bought the brush thinking the bristles would stay firm.</li>
            <li>They last a good while, about as long as any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li>, it did at first feel like a bit big</li>
            <li>I would describe it as \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; on the first and second use and \\&quot;Soft\\&quot; thereafter.</li>
            <li>But to be fair, as noted above, my teeth are very crooked and rough on a toothbrush, and I do scrub thoroughly and at a moderate pressure.  </li>
            <li>It tends to get soft if wet a lot, but it is much stiffer than the first one.  </li>
            <li>Finally a hard bristle toothbrush, and it softens only minimally after the first couple of uses to a really good brush...</li>
            <li>I had great expectation due to the other reviewers here, but maybe its the cross between my vampire and British combined teeth that these did not hold up for me at all.  </li>
            <li>if the bristles stayed hard for longer than 5 minutes, this would be my favorite toothbrush</li>
            <li>Getting ready to travel overseas an in the effort to travel as light as possible, I thought of looking on Amazon for a firm manual brush.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind brushing your teeth with something that smells like a wild animal, give these a shot.   </li>
            <li>Now, they are way too soft to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>going to the second of the three brushes I got, this one is much stiffer.  </li>
            <li>I dread using this toothbrush as I threw my old one out and haven&#x27;t had time to replace this yet.</li>
            <li>My 20 year old son likes these also..</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes will last much longer.</li>
            <li>I am a natural bristle convert for life.</li>
            <li>It was baby soft.  </li>
            <li>And the fear I had was that the others I bought were soft like this, too.  </li>
            <li>I used to have to buy natural bristles in Paris to satisfy my preference.</li>
            <li>I gave up 20 yrs ago on natural brushes.</li>
            <li>They sure do stay firm, those bristles!!</li>
            <li>The bristles are firm enough to clean the tongue really well, yet they do not tear up my gums.</li>
            <li>;) Since I have and use both hard and not of this brush, I&#x27;d say  If this was helpful please click yes, thanks!</li>
            <li>Apparently we have gotten to the point that the default material for a product is plastic!.</li>
            <li>These were flaring out widely pretty quickly and irritating the inside of my cheeks and lips (and even firm Oral B and medium Reach brushes flare and get wide after 2 to 3 weeks, but that is when I replace the toothbrush anyway - I can rarely use a toothbrush for more than a month due to my fangtastic teeth!!).  </li>
            <li>Quality brush, firm bristles (but not so much as to irritate) and decent price.</li>
            <li>The bristles are not too hard or soft but are too big to use comfortably.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m not used to a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; bristle brush, I didn&#x27;t realize it would go soft after only one use.</li>
            <li>It last longer than the soft or medium bristle toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone who want to save on buying soft and medium toothbrushes that don&#x27;t last but for a two week period.</li>
            <li>Which is also why I didn&#x27;t open the rest to see if they were all soft.  </li>
            <li>I use them on hard to clean areas, like where the molding meets the walls and floors.  </li>
            <li>first, the bristles were somewhere between medium and firm.  </li>
            <li>A few bristles came out on the first brushing but it seems to be holding together otherwise.</li>
            <li>At first I will say that the one I was using was sturdy and firm.</li>
            <li>Felt good on my teeth the first few times I&#x27;d use one, then the flaring would make them impossible to use.  </li>
            <li>The brush will feel extremely stiff at first, like a boar bristle bath brush.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re serious about clean teeth</li>
    </ol>

            <li> When I run my tongue over my teeth after brushing, I am confident all day long.</li>
            <li> I got the SOFT pack too, which are also great, with well packed bristles for a firm but gentle brushing.</li>
            <li> caution: Don&#x27;t buy these and then complain because they lose some bristles, because they do.&lt;br /&gt;Today&#x27;s all-plastic wonders last forever, but don&#x27;t clean worth a darn in comparison to these.</li>
            <li> Be aware that the handle on this is plastic but the bristles are natural, so a step in the right direction.</li>
            <li> Too many loose hairs.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this toothbrush when I first opened it.</li>
            <li> Too good to use, the brush is very soft when using on enamel as it possess no harm to any part of mouth/ teeth highly recommended for youngest and older ages most especially those who are having damage, trouble or fragile gum but friendly toughs in cleaning all mouth.</li>
            <li> does not feel like it is cleaning my teeth/gums very well.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> I really care about my teeth</li>
            <li> Very good,cleans all your teeth.</li>
            <li> The two-star review is for the two reasons above, and because these only come in a 3-pack, and it would be nice to try one out without having to buy 3.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more and am pretty let down by these brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BUT the first one I opened, as eagerly as I&#x27;d ordered, was NOT hard.  </li>
            <li> i was so happy to find these toothbrushes online at a very reasonable price, but they only last about 8-10 days before the bristles begin coming loose as you brush.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an odd smell at first, but they work better than nylon.</li>
            <li> Strong handle, sheds a few bristles but not bad.  </li>
            <li> This second brush is a 4-star brush but the first one was a dud so good luck on getting three firm ones.</li>
            <li> I wonder if the first one I tried was actually not a firm one but a mispackaged medium one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upped to three stars.  </li>
            <li> Most toothbrushes are angled upward towards the head;  this one dips down.  </li>
            <li> and I have heard that soft bristles arenâ€™t as good at cleaning as the hard bristles are.</li>
            <li> the positive side the bristles are apparently natural.</li>
            <li> Stiff bristles make it good for various cleaning jobs, not just teeth.</li>
            <li> even the medium are so soft that they simply dont clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li> These are the &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; bristles, and they&#x27;re going to be much firmer than the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; nylon bristles on your average cheap toothbrush.</li>
            <li> You really feel the natural bristles scrubbing while you</li>
            <li> Still looking for something to replace the firm toothbrushes I used to be able to buy at CVS.</li>
            <li> So I went back to a dentures toothbrush &amp; cut off the smaller amount of bristles on the one side &amp; everything is fine for me again.</li>
            <li> The swissco toothbrush has a noticeably larger head which may be uncomfortable at first to some, but i think it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> I love the tortoise and the idea of natural but bought the brush thinking the bristles would stay firm.</li>
            <li> They last a good while, about as long as any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> , it did at first feel like a bit big</li>
            <li> I would describe it as \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; on the first and second use and \\&quot;Soft\\&quot; thereafter.</li>
            <li> But to be fair, as noted above, my teeth are very crooked and rough on a toothbrush, and I do scrub thoroughly and at a moderate pressure.  </li>
            <li> It tends to get soft if wet a lot, but it is much stiffer than the first one.  </li>
            <li> Finally a hard bristle toothbrush, and it softens only minimally after the first couple of uses to a really good brush...</li>
            <li> I had great expectation due to the other reviewers here, but maybe its the cross between my vampire and British combined teeth that these did not hold up for me at all.  </li>
            <li> if the bristles stayed hard for longer than 5 minutes, this would be my favorite toothbrush</li>
            <li> Getting ready to travel overseas an in the effort to travel as light as possible, I thought of looking on Amazon for a firm manual brush.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind brushing your teeth with something that smells like a wild animal, give these a shot.   </li>
            <li> Now, they are way too soft to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> going to the second of the three brushes I got, this one is much stiffer.  </li>
            <li> I dread using this toothbrush as I threw my old one out and haven&#x27;t had time to replace this yet.</li>
            <li> My 20 year old son likes these also..</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes will last much longer.</li>
            <li> I am a natural bristle convert for life.</li>
            <li> It was baby soft.  </li>
            <li> And the fear I had was that the others I bought were soft like this, too.  </li>
            <li> I used to have to buy natural bristles in Paris to satisfy my preference.</li>
            <li> I gave up 20 yrs ago on natural brushes.</li>
            <li> They sure do stay firm, those bristles!!</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm enough to clean the tongue really well, yet they do not tear up my gums.</li>
            <li> ;) Since I have and use both hard and not of this brush, I&#x27;d say  If this was helpful please click yes, thanks!</li>
            <li> Apparently we have gotten to the point that the default material for a product is plastic!.</li>
            <li> These were flaring out widely pretty quickly and irritating the inside of my cheeks and lips (and even firm Oral B and medium Reach brushes flare and get wide after 2 to 3 weeks, but that is when I replace the toothbrush anyway - I can rarely use a toothbrush for more than a month due to my fangtastic teeth!!).  </li>
            <li> Quality brush, firm bristles (but not so much as to irritate) and decent price.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not too hard or soft but are too big to use comfortably.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not used to a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; bristle brush, I didn&#x27;t realize it would go soft after only one use.</li>
            <li> It last longer than the soft or medium bristle toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone who want to save on buying soft and medium toothbrushes that don&#x27;t last but for a two week period.</li>
            <li> Which is also why I didn&#x27;t open the rest to see if they were all soft.  </li>
            <li> I use them on hard to clean areas, like where the molding meets the walls and floors.  </li>
            <li> first, the bristles were somewhere between medium and firm.  </li>
            <li> A few bristles came out on the first brushing but it seems to be holding together otherwise.</li>
            <li> At first I will say that the one I was using was sturdy and firm.</li>
            <li> Felt good on my teeth the first few times I&#x27;d use one, then the flaring would make them impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> The brush will feel extremely stiff at first, like a boar bristle bath brush.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re serious about clean teeth</li>
            <li> As some reviews state, there is occasional bristle loss, and be aware that they are stiff!</li>
            <li> I am still using the first one which is going on for two months and the bristle&#x27;s are still hard and functional without falling out.</li>
            <li> but they do not last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a more hard bristle toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The head is large, but being a small lady with teeth jammed in the back of my mouth</li>
            <li> I have got the occasional bristle loose in my mouth</li>
            <li> As the ADA gains control of our health, firm toothbrushes are being pushed out of retailers, leaving soft bristle brushes that are ineffective at cleaning teeth.  </li>
            <li> Strange and inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are LONG</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard at all, you should not rate and sell this as a hard toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the next day thinking it was just a few loose ones and</li>
            <li> Maybe pull the old ides bristles out and put it in with hard plastics.</li>
            <li> Once you have become use to a Hard Natural Bristle tooth brush nothing else will do.</li>
            <li> the &#x27;hard&#x27; bristle is anything but, especially after the second brushing.</li>
            <li> I guess the natural hair absorbs water and loses its rigidity?</li>
            <li> There is a dip where the head is, which makes it harder to manuever the head where it needs to go.  </li>
            <li> However, after only a few uses the bristles began to loosen and it became softer.</li>
            <li> Wish it was harder.</li>
            <li> I wish the bristles were even harder</li>
            <li> I have not tried the other 2</li>
            <li> If you are looking to have less plastic scraping around your planet every day...</li>
            <li> I switched to these in an effort to have less plastic in my mouth.</li>
            <li> If you soak them in water for a minute (or less) before brushing they&#x27;ll be a little softer.</li>
            <li> having said that, it did take a little to get used to the size of it</li>
            <li> Hence, I resorted to Amazon to try and find a truly firm toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was plenty firm enough but it is made poorly.</li>
            <li> These are listed as \\&quot;hard\\&quot;, and believe me, the bristles are extremely stiff.  </li>
            <li> It is not as firm as described, at least for me.</li>
            <li> no sale... or, in my case, no more sale.</li>
            <li> Handle is thin difficult to grip, this is a HUGE disappointment.</li>
            <li> Impossible to find anything but soft and medium in stores anymore and</li>
            <li> Trying to find a toothbrush that is rated hard or firm is impossible these days, in any local store, every display has these things that leave your mouth like ...</li>
            <li> I like a hard tooth brush to brush my teeth, gums &amp; tongue, like you could buy in the 1960&#x27;s, 70&#x27;s &amp; 80&#x27;s &amp; you can not find them anymore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was deceiving to read that it was hard.</li>
            <li> The bristle&#x27;s are hard which is the way I like my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Gave up on manual toothbrushes some years ago when the dental police convinced everyone that a firm bristle toothbrush was a fate worse than death.</li>
            <li> They are very hard, and not suitable for brush teeth.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> The bristles are HARD at first(man!)</li>
            <li> A waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> A waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I was unable to find hard toothbrushes for over a decade.</li>
            <li> Very poorly designed and poor quality.</li>
            <li> the bristles fell out immediately and it was useless.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed, and angry and...</li>
            <li> The bristles brake off to soon and its annoying.</li>
            <li> like the fact they they&#x27;re \\&quot;natural\\&quot;, but beyond that they are, to me, the worst toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/16/12:&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> Horrible experience!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These work great for my dogs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this tooth brush for about 6 months now and is holding up well.</li>
            <li> These are listed as \\&quot;hard\\&quot;, and believe me, the bristles are extremely stiff.  Also, they have a very strong odor of badger hair (similar to the smell of a badger brush used in men&#x27;s shaving).  If you don&#x27;t mind brushing your teeth with something that smells like a wild animal, give these a shot.   The two-star review is for the two reasons above, and because these only come in a 3-pack, and it would be nice to try one out without having to buy 3.</li>
            <li> It is not as firm as described, at least for me. It has a full head of bristles but some of the bristles fall out in the 1st month of use. I like a hard tooth brush to brush my teeth, gums &amp; tongue, like you could buy in the 1960&#x27;s, 70&#x27;s &amp; 80&#x27;s &amp; you can not find them anymore. So I went back to a dentures toothbrush &amp; cut off the smaller amount of bristles on the one side &amp; everything is fine for me again.</li>
            <li> In the picture, the handle appears to be wood; however its plastic. Even though it seems to be a very strong and durable plastic handle, it is plastic. However, the bristles are great; they are firm and secure and left my teeth squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> As the ADA gains control of our health, firm toothbrushes are being pushed out of retailers, leaving soft bristle brushes that are ineffective at cleaning teeth.  Hence, I resorted to Amazon to try and find a truly firm toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, the bristles were somewhere between medium and firm.  Then, about a month into it, they began to lose most of their sturdiness.  Now, they are way too soft to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also do not like the contour of the handle.  There is a dip where the head is, which makes it harder to manuever the head where it needs to go.  Most toothbrushes are angled upward towards the head;  this one dips down.  Strange and inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact they they&#x27;re \\&quot;natural\\&quot;, but beyond that they are, to me, the worst toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/16/12:&lt;br /&gt;Upon going to the second of the three brushes I got, this one is much stiffer.  It tends to get soft if wet a lot, but it is much stiffer than the first one.  I wonder if the first one I tried was actually not a firm one but a mispackaged medium one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upped to three stars.  This second brush is a 4-star brush but the first one was a dud so good luck on getting three firm ones.</li>
            <li> the &#x27;hard&#x27; bristle is anything but, especially after the second brushing. does not feel like it is cleaning my teeth/gums very well. if the bristles stayed hard for longer than 5 minutes, this would be my favorite toothbrush</li>
            <li> I had great expectation due to the other reviewers here, but maybe its the cross between my vampire and British combined teeth that these did not hold up for me at all.  All three were used and gone within 3 weeks.  But to be fair, as noted above, my teeth are very crooked and rough on a toothbrush, and I do scrub thoroughly and at a moderate pressure.

If you have regular, uniform good teeth, they may be perfect; but for my teeth, they just didn&#x27;t work.  Felt good on my teeth the first few times I&#x27;d use one, then the flaring would make them impossible to use.  Was worth a shot though, as firm toothbrushes are getting harder to find and more expensive when I do find them.</li>
            <li> They are very hard, and not suitable for brush teeth.  I used them to clean my nails now.</li>
            <li> Horrible experience! Bristles fall out and get stuck between teeth and inside mouth...I dread using this toothbrush as I threw my old one out and haven&#x27;t had time to replace this yet. Handle is thin difficult to grip, this is a HUGE disappointment. Very poorly designed and poor quality.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re serious about clean teeth this is the brush you need.</li>
            <li> Finally a hard bristle toothbrush, and it softens only minimally after the first couple of uses to a really good brush... having said that, it did take a little to get used to the size of it, it did at first feel like a bit big but now it&#x27;s great...</li>
            <li> These are nice large tooth brushes, but they start spreading sooner than I would like. The handle is a good design. I have looked far and wide for a good brush. What happened to the nice Colgate straight large tooth brush for 1.25??? My 20 year old son likes these also..</li>
            <li> I have no idea if natural bristles are better than synthetic, but I love this toothbrush.  It seems to hold up as well or better than synthetic.  Handle is still plastic, so I don&#x27;t know how to recycle this.  Maybe pull the old ides bristles out and put it in with hard plastics.</li>
            <li> Once you have become use to a Hard Natural Bristle tooth brush nothing else will do. I can&#x27;t get these in the UK and the service was very good.</li>
            <li> The swissco toothbrush has a noticeably larger head which may be uncomfortable at first to some, but i think it&#x27;s great.  The bristles are firm enough to clean the tongue really well, yet they do not tear up my gums. I would reccomend.  Might not be suitable for weiner boys. haha</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an odd smell at first, but they work better than nylon.</li>
            <li> Nice firm bristles, good handle. I wish I could find a natural bristle/non-plastic handle toothbrush at this price (or better!). As some reviews state, there is occasional bristle loss, and be aware that they are stiff! These are the &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; bristles, and they&#x27;re going to be much firmer than the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; nylon bristles on your average cheap toothbrush. If you soak them in water for a minute (or less) before brushing they&#x27;ll be a little softer.</li>
            <li> The bristles brake off to soon and its annoying.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not too hard or soft but are too big to use comfortably.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever!</li>
            <li> The bristles do come out easily after say about 10 uses??? WHY????</li>
            <li> I was unable to find hard toothbrushes for over a decade. My theory is: The do not sell them to the public anymore so dentist have more business removing accumulated tartar at a very high price. I am very satisfied with these toothbrushes but they do not last for a long time.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not used to a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; bristle brush, I didn&#x27;t realize it would go soft after only one use. I love the tortoise and the idea of natural but bought the brush thinking the bristles would stay firm. I guess the natural hair absorbs water and loses its rigidity?</li>
            <li> I am obsessive about my teeth, and I must have a toothbrush that REALLY CLEANS, and these brushes really do clean your teeth.  When I run my tongue over my teeth after brushing, I am confident all day long.</li>
            <li> These are nice toothbrushes but they should not be classified as \\&quot;Hard\\&quot;. I would describe it as \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; on the first and second use and \\&quot;Soft\\&quot; thereafter. Still looking for something to replace the firm toothbrushes I used to be able to buy at CVS.</li>
            <li> Gave up on manual toothbrushes some years ago when the dental police convinced everyone that a firm bristle toothbrush was a fate worse than death. Impossible to find anything but soft and medium in stores anymore and even the medium are so soft that they simply dont clean my teeth.  Gave up switched to a SoniCare which I love.  Getting ready to travel overseas an in the effort to travel as light as possible, I thought of looking on Amazon for a firm manual brush.  Decided on this one and it&#x27;s actually quite acceptable.  Mouth feels clean when I&#x27;m done.  Not going to give up my SoniCare, but for travel, these brushes will do quite nicely.  Quality brush, firm bristles (but not so much as to irritate) and decent price.</li>
            <li> Too good to use, the brush is very soft when using on enamel as it possess no harm to any part of mouth/ teeth highly recommended for youngest and older ages most especially those who are having damage, trouble or fragile gum but friendly toughs in cleaning all mouth. Without prejudice , I sincerely recommend its usage. ITS EXCELLENT</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this toothbrush when I first opened it. It was plenty firm enough but it is made poorly. The very first time I tried brushing with it the bristles started falling out. I tried the next day thinking it was just a few loose ones and this time ended up with a mouth full of them. I have not tried the other 2 yet but I&#x27;m betting the same thing will happen. A waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> LOOKS GOOD ,BUT I HAVENT USE IT YET</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. I love it.</li>
            <li> Cleans great old school style toothbrushes</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a way to avoid scraping a bunch of plastic around your mouth every day - keep looking. If you are looking to have less plastic scraping around your planet every day... ditto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these on a gamble - since the product description (and that includes the one at the Swissco site) does not say what the handles are made of. Amazon search on \\&quot;wooden toothbrush\\&quot; pops up these among others. Great search engine, eh! Apparently we have gotten to the point that the default material for a product is plastic!. Packaged separately in plastic cylinders and then into a plastic ziploc. Sigh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side the bristles are apparently natural. I didn&#x27;t detect the smell of badger fur (!) another reviewer mentioned (how does one know that?). A few bristles came out on the first brushing but it seems to be holding together otherwise. The handle is about an inch too short for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t care about the fossil fuels used to make plastic, and the toxic hormone-emulating chemicals in most plastics, and the ten-thousand-year landfill mountains of plastic we are leaving our grandkids then keep buying this sort of junk. If you do care then join me in posting reviews like this that tell manufacturers plastic &#x3D; no sale... or, in my case, no more sale.</li>
            <li> I really care about my teeth and I have heard that soft bristles arenâ€™t as good at cleaning as the hard bristles are. I purchased these because I thought for 3 of them it was a good price and figured they would last me a while. At first I will say that the one I was using was sturdy and firm. However, after only a few uses the bristles began to loosen and it became softer. In addition to that some of the bristles actually fell out in my mouth while I brushed. I never had that problem with a toothbrush before. I was hoping for more and am pretty let down by these brushes.</li>
            <li> worthless---ready to throw away&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after qne use</li>
            <li> These things work great. You really feel the natural bristles scrubbing while you brush.&lt;br /&gt;A caution: Don&#x27;t buy these and then complain because they lose some bristles, because they do.&lt;br /&gt;Today&#x27;s all-plastic wonders last forever, but don&#x27;t clean worth a darn in comparison to these.</li>
            <li> May be because its natrual bristal t can not have consistancy - first 3 pack was good lasted almost a year just gor second one bristals are fadding in 2 weeks. No matter what but this cleans the tteth lot better than regular brush.</li>
            <li> I think it work&#x27;s well. Wish it was harder.It&lt;br /&gt; is very gentle on teeth if you like a medium brush.</li>
            <li> i was so happy to find these toothbrushes online at a very reasonable price, but they only last about 8-10 days before the bristles begin coming loose as you brush.  i do believe in changing my toothbrush regularly, but not that often!  So... happy day they are natural bristles, but have you ever tried picking toothbrush fibers out of your teeth?  enough said!  i will not purchase them again.</li>
            <li> It is not Tooth Brush, it will be useful for carpet brush!!! not buy this product! A waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard at all, you should not rate and sell this as a hard toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;It was deceiving to read that it was hard.</li>
            <li> Too many loose hairs.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a more hard bristle toothbrush. I used the Swissco tooth brush and I love it and will use them from now on. The bristle&#x27;s are hard which is the way I like my toothbrush. It last longer than the soft or medium bristle toothbrush. I would recommend these to anyone who want to save on buying soft and medium toothbrushes that don&#x27;t last but for a two week period. These toothbrushes will last much longer. I am still using the first one which is going on for two months and the bristle&#x27;s are still hard and functional without falling out.</li>
            <li> I am a natural bristle convert for life. I switched to these in an effort to have less plastic in my mouth. Be aware that the handle on this is plastic but the bristles are natural, so a step in the right direction. They clean much better than nylon toothbrushes. You could even use it without toothpaste if you wanted and it would still do a great job. The head is large, but being a small lady with teeth jammed in the back of my mouth I can still get to them all. The brush will feel extremely stiff at first, like a boar bristle bath brush. But if you be sure to give the bristles a good soak under the faucet and use light pressure at first, they will soften over time. They last a good while, about as long as any other toothbrush. I have got the occasional bristle loose in my mouth but that&#x27;s rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave these 4 stars is because I have since started making my own toothpaste using coconut oil. Something about the oil causes the plastic brush head to split and crack after about a month - premature for this brush.  I will be switching to a wood or bone handle to see how it holds up.  But if you are still using toothpaste from the store then this brush is a win - I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> very pleased with these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Reading the comments about these, I eagerly bought six.  Skipping to the second one for a minute, it was everything the 5-star comments promised, and I was SO glad!  Trying to find a toothbrush that is rated hard or firm is impossible these days, in any local store, every display has these things that leave your mouth like ... I don&#x27;t even have to finish, because I&#x27;m sure all of you know.  It&#x27;s perfect...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT the first one I opened, as eagerly as I&#x27;d ordered, was NOT hard.  It wasn&#x27;t even the old-fashioned Medium, when &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; meant something.  It was baby soft.  I was so disappointed, and angry and...just wondering where I&#x27;d ever find anything like I needed.  I used it...out of fear, mostly.  Which is also why I didn&#x27;t open the rest to see if they were all soft.  The bristles on this first one even swayed and bent at the barest touch of a fingertip.  And the fear I had was that the others I bought were soft like this, too.  And yes, it WAS labelled &amp;#34;Hard&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t opened the last four yet, because of that same worry I had.  But for the nonce, I&#x27;m beaming, because it&#x27;s so wonderful to have a toothbrush that actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I&#x27;d give it ten stars if I could.</li>
            <li> For people with stains on the teeth or who want very clean teeth, these are very good. I wish the bristles were even harder but I am glad they make these. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush I have ever owned in my opinion. Worth the price and subscription. Store bought toothbrushes do not stand a chance against the Swissco.</li>
            <li> Very good,cleans all your teeth. Much better than those plastic bristle toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Strong handle, sheds a few bristles but not bad.  Stiff bristles make it good for various cleaning jobs, not just teeth.</li>
            <li> I used to have to buy natural bristles in Paris to satisfy my preference.I found this one at Amazon and it more than suits the purpose.</li>
            <li> I love these, but I don&#x27;t buy them to brush my teeth.  I use them to clean around faucets in the kitchen and bathroom.  I use them on hard to clean areas, like where the molding meets the walls and floors.  They are very good for cleaning hard to reach areas, in my experience.  Can&#x27;t tell you how they are for teeth, haven&#x27;t used them for that.</li>
            <li> I have gotten these \\&quot;natural\\&quot; toothbrushes quite a while back(not this brand but whatever was available @ health food store etc) and the bristles fell out immediately and it was useless. I gave up 20 yrs ago on natural brushes. This is now my second try and so far it is super great and I love it. The bristles are LONG so I trimmed a bit with sizzors which was a snap. The bristles are HARD at first(man!) but soften perfectly in a brush or two and settle in to a perfect fit to the teeth and between. Lots of bristles make it feel like no junk gets brushed over. Feels like I get a really good job done, like no other plastic brush I ever used. It works as I always suspected, feels like a WAY better clean, like orders of magnitude. Seriously. I am TOTALLY sold.. . .  OK  (6months later) They sure do stay firm, those bristles!! I got the SOFT pack too, which are also great, with well packed bristles for a firm but gentle brushing. Now I alter between the 2. These brushes are great and durable and gentle without feeling whimpy. ;) LOVE is not too strong a word to express my adoration of these natural brushes. ;) Since I have and use both hard and not of this brush, I&#x27;d say  If this was helpful please click yes, thanks!</li>
