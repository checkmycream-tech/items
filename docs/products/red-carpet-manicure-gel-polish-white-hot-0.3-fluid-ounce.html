    <ol>
            <li>Very happy.</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>Looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Looks amazing with \\&quot;the winner is\\&quot; shade.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I had to apply about 2-3 nice coats for it to look nice and nonstreaky.</li>
            <li>Is on of many RCM gel polishes I own.</li>
            <li>This is the best white gel polish I have found.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite brand</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li>The perfect summer white!  </li>
            <li>However, unlike most of my UV cured polishes that harden under the lamp in about 60 seconds, this one took way longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, Okay quality, wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>I love this LED nail polish system.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try it again this weekend when I&#x27;m more relaxed</li>
            <li>i have the kit and inside was the red color very good quality.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good as new!</li>
            <li>This system is really easy to do at home</li>
            <li>This color is streaky and I don&#x27;t like the way it cures under the LED light.</li>
            <li>Great for french manicures.</li>
            <li>This is a polish that is used under a UV light.</li>
            <li>I used it with my nailuv kit (LED light, and their base/top coat combo polish)</li>
            <li>A beautiful true red.  </li>
            <li>so I was excited to try.  </li>
            <li>It takes longer, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>Matches in with many different wardrobe combinations.  </li>
            <li>Love it and Red Carpet Nails.</li>
            <li>The little bit of chipping I have experienced, I just filed it down around the chip, then applied a couple more coats to fill it in (curing between coats, of course), put on a new to coat</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved how long gel manicures last</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really trying to give it a chance</li>
            <li>The nail polish comes out really streaky.  </li>
            <li>I really do like this polish.</li>
            <li>Vibrant color to be white and good coverage, you don&#x27;t have to apply super thick.</li>
            <li>This is a true white.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it for dots and design on darker colors.</li>
            <li>Make sure you are aware that this is a very small size polish.</li>
            <li>This is a new brand that I&#x27;m trying</li>
            <li>I really wanted a white polish to build nail art on</li>
            <li>The past few months my fingernails have not been growing as much as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>Used White Hot to paint French Manicure.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had it on for over a week with barely any chipping at all.</li>
            <li>and hopefully it won&#x27;t be a hot mess this time.</li>
            <li>I go to open the bottle last night, which was the first time I had ever opened it, and it was EMPTY.  </li>
            <li>It WILL NOT dry by itself and needs to be cured with a lamp!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Last night I realized that my nails were finally long enough to use my white nail polish that I bought before the holiday&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This is actually a solid white unlike other gels where it looks white in the bottle, but is  actually see through.</li>
            <li> The colour was so hard to build and it was very runny (if that makes sense).</li>
            <li> and it lasts just as long as a salon gel manicure.</li>
            <li> In order for it to look decent I need to apply at least three coats.</li>

            <li> The white isn&#x27;t white enough and its consistency/coat is thin.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much a waste of money and useless for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> had it ever dried</li>
            <li> Not too thin and not to thick for a french manicure.  </li>
            <li> that I was not able to use this polish.</li>
            <li> Four stars because the bottle is sooooo small.</li>
            <li> the  white color is to liquide, when you put a very thin on your nails he flow away.............</li>
            <li> It comes out really strange and smells quite bad.</li>
            <li> Looks like applying water ,with this color is supposed to be &amp;#34;WHITE&amp;#34; to make french manicure tip :(</li>
            <li> Remember to apply thin coats of gel.  </li>
            <li> but they are so expensive to get at a salon.</li>
            <li> Hate it, not what I expected and worst thing</li>
            <li> but by then I was frustrated.</li>
            <li> Really hate this nail polish.</li>

            <li> Bought this to do designs on my nails. The white isn&#x27;t white enough and its consistency/coat is thin.  Pretty much a waste of money and useless for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> Make sure you are aware that this is a very small size polish.</li>
            <li> This is the best white gel polish I have found.  Not too thin and not to thick for a french manicure.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> The past few months my fingernails have not been growing as much as I would have liked.  Last night I realized that my nails were finally long enough to use my white nail polish that I bought before the holiday&#x27;s.  I have never done a french manicure on my nails with this type of polish before so I was excited to try.  I go to open the bottle last night, which was the first time I had ever opened it, and it was EMPTY.  Needless to say that it was a huge let down that I was not able to use this polish.</li>
            <li> This is a new brand that I&#x27;m trying and I&#x27;m really trying to give it a chance but I don&#x27;t know. I got this color off of hautelook( they always have gel on sale (ManiMonday). This color is streaky and I don&#x27;t like the way it cures under the LED light. It&#x27;s not my favorite brand</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. This is actually a solid white unlike other gels where it looks white in the bottle, but is  actually see through.</li>
            <li> The perfect summer white!  Looks amazing. Vibrant color to be white and good coverage, you don&#x27;t have to apply super thick.</li>
            <li> Great for french manicures.</li>
            <li> This is a polish that is used under a UV light. It WILL NOT dry by itself and needs to be cured with a lamp!&lt;br /&gt;I found this polish to be alright.... I had to apply about 2-3 nice coats for it to look nice and nonstreaky.However, unlike most of my UV cured polishes that harden under the lamp in about 60 seconds, this one took way longer. I had to cure it for about 2.5 minutes and even then when I would touch it, it didn&#x27;t feel hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Okay quality, wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Hate it, not what I expected and worst thing I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> A beautiful true red.  Matches in with many different wardrobe combinations.  Remember to apply thin coats of gel.  It takes longer, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a true white. I mainly use it for dots and design on darker colors. But if you are aiming for french manicure, then this is the white you want. Looks amazing with \\&quot;the winner is\\&quot; shade.&lt;br /&gt;Note: This is for use with the Red Carpet Manicure system.</li>
            <li> I love this LED nail polish system. I&#x27;ve always loved how long gel manicures last but they are so expensive to get at a salon. This system is really easy to do at home and it lasts just as long as a salon gel manicure. It&#x27;s no different than the UV versions. Definitely recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Used White Hot to paint French Manicure.  Love it and Red Carpet Nails.</li>
            <li> i have the kit and inside was the red color very good quality. the  white color is to liquide, when you put a very thin on your nails he flow away.............</li>
            <li> This. Is on of many RCM gel polishes I own. I really wanted a white polish to build nail art on but this was so dissapointing. The colour was so hard to build and it was very runny (if that makes sense). I used 4 coats to get the colour on but by then I was frustrated. I took it off that same day. I&#x27;ll try it again this weekend when I&#x27;m more relaxed and hopefully it won&#x27;t be a hot mess this time.</li>
            <li> The nail polish comes out really streaky.  In order for it to look decent I need to apply at least three coats.</li>
            <li> Looks like applying water ,with this color is supposed to be &amp;#34;WHITE&amp;#34; to make french manicure tip :(</li>
            <li> I really do like this polish. I used it with my nailuv kit (LED light, and their base/top coat combo polish) and I&#x27;ve had it on for over a week with barely any chipping at all. The little bit of chipping I have experienced, I just filed it down around the chip, then applied a couple more coats to fill it in (curing between coats, of course), put on a new to coat and it&#x27;s good as new! Very happy. Four stars because the bottle is sooooo small.</li>
            <li> Really hate this nail polish. It comes out really strange and smells quite bad. It would have taken multiple coats to get it to look truly white on my nails had it ever dried; it stays almost runny/gooey like.</li>
