            <li>daughter is THRILLED with the results and wanted me to include her statement in this review: &amp;#34;Anyone who is struggling with acne should give this product a try.  </li>

            <li>I have had acne most of my life even now</li>

            <li>I have since purchased Grandpas Thylox,  much better.  </li>
            <li>Love this soap.  </li>
            <li>Love it and plan to buy it again.</li>
            <li>This soap seems to help much better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>but I think I found another one which one was a bit better than this one.</li>
            <li>This soap has more than met my hopeful expectations, delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li>This soap is okay.</li>
            <li>Because, even at 50 years of age, I still occasionally breakout with acne and that stuff was the best thing for it.</li>
            <li>Sure</li>
            <li>May not work for everyone but l love it.</li>
            <li>Have used this several times and like the way it lathers and seems to be a great product good price.</li>
            <li>Those seem to work alot better.</li>
            <li>I am going to try another Sulfur soap to see how my skin responds, then place future orders for the soap that is best for my skin.  </li>
            <li>It clears up acne and keeps the skin healthy.  </li>
            <li>It is a great soap, leaves skin feeling fresh and clean with no residue.</li>
            <li>Keep striving for beautiful clear skin</li>
            <li>Great way to keep clear skin!</li>
            <li>Really great for helping to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>and I have a strong nose.</li>
            <li>Works fine for what I use it for.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say if the product works yet because I just started using it last night, but it got great reviews</li>
            <li>i got a similar product for 20 dollars and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Affordable compared to alternatives, works as advertised - so far so good.</li>
            <li>Product melted quickly and the concentration was not that strong</li>
            <li>This product seems to dry it up and smooth out my face for a really great look.</li>
            <li>just channel your innner hot spring:)</li>
            <li>The size is a bit small but it works great!</li>
            <li>After 2 nights of using this my hormonal/cystic acne cleared up significantly.</li>
            <li>This is the original Fostex soap.  </li>
            <li>I will stick with the original because it works.  </li>
            <li>Works well for my wife and her  efforts to clean her face and get her morning ritual done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple of weeks, but I have had good results.  </li>
            <li>Skin feel super clean after use.</li>
            <li>This sulfur soap by Braunfels Labs contains the full 10% sulfur as in a prescription, for a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Some residual smell after but not bad and not noticable by anyone but me</li>
            <li>I had some telling me my skin looked so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;She has a wonderful dermatologist who has - at parents&#x27; request - eased her from topical prescription treatments into oral medications over the last year.  </li>
            <li>This is the best sulfur soap I have used so far, it&#x27;s gentle on my aggravated dry skin and not overly perfumed.</li>
            <li>Seems to help calm the allergic reaction some, but no miracle.</li>
            <li>but I would have preferred that smell over this powerful scent.  </li>
            <li>My teenage daughter tried it and really liked it.</li>
            <li>but compared to the cost of a dermatologist it&#x27;s seriously worth it.</li>
            <li>My husband had some kind of fungus on his back.</li>
            <li>Since sulfur soaps are not easily found in stores, this is great.</li>
            <li>It really makes your skin feel so clean... Not too drying .  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I didn&#x27;t have to make an appointment at the dermatologists, spend half my day off there, and pay a large co pay for an Rx product.</li>
            <li>got it super fast a</li>
            <li>Who knew something so basic and simple as this would work great on my face?  </li>
            <li>I Love this soap, i just wish it was bigger!</li>
            <li>I get breakouts on my chin the most and forehead second.</li>
            <li>Bought this exact product and will be buying again when I run out.</li>
            <li>I panicked when I searched... and searched.. all over for Penox facial scrub, only to find it discontinued on many, many Web sites.</li>
            <li>almost cleared with the first use.</li>
            <li>Done with spending a fortune on Pro-Active which has less sulfur and costs so much more!</li>
            <li>i got this for so cheap and its exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Definately leaves a strong sulfur odor on your skin and clothing, especially if you sweat.</li>
            <li>I have mild breakouts due to monthly fluctuations (hormonal) and this works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>Her skin is also now clear from breakouts and fresh looking.</li>
            <li>Might work from someone who has really oily skin.</li>
            <li>It really does the trick</li>
            <li>Thank you sooooooo much</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>fast shipping.thanks diana</li>
            <li>We had great results, dramatic changes even after the 2 day of use.</li>
            <li>Have used Sulfer flowers before, long ago &amp; believe the soap bar is by far better.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing standing between me and a face full of pimples.</li>
            <li>This soap has really helped to calm the red itchy skin on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li>so I have high expectation.</li>
            <li>The product hasn&#x27;t really helped I thought by the reviews it would clear my face up and that was not the case.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are gentle for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Did not work just dried out my skin and caused more oil production.</li>
            <li>Less expensive and more effective than R&amp;F unblemish cleanser.</li>
            <li>After a few days of use I have noticed a huge difference in my complexion.  </li>
            <li>This soap helped clear up my skin in just a week without having to change my diet or anything else.</li>
            <li>I take with zinc pills to help clear up body acne.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and keeps it clear of  acne.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 11 and has had every type of over the counter products on her face since 9 years old.</li>
            <li>this was my 2nd go round with sulfur soap as the reviews said it was used on people with the most sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer and my face is clear from adult acne.</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised by this soap.</li>
            <li>I purchased this specifically for my adult acne.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and rosacea.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult</li>
            <li>I have adult acne.</li>
            <li>As a woman with fair skin this can be terribly frustrating as I am not one who can contain herself from popping pimples to help speed up the process of healing!</li>
            <li>I actually could not use this soap long enough to come to any conclusion because of the strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li>* Start out using the sulfur soap at night only for the first seven to ten days&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im really not sure why a 10% sulfur soap (fragrance free) would smell this way.</li>
            <li>I was thoroughly surprised and pleased as I didn&#x27;t expect it until late next week.  </li>
            <li>She saw an immediate improvement within the first two or three days and even greater improvement in her acne over the past few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It arrived in less than 48 hours and i began to use it right away as i had some cystic acne on my cheek and chin.</li>
            <li>This soap barely smells like sulfur and smells like there&#x27;s fragrance to mask the sulfur.</li>
            <li>My face didn&#x27;t get better but it didn&#x27;t get worse.</li>
            <li>It did not dry out my skin</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a good thing and bad thing but its necessary.</li>

            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and rosacea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult</li>
            <li> I have adult acne.</li>
            <li> As a woman with fair skin this can be terribly frustrating as I am not one who can contain herself from popping pimples to help speed up the process of healing!</li>
            <li> I actually could not use this soap long enough to come to any conclusion because of the strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li> * Start out using the sulfur soap at night only for the first seven to ten days&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im really not sure why a 10% sulfur soap (fragrance free) would smell this way.</li>
            <li> I was thoroughly surprised and pleased as I didn&#x27;t expect it until late next week.  </li>
            <li> She saw an immediate improvement within the first two or three days and even greater improvement in her acne over the past few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It arrived in less than 48 hours and i began to use it right away as i had some cystic acne on my cheek and chin.</li>
            <li> This soap barely smells like sulfur and smells like there&#x27;s fragrance to mask the sulfur.</li>
            <li> My face didn&#x27;t get better but it didn&#x27;t get worse.</li>
            <li> It did not dry out my skin</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a good thing and bad thing but its necessary.</li>
            <li> Yes it worked very well and lessened the small bumps.</li>
            <li> but I can get past that for clear skin!</li>
            <li> I think because I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and does the trick for my face.  </li>
            <li> Lately it seems as though when one pimple/nodule starts to disappear up pop 2 or 3 new ones.</li>
            <li> The only things is my face gets a little dry</li>
            <li> I am a African American woman I have had a hard time with my oily skin and breakouts for a long time.</li>
            <li> It has helped reduce the acne on my daughter&#x27;s face, it doesn&#x27;t dry her skin as other soaps have.</li>
            <li> Cleared and dried all pimples within days of using soap twice daily!!</li>
            <li> In our research, we found a few designer brand acne treatment products contained only 2-4 percent sulfur, and that prescription strength sulfur acne treatment is 10%.  </li>
            <li> My sides from my underarms down became irritated and dry and it was to the point that I had to stop using this product.</li>
            <li> As parents, we were very hesitant to put our child on oral medication for a &amp;#34;cosmetic&amp;#34; purpose, but our daughter&#x27;s acne was getting worse and becoming physically painful for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An esthetician friend mentioned that she might want to try a product containing sulfur.  </li>
            <li> this actually made my sensitive skin worse!</li>
            <li> I bought this looking to clear up my face, I was tired of peroxide products bleach my cloths, pillows, and towels.</li>
            <li> I tried their Sal-3 soap which is a bit stronger and can be irritating to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> So far, it has been less than a week of use, and as expected with any sskin treatment, skin got a little worse.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it would help keep my break outs down.</li>
            <li> and I could care less.</li>
            <li> It may take a little getting used to the fragrance, but</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s drying and smells a little funky on the skin</li>
            <li> Just waste my face with the soap</li>
            <li> Sulfur soap is one of the few soaps I can use with my  myriad of skin allergies.</li>
            <li> it being too harsh for my skin thus burning it.</li>
            <li> If I can bring myself to use it for a few weeks I will update this comment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap on my face and body for a few months now.</li>
            <li> This product did in fact control my acne, but was way too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> and it actually made it a bit worse.</li>
            <li> AGAIN.Have to lather it for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> It smells the worse when actively washing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also incorporated using a Nandiola fade cream at night to lighten/fade scars and what I have been doing has helped in lessening my bad outbreak to a normal outbreak of a couple of pimples</li>
            <li> Hard to believe there is no fragrance in it.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely diligent about my skincare and try to always maintain a tedious routine.</li>
            <li> Also noticed some faint lines and dark spots have faded.</li>
            <li> My rosacea flared up even worse after using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always worse around my period</li>
            <li> i woke up and the painful bumps that was there the night before had dried up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and my skin broke out in terrible hormonal acne after discontinuing birth control.</li>
            <li> Sounds silly</li>
            <li> This soap is sulfur based so it is going to have a bad odor of course</li>
            <li> too bad...</li>
            <li> Acne became an issue of mine about 10 years ago, and has been on a pattern where I will have bad break outs every 2 years like clockwork.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best sulfur soap I have used so far, it&#x27;s gentle on my aggravated dry skin and not overly perfumed. Occasionally you get a whif of the eggy sulfur but it&#x27;s not bad at all. This soap has really helped to calm the red itchy skin on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> works great, smell not so great....just channel your innner hot spring:)</li>
            <li> I love my sulfur soap! It arrived in less than 48 hours and i began to use it right away as i had some cystic acne on my cheek and chin. i woke up and the painful bumps that was there the night before had dried up. I will be ordering more before I run out</li>
            <li> Not sure. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I am a African American woman I have had a hard time with my oily skin and breakouts for a long time. This soap helped clear up my skin in just a week without having to change my diet or anything else. Just waste my face with the soap and I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Affordable compared to alternatives, works as advertised - so far so good.</li>
            <li> I had some telling me my skin looked so fresh and clean.  it will make you look cute in the face.</li>
            <li> It has helped reduce the acne on my daughter&#x27;s face, it doesn&#x27;t dry her skin as other soaps have.</li>
            <li> I bought this looking to clear up my face, I was tired of peroxide products bleach my cloths, pillows, and towels. The product hasn&#x27;t really helped I thought by the reviews it would clear my face up and that was not the case. My face didn&#x27;t get better but it didn&#x27;t get worse.</li>
            <li> I Love this soap, i just wish it was bigger! The size is a bit small but it works great!</li>
            <li> Really great for helping to clear up my skin. I have had acne most of my life even now and I&#x27;m 32. My face has never been clearer! This soap is sulfur based so it is going to have a bad odor of course but I can get past that for clear skin! This sulfur soap is way cheaper than buying R+F line for almost $200 for their sulfur cleanser.</li>
            <li> Smells a tad funky..but it works GREAT! No breakouts!</li>
            <li> Love it! Less expensive and more effective than R&amp;F unblemish cleanser.</li>
            <li> Product melted quickly and the concentration was not that strong</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars because i reall didnt get much of a result smells great though its was nice wraped got it super fast a</li>
            <li> Sulfur soap is one of the few soaps I can use with my  myriad of skin allergies. This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> not my favorite, kinda like crisco with sulfer. have to soak it before each use i prefer grisi bio sulfer soap.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this on Tuesday and I received my order last night.  I was thoroughly surprised and pleased as I didn&#x27;t expect it until late next week.  Can&#x27;t say if the product works yet because I just started using it last night, but it got great reviews so I have high expectation.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! My daughter is 11 and has had every type of over the counter products on her face since 9 years old. A friend of mine told me about this soap and how it helped her siblings. I decided to try it before I dragged my daughter into the dermatologist office. This product has improved her acne to the point of I don&#x27;t have to make an appointment. We had great results, dramatic changes even after the 2 day of use.</li>
            <li> this actually made my sensitive skin worse! several acne pimples AND darkening of the skin which i attribute to it being too harsh for my skin thus burning it. too bad...this was my 2nd go round with sulfur soap as the reviews said it was used on people with the most sensitive skin. just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I actually could not use this soap long enough to come to any conclusion because of the strong perfume smell. People complain about the smell of sulfur but I would have preferred that smell over this powerful scent.  Hard to believe there is no fragrance in it.  I had to seal it in a baggy and put it in the basement. Im really not sure why a 10% sulfur soap (fragrance free) would smell this way. If I can bring myself to use it for a few weeks I will update this comment. I have since purchased Grandpas Thylox,  much better.  I know if you don&#x27;t agree with this review you will mark it unhelpful and I could care less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap on my face and body for a few months now. My skin is softer and my face is clear from adult acne. My teenage daughter tried it and really liked it. Her skin is also now clear from breakouts and fresh looking. No makeup needed for either one of us. Also noticed some faint lines and dark spots have faded. I believe sulfur is suppose to assist with collagen renewal. The fact it&#x27;s inexpensive is a big plus.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  I used it as a teenager under a different brand name; but it works as well now as it did then.  It may take a little getting used to the fragrance, but I sort of like it.  Good stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Great product !!! Cleared and dried all pimples within days of using soap twice daily!! Love it and plan to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great soap for just about any problems, soothes chigger bites , jock itch, or any thing else that ails u and ur peckerwood.</li>
            <li> Even though I am no stranger to sulfur based products. I have been pleasantly surprised by this soap. I purchased this specifically for my adult acne. Lately it seems as though when one pimple/nodule starts to disappear up pop 2 or 3 new ones. As a woman with fair skin this can be terribly frustrating as I am not one who can contain herself from popping pimples to help speed up the process of healing! Sounds silly I know but I can not help myself. Acne became an issue of mine about 10 years ago, and has been on a pattern where I will have bad break outs every 2 years like clockwork. Using a combination of sulfur with benzoyl peroxide has helped. I&#x27;ve also incorporated using a Nandiola fade cream at night to lighten/fade scars and what I have been doing has helped in lessening my bad outbreak to a normal outbreak of a couple of pimples but this is nonetheless frustration as hell! My motto is prevention. I am extremely diligent about my skincare and try to always maintain a tedious routine. This soap has been a help... what I will warn those of you newcomers about this soap is that IF you have any pimples laying under the surface this soap will draw them out. That&#x27;s a good thing and bad thing but its necessary. that&#x27;s why when using this soap you need a benozyl peroxide like AcneFree Terminator 10 which is what I use daily for spot treatment.. and please whatever you do not forget the moisturizer/sunscreen!!!!!! This soap can help w body acne as well. The key is to be diligent, do not give up you are not the only one who has felt the sting of Acne.. Keep striving for beautiful clear skin it is obtainable!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and rosacea. This soap barely smells like sulfur and smells like there&#x27;s fragrance to mask the sulfur. My rosacea flared up even worse after using this.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son because he has some acne so he washes his face with it twice a day which dries up the acne followed by some ambi that  is blending his skin tone, so yes I think its working well for him</li>
            <li> This soap seems to help much better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  I do however get big pimples still, just one here or there.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I take with zinc pills to help clear up body acne. Would buy this again</li>
            <li> This sulphur soap is good but I think I found another one which one was a bit better than this one. But I still recommend this soap for the people who are suffering from skin problems.</li>
            <li> i got a similar product for 20 dollars and it worked great. i got this for so cheap and its exactly the same.</li>
            <li> This soap has more than met my hopeful expectations, delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> Works fine for what I use it for.</li>
            <li> Did not work just dried out my skin and caused more oil production.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my nephew who has just started getting acne.  I was happy with the reviews.</li>
            <li> This soap is okay. I think because I have dry skin it&#x27;s just over kill and it didn&#x27;t work for me. Might work from someone who has really oily skin.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for two weeks now.  Hoping that it is like Fostex that disappeared off the selves at the drugstores.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for over a month. I get breakouts on my chin the most and forehead second. This has drastically reduced that. It&#x27;s always worse around my period and it even changed that. I&#x27;ve had the clearest skin I&#x27;ve had since using this product. It smells the worse when actively washing. Some residual smell after but not bad and not noticable by anyone but me and I have a strong nose. Bought this exact product and will be buying again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Good product-fair price and excellent delivery.</li>
            <li> Great way to keep clear skin!</li>
            <li> I panicked when I searched... and searched.. all over for Penox facial scrub, only to find it discontinued on many, many Web sites. Because, even at 50 years of age, I still occasionally breakout with acne and that stuff was the best thing for it. However, I am SO HAPPY to find this sulfur soap. It really does the trick and I&#x27;m now a calm and happy camper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple of weeks, but I have had good results.  It is a very good product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SOAP!  Thank you sooooooo much</li>
            <li> Use this in the shower for my face.  It really makes your skin feel so clean... Not too drying .  Always keep this soap stocked up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and my skin broke out in terrible hormonal acne after discontinuing birth control. I was on a prescription face wash, Plexion(sodium sulfacetamine and sulfur), years ago which worked and so I thought I would try and find an OTC sulfur wash. After 2 nights of using this my hormonal/cystic acne cleared up significantly. I&#x27;m so happy I didn&#x27;t have to make an appointment at the dermatologists, spend half my day off there, and pay a large co pay for an Rx product. I will definitely be repurchasing this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult and I have acne. This is the only thing standing between me and a face full of pimples. Sure it&#x27;s drying and smells a little funky on the skin but compared to the cost of a dermatologist it&#x27;s seriously worth it.</li>
            <li> Who knew something so basic and simple as this would work great on my face?  Was pleasantly surprise that despite the high percentage of sulfur, the scent is nice!  Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and does the trick for my face.  I have mild breakouts due to monthly fluctuations (hormonal) and this works just fine for me. Can&#x27;t beat the price!  Done with spending a fortune on Pro-Active which has less sulfur and costs so much more!</li>
            <li> A very good product for acne.</li>
            <li> Very good cleanser. Skin feel super clean after use.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY thing that has helped my acne, including prescribed medicine from a dermatologist (Retin-A). I had bacterial acne, as opposed to hormonal acne, meaning it was on my cheeks and not on my T-zone. It works, I promise!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best soaps l ever used on my face. It did not dry out my skin&lt;br /&gt;and keeps it clear of  acne. May not work for everyone but l love it.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter has used this sulfur soap for almost a month.  She saw an immediate improvement within the first two or three days and even greater improvement in her acne over the past few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has a wonderful dermatologist who has - at parents&#x27; request - eased her from topical prescription treatments into oral medications over the last year.  As parents, we were very hesitant to put our child on oral medication for a &amp;#34;cosmetic&amp;#34; purpose, but our daughter&#x27;s acne was getting worse and becoming physically painful for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An esthetician friend mentioned that she might want to try a product containing sulfur.  In our research, we found a few designer brand acne treatment products contained only 2-4 percent sulfur, and that prescription strength sulfur acne treatment is 10%.  This sulfur soap by Braunfels Labs contains the full 10% sulfur as in a prescription, for a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is THRILLED with the results and wanted me to include her statement in this review: &amp;#34;Anyone who is struggling with acne should give this product a try.  If you do not see immediate results like I did, please give it the recommended two to four weeks to notice a difference.  It is changing my life!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also wanted to include the following information about the use of the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Start out using the sulfur soap at night only for the first seven to ten days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* If you experience any sensitivity or dryness, I recommend Braunfels Labs Sulfur Butter (also sold on Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* If you are seeing progress and your skin is tolerating the soap (and Sulfur Butter if needed), then after about day ten, begin using morning and evening (again using the Sulfur Butter if you experience any sensitivity.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* ALWAYS soak the bar for 20 seconds as directed!  Follow the instructions - they are there for a reason.</li>
            <li> This soap is very good for breakouts etc. almost cleared with the first use. Have used Sulfer flowers before, long ago &amp; believe the soap bar is by far better. Thank you for the introduction of the product.</li>
            <li> Works well for my wife and her  efforts to clean her face and get her morning ritual done.</li>
            <li> This product did in fact control my acne, but was way too harsh on my skin. My sides from my underarms down became irritated and dry and it was to the point that I had to stop using this product. I&#x27;m going to stick to my salicylic acid body wash because that did not cause such a sensitivity issue.</li>
            <li> Have used this several times and like the way it lathers and seems to be a great product good price.</li>
            <li> My husband had some kind of fungus on his back. The Dermatologist recommended he scrub his back in the shower with this soap. It did work to remove the fungal rash, so it is recommended.</li>
            <li> I have used sulfur soaps from Italy before. Those seem to work alot better. Since sulfur soaps are not easily found in stores, this is great. It is a great soap, leaves skin feeling fresh and clean with no residue. Definately leaves a strong sulfur odor on your skin and clothing, especially if you sweat. So far, it has been less than a week of use, and as expected with any sskin treatment, skin got a little worse. waiting to see what happens by week 2.</li>
            <li> Yes it worked very well and lessened the small bumps. The price was great also. I will order this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it would help keep my break outs down. I have adult acne. This product seems to dry it up and smooth out my face for a really great look. Thanks so much</li>
            <li> purchased for help with acne prone skin and it actually made it a bit worse.</li>
            <li> This product do not work in my opinion.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin after using for a month.</li>
            <li> Just recieved the soap cant wait to use it. Will let you know what i think.after use.such fast shipping.thanks diana</li>
            <li> I have gone through two bars of this soap.  It works!  Helps control acne prone skin.  I have been using it along with Sulfur Ointment to get rid of occasional breakouts.  I am going to try another Sulfur soap to see how my skin responds, then place future orders for the soap that is best for my skin.  No Sulfur odor problem.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my daughter&#x27;s acne after using twice a day for 10 days. This soap is almost identical to Fostex the acne bar I used as a teen!</li>
            <li> After a few days of use I have noticed a huge difference in my complexion.  My skin is smoother, and clearer. The only things is my face gets a little dry so I use a none pore clogging moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great product,and a good price too.Shipping was great fron USPS.WOULD BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.Have to lather it for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Bought on a recommendation to use after outdoor activity / bug bites.  Seems to help calm the allergic reaction some, but no miracle.</li>
            <li> This is the original Fostex soap.  I don&#x27;t know about all this nonsense about \\&quot;activating\\&quot;  the soap.  I just use it on my face with a washrag and warm water.  It is excellent for oily type skin and does not clog the pores.  It clears up acne and keeps the skin healthy.  I have been using it as a facial soap ever since I was a teenager.  The ingredients are gentle for sensitive skin.  I tried their Sal-3 soap which is a bit stronger and can be irritating to sensitive skin.  I will stick with the original because it works.  It goes with me wherever I travel.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my acne or my husbands.</li>
