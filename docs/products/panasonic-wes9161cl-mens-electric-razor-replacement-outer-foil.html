    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>so Panny shavers with the foil and blade made in japan are perfect.</li>
            <li>Best price that I have found.</li>
            <li>Very good quality.</li>
            <li>This razor is a very good product.</li>
            <li>Works great to shave your head as well.</li>
            <li>Still a great razor.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the performance of the razor and I am just as happy with the replacement foil and blades.</li>
            <li>and you will get good life out of the screen.</li>
            <li>So 8243A + a replacement is good for 4years.  </li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>I think it would be priced fairly at $25.</li>
            <li>good price.</li>
            <li>perfect replacement for original foil.</li>
            <li>Very glad that the product is made in Japan,</li>
            <li>Consistently the best electric razor I have used over the years.</li>
            <li>This is a nice shaver I purchased this replacement head</li>
            <li>So far (18 months) very happy with shaver and replacements.</li>
            <li>Just received it, so far working perfectly.</li>
            <li>I do recommend keeping the razor charged above 50% as well for best performance.</li>
            <li>but it works very well.not as close a shave as with a bladed razor but is a great substitute when you cannot use one.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with the shaver&#x27;s performance until it began to decline.</li>
            <li>That assuring feeling of quality just makes the experience so much better automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>Much better shaves than I ever got with my Braun shavers, which I used for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave</li>
            <li>This is an exact replacement for the original, it is great.</li>
            <li>this Panasonic one works great and it is just like having a new shaver.</li>
            <li>If you love the ES8243 shaver (it is the best shaver in the market today, hands down),</li>
            <li>But, I do love this panasonic razor and this replacement foil is just like the original.</li>
            <li>My shaver is as good as new again!</li>
            <li>This is one shaver that works on heavy beards it is the best I have ever used</li>
            <li>Great razor and will be buying my next replacement from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It shaves well and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shaver and worth replacing blades and foil unless you&#x27;re ready to move up the Panasonic scale for the higher end shavers.</li>
            <li>IT doesn&#x27;t handle my beard when I let it get long, but when it is short/stubby, this works great on my Razor.</li>
            <li>Original OEM product brings your shaver to &amp;#34;like new&amp;#34; condition.</li>
            <li>Original equipment quality at an Amazon.com price.  </li>
            <li>Original foil replacement for my wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>but not enough cheaper that you feel good about it.</li>
            <li>This foil is overall a good product and it produces a close shave with the ES8243 shaver.  </li>
            <li>Have also been researching double edge razors, but for speed and a fairly close shave an electric razor works well.</li>
            <li>It is a direct replacement to the very easy to break by dropping all plastic original.</li>
            <li>just wait until Amazon reduces the price again and get it new; you will be much better off than getting this replacement foil.</li>
            <li>Ordering was easy shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>A good idea to replace it every 18 months due to wear/tear and residue buildup from shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>your foil is more than a couple years old and your inner blades are in good shape, then this replacement foil will make your shave like new, and you will certainly notice the difference.</li>
            <li>The replacement is decent but it does not shave as close as&lt;br /&gt;the original foil.  </li>
            <li>I replace the original foil and blades at the recommended time and the razor is like new again.</li>
            <li>This replacement (which I bought with the shaver heads) completely restored the excellent, and now that I&#x27;m being careful to always stash it in the medicine cabinet has not had any diminished performance in several months of use.    </li>
            <li>I have been using the first one for almost two years now and still do not have a problem.</li>
            <li>It is usable (the first one sent had a crack in the head screen), but seems to be of lower quality than the one that came with the shaver.  </li>
            <li>Definitely cuts better than my original (3 years old).</li>
            <li>In this case, the replacement was a marked improvement over the worn out original.</li>
            <li>Usually I have found that replacement foils are not as good as the original and don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>It shaves much smoother and closer now.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than throwing out you electric razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using my Panasonic shaver for a couple of years now, and the battery life is really falling off now, so</li>
            <li>I just purchased this foil in hopes that it would bring back the original performance of the shaver.</li>
            <li>last outer foil lasted me 6 months, not bad since I shave my whole head.</li>
            <li>The main problem with me however is the durability or lack</li>
            <li>highly recommend you try this one.</li>
            <li>I think the price is a bit too high.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s signfiganltly cheaper than buying a new shaver</li>
            <li>My razor shaved like it was brand new after I replaced the old foil with tis new one !</li>
            <li>Three years and eight months later I purchased my first replacement foil.</li>
            <li>My husband just bought this to replace his old shaver head, now it gives as close a shave as ever!</li>
            <li>Very very poor quality replacement (the original lasted more than 6 months)</li>
            <li>To really get the shave all the way back to where it was when new, the blade should also be replaced.  </li>
            <li>I will likely get a whole new shaver now.  </li>
            <li>I finally completely ruined it when I stepped on the screen.</li>
            <li>This lasts me nearly 2years.  </li>
            <li>Have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Not only did it produce a much closer shave in a shorter time period, but the shaver even sounded and felt</li>
            <li>I wasted a lot of money on this as I was led to believe it would fit my razor.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is much noisier than original (which I half expected), but the shaving results have never approached the shaver when new.</li>
            <li>I really shouldn&#x27;t have used it that long but hadn&#x27;t noticed the gradual decline in performance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought it once, but maybe next time, i&#x27;ll just buy the new shaver instead.</li>
            <li>I was actually ready to go back to Braun until I replaced both and got back to a speedier and closer shave.</li>
            <li>Replacing both screen and blades more frequently makes a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic foil gives much closer shaves and lasts longer before needing replacement than the Braun Series 3 foil that is used on my other shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only going to buy directly from the Panasonic website in the future.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you are extremely careful with your Panasonic razor to never let it fall to the floor</li>

            <li> It actually feels more dull than the yearlong foil I had on my shaver - not sure if it has anything to do with the fact that I didn&#x27;t replace the cutter</li>
            <li> My previous screen wore out quickly but I was too careless in where I put the razor when I first bought it, and dropped it several times.    </li>
            <li> I know I am hard on a shaver with my beard but my original foil wore out and was breaking down after 7 months.  </li>
            <li> Have only used it on dry skin</li>
            <li> I bought a less expensive Nano Panasonic model and am OK with the performance, but I think putting the money toward replacing the shaver is better than replacing the cutting system.</li>
            <li> I replaced screen and cutter on my nearly (2) year old Pnansonic (expensive) wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li> as expected.</li>
            <li> Panasonic is gauging past customers, because the foil will not last longer than one year.</li>
            <li> Usually I replace both this and the blades at the same time even though the recommended maintenance is foil every year and blades every two years.</li>
            <li> most disappointed.</li>
            <li> befor the original went bad.</li>
            <li> Previously I have replaced the blades every 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> I would like to return it as it is very flimsy - afraid it is going to break any minute.</li>
            <li> Awfully expensive though, actually, I&#x27;m gonna knock this down to 3 stars from 4.</li>
            <li> The price is painful; for the cost of 2 replacement foils, you could almost buy a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> But just replacing the (less expensive) foil does help quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because it is expensive.</li>
            <li> Just EXTREMELY expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s priced at the painfully awkward point wher</li>
            <li> The results were disappointing for the cost involved</li>
            <li> I just replaced it and the cutting blocks.</li>

            <li> Restores the shaver to new-bought efficiency.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s priced at the painfully awkward point wher it&#x27;s signfiganltly cheaper than buying a new shaver but not enough cheaper that you feel good about it. I&#x27;ve bought it once, but maybe next time, i&#x27;ll just buy the new shaver instead.</li>
            <li> IT doesn&#x27;t handle my beard when I let it get long, but when it is short/stubby, this works great on my Razor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that you are extremely careful with your Panasonic razor to never let it fall to the floor and you will get good life out of the screen. My previous screen wore out quickly but I was too careless in where I put the razor when I first bought it, and dropped it several times.    I finally completely ruined it when I stepped on the screen. This replacement (which I bought with the shaver heads) completely restored the excellent, and now that I&#x27;m being careful to always stash it in the medicine cabinet has not had any diminished performance in several months of use.    I do recommend keeping the razor charged above 50% as well for best performance.</li>
            <li> This lasts me nearly 2years.  So 8243A + a replacement is good for 4years.  Have sensitive skin so Panny shavers with the foil and blade made in japan are perfect.</li>
            <li> I would like to return it as it is very flimsy - afraid it is going to break any minute. how do I go about returning it?</li>
            <li> Have&#x27;t used it in the shower.  Have only used it on dry skin but it works very well.not as close a shave as with a bladed razor but is a great substitute when you cannot use one.</li>
            <li> Good quality. The Panasonic foil gives much closer shaves and lasts longer before needing replacement than the Braun Series 3 foil that is used on my other shaver.</li>
            <li> This is one shaver that works on heavy beards it is the best I have ever used and I have used many&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you try this one.</li>
            <li> I replaced screen and cutter on my nearly (2) year old Pnansonic (expensive) wet/dry shaver. I have been pleased with the shaver&#x27;s performance until it began to decline. I decided to try replacing the cutter assembly as recommended by Panasonic. The results were disappointing for the cost involved and I wouldn&#x27;t do it again. The shaver is much noisier than original (which I half expected), but the shaving results have never approached the shaver when new. I can put up with the noise, but not the reduced shaving results. I bought a less expensive Nano Panasonic model and am OK with the performance, but I think putting the money toward replacing the shaver is better than replacing the cutting system.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rarity now a days to see the tag &amp;#34;Made in Japan&amp;#34;. That assuring feeling of quality just makes the experience so much better automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item as expected. Just that it is a bit more expensive than it should.</li>
            <li> This is the replacement for the Panasonic shave I use. It&#x27;s a great shaver and worth replacing blades and foil unless you&#x27;re ready to move up the Panasonic scale for the higher end shavers.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a worn foil.  It shaves much smoother and closer now.</li>
            <li> I think it would be priced fairly at $25. Panasonic is gauging past customers, because the foil will not last longer than one year.</li>
            <li> I purchased my [[ASIN:B001DKMY9Q Panasonic ES8243A Men&#x27;s 4-Blade Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver]] shaver in January of 2010. Three years and eight months later I purchased my first replacement foil. Manufacturer recommended replacement interval is one year, but I replace things when they need to be - not when the company selling them \\&quot;recommends\\&quot; they should be replaced. In this case, the replacement was a marked improvement over the worn out original. Not only did it produce a much closer shave in a shorter time period, but the shaver even sounded and felt \\&quot;tighter.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your foil is more than a couple years old and your inner blades are in good shape, then this replacement foil will make your shave like new, and you will certainly notice the difference.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than throwing out you electric razor. Original OEM product brings your shaver to &amp;#34;like new&amp;#34; condition.</li>
            <li> My husband just bought this to replace his old shaver head, now it gives as close a shave as ever!</li>
            <li> But, I do love this panasonic razor and this replacement foil is just like the original. Usually I replace both this and the blades at the same time even though the recommended maintenance is foil every year and blades every two years.</li>
            <li> Very good quality. Very glad that the product is made in Japan, good price. I recommend!! I recommend!! I recommend!! I recommend!!</li>
            <li> The replacement is decent but it does not shave as close as&lt;br /&gt;the original foil.  It is a bit pricey, too.</li>
            <li> last outer foil lasted me 6 months, not bad since I shave my whole head. Need to replace the foil and blade each year. So far (18 months) very happy with shaver and replacements.</li>
            <li> My last cartridge lasted 1 1/2 years. I really shouldn&#x27;t have used it that long but hadn&#x27;t noticed the gradual decline in performance. I just replaced it and the cutting blocks. My shaver is as good as new again!</li>
            <li> Consistently the best electric razor I have used over the years. Works great to shave your head as well. Just remember to also change the razor blades to keep that close shaved feeling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the Panasonic ES8243A Arc4 razor since 2011. I replace the original foil and blades at the recommended time and the razor is like new again. I am very satisfied with the performance of the razor and I am just as happy with the replacement foil and blades. Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> This razor is a very good product. I have been using the first one for almost two years now and still do not have a problem. I think the price is a bit too high.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this foil in hopes that it would bring back the original performance of the shaver. It actually feels more dull than the yearlong foil I had on my shaver - not sure if it has anything to do with the fact that I didn&#x27;t replace the cutter but it shouldn&#x27;t. If you love the ES8243 shaver (it is the best shaver in the market today, hands down), just wait until Amazon reduces the price again and get it new; you will be much better off than getting this replacement foil.</li>
            <li> Proper Panasonic replacement part  for the shaver. And it made a big improvement to the shaver. Should have done it earlier.</li>
            <li> To really get the shave all the way back to where it was when new, the blade should also be replaced.  But just replacing the (less expensive) foil does help quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using my Panasonic shaver for a couple of years now, and the battery life is really falling off now, so I will likely get a whole new shaver now.  And it will be another Panasonic.  Much better shaves than I ever got with my Braun shavers, which I used for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave O.</li>
            <li> Previously I have replaced the blades every 3-4 months. Unless damaged I would only replace screen maybe once a year as recommended. Replacing both screen and blades more frequently makes a dramatic difference. I was actually ready to go back to Braun until I replaced both and got back to a speedier and closer shave. A pre-shave like Aramis Lab Series with take it to another level.</li>
            <li> Just received it, so far working perfectly. Still a great razor.</li>
            <li> This replacement foil works as it should.  Original equipment quality at an Amazon.com price.  I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> My razor shaved like it was brand new after I replaced the old foil with tis new one !</li>
            <li> Restored my razor to like the day I bought it. Looks as if the replacements will be about a 9 mo interval. Great razor and will be buying my next replacement from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because it is expensive. It shaves well and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> This foil is overall a good product and it produces a close shave with the ES8243 shaver.  The main problem with me however is the durability or lack thereof.  I know I am hard on a shaver with my beard but my original foil wore out and was breaking down after 7 months.  It is supposed to last one year.  I had to purchase this replacement foil 7 months after getting the shaver.  The price is painful; for the cost of 2 replacement foils, you could almost buy a new shaver.  Also $43.77 buys a lot of razor blades and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I wasted a lot of money on this as I was led to believe it would fit my razor.  But, it didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m only going to buy directly from the Panasonic website in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a nice shaver I purchased this replacement head befor the original went bad. This is an exact replacement for the original, it is great. Ordering was easy shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> It is usable (the first one sent had a crack in the head screen), but seems to be of lower quality than the one that came with the shaver.  Have read others saying the same thing.  I am considering switching back to Braun shavers for several reasons.  Have also been researching double edge razors, but for speed and a fairly close shave an electric razor works well.</li>
            <li> As described, works well</li>
            <li> Replacement foil only lasted 5 weeks! Very very poor quality replacement (the original lasted more than 6 months) most disappointed.</li>
            <li> Original foil replacement for my wet/dry shaver.  A good idea to replace it every 18 months due to wear/tear and residue buildup from shaving cream.  Best price that I have found.</li>
            <li> Did I have a choice? No. But it works, and my razor now runs well again. Awfully expensive though, actually, I&#x27;m gonna knock this down to 3 stars from 4.</li>
            <li> perfect replacement for original foil. Definitely cuts better than my original (3 years old).</li>
            <li> It is a direct replacement to the very easy to break by dropping all plastic original. Just EXTREMELY expensive.</li>
            <li> Yep. It&#x27;s a replacement shaver head, for the shaver it&#x27;s advertised for. Works just as well as you would expect</li>
            <li> Usually I have found that replacement foils are not as good as the original and don&#x27;t last. this Panasonic one works great and it is just like having a new shaver.</li>
            <li> What a pleasure to replace blades &amp; foil.</li>
