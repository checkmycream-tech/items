    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>That makes it perfect for use in the eye area, and perfect for people like me who cannot have scented products.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best eye creams I have used.</li>
            <li>In fact, this feels wonderful going on.  </li>
            <li>I thought the product itself though was great and would give it five stars for formula alone.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve experienced neither.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Whatever makes her happy is good with me.</li>
            <li>but after 3 days she said she loved it.</li>
            <li>, the SK-II is good at hydrating skin, but does it reduce wrinkles?  </li>
            <li>, I would expect the SK-II to have exceptional results.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is nicely packaged and looks quite \\&quot;luxe.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The SK-II cream comes with a plastic applicator which is a nice touch so that you dont have to use your fingers remove the cream from its container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do think it&#x27;s great for special occasions</li>
            <li>More importantly, the skin around our eyes looks great.</li>
            <li>It rubs on fine and smells good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a nice eye cream with a lot to offer, but it does not deliver on the more optimistic product claims.</li>
            <li>This cream is very light and doesn&#x27;t make my eyes look puffy after application.  </li>
            <li>It will probably be a couple more days till we dip into the body of the jar.</li>
            <li>Okay -- This.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this eye cream, I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but I was hoping that it would improve my complexion and give me a healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus, for 1/6 the cost, I get slightly more product.  </li>
            <li>Olay’s packaging also makes more sense.  </li>
            <li>My problem is crow&#x27;s feet more than puffiness.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love the way this feels -it</li>
            <li>My opinion is that it didn&#x27;t hurt but you should probably read more reviews and compare products before deciding if this is the cream for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>more supple and youthful looking.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re committed to using this product then you might be pleased</li>
            <li>Out of all the eye creams I&#x27;ve used over the years, I saw the fastest most significant results using this cream.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I find that the cream does not absorb into the skin easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had better results using sweet almond oil than I did this stuff</li>
            <li>The cream itself is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure I can be the best judge of whether this is the best out there or even dramatically better than other available creams.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that the fine lines are still there --</li>
            <li>Some people, despite the price, will consider it to be an indispensable bargain.</li>
            <li>Yes, they cost more but are usually worth the difference in price if they work for you.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has a light, creamy texture</li>
            <li>The cream comes with a spatula for easy scooping from the cream pot and it absorbs quickly under my eyes and over my lids.</li>
            <li>It glides on easily and is quickly absorbed around the eye area.  </li>
            <li>I had somebody ask me if I&#x27;ve been sleeping better because the bags under my eyes are much diminished</li>
            <li>time, I have become convinced that good quality facial products do make a difference.</li>
            <li>SK-II Essential Power Eye Cream is a good eye cream</li>
            <li>The SKII Essential Power Eye Cream is a good choice.  </li>
            <li>Since my wife and I have oily, sensitive skin, I have just one demand of a health/beauty product - please don&#x27;t irritate my skin and cause a reaction of some kind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool and soothing and the directions tell you to rub it in a circular motion with your ring finger which is soothing in itself.  </li>
            <li>The skin under and around my eyes is amazingly soft now, much more so than before and easily the silkiest skin on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Clinique&#x27;s Repairwear Laser Focus Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream for years and have been happy with it but have also keen to try other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This eye cream seemed to hydrate the skin around my eyes and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I turned 43 yesterday and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, especially around my eyes, but I am using this product more as a preventive step than as a remover.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and does not clump up or make your make run</li>
            <li>cream is a light yellowish color, has a very light pleasant but really nondescript odor, and a small applicator.</li>
            <li>As I get older, I am more aware that my skin has lost the fresh glow of my youth.</li>
            <li>but I’m not convinced it’s worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It is readily absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>As for the reduction of wrinkles around the eyes, only time will tell how effective the cream is.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth reviewing right now.  </li>
            <li>He is a medium-brown skinned Puerto Rican with marked darkness under his eyes with fine lines.  </li>
            <li>After several days the effect becomes more pronounced &amp; lasts longer.</li>
            <li>There is no longer any darkness under his eyes and I hadn&#x27;t even realized it at first because he wears glasses.  </li>
            <li>First and foremost for 125.00 don&#x27;t expect quantity.  </li>
            <li>The effects the first time lasted all day.</li>
            <li>This is a water/glycerin based product (first two ingredients).  </li>
            <li>It definitely wasn&#x27;t the most rigorous test.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been one week my wife has been using SK-II and at first she said it did nothing for her</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am pleased with the SK-II Essential Power Eye Cream.  </li>
            <li>is the first SK-II product I have tried and the quality itself did not disappoint.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream applies smoothly but does not absorb completely into the skin for almost an hour.</li>
            <li>melts right in, is not greasy, and works very well.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is thick and golden (a good choice considering the pricetag),</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t seen any positive effects to this eye cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredible actually, especially for such a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>I can tell if I&#x27;ve used too much cream because it absorbs quickly, and I can feel the sensation on my eyeballs, the same way I feel it when I use too much castor oil to clean my face at night - it feels like you&#x27;ve got something in your eye.</li>
            <li>So while it&#x27;s fine, it just seems to deliver same day results.</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling very silky but not oily.</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>Maybe it will take a month to see results, but for now I can&#x27;t really suggest this product.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get much, but you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>I did not notice much impact on wrinkles or skin health over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a light smell, reminiscent of Windex (but not offensive).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those people who probably should have been moisturizing for my whole life and am just now realizing what aging can do to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need much of this cream,</li>
            <li>On the downside is the size-to-price ratio is a bit much.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkling in the eye area as of yet, but this came as a test product and I was eager to try it because my family is genetically prone to under eye darkness.  </li>
            <li>People don&#x27;t usually point that kind of thing out to a guy unless it really is noticeable.</li>
            <li>The bottle is nicely packaged and looks quite \\&quot;luxe.\\&quot;you to use, I think one jar would last a fairly long time.  </li>
            <li>Just a little is needed per application, and it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly without any greasy feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>First of all, you should know that I&#x27;m 47 years old.</li>
            <li>I truly believe that over time and consistent use of the product, that the early signs of my crows feet on the corners of my eyes will diminish.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly young and have fine lines around my eyes but no deep wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li>On some days, I felt like my left eye area actually looked better too.</li>
            <li>and I was able to apply makeup within a few minutes, which is unusual for an eye</li>
            <li>It is a quality product that does what it says &amp; is highly recommended if you can afford it.</li>
            <li>Has quite a high cost for what it delivers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would prefer to have more natural ingredients, especially in the sensitive area near the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was kinda expecting something a little more robust for the cost.  </li>
            <li>Of course you&#x27;d want to have a fresh tube that was never used for it&#x27;s intended purpose &amp; probably shouldn&#x27;t be used as a daily routine.</li>
            <li>The tiny spatula that comes with the SK-II product is useful</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product but hardly worth the cost and with poorly designed packaging.  </li>
            <li>if this IS something that you deal with normally, you may want to take that into consideration.  </li>
            <li>few more comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but she said it was a normal price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s up to each individual to decide if this - or any beauty product - is worth the price</li>
            <li>, I applied it (almost) every day for about 28 days to my left eye area but didn&#x27;t apply it to my right eye area.</li>
            <li>Then I take 1/2 of the cream off my left pinky with my right pinky.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also easy to apply the eye concealer to cover dark circles after using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, nor have any new wrinkles appeared that I have noticed and my skin around my eyes does feel good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Therefore, I think its priced very reasonably as the jar will last for a year for</li>
            <li>Having lived in Asia for several years, I was already familiar with the quality of Japanese beauty products.</li>
            <li>consistency is that of a rich lotion rather than heavy cream, which worked well for me (others with much drier skin may prefer a heavier product).</li>
            <li>This SK-II Essential Power eye cream absorbs well into the skin, unlike others I&#x27;ve used which seem to sit on top and can cause my glasses to slide down the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li>My wife just began using this cream and this is her input thus far:    </li>
            <li>So far, I have not seen the crow&#x27;s feet lines diminish any.  </li>
            <li>Been using this about two weeks, and so far I have noticed my skin being</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say if you&#x27;re looking for something that will produce real results, don&#x27;t overlook this.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t see spending this much money on eye cream on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>So far, SK-II hasn&#x27;t let me down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With facial creams you can apply liberally, but with this you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After just a week it&#x27;s been leaving our skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cream definitely made made the skin around my left eye FEEL noticeably smoother than the skin around my right eye.</li>
            <li>cream went on very smoothly, and as others have noted, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and I can see an improvement in my skin, but that may also be due to me getting into a better skin care routine of using an eye product on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too soon to see any miracle difference, so if you are expecting to try this once and suddenly look like Angelina Jolie, you will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Is it worth twice (or in some cases four times ) the money as other creams?  </li>
            <li>SK-II Essential Power Eye Cream comes with a small white plastic spatula (a nice touch), so you can use the product without contaminating the jar with your finger.  </li>
            <li>Directions say to apply an \\&quot;appropriate amount of product (approximately 0.5 cm in diameter)\\&quot;...  The white spatula tip is about 0.5 cm wide, so it is easy to judge the recommended amount.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks of use, I am pleased with how my under-eye area is lighter and not as dry looking.</li>
            <li>Now as a husband I really don&#x27;t care if it works or not as long as she thinks it works.</li>
            <li>The final answer is that it does completely live up to it&#x27;s promise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s eye cream and difficult to give much of a review until you&#x27;ve been able to use it a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over four straight weeks, morning and evening, and don&#x27;t see any significant improvement to justify the cost of this over other brands&#x27; creams that I have used and like before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been especially concerned about following a skin care regimen that would prevent wrinkles, and I&#x27;m certainly not going to allow any wrinkle to make me think less of my own appearance.</li>
            <li>Although my skin has yet to show major signs of aging, I know that I must start thinking about preventing mother nature from taking control.  </li>
            <li>&gt;* Based on how much cream they tell you to use, I think one jar would last a fairly long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apparently I&#x27;m out of the cosmetic loop.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start out by saying that I&#x27;m only in my early thirties</li>
            <li>After the first week of use, I have noticed some firming of my eyelids and the area under my eyes look less sunken in.  </li>
            <li>The cream has a very faint but pleasant scent and it is lightweight when applied.  </li>
            <li>This cream made an immediate noticeable difference in improving the fine lines around my eyes, however, it hasn&#x27;t appeared to be a lasting difference (at least not yet).</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil or coconut oil are very low cost and natural alternatives.  </li>
            <li>Then \\&quot;Gently spread around eye area using ring finger in slow and gentle circular</li>
            <li>Of course, long term use is the recommended course of action</li>
            <li>Although I used it the first few times, I then just used my finger to apply</li>
            <li>I normally never see blemishes near my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I’ll stick with my far less expensive and equally effective eye serum.</li>
            <li>I have not used eye creams very much in the past.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> As for the reduction of wrinkles around the eyes, only time will tell how effective the cream is.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth reviewing right now.  </li>
            <li> He is a medium-brown skinned Puerto Rican with marked darkness under his eyes with fine lines.  </li>
            <li> After several days the effect becomes more pronounced &amp; lasts longer.</li>
            <li> There is no longer any darkness under his eyes and I hadn&#x27;t even realized it at first because he wears glasses.  </li>
            <li> First and foremost for 125.00 don&#x27;t expect quantity.  </li>
            <li> The effects the first time lasted all day.</li>
            <li> This is a water/glycerin based product (first two ingredients).  </li>
            <li> It definitely wasn&#x27;t the most rigorous test.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been one week my wife has been using SK-II and at first she said it did nothing for her</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with the SK-II Essential Power Eye Cream.  </li>
            <li> is the first SK-II product I have tried and the quality itself did not disappoint.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream applies smoothly but does not absorb completely into the skin for almost an hour.</li>
            <li> melts right in, is not greasy, and works very well.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is thick and golden (a good choice considering the pricetag),</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t seen any positive effects to this eye cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredible actually, especially for such a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> I can tell if I&#x27;ve used too much cream because it absorbs quickly, and I can feel the sensation on my eyeballs, the same way I feel it when I use too much castor oil to clean my face at night - it feels like you&#x27;ve got something in your eye.</li>
            <li> So while it&#x27;s fine, it just seems to deliver same day results.</li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling very silky but not oily.</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> Maybe it will take a month to see results, but for now I can&#x27;t really suggest this product.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get much, but you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> I did not notice much impact on wrinkles or skin health over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a light smell, reminiscent of Windex (but not offensive).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who probably should have been moisturizing for my whole life and am just now realizing what aging can do to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need much of this cream,</li>
            <li> On the downside is the size-to-price ratio is a bit much.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkling in the eye area as of yet, but this came as a test product and I was eager to try it because my family is genetically prone to under eye darkness.  </li>
            <li> People don&#x27;t usually point that kind of thing out to a guy unless it really is noticeable.</li>
            <li> The bottle is nicely packaged and looks quite \\&quot;luxe.\\&quot;you to use, I think one jar would last a fairly long time.  </li>
            <li> Just a little is needed per application, and it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly without any greasy feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> First of all, you should know that I&#x27;m 47 years old.</li>
            <li> I truly believe that over time and consistent use of the product, that the early signs of my crows feet on the corners of my eyes will diminish.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly young and have fine lines around my eyes but no deep wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li> On some days, I felt like my left eye area actually looked better too.</li>
            <li> and I was able to apply makeup within a few minutes, which is unusual for an eye</li>
            <li> It is a quality product that does what it says &amp; is highly recommended if you can afford it.</li>
            <li> Has quite a high cost for what it delivers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would prefer to have more natural ingredients, especially in the sensitive area near the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was kinda expecting something a little more robust for the cost.  </li>
            <li> Of course you&#x27;d want to have a fresh tube that was never used for it&#x27;s intended purpose &amp; probably shouldn&#x27;t be used as a daily routine.</li>
            <li> The tiny spatula that comes with the SK-II product is useful</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product but hardly worth the cost and with poorly designed packaging.  </li>
            <li> if this IS something that you deal with normally, you may want to take that into consideration.  </li>
            <li> few more comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but she said it was a normal price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s up to each individual to decide if this - or any beauty product - is worth the price</li>
            <li> , I applied it (almost) every day for about 28 days to my left eye area but didn&#x27;t apply it to my right eye area.</li>
            <li> Then I take 1/2 of the cream off my left pinky with my right pinky.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also easy to apply the eye concealer to cover dark circles after using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, nor have any new wrinkles appeared that I have noticed and my skin around my eyes does feel good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Therefore, I think its priced very reasonably as the jar will last for a year for</li>
            <li> Having lived in Asia for several years, I was already familiar with the quality of Japanese beauty products.</li>
            <li> consistency is that of a rich lotion rather than heavy cream, which worked well for me (others with much drier skin may prefer a heavier product).</li>
            <li> This SK-II Essential Power eye cream absorbs well into the skin, unlike others I&#x27;ve used which seem to sit on top and can cause my glasses to slide down the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li> My wife just began using this cream and this is her input thus far:    </li>
            <li> So far, I have not seen the crow&#x27;s feet lines diminish any.  </li>
            <li> Been using this about two weeks, and so far I have noticed my skin being</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say if you&#x27;re looking for something that will produce real results, don&#x27;t overlook this.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t see spending this much money on eye cream on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> So far, SK-II hasn&#x27;t let me down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With facial creams you can apply liberally, but with this you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just a week it&#x27;s been leaving our skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cream definitely made made the skin around my left eye FEEL noticeably smoother than the skin around my right eye.</li>
            <li> cream went on very smoothly, and as others have noted, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I can see an improvement in my skin, but that may also be due to me getting into a better skin care routine of using an eye product on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too soon to see any miracle difference, so if you are expecting to try this once and suddenly look like Angelina Jolie, you will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Is it worth twice (or in some cases four times ) the money as other creams?  </li>
            <li> SK-II Essential Power Eye Cream comes with a small white plastic spatula (a nice touch), so you can use the product without contaminating the jar with your finger.  </li>
            <li> Directions say to apply an \\&quot;appropriate amount of product (approximately 0.5 cm in diameter)\\&quot;...  The white spatula tip is about 0.5 cm wide, so it is easy to judge the recommended amount.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, I am pleased with how my under-eye area is lighter and not as dry looking.</li>
            <li> Now as a husband I really don&#x27;t care if it works or not as long as she thinks it works.</li>
            <li> The final answer is that it does completely live up to it&#x27;s promise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s eye cream and difficult to give much of a review until you&#x27;ve been able to use it a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over four straight weeks, morning and evening, and don&#x27;t see any significant improvement to justify the cost of this over other brands&#x27; creams that I have used and like before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been especially concerned about following a skin care regimen that would prevent wrinkles, and I&#x27;m certainly not going to allow any wrinkle to make me think less of my own appearance.</li>
            <li> Although my skin has yet to show major signs of aging, I know that I must start thinking about preventing mother nature from taking control.  </li>
            <li> &gt;* Based on how much cream they tell you to use, I think one jar would last a fairly long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apparently I&#x27;m out of the cosmetic loop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start out by saying that I&#x27;m only in my early thirties</li>
            <li> After the first week of use, I have noticed some firming of my eyelids and the area under my eyes look less sunken in.  </li>
            <li> The cream has a very faint but pleasant scent and it is lightweight when applied.  </li>
            <li> This cream made an immediate noticeable difference in improving the fine lines around my eyes, however, it hasn&#x27;t appeared to be a lasting difference (at least not yet).</li>
            <li> Extra virgin olive oil or coconut oil are very low cost and natural alternatives.  </li>
            <li> Then \\&quot;Gently spread around eye area using ring finger in slow and gentle circular</li>
            <li> Of course, long term use is the recommended course of action</li>
            <li> Although I used it the first few times, I then just used my finger to apply</li>
            <li> I normally never see blemishes near my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I’ll stick with my far less expensive and equally effective eye serum.</li>
            <li> I have not used eye creams very much in the past.  </li>
            <li> My eyes are normally sensitive to the products I use on the skin around my eyes, but I have had no problems with irritation due to the use of the SK-II cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The downside is that this eye cream hasn&#x27;t done much for my dark circles, and as other users have noted sometimes actually seems to accentuate them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products that cost half as much but where the results ar every similar.</li>
            <li> For the price, I think at least some results should have been evident by now.</li>
            <li> Overall, the SK-II eye cream did not perform better thanthe less expensive DHC eye cream.  </li>
            <li> The price is a bit scary, but I have to admit that fine lines and wrinkles are a thing of the past with this highly affective cream.</li>
            <li> think the product is a bit overpackaged, with a clear plastic “cozy” for the jar in the box, and a stylized spatula to ( I guess) keep your fingers from contaminating the product.</li>
            <li> eye cream has an extremely long list of ingredients.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll stick with that and products that don&#x27;t have an ingredient list a mile long of things I don&#x27;t recognize.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in classy looking jar - burgundy red glass jar with a matching slightly metallic slightly shiny lid.  </li>
            <li> This small jar gets even smaller when you open it up and actually see its contents.  </li>
            <li> The results I&#x27;ve seen have been two-fold: the short-term results that only last a few hours and the long term ones that take a week or so to start noticing.</li>
            <li> It is winter in the midwest, so skin gets dry and dehydrated.  </li>
            <li> have the feeling that not one drop of SKII will go unused, so the actual per ounce cost of product USED may be LESS than some of the bargain brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this cream over the next few weeks to see if there are any long term benefits, but the shirt term ones don&#x27;t seem to exist for me.</li>
            <li> The package contains less than 1/2 ounce as advertised but that isn&#x27;t such an issue if it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Granted, at 51 years of age, all my wrinkles are well earned and not likely to give way to anything less than surgical</li>
            <li> when we stopped, our eyelids went back to their previous state.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for less than a week</li>
            <li> skin around my eyes is normally very dry</li>
            <li> I use the smaller end to scoop up a little bit, and scrape the cream onto my pinky finger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it helps with fine lines and dark circles for your workday in a 24 hour period, the truth of the matter is that we&#x27;ve used less expensive brands that have a longer lasting impact, where the effects are visible even for a few days after you cease using the product.</li>
            <li> I have been diligently using this SK-II Essential Power Eye Cream twice a day for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> The jar is the size of a tiny tangerine, the glass walls are thick and the lid is larger than the size of the jar.</li>
            <li> even though it&#x27;s a small bottle it should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I used the spatula once then tossed it when I realized that dabbing my finger tip into the cream not only provides the same amount needed but is less clumsy and wasteful.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way, however, and this small jar will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I have noticed very little results after 10 days of using SK-II daily.</li>
            <li> Other will consider it to be an unobtainable extravagance.</li>
            <li> One other thing of note is that it  does not “flake” under makeup as some eye products do.</li>
            <li> It is extremely pricey though.</li>
            <li> I see other people have seen a difference, but we have not.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of SK-II&#x27;s other products, this one has no scent.</li>
            <li> I also cannot get past the various preservatives the SK-II contains.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve not tried other eye creams (just this one)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t iron out whether it&#x27;s a fluke or solely due to this cream, but it&#x27;s my observation.  </li>
            <li> have used other brands of eye cream in the past and all, including the SK-II, appear to have the same effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> But, the 2-ounce jar of another brand I have used in the past is only $36.</li>
            <li> This bottle is surprisingly small, but if you use it as directed with the micro-spatula that&#x27;s included, it should last quite a while.</li>
            <li> other creams I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> and I had to actively massage it into the skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way, so this should last at least 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and thin skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a small jar and you only need to use a little bit on your finger.</li>
            <li> Rating 2 1/2 stars, rounded down to 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I close the jar and set it down.</li>
            <li> and they are less dark.</li>
            <li> There are products out there that cost way less</li>
            <li> Maybe slightly tighter skin.</li>
            <li> Lines around my eyes seem less pronounced as well.  </li>
            <li> To me, those shadows are less flattering than any wrinklesn I might have.</li>
            <li> My eyes are less puffy, moisturized, and firmer.</li>
            <li> I did notice a slight burning if any would get INTO my eyes</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t typically experience any sensitivity with my eye products, so</li>
            <li> It has a slight sting when you apply it if you&#x27;ve just finished washing your face.</li>
            <li> For less than half an ounce, it&#x27;s pricey, at $125.</li>
            <li> and it has a slight sting after applying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I feel like I can already see some results in terms of making that under eye darkness less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> This is at a high price point, so I would suggest trying a less expensive eye cream before experimenting with SK-II.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of the cream seems to be sufficient to keep the skin from feeling tight.  </li>
            <li> This morning was the 6th time I&#x27;ve used it &amp; &amp; the 4th time my wife has used it &amp; we&#x27;re still using what is stuck to the little barrier that is between lid of the jar &amp; the product.</li>
            <li> The cream came with a little plastic \\&quot;spatula\\</li>
            <li> You can use your finger or the little spatula it comes with to pick up the tiniest amount and put it on your pinky finger.</li>
            <li> jar comes with a tiny spatula for measuring the less than peas-sized amount (\\&quot;approximately 0.5 cm in diameter\\&quot;) needed for each application.</li>
            <li> For the whopping price on this teeny tiny jar of product, I expect at least a slight improvement in that time frame or at least something about the product that sets it apart</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Clinique Eye Cream to be a little stiff</li>
            <li> Overall, I didn&#x27;t notice a dramatic difference between the two when you just LOOK at them.</li>
            <li> Not only does this eye cream fail at that, but it seems to enhance or even create dark shadows under my eyes when I apply it in the mornings.</li>
            <li> This is very expensive for a small amount of material, but likely in the same price range as high-end anti-aging face/eye lotions and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is a cream color (slightly yellowish tinge) with a thick lotion-like consistency (on the thinner side of creams).  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s very expensive to buy this product but keep in mind that the SK-II brand has been around for a very long time and has sold very well in its local Japanese market, so this is no fly by night infomercial product featuring some fake doctor to show off fake before and after photos.  </li>
            <li> You need to use very little so even though the jar is small it will go a lot farther than you would imagine.</li>
            <li> The bottle is quite small and the applicator that comes with</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes do feel smoother and plumper, although I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s something that will go away if I discontinue use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have broken out from eye creams before, but haven&#x27;t noticed any ill effects of this one.</li>
            <li> Did not noticeably change the small, shallow lines around my eyes</li>
            <li> Some eye creams will at least seem to fill in the area around wrinkles and improve the look of your skin&#x27;s texture, even without eliminating wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The advertising for the cream states that it includes Stem-Acanax Eye Complex and Pitera.  </li>
            <li> It’s silly to have this small, easily misplaced item, without having a means to tuck it somehow in the lid or something.  </li>
            <li> I apply a very small amount at night, after cleaning off my makeup</li>
            <li> thing to consider when ordering is that the instructions advise against keeping the cream in extreme heat or cold.  </li>
            <li> it is no thrills (just a thin plastic spatula).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite expensive and a very small bottle.  </li>
            <li> YET so I didn&#x27;t see a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> If you are reading this you know how expensive it is</li>
            <li> Still... this product is quite expensive</li>
            <li> I said to her that $125 for a tiny bottle of eye lotion is insane</li>
            <li> so I guess it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
            <li> And considering how expensive it is, you&#x27;ll want to conserve!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My package with the cream arrived on a day when the temperature was below freezing and the cream sat in the cold for hours until I got home to bring the package inside.  </li>
            <li> I cant tell if the cream was affected by the cold, but the exposure of the cream to cold and heat during delivery is something to keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used DHC Concentrated Eye Cream, about thirty-five dollars for 0.7 oz, compared to this very expensive SK-II product costly one hundred twenty-five dollars for 0.5 oz.  </li>
            <li> If you get this product, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you are reading this you know how expensive it is and you will have one key question. Does it work? Simply put, yes it does. I started using  it five days ago &amp; you can tell a difference almost immediately. After several days the effect becomes more pronounced &amp; lasts longer. I had somebody ask me if I&#x27;ve been sleeping better because the bags under my eyes are much diminished and they are less dark. People don&#x27;t usually point that kind of thing out to a guy unless it really is noticeable. One again this brings us back to the price. You need to use very little so even though the jar is small it will go a lot farther than you would imagine. This morning was the 6th time I&#x27;ve used it &amp; &amp; the 4th time my wife has used it &amp; we&#x27;re still using what is stuck to the little barrier that is between lid of the jar &amp; the product. It will probably be a couple more days till we dip into the body of the jar. Some people, despite the price, will consider it to be an indispensable bargain. Other will consider it to be an unobtainable extravagance. There are products out there that cost way less that give similar but not quite equal results. I learned from an actor friend that in a pinch you can tighten the bags under your eyes with Prep H. Of course you&#x27;d want to have a fresh tube that was never used for it&#x27;s intended purpose &amp; probably shouldn&#x27;t be used as a daily routine. The final answer is that it does completely live up to it&#x27;s promise. It is a quality product that does what it says &amp; is highly recommended if you can afford it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s eye cream and difficult to give much of a review until you&#x27;ve been able to use it a while. It rubs on fine and smells good. Give me some time to keep using it. Don&#x27;t notice anything different after two weeks. Maybe slightly tighter skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait 30 days to review this product but it&#x27;s worth reviewing right now.  Okay -- This. Stuff. Really. Works.  I use Bobbi Brown under-eye cream and I&#x27;ve never seen a difference so I gave this to my husband to try.  He is a medium-brown skinned Puerto Rican with marked darkness under his eyes with fine lines.  Oh my goodness, after 2 weeks there is a difference!!  There is no longer any darkness under his eyes and I hadn&#x27;t even realized it at first because he wears glasses.  I only noticed it because this morning he was talking about how under his eyes feels softer and not as &amp;#34;agey&amp;#34;? Does that make sense?  I have to admit that the fine lines are still there -- but it&#x27;s only been two weeks and if there is a change after 30 days I will definitely update this review.  He only puts in on in the morning after showing, and once in a while he has missed a day or two.  Still... this product is quite expensive so I don&#x27;t know if I will repurchase! It looks like it will last maybe another 2 months.</li>
            <li> Reviewed by Lynn Holland&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over time, I have become convinced that good quality facial products do make a difference. Of course, I am not a fan of paying big money for them, but sometimes you have to accept the fact that there may be a cost/benefit ratio to be considered. Such is the case with SK II Essential Power Eye Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the product is a bit overpackaged, with a clear plastic “cozy” for the jar in the box, and a stylized spatula to ( I guess) keep your fingers from contaminating the product. The cream itself is thick and golden (a good choice considering the pricetag), though not greasy. It glides on easily and is quickly absorbed around the eye area.  After a few weeks of use, I am pleased with how my under-eye area is lighter and not as dry looking. Lines around my eyes seem less pronounced as well.  One other thing of note is that it  does not “flake” under makeup as some eye products do. Is it worth twice (or in some cases four times ) the money as other creams?  That depends. If you’re like me, you have abandoned, barely-used products in your drawer—wasted money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the feeling that not one drop of SKII will go unused, so the actual per ounce cost of product USED may be LESS than some of the bargain brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been especially concerned about following a skin care regimen that would prevent wrinkles, and I&#x27;m certainly not going to allow any wrinkle to make me think less of my own appearance. However. As I get older, I am more aware that my skin has lost the fresh glow of my youth. When I ordered this eye cream, I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but I was hoping that it would improve my complexion and give me a healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t seen any positive effects to this eye cream. Some eye creams will at least seem to fill in the area around wrinkles and improve the look of your skin&#x27;s texture, even without eliminating wrinkles. Not only does this eye cream fail at that, but it seems to enhance or even create dark shadows under my eyes when I apply it in the mornings. To me, those shadows are less flattering than any wrinklesn I might have. I&#x27;ll continue to use this cream over the next few weeks to see if there are any long term benefits, but the shirt term ones don&#x27;t seem to exist for me.</li>
            <li> SK-II Essential Power Eye Cream is a good eye cream but I’m not convinced it’s worth the price.  I’ve been using Olay Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum for ten years and see no difference in my skin’s appearance.  Plus, for 1/6 the cost, I get slightly more product.  Olay’s packaging also makes more sense.  The tiny spatula that comes with the SK-II product is useful but I don’t understand why there’s no way for the manufacturer to design a jar that will actually hold the spatula in some manner.  It’s silly to have this small, easily misplaced item, without having a means to tuck it somehow in the lid or something.  Overall, a good product but hardly worth the cost and with poorly designed packaging.  I’ll stick with my far less expensive and equally effective eye serum.</li>
            <li> Out of all the eye creams I&#x27;ve used over the years, I saw the fastest most significant results using this cream.  Because of the cost, I don&#x27;t use it every night, but probably 3-4 nights a week. I apply a very small amount at night, after cleaning off my makeup and I can see a noticeable difference the very next morning.  My eyes are less puffy, moisturized, and firmer. It is extremely pricey though. The bottle is quite small and the applicator that comes with it is no thrills (just a thin plastic spatula). I was kinda expecting something a little more robust for the cost.  I did notice a slight burning if any would get INTO my eyes and I don&#x27;t typically experience any sensitivity with my eye products, so if this IS something that you deal with normally, you may want to take that into consideration.  I thought the product itself though was great and would give it five stars for formula alone. I rated it four stars though because of the cost.  Definitely a splurge!</li>
            <li> My wife just began using this cream and this is her input thus far:    First and foremost for 125.00 don&#x27;t expect quantity.  This small jar gets even smaller when you open it up and actually see its contents.  There appears to be about one tablespoon of cream in the jar.    I have used the cream and I have not seen a noticeable difference.  In fact, I find that the cream does not absorb into the skin easily.  My problem is crow&#x27;s feet more than puffiness.  So far, I have not seen the crow&#x27;s feet lines diminish any.  Will update if my opinion changes.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using the SK-II Essential Power Eye Cream for about three weeks now.  The package contains less than 1/2 ounce as advertised but that isn&#x27;t such an issue if it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is a light yellowish color, has a very light pleasant but really nondescript odor, and a small applicator. It has a slight sting when you apply it if you&#x27;ve just finished washing your face. The effects the first time lasted all day. After a week, it stilll seemed to last for about a day, the same after two weeks, and then again after this third week. No longer term impact was noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it helps with fine lines and dark circles for your workday in a 24 hour period, the truth of the matter is that we&#x27;ve used less expensive brands that have a longer lasting impact, where the effects are visible even for a few days after you cease using the product. So while it&#x27;s fine, it just seems to deliver same day results.</li>
            <li> I have noticed very little results after 10 days of using SK-II daily. For the price, I think at least some results should have been evident by now. I see other people have seen a difference, but we have not. Maybe it will take a month to see results, but for now I can&#x27;t really suggest this product. This is at a high price point, so I would suggest trying a less expensive eye cream before experimenting with SK-II.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. The price is a bit scary, but I have to admit that fine lines and wrinkles are a thing of the past with this highly affective cream. You don&#x27;t get much, but you don&#x27;t need much. Unlike some of SK-II&#x27;s other products, this one has no scent. That makes it perfect for use in the eye area, and perfect for people like me who cannot have scented products. I love the way this feels -it melts right in, is not greasy, and works very well. If you get this product, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have not used eye creams very much in the past.  I have used DHC Concentrated Eye Cream, about thirty-five dollars for 0.7 oz, compared to this very expensive SK-II product costly one hundred twenty-five dollars for 0.5 oz.  This is very expensive for a small amount of material, but likely in the same price range as high-end anti-aging face/eye lotions and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SK-II Essential Power Eye Cream comes with a small white plastic spatula (a nice touch), so you can use the product without contaminating the jar with your finger.  Directions say to apply an \\&quot;appropriate amount of product (approximately 0.5 cm in diameter)\\&quot;...  The white spatula tip is about 0.5 cm wide, so it is easy to judge the recommended amount.  Then \\&quot;Gently spread around eye area using ring finger in slow and gentle circular movements.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the SK-II eye cream to work acceptably.  It is winter in the midwest, so skin gets dry and dehydrated.  This eye cream seemed to hydrate the skin around my eyes and absorbs quickly.  I did not notice much impact on wrinkles or skin health over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye cream has an extremely long list of ingredients.  This is a water/glycerin based product (first two ingredients).  Parabens are listed (preservatives), and some people are avoiding those.  There are also silicones (dimethicone and derivatives), and some people are also avoiding those.  I would prefer to have more natural ingredients, especially in the sensitive area near the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in classy looking jar - burgundy red glass jar with a matching slightly metallic slightly shiny lid.  The product is a cream color (slightly yellowish tinge) with a thick lotion-like consistency (on the thinner side of creams).  It has a light smell, reminiscent of Windex (but not offensive).  Product is made in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $125 for a minuscule amount, I would expect the SK-II to have exceptional results.  Overall, the SK-II eye cream did not perform better thanthe less expensive DHC eye cream.  I also cannot get past the various preservatives the SK-II contains.  Extra virgin olive oil or coconut oil are very low cost and natural alternatives.  Rating 2 1/2 stars, rounded down to 2 stars.</li>
            <li> First of all, you should know that I&#x27;m 47 years old. I&#x27;m just now starting to show my age in a my skin but I&#x27;m not too \\&quot;old\\&quot; looking yet. My eye area is probably going to start needing some help so when this cream came up in my Vine queue, I thought \\&quot;Well, I&#x27;ll try it out.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To \\&quot;test\\&quot; the cream, I applied it (almost) every day for about 28 days to my left eye area but didn&#x27;t apply it to my right eye area. Thought that would help me determine if the cream made a difference. Here is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream definitely made made the skin around my left eye FEEL noticeably smoother than the skin around my right eye. On some days, I felt like my left eye area actually looked better too. Overall, I didn&#x27;t notice a dramatic difference between the two when you just LOOK at them. The biggest change came in how the skin FELT (a bit tighter, smoother and \\&quot;younger\\&quot; if that makes sense). As I mentioned, I&#x27;m not quite wrinkly in this area YET so I didn&#x27;t see a dramatic difference. (Plus this was only for a short period of time ... and some days I was too rushed and forgot to the put the cream on. It definitely wasn&#x27;t the most rigorous test.) However, I feel the cream has potential to help out ... and I don&#x27;t think it would hurt to try it out if this is an issue for you. I&#x27;m one of those people who probably should have been moisturizing for my whole life and am just now realizing what aging can do to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve not tried other eye creams (just this one) so I&#x27;m not sure I can be the best judge of whether this is the best out there or even dramatically better than other available creams. Bottom line: My opinion is that it didn&#x27;t hurt but you should probably read more reviews and compare products before deciding if this is the cream for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few more comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The cream came with a little plastic \\&quot;spatula\\&quot; thing to get it out of the jar. Although I used it the first few times, I then just used my finger to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;* Based on how much cream they tell you to use, I think one jar would last a fairly long time.&lt;br /&gt;* The bottle is nicely packaged and looks quite \\&quot;luxe.\\&quot;you to use, I think one jar would last a fairly long time.  * The bottle is nicely packaged and looks quite \\&quot;luxe.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and thin skin around my eyes.  This cream is very light and doesn&#x27;t make my eyes look puffy after application.  You really don&#x27;t need much of this cream, just the size of a rice grain is enough for daily application.  Therefore, I think its priced very reasonably as the jar will last for a year for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for 3 week.  My wrinkles haven&#x27;t disappeared but the skin around my eyes looks healthier and it&#x27;s also easy to apply the eye concealer to cover dark circles after using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this cream!</li>
            <li> For less than half an ounce, it&#x27;s pricey, at $125. Having said that, the jar will last several months. You can use your finger or the little spatula it comes with to pick up the tiniest amount and put it on your pinky finger. I use the dabber. I use the smaller end to scoop up a little bit, and scrape the cream onto my pinky finger. I close the jar and set it down. Then I take 1/2 of the cream off my left pinky with my right pinky. Using both fingers at the same time, I rub the cream around the 3 sides of my eye area, skipping the space between my eyes. I can tell if I&#x27;ve used too much cream because it absorbs quickly, and I can feel the sensation on my eyeballs, the same way I feel it when I use too much castor oil to clean my face at night - it feels like you&#x27;ve got something in your eye. After a few days you&#x27;ll learn how much to pick up with the spatula or your finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While others have noticed a lightening of the skin around their eyes, I have not. I am a brown-skinned African-American woman, and I think I&#x27;d feel a need to visit the emergency room if my skin became translucent. I turned 43 yesterday and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, especially around my eyes, but I am using this product more as a preventive step than as a remover. The skin around my eyes do feel smoother and plumper, although I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s something that will go away if I discontinue use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way, so this should last at least 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been one week my wife has been using SK-II and at first she said it did nothing for her but after 3 days she said she loved it. Now as a husband I really don&#x27;t care if it works or not as long as she thinks it works. Whatever makes her happy is good with me. I said to her that $125 for a tiny bottle of eye lotion is insane but she said it was a normal price. Apparently I&#x27;m out of the cosmetic loop. She claims it will easily last her six months so I guess it&#x27;s not too expensive. Too be the byproduct of brewing beer should be a lot cheaper but hey what do I know?</li>
            <li> The brand, SK-II belongs to Proctor and Gamble and the Essential Power Eye Cream is made in Japan.  The advertising for the cream states that it includes Stem-Acanax Eye Complex and Pitera.  Stem-Acanax is a plant derived ingredient taken from the root of Siberian Ginseng.  Pitera is a liquid produced in the fermentation process of yeast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Clinique&#x27;s Repairwear Laser Focus Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream for years and have been happy with it but have also keen to try other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Clinique Eye Cream to be a little stiff and I had to actively massage it into the skin around my eyes.  In comparison, the SK-II cream is softer and easier to apply.  It is readily absorbed into the skin.  The SK-II cream comes with a plastic applicator which is a nice touch so that you dont have to use your fingers remove the cream from its container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin around my eyes is normally very dry and I have found the SK-II cream to be lightweight and hydrating.  Just a little bit of the cream seems to be sufficient to keep the skin from feeling tight.  My eyes are normally sensitive to the products I use on the skin around my eyes, but I have had no problems with irritation due to the use of the SK-II cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the SK-II is good at hydrating skin, but does it reduce wrinkles?  The product literature reads that you will see noticeable differences in two weeks.  Maybe it is that I was already using wrinkle correcting cream before using the SK-II cream, but I havent noticed any changes.  But, nor have any new wrinkles appeared that I have noticed and my skin around my eyes does feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem that I had was a blemish that appeared after I started using the SK-II cream.  I normally never see blemishes near my eyes.  I cant say that it was caused by the SK-II cream, but it did appear around the time that I started using the cream.  However, it has now gone despite my continued use of the SK-II cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to consider when ordering is that the instructions advise against keeping the cream in extreme heat or cold.  My package with the cream arrived on a day when the temperature was below freezing and the cream sat in the cold for hours until I got home to bring the package inside.  I cant tell if the cream was affected by the cold, but the exposure of the cream to cold and heat during delivery is something to keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with the SK-II Essential Power Eye Cream.  The skin around my eyes feels hydrated and it doesnt irritate my eyes.  As for the reduction of wrinkles around the eyes, only time will tell how effective the cream is.</li>
            <li> Been using this about two weeks, and so far I have noticed my skin being more supple and youthful looking.  Can&#x27;t iron out whether it&#x27;s a fluke or solely due to this cream, but it&#x27;s my observation.  Yes, it&#x27;s very expensive to buy this product but keep in mind that the SK-II brand has been around for a very long time and has sold very well in its local Japanese market, so this is no fly by night infomercial product featuring some fake doctor to show off fake before and after photos.  I have a lot of faith that it does what it says it needs to do.  Of course, long term use is the recommended course of action and I have used this for a very short period of time.  Overall, I would say if you&#x27;re looking for something that will produce real results, don&#x27;t overlook this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now and do not notice any difference or improvement at all.  For the whopping price on this teeny tiny jar of product, I expect at least a slight improvement in that time frame or at least something about the product that sets it apart and I&#x27;ve experienced neither.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think the product absorbs well and it has a slight sting after applying.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had better results using sweet almond oil than I did this stuff and I&#x27;ll stick with that and products that don&#x27;t have an ingredient list a mile long of things I don&#x27;t recognize.</li>
            <li> Having lived in Asia for several years, I was already familiar with the quality of Japanese beauty products. Yes, they cost more but are usually worth the difference in price if they work for you.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first SK-II product I have tried and the quality itself did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is that of a rich lotion rather than heavy cream, which worked well for me (others with much drier skin may prefer a heavier product). There was no discernible scent, which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;The cream went on very smoothly, and as others have noted, a little goes a long way. It absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling very silky but not oily. It left no residue and I was able to apply makeup within a few minutes, which is unusual for an eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;As to the big question of if it works, I guess that depends on what your expectations are.&lt;br /&gt;As an eye cream, it works well and I can see an improvement in my skin, but that may also be due to me getting into a better skin care routine of using an eye product on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too soon to see any miracle difference, so if you are expecting to try this once and suddenly look like Angelina Jolie, you will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;But it is definitely a quality eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s up to each individual to decide if this - or any beauty product - is worth the price</li>
            <li> Although my skin has yet to show major signs of aging, I know that I must start thinking about preventing mother nature from taking control.  The SKII Essential Power Eye Cream is a good choice.  The cream comes with a spatula for easy scooping from the cream pot and it absorbs quickly under my eyes and over my lids. The cream has a very faint but pleasant scent and it is lightweight when applied.  It is not greasy and has a luxurious feel.  After the first week of use, I have noticed some firming of my eyelids and the area under my eyes look less sunken in.  I truly believe that over time and consistent use of the product, that the early signs of my crows feet on the corners of my eyes will diminish.  This is one of the best eye creams I have used.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is pretty nice. Just a little is needed per application, and it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly without any greasy feeling afterwards. The results I&#x27;ve seen have been two-fold: the short-term results that only last a few hours and the long term ones that take a week or so to start noticing. On the downside is the size-to-price ratio is a bit much. I&#x27;ve used other products that cost half as much but where the results ar every similar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly young and have fine lines around my eyes but no deep wrinkles yet. This cream made an immediate noticeable difference in improving the fine lines around my eyes, however, it hasn&#x27;t appeared to be a lasting difference (at least not yet). When I use the cream I notice an improvement, however, by the end of the day or the next day if I&#x27;ve used the cream at night before bed, I don&#x27;t continue to see the difference. If you&#x27;re committed to using this product then you might be pleased but if you&#x27;re hoping for something that will make a lasting long-term difference this might not be the product for you. I do think it&#x27;s great for special occasions or if you&#x27;ll be having portraits done but I can&#x27;t see spending this much money on eye cream on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I have been diligently using this SK-II Essential Power Eye Cream twice a day for a few weeks.  The positives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It&#x27;s has a light, creamy texture&lt;br /&gt;2.  There is almost no scent&lt;br /&gt;3.  It does not sting your eyes or make them tear&lt;br /&gt;4.  It absorbs quickly and does not clump up or make your make run&lt;br /&gt;5.  It does moisturize&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downsides:&lt;br /&gt;1.  I didn&#x27;t find it moisturizing enough, albeit it is winter, and had to supplement with another cream in the corner of my eyes&lt;br /&gt;2.  Did not noticeably change the small, shallow lines around my eyes&lt;br /&gt;3.  Has quite a high cost for what it delivers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a nice eye cream with a lot to offer, but it does not deliver on the more optimistic product claims.</li>
            <li> Knowing that a sample of SK-II Essential Power Eye Cream is $125 a jar, I still did a double take when I received it. The jar is the size of a tiny tangerine, the glass walls are thick and the lid is larger than the size of the jar. And, there is only 0.49 fluid ounces of its purported fountain of youth eye cream inside. At $125 for a half-ounce, I was expecting miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar comes with a tiny spatula for measuring the less than peas-sized amount (\\&quot;approximately 0.5 cm in diameter\\&quot;) needed for each application. I used the spatula once then tossed it when I realized that dabbing my finger tip into the cream not only provides the same amount needed but is less clumsy and wasteful. The cream applies smoothly but does not absorb completely into the skin for almost an hour. There is no chemical smell and no skin irritation. I have religiously used the product twice daily for almost a month now and find myself hard-pressed to say if there is a difference or not.  Granted, at 51 years of age, all my wrinkles are well earned and not likely to give way to anything less than surgical means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other brands of eye cream in the past and all, including the SK-II, appear to have the same effect on my skin. But, the 2-ounce jar of another brand I have used in the past is only $36. Two ounces of SK-II would cost $500. So, bearing in mind the results versus the price tag, and finding the results between the two products to be equal, I would rather use another product.</li>
            <li> Since my wife and I have oily, sensitive skin, I have just one demand of a health/beauty product - please don&#x27;t irritate my skin and cause a reaction of some kind. So far, SK-II hasn&#x27;t let me down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a small jar and you only need to use a little bit on your finger. With facial creams you can apply liberally, but with this you don&#x27;t need much. And considering how expensive it is, you&#x27;ll want to conserve!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a week it&#x27;s been leaving our skin soft and moisturized. More importantly, the skin around our eyes looks great.</li>
            <li> This SK-II Essential Power eye cream absorbs well into the skin, unlike others I&#x27;ve used which seem to sit on top and can cause my glasses to slide down the bridge of my nose. I have sensitive skin and have broken out from eye creams before, but haven&#x27;t noticed any ill effects of this one. It&#x27;s hydrating, and my undereye makeup/concealer no longer cakes and creases. The downside is that this eye cream hasn&#x27;t done much for my dark circles, and as other users have noted sometimes actually seems to accentuate them. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over four straight weeks, morning and evening, and don&#x27;t see any significant improvement to justify the cost of this over other brands&#x27; creams that I have used and like before. A little does go a long way, however, and this small jar will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> This bottle is surprisingly small, but if you use it as directed with the micro-spatula that&#x27;s included, it should last quite a while. Both my wife and I tried the product and it appeared that our eye lids were getting smoother, but the results seem temporary -- when we stopped, our eyelids went back to their previous state.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start out by saying that I&#x27;m only in my early thirties so I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkling in the eye area as of yet, but this came as a test product and I was eager to try it because my family is genetically prone to under eye darkness.  I&#x27;ve had it since I was a teenager, and by the time I hit my twenties that darkness spread to the over-eye and eyelid area as well.  So I&#x27;ve been in search of products that will improve this over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other creams I&#x27;ve used, I didn&#x27;t experience any tingling, redness, stinging etc.  In fact, this feels wonderful going on.  It&#x27;s cool and soothing and the directions tell you to rub it in a circular motion with your ring finger which is soothing in itself.  It feels like a spa treatment for the eyes!  I&#x27;ve only used it for less than a week but I feel like I can already see some results in terms of making that under eye darkness less noticeable.  But beyond just the physical appearance is the effect I&#x27;m experiencing in skin texture.  It&#x27;s incredible actually, especially for such a short period of time.  The skin under and around my eyes is amazingly soft now, much more so than before and easily the silkiest skin on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the price.  It&#x27;s quite expensive and a very small bottle.  However, you only need to use just a tiny bit at a time, so even though it&#x27;s a small bottle it should last a very long time.</li>
