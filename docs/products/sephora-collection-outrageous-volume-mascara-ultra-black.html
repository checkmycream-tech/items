            <li>I love this product it givs your eye lashed the best length</li>
            <li>Good my wife likes it</li>
            <li>I have to kind of scrape it along the side</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice mascara</li>
            <li>so I dont want to ding it too much because its an AWESOME mascara.</li>
            <li>It clumps which most would complain about.</li>
            <li>It lengthened my lashes like nothing else, but it made them look more clumpy than what I like and not too voluminous.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE NORMALLY I LOVE THIS MASCARA</li>
            <li>I would recomend this to anyone looking for mascara that gives your lashes more length.</li>
            <li>The mascara is great except it clumps too much</li>
            <li>It is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>It is an okay eyeliner</li>
            <li>When I first applied it I loved the brush and effect.  </li>
            <li>It applies easily</li>
            <li>I would not even take this as a free sample.</li>
            <li>After years of searching I finally found an amazing mascara!</li>
            <li>Love it but ran out super fast!</li>
            <li>I love so many of Sephora&#x27;s products but will be skipping this one next time.</li>
            <li>This mascara really makes my eyelashes &amp;#34;pop.&amp;#34; I got it in a demo version first and fell in love.</li>
            <li>I bought this mascara from the store, thinking it&#x27;d be an all right product, and it was just that: all right.</li>
            <li>I absolutely had to have the full size of this mascara when I first sampled the trial size.</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look twice as long and full and very sexy even with no other makeup.</li>
            <li>True, there is a little excess on the tip of the wand that you have to kind of lightly scrape back into the rim</li>
            <li>In order to have a really good mascara that I would buy over and over, there has to be mascara thick enough to volumize lashes without being a globby mess, plus a really good brush that holds enough mascara to give good coverage</li>
            <li>I have long eyelashes but need a good volumizing mascara and brush to bring out my blonde lashes.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t experience any clumping issues, but it does absolutely nothing for my lashes.</li>
            <li>and it lasts for the whole day.</li>
            <li>Very clumpy</li>
            <li>I like the concept of the special applicator, but it just ends up with big glops of mascara on it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on particularly well, either.</li>
            <li>I splurged for the full size shortly after and was so excited to use it with my other makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge makeup person but love my mascaras.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge mess.</li>
            <li>I THINK THE PRODUCT WAS OLD</li>
            <li>but they have blonde tips and don&#x27;t curl very well.</li>
            <li>I get compliments all the time on how long my lashes are and if they&#x27;re real.</li>
            <li>Adds volume but can clump if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li>Even with multiple coats, it barely looks like I am wearing any mascara at all.</li>

            <li> I like it.  It clumps which most would complain about. It&#x27;s too expensive</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara from the store, thinking it&#x27;d be an all right product, and it was just that: all right. It lengthened my lashes like nothing else, but it made them look more clumpy than what I like and not too voluminous. I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s gone but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I&#x27;m not a fan of the \\&quot;spider-leg\\&quot; look, and this product gave me that.</li>
            <li> Love it but ran out super fast!</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and just as described</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used.  I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This mascara really makes my eyelashes &amp;#34;pop.&amp;#34; I got it in a demo version first and fell in love. True, there is a little excess on the tip of the wand that you have to kind of lightly scrape back into the rim but that&#x27;s no biggie for me. I get the voluminous effect of wearing false lashes with just a mascara. Yay! Even my sister stole my spare tube and tried to discreetly ask me where I got it. So now I&#x27;m buying her one too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters Christmas stocking.  It&#x27;s a Great working mascara. She loves it and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the Sephora store when I went in to buy a more expensive name brand mascara.  The sales rep talked me in to buying the Sephora brand claiming that it  would give the same results at half the price.  When I first applied it I loved the brush and effect.  I have long eyelashes but need a good volumizing mascara and brush to bring out my blonde lashes.  My lashes looked great but by the time I got to my 10am meeting my associate ask me if I was O.K.  He thought I had been crying.  I was so embarrassed after the meeting when I went in the bathroom and found mascara above and below my eyes.  Even the sides looked like I&#x27;d been in a boxing match.  Having said that, I&#x27;m no expert with makeup.  Did I miss something?  Do you have to use a primer with this mascara to keep it in place?  This did not work for me at all.  Back to Cover Girl or Trish McElvoy on sale.</li>
            <li> I have now tried this twice. Don&#x27;t ask me why-- I guess I momentarily forgot about my first bad experience. I like the concept of the special applicator, but it just ends up with big glops of mascara on it. It makes a huge mess. I have to kind of scrape it along the side so it doesn&#x27;t come out covered in black tar. It doesn&#x27;t go on particularly well, either. Glops on my lashes. I would not even take this as a free sample.</li>
            <li> In order to have a really good mascara that I would buy over and over, there has to be mascara thick enough to volumize lashes without being a globby mess, plus a really good brush that holds enough mascara to give good coverage but still separate lashes.  I have found a number of brands that meet that criteria.  This is not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush bristles are very short and don&#x27;t seem to separate my lashes.  Another problem is that the brush is holding too much mascara or the mascara is too thick and just makes my lashes stick together with lots of mascara on them.  I realize that some mascara works better with thin lashes than with thick, and some brushes work better with some lashes than others, but with my experience with Sephora&#x27;s Outrageous Volume Mascara, I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> cLUMPY AND HARD TO USE.....I THINK THE PRODUCT WAS OLD BECAUSE NORMALLY I LOVE THIS MASCARA</li>
            <li> Good my wife likes it and she is happy</li>
            <li> Adds volume but can clump if you are not careful.  I like it enough to continue buying it, third time.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this stuff AT ALL. It applies easily and I didn&#x27;t experience any clumping issues, but it does absolutely nothing for my lashes. Even with multiple coats, it barely looks like I am wearing any mascara at all. Even worse is that it begins to flake after a few hours of wear, so I had raccoon eyes by mid-afternoon. Stay away from this cheap crap!</li>
            <li> I love this product it givs your eye lashed the best length and it lasts for the whole day. I would recomend this to anyone looking for mascara that gives your lashes more length.</li>
            <li> The mascara is great except it clumps too much so that was a little disappointing. It&#x27;s nice mascara but you have to get the clumps off your lashes.</li>
            <li> After years of searching I finally found an amazing mascara! I have long eyelashes but they have blonde tips and don&#x27;t curl very well. This mascara works awesome to volumize, separate and curl my eyelashes. It is my all time favorite. I get compliments all the time on how long my lashes are and if they&#x27;re real. I&#x27;m not a huge makeup person but love my mascaras. This is the best I&#x27;ve found in years!</li>
            <li> I ordered this mascara but I received eyeliner instead. It is an okay eyeliner but it is not what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I found this mascara to be a bit of a disappointment.  Very clumpy and it begins to flake off after a few hours wear. I love so many of Sephora&#x27;s products but will be skipping this one next time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely had to have the full size of this mascara when I first sampled the trial size. It makes my lashes look twice as long and full and very sexy even with no other makeup. Often times, mascara is the only makeup I will use for daytime so it was a find that I couldnt wait to tell everyone about. The trial size was great. I splurged for the full size shortly after and was so excited to use it with my other makeup. When it first arrived, I used it constantly for about a week before I noticed that it is incredibly hard to remove. I have the sephora makeup remover and nars make up remover amongst other methods and it is very difficult to remove in its entirety. Not to mention, I noticed when Im trying to get it off my lashes that it started to pull my lashes out. Whats the point of wearing mascara if by the time your done with one tube, you have no lashes left?? I gave this mascara a 4 star because it does what it says it does. Its getting it to stop doing what it does is the problem. Perhaps, Im missing something in regards to removal so I dont want to ding it too much because its an AWESOME mascara. but unfortunately for me, Im going to go back to the drawing board to find my ultimate mascara.</li>
