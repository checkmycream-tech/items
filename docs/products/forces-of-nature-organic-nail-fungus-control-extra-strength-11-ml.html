    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best results of any nail treatment I have used.</li>
            <li>I found out that they hired &#x27;actors&#x27; with none of these &#x27;nail problems&#x27; (but with especially nice hands and feet) to give testimonials.</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my story on this great product and what you can expect from it...</li>
            <li>I bought Dr. Remedy&#x27;s Nail polishes (has Tea Tree Oil, Vitamins, Wheat Protein specifically to &amp;#60; fungal issues) - great colors/base coat.</li>
            <li>2 times if I am home all day - it is working great.  </li>
            <li>but glad I stuck with it!!</li>
            <li>I will let my friends know on how good it works.</li>
            <li>Bottom-line - was really pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>wash your hands afterwards - not the most pleasant of smells</li>
            <li>I do my own.</li>
            <li>I just know it worked on my toes very well and was extremely happy about it!</li>
            <li>I bought this and within a week, the nail bed began to look better.</li>
            <li>I almost have a full grown toenail.</li>
            <li>You just have to be patient and consistent with it and it may not work as well on advanced cases -</li>
            <li>it is easy to drop on my toes and really seems to be working.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to turn to laser treatments or chemical treatments without trying more natural means 1st.</li>
            <li>After reading trying to many different cures, and reading reviews on the Forces of Nature product, I really hoped this was the magic bullet.</li>
            <li>Also has a very nice scent, heavy on the sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;PSS-</li>
            <li>Here we are 3 months later and my toe nail has grown-out and is clean and healthy again.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly?</li>
            <li>The quality of the ingredients and smell is fine, seems high quality and not offensive.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working, will know more later.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve attached pictures as proof - the most recent one is from today.</li>
            <li>I also now use it immediately after clipping/filing my finger and toe nails as it&#x27;s very soothing and can only guess that it works as well or better preventatively than curatively.</li>
            <li>The one nice thing about this medicine is that it does help take away the yellowness of your toenails if you needed to go out for a stroll with your little piggies out.</li>
            <li>and I feel the Extra Strength version was what really helped the most - since it was the only thing I consistently did for 8 months!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for one week and can already see a huge improvement in my nails.</li>
            <li>(Found out that if nails are not trimmed more-or-less straight across &amp; edges go in &amp; implements trimming not 100% sterile - can cause ingrown toenails &amp; fungal issues).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know, since I didn&#x27;t have to resort to that.</li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>absolutely gone</li>
            <li>I really wish it had worked .. the search continues.</li>
            <li>It would have taken much less time if I had been more aggressive about treating it in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;PS-</li>
            <li>I noticed that each time my nail polish was being removed at salon, my right big toe nail &amp; 4th digit of right toe was yellow on right side of nail.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to anyone struggling with stubborn toenail fungus.</li>
            <li>for the affected 2 toes &amp; sterilized by spritzing with Walgreens spray bottle alcohol when done using each time - not soak in it - just a quick spray; (7) and every morning &amp; every night put on Forces of Nature Organic Nail Fungus Control Extra Strength on top of nail &amp; underneath &amp; rubbed in for a few seconds...</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work because I heard so many horror stories about the medicine they use to clear toenail fungus, but this product only slows down the fungus it does not cure it.  </li>
            <li>but hey - I&#x27;m busy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m busy!</li>
            <li>2nd month - definite slowly getting better &amp; bottom of nail bed nice &amp; pink where it used to be white/yellow...</li>
            <li>It has completely irradicated  the fungus on my toe.....</li>
            <li>It might work if you are in the early stages but for me I had it in every nail.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had an aggravating nail fungus just &amp;#34;show up&amp;#34; on one of my big toes one day, but didnt think much about it...</li>
            <li>Not cheap but worth it!</li>
            <li>The bottle is tough to use, needs a brush, and the smell is potent.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this product as it is natural and will not harm your liver like the other prescription medications out there.</li>
            <li>, (5) for three months soaked my feet in Purely Northwest Tea Tree Oil foot soak a few times a week..</li>

            <li> , (5) for three months soaked my feet in Purely Northwest Tea Tree Oil foot soak a few times a week..</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what I did... (1) Did not use nail polish, (2) walked only with open toed shoes in house vs. barefoot, (3) kept feet dry (4)  used UV shoe sterilizer called SteriShoe+ &amp; used once/week...</li>
            <li> The fungus also spread to two of my other toes on the same foot.</li>
            <li> As long as we&#x27;re using it everyday it seems to minimize the fungus but not totally get rid of it.</li>
            <li> Super frustrating!</li>
            <li> 1st month - not much difference...</li>
            <li> After trying everything under the sun including harsh oral medications that made me I&#x27;ll I finally found this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first since nothing I had tried worked but it worked.</li>
            <li> some people say everyday...</li>
            <li> some people did everyday in websites...</li>
            <li> Do not buy it does not work, I used it for few months and nothing changed.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it to anyone - waste of money.</li>
            <li> My nail grew and fell off, turned green and then fell off again.</li>
            <li> in fact, my big toe nail has gotten even worse.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;After not doing anything about it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this for about 3 months now, and already, her nails have dramatically improved that we hardly notice where there was fungus once.</li>
            <li> I will buy again to at least control the problem.</li>
            <li> If you have extremely bad nail fungus..just go to the doctor.</li>
            <li> it became rather disgusting-looking and slightly painful.</li>

            <li> It works. Be faithful though.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and see it work where some did not I will let my friends know on how good it works.</li>
            <li> The bottle is tough to use, needs a brush, and the smell is potent. It did work somewhat, but the application process needs work.</li>
            <li> Best results of any nail treatment I have used.</li>
            <li> This product actually works. I&#x27;ve only used it for one week and can already see a huge improvement in my nails.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Supposed to be guaranteed to work, totally doesn&#x27;t. Back to the drawing board I guess... Super frustrating! Wear slippers at the gym.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my story on this great product and what you can expect from it... I used to get pedicures on a regular basis for years until last year. I noticed that each time my nail polish was being removed at salon, my right big toe nail &amp; 4th digit of right toe was yellow on right side of nail. I poo-pooed it and thought it was just because I wore nail polish a lot &amp; it was yellowing nail. But then I noticed it just looked funkier each time I went (end of nail brittle/flaky, etc). I decided to take the polish off my self one day &amp; left it off because I realized it was a fungal infection! As an RN - I should have figured this out sooner - oh well! (Found out that if nails are not trimmed more-or-less straight across &amp; edges go in &amp; implements trimming not 100% sterile - can cause ingrown toenails &amp; fungal issues). Well - I looked at tons or websites/product reviews/medical info/talked to podiatrists at work and being the stubborn lady I am - I didn&#x27;t want to turn to laser treatments or chemical treatments without trying more natural means 1st. I was going to give it 4 months to see some result since I knew toenails take a while to grow out. Here&#x27;s what I did... (1) Did not use nail polish, (2) walked only with open toed shoes in house vs. barefoot, (3) kept feet dry (4)  used UV shoe sterilizer called SteriShoe+ &amp; used once/week... some people say everyday... but hey - I&#x27;m busy!, (5) for three months soaked my feet in Purely Northwest Tea Tree Oil foot soak a few times a week.. again... some people did everyday in websites... but again.... I&#x27;m busy!; (6) bought separate toe nail clipper (Seki Edge), Emery Board, etc. for the affected 2 toes &amp; sterilized by spritzing with Walgreens spray bottle alcohol when done using each time - not soak in it - just a quick spray; (7) and every morning &amp; every night put on Forces of Nature Organic Nail Fungus Control Extra Strength on top of nail &amp; underneath &amp; rubbed in for a few seconds... wash your hands afterwards - not the most pleasant of smells &amp; you don&#x27;t want to touch your eyes afterwards of course! 1st month - not much difference... 2nd month - definite slowly getting better &amp; bottom of nail bed nice &amp; pink where it used to be white/yellow... 3rd month - continued improvement... and each month improved so kept routine going. It took 8 months for it to be totally gone (the length of time for my nail to grow out) - but glad I stuck with it!! Will NEVER go back to get pedicure again - I do my own. I bought Dr. Remedy&#x27;s Nail polishes (has Tea Tree Oil, Vitamins, Wheat Protein specifically to &amp;#60; fungal issues) - great colors/base coat. Not cheap but worth it! I use the Forces of Nature Organic Nail Fungus once a week or so - or whenever I think about it - but just the regular strength version - I may be paranoid but I don&#x27;t want it coming back and I feel the Extra Strength version was what really helped the most - since it was the only thing I consistently did for 8 months! You just have to be patient and consistent with it and it may not work as well on advanced cases - I just know it worked on my toes very well and was extremely happy about it! Just know that your toenail fungus probably didn&#x27;t develop overnight &amp; it will probably take until the nail grows out to eliminate it. Only &amp;#34;quicker&amp;#34; solution may be laser - I don&#x27;t really know, since I didn&#x27;t have to resort to that. Bottom-line - was really pleased with this product! Good luck!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both like this for toe nail fungus. As long as we&#x27;re using it everyday it seems to minimize the fungus but not totally get rid of it. If we stop using it, the fungus flares back. The quality of the ingredients and smell is fine, seems high quality and not offensive. When we run out, we specifically buy the same one again.</li>
            <li> These products take time to work, and although I only have time to apply 1-2 times a day. 2 times if I am home all day - it is working great.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This really works.  It has completely irradicated  the fungus on my toe.....absolutely gone</li>
            <li> If you have extremely bad nail fungus..just go to the doctor. I really wanted this to work because I heard so many horror stories about the medicine they use to clear toenail fungus, but this product only slows down the fungus it does not cure it.  It might work if you are in the early stages but for me I had it in every nail.&lt;br /&gt;  The one nice thing about this medicine is that it does help take away the yellowness of your toenails if you needed to go out for a stroll with your little piggies out.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this for about 3 months now, and already, her nails have dramatically improved that we hardly notice where there was fungus once. We highly recommend this product as it is natural and will not harm your liver like the other prescription medications out there.</li>
            <li> This remedy worked like a miracle for two of my relatives. In fact, nail fungus on ALL of their toenails disappeared after a month of use, and never came back!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it but, I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27;t work. It just may not work as well as you see on TV. I found out that they hired &#x27;actors&#x27; with none of these &#x27;nail problems&#x27; (but with especially nice hands and feet) to give testimonials. FYI...</li>
            <li> Seems to be working, will know more later. Bought another batch.</li>
            <li> Finally, something that is helping my fungus and not doing me any harm...it is easy to drop on my toes and really seems to be working.</li>
            <li> Do not buy it does not work, I used it for few months and nothing changed. I would not recommend it to anyone - waste of money.</li>
            <li> After trying everything under the sun including harsh oral medications that made me I&#x27;ll I finally found this product. It actually works. No side effects! Highly recommend it to anyone struggling with stubborn toenail fungus. Nothing else worked.</li>
            <li> I had an injury when I was in the military that caused my big toenail to fall and ever since then, it never healed completely. My nail grew and fell off, turned green and then fell off again. I tried everything. Listerine, vapor rub, and even the laser treatments to no avail. I bought this and within a week, the nail bed began to look better. I almost have a full grown toenail. The fungus also spread to two of my other toes on the same foot. They have grown too. I was skeptical at first since nothing I had tried worked but it worked. I will buy again to at least control the problem. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with nail fungus for several years. After reading trying to many different cures, and reading reviews on the Forces of Nature product, I really hoped this was the magic bullet. I&#x27;ve been applying this regularly (2x a day) for over 6 months and seen no improvement .. in fact, my big toe nail has gotten even worse. I&#x27;ve attached pictures as proof - the most recent one is from today. I really wish it had worked .. the search continues. Ugh.</li>
            <li> I had an aggravating nail fungus just &amp;#34;show up&amp;#34; on one of my big toes one day, but didnt think much about it... UNTIL...&lt;br /&gt;After not doing anything about it for a few weeks it became rather disgusting-looking and slightly painful. I began a diligent regimen of applying this product morning and night, plus vigorously scrubbing the end of my toe with a toothbrush dipped in isopropyl alcohol and drying it just before applying the NFC. Here we are 3 months later and my toe nail has grown-out and is clean and healthy again.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly? It would have taken much less time if I had been more aggressive about treating it in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;PS- Also has a very nice scent, heavy on the sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;PSS- I also now use it immediately after clipping/filing my finger and toe nails as it&#x27;s very soothing and can only guess that it works as well or better preventatively than curatively.</li>
