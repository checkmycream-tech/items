            <li>It is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried in 50 years!  </li>
            <li>Best shampoo ever and the fragrance is great!</li>

            <li>Save your money and have beautiful shiny,soft,silky hair.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>works good and smell great</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would also like to add that I&#x27;ve tried a number of hair products from this brand, and loved them all.</li>
            <li>, I AM VERY SATISFIED</li>
            <li>I love everything about this brand!</li>
            <li>and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Leaves hair smooth and the perfume is.... great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice shampoo, just not for me.</li>
            <li>I own this set of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but it does not make my wavy poofy hair any straighter.</li>
            <li>WITH MY FRIENDS, AMAZON SELLS CUTE THINGS AND GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li>The shampoo is good and makes the hair feel better, but when I received the shampoo, the bottle had shampoo liquid marks all around the bottle(specifically around the bottle cap).</li>
            <li>BEST product out there including all those high priced salon products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does smell good, but if you&#x27;re looking for a sulfate free shampoo, you have to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Great product, got here relatively fast!</li>
            <li>This is a lovely shampoo, but not for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ticked - this is NOT SULFATE FREE!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t build up residue on my hair like many shampoos do</li>
            <li>We love OGX products in our house.</li>
            <li>No frizzies despite the most humid conditions even in the tropics.</li>
            <li>I also love the coconut smell.</li>
            <li>I tried so many shampoos but, finally, this shampoo is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and love the way my hair looks and feels after use.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Works well on removing hairspray from the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I love this particular shampoo because it makes my hair feel great</li>
            <li>Anyways, for a phosphate free shampoo, it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>- There are better values out there for phosphate free shampoos.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d compare them to Aveda Smooth Infuser with respect to frizz, but with an added straightening benefit and at a better price.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this shampoo/conditioner and treatment conditioner (in the pot)!</li>
            <li>I have fine wavy hair that can become frizzy when air-dried.</li>
            <li>Free</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been so soft and it smells good too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfectly fine shampoo that&#x27;s better than Pantene Pro V or Garnier Fructis, but then again, its pretty ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As usual, smells good, feels good, and the price is gooood.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see that they changed their name from Organix to OGX as their products aren&#x27;t very organic!  </li>
            <li>Am not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair straight, smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>So worth the price.</li>
            <li>Smooth, soft, shiny hair ...</li>
            <li>I really like the shampoo it smells nice and left my hair soft and with such a shine, I was really pleased with this product,</li>
            <li>LIKE SO MUCH</li>
            <li>My husband, who has plenty of normal hair uses this shampoo and really likes it.</li>
            <li>Very thick consistency and a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>I recommended to all who has a little imrovement in her hair :)</li>
            <li>When the bottle cap was opened it clearly has the shampoo marks all around the cap.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell too much as I also use hair straightener after I blow dry.  </li>
            <li>My hair is extremely straight already and the other OGX keratin shampoo causes my fine, somewhat thin hair to feel thicker and actually seems to be re-growing hair for me!</li>
            <li>I feel its a little more expensive than L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s or other phosphate free shampoos though.  </li>
            <li>I used the Shampoo for the first time last weekend, I have a few others from this line I have been reading review after review on this product</li>
            <li>Using Ever Straight, all I have to do is put my partially air-dried hair into a low bun and my hair dries mostly straight with some loose curl and NO frizzâ€“ even without using any other products!</li>

            <li> So, if you have normal hair, perhaps a little too curly, you probably will appreciate this shampoo a lot.</li>
            <li> They work as well, if not better, than high dollar shampoos you can only buy in the salon.</li>
            <li> Since we started using this on our daughter&#x27;s hair, we have had far less tears over tangles.</li>
            <li> Have been using the conditioner for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t very detangling as I find it hard to comb after I air dry it or blow dry it.</li>
            <li> I also use the Anti-Breakage Serum before I blow dry, and it makes my hair SO SHINY!</li>
            <li> The shampoo bottle looks as if it was previously used by someone or if not the shampoo liquid is taken out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam</li>
            <li> Really works and performs as a very expensive shampoo.</li>
            <li> The second ingredient is Olefin Sulfonate, which is just as bad as SLS.</li>
            <li> My takeaway is that coconut oil in your shampoo is bad especially when the shampoo is organic and weak.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are not disclosed on this page and I&#x27;m so frustrated that I spent almost $10 for this</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s beyond my expectation!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to see that they changed their name from Organix to OGX as their products aren&#x27;t very organic!  Anyways, for a phosphate free shampoo, it is pretty good.  Very thick consistency and a pleasant smell.  Does it make my hair noticeably straighter?  I can&#x27;t tell too much as I also use hair straightener after I blow dry.  I feel its a little more expensive than L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s or other phosphate free shampoos though.  It&#x27;s a perfectly fine shampoo that&#x27;s better than Pantene Pro V or Garnier Fructis, but then again, its pretty ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Phosphate Free&lt;br /&gt;-Thick Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;-Nice Smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#34;Straightening&amp;#34; dubious at best&lt;br /&gt;-Price - There are better values out there for phosphate free shampoos.</li>
            <li> Great product, got here relatively fast!</li>
            <li> works good and smell great</li>
            <li> This is a lovely shampoo, but not for me. My hair is extremely straight already and the other OGX keratin shampoo causes my fine, somewhat thin hair to feel thicker and actually seems to be re-growing hair for me! This shampoo does not do those things. My husband, who has plenty of normal hair uses this shampoo and really likes it. So, if you have normal hair, perhaps a little too curly, you probably will appreciate this shampoo a lot. It&#x27;s nice shampoo, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ticked - this is NOT SULFATE FREE! The second ingredient is Olefin Sulfonate, which is just as bad as SLS. Google it if you don&#x27;t believe me. The ingredients are not disclosed on this page and I&#x27;m so frustrated that I spent almost $10 for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell good, but if you&#x27;re looking for a sulfate free shampoo, you have to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I love this particular shampoo because it makes my hair feel great and it smells amazing. It doesn&#x27;t build up residue on my hair like many shampoos do (I have oily hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to add that I&#x27;ve tried a number of hair products from this brand, and loved them all.</li>
            <li> I own this set of shampoo and conditioner. It smells nice, but it does not make my wavy poofy hair any straighter. It also isn&#x27;t very detangling as I find it hard to comb after I air dry it or blow dry it.</li>
            <li> Only used once. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this shampoo/conditioner and treatment conditioner (in the pot)! It makes my hair straight, smooth and frizz free. I also use the Anti-Breakage Serum before I blow dry, and it makes my hair SO SHINY! I use this on and off with the Coconut Milk products in Organix....I love everything about this brand!</li>
            <li> My takeaway is that coconut oil in your shampoo is bad especially when the shampoo is organic and weak. Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> Really works and performs as a very expensive shampoo. I recommend it even if your hair is not keratin treated.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair smooth and the perfume is.... great.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and I will never ever stray and buy another shampoo and conditioner set again. So worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use this on my keratin straightened hair. My hair loves it and the treatment has lasted going on 10 months. Smooth, soft, shiny hair ... No frizzies. And it smells amazingly delicious with all good ingredients</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so soft and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> We love OGX products in our house. They work as well, if not better, than high dollar shampoos you can only buy in the salon. Since we started using this on our daughter&#x27;s hair, we have had far less tears over tangles.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT RECOMMEND ME LIKE SO MUCH WITH MY FRIENDS, AMAZON SELLS CUTE THINGS AND GOOD PRICE, I AM VERY SATISFIED</li>
            <li> BEST product out there including all those high priced salon products. Save your money and have beautiful shiny,soft,silky hair. Use with the hair mask and you won&#x27;t believe how awesome your hair will be!!!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is good and makes the hair feel better, but when I received the shampoo, the bottle had shampoo liquid marks all around the bottle(specifically around the bottle cap). When the bottle cap was opened it clearly has the shampoo marks all around the cap.The shampoo bottle looks as if it was previously used by someone or if not the shampoo liquid is taken out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam</li>
            <li> It is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried in 50 years!  No frizzies despite the most humid conditions even in the tropics.</li>
            <li> I used the Shampoo for the first time last weekend, I have a few others from this line I have been reading review after review on this product and it took sometime for me to decide on if I should purchase this poduct line. I really like the shampoo it smells nice and left my hair soft and with such a shine, I was really pleased with this product,</li>
            <li> Have been using the conditioner for a long time.  Decided to give the shampoo a try.  Am not disappointed at all.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever and the fragrance is great!</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo with the conditioner. Using them doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair dramatically, but they eliminate frizz and make my hair straighter than it is otherwise. I&#x27;d compare them to Aveda Smooth Infuser with respect to frizz, but with an added straightening benefit and at a better price. I have fine wavy hair that can become frizzy when air-dried. Using Ever Straight, all I have to do is put my partially air-dried hair into a low bun and my hair dries mostly straight with some loose curl and NO frizzâ€“ even without using any other products! After a couple of weeks, I&#x27;m a convert! I also love the coconut smell.</li>
            <li> I tried so many shampoos but, finally, this shampoo is amazing!!!! I recommended to all who has a little imrovement in her hair :)</li>
            <li> As usual, smells good, feels good, and the price is gooood.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and love the way my hair looks and feels after use. This is my new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Works well on removing hairspray from the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use.</li>
