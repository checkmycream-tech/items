            <li> I can only second what another customer has written: this cutter makes me remember why I loved this razor so much when I got it. The cutting heads lasted about a year and a half. But I&#x27;ll change the assembly every year from now on. A sharp set of blades makes a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It couldn&#x27;t be easier, by the way. Just snap the old one of and the new one on. I didn&#x27;t even have to put on my glasses.</li>
            <li> This is excellent cinnamon!</li>
            <li> The replacement shave head arrived earlier than expected intact, with no damage. The price was less than the reail stores even with the shipping so it was a win-win purchase.</li>
            <li> OEM Product, Works as designed. Will Purchase again if available.</li>
            <li> Forgot how much I loved this razor when the blade was sharp! Get a replacement blade each year!</li>
            <li> IT was just what I was looking for. Shipment was good.</li>
            <li> This is the original CoolTec cartridge. I bought two of these since I exclusively shave with Braun products. I am biased, because in my 20 years of shaving, this is my second Braun product. My first one was stolen from my hotel room. These are great products.</li>
            <li> This is an exact replacement head. A little pricey but well worth the cost to keep using my coolTec.</li>
            <li> It was a replacement blade, as described, new and in the plastic case, unopened. Only way it could have been better, is to be cheaper</li>
            <li> Excellent.  FAST DELIVERY</li>
            <li> Product defective but no hassle return. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this razor! No more Shaver Burn!</li>
            <li> allis according to plan</li>
            <li> With my Braun CoolTec Shaver coming up on 16 months, the foil was beginning to show its age.  This OEM foil and cutter replacement works beautifully.  On this razor, the foil and cutters are part of one integrated unit.  You simply pull off the old foil and cutter head, throw it out, and pop on the new one.  Because it can go on only one way, it is even easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep your shaver cutting with a new foil and cutter.</li>
