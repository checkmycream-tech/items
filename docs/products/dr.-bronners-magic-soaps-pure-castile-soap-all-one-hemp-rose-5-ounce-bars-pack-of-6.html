            <li>Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap is a very good soap.</li>
            <li>it a good soap for the price.</li>
            <li>good soap to buy.  </li>
            <li>This is a good, old-fashioned cleansing soap, which reminds me of one that my grandma used to use.</li>
            <li>She loved it and so did I.  </li>
            <li>The soap smells really good, and it lathers well.</li>
            <li>I LOVED it.</li>
            <li>People love it!  </li>
            <li>So many uses for these bars!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also happy to support a fine company.</li>
            <li>I use it to make my own laundry soap (although the scent doesn&#x27;t stick) and as a body-bar in the shower.  </li>
            <li>This got four stars and not five because I felt the fragrance of the rose could have been a bit stronger to experience the soothing aroma therapy of the scent while bathing.  </li>
            <li>I use the bars for making my own laundry detergent.</li>
            <li>My daughter likes the rose scent</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s rose all the way.</li>
            <li>Bonner company upgrade their product, I would suggest, to make the rose soap smell like roses.</li>
            <li>We love their products and all that they support, fair trade, organics, families.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice rose hint to the clothes.</li>
            <li>I read comments that the rose soap is very strong scented.</li>
            <li>Smells great, gets me clean, and lasts a lot longer and is more cost effective than shower gel.</li>
            <li>Trying this Hemp Rose for the first time, I find it too has its own wonderful and unique smell.</li>
            <li>We love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this soap and feeling confident that I&#x27;m getting a good and healthy soap.</li>
            <li>love the Hemp Rose smell and made both liquid and powder landry detergent by adding washing powder and borax.  </li>
            <li>Rose is one of my favorite scents of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Soaps.</li>
            <li>These are really good soaps, and came quick in mail.</li>
            <li>This is very real thing, effective!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so silky and the bars are huge!  </li>
            <li>and I really enjoy anything rose scented.</li>
            <li>While it is better for your skin than the synthetic detergent bars so often labeled as &#x27;soap&#x27; in stores, it&#x27;s a lot more drying to the skin than it should be.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this soap.  </li>
            <li>ive bought the liquid dr.bonners soap and it does the job, but the bar soap is a much better.</li>
            <li>Non-drying, long-lasting, lovely.  </li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;re trying to avoid chemicals and add more organic products to your life, Dr Bronner fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my grand daughter can use it with no problems.</li>
            <li>But I do like this soap better than the stuff I buy off the shelf at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap...</li>
            <li>Love the smell as well.</li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner soaps are a lot better than store bought soaps that have a lot of added chemicals you don&#x27;t need on your skin.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I love this scent as well as the peppermint.  </li>
            <li>While searching Amazon, I discovered Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps.</li>
            <li>I love this soap....</li>
            <li>Lovely scent.</li>
            <li>B001ET77PM Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, All-One Hemp Citrus Orange, 5-Ounce Bars (Pack of 6)]]</li>
            <li>B000168CIK Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps:</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>I love the scent,</li>
            <li>It moisturizes well, better than Ivory, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it for your hair...</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love Dr Bronner&#x27;s soaps.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this soap, smells great and clean really well!</li>
            <li>They are gentle and so nice to use!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with the liquid soaps (even does a nice job on the laundry though a little pricey for that) and Sal Suds does a bang up job too for some of the tougher cleaning jobs.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Hemp Rose!</li>
            <li>Non-drying and smells nice, no artificial smells.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and you get an overall pleasant experience from using this type of soap.  </li>
            <li>A great smelling and feeling soap, just about the only affordable organic, vegan soap around.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t permeate the whole bathroom with its \\&quot;amazing smell\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This soap is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>The lather is smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li>So It&#x27;s seems to be good for folks who have allergies and sensitive skin.     </li>
            <li>Good stuff, clean and natural feeling.</li>
            <li>Each of the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s brand name is a rich, well-lathering, long-lasting bar of soap.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>But it still gets a body clean.</li>
            <li>One thing for certain is that this soap leaves you with a refreshing feeling after each shower.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have my bathroom smell of roses and give me soft clean skin too.</li>
            <li>This soap is OK, but can&#x27;t hold a candle to real handmade cold-process soap.  </li>
            <li>Dr. Bronners soap is consistent excellence and we are loving the new choices in scents and size.</li>
            <li>I was impressed first by the ingredients and then by the positive reviews and thought to try a few varieties.</li>
            <li>This soap smells good, rinses off well, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.</li>
            <li>They thought that they tasted pretty pepperminty!  </li>
            <li>I personally prefer the bar to the liquid, but the liquid is nice also.</li>
            <li>My favorite so far is the Citrus Orange.</li>
            <li>It has a very subtle-rose scent that smells very fresh.</li>
            <li>Clean without drying and I like using pure soap with no detergents.</li>
            <li>Please, true castile soap is fabulous for sensitive skin; this isn&#x27;t castile.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li>I really think you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance and will use the bars as room fresheners, but I had to go back to the Peppermint Oil fragrance to get my sexy back.</li>
            <li>My hand are easily dried out, and I really love this soap being gentle and refreshing.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of Dr Bronner&#x27;s anything.</li>
            <li>Better deal than buying locally as well.</li>
            <li>It was actually pretty funny</li>
            <li>Aside from the absence of animal products, this soap leaves my skin feeling better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is amazing, but the texture your skin is left with is far from the glassy look that the Peppermint oil fragrance leaves.  </li>
            <li>it lathers so well and it leaves your skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>so I buy a large supply when I order.  </li>
            <li>This was a smart buy.</li>
            <li>I have used the liquid Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Pure Castile Soaps for years.  </li>
            <li>Pure Castile Bar Soap, Almond 5 oz]] that I also tried.</li>
            <li>I grate this soap, put it in a processor to make it as fine as possible, and mix this with two parts of each borax and washing soda.</li>
            <li>As a daily bath soap I like how it cleans and as important, it&#x27;s organically certified.  </li>
            <li>, it dissolves fast if you do that.</li>
            <li>It cleans the body really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;won&#x27;t buy again or really recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>True castile soap is made with nothing more than the liquid (usually water or goat&#x27;s milk) olive oil, and sodium hydroxide.  </li>
            <li>Your skin really feels clean and without any residue or the sense that a layer of something was left on it as a result of washing with the soap.</li>
            <li>Never leaves my skin itchy irritated, definitely better than your average soap bar</li>
            <li>I use about a fourth a cup for a full load</li>
            <li>It only takes a little of it to build a good lather and you can tell it is cleaning your skin.  </li>
            <li>There is no comparison to main stream bar soaps eg safeguard etc.  </li>
            <li>I do highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend all varieties of this soap.</li>
            <li>(One bar comes to roughly a cup of finely processed soap, so I mix this with two cups of borax and two cups of washing soda &#x3D;</li>
            <li>With the liquid soap u would be very very ashy, the bar soap does the same but not as much.</li>
            <li>I have really preferred the smell of the Citrus Orange so far.</li>
            <li>this soap loses the rose scent almost immediately after use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also have had lots of trouble with acne for many years and have tried EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li>I have very very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>With so many additives and toxins in our products and our environment, I am very careful about what I put in my body and use for personal hygiene.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought this soap, it was very fragrant and pink.</li>
            <li>The scent of rose is so weak.</li>
            <li>last time I ordered Tom&#x27;s of Maine, I was referred to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Organic Bar Soaps Pure Castile Soaps by Amazon.</li>
            <li>(If you purchase the large, clear bottle, don&#x27;t let your child&#x27;s friend mistake it for canola oil when he uses it to make batter for deep frying Oreos.)  </li>
            <li>Sometimes, living in the sticks, it&#x27;s hard to find Dr Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps.</li>
            <li>I initially found this soap at Whole Foods here in Houston and got some for me and my Mom to try.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>With Dr. Bonner&#x27;s, there is no need to buy softener and its natural.</li>
            <li>It dried out my skin even more that regular soap.</li>
            <li>Because Dr. Bronner&#x27;s uses a high percentage of other cheaper oils such as coconut and palm, with citric acid, it is far more drying and not nearly as moisturizing as it should be.  </li>
            <li>It has the most subtle scent ever</li>
            <li>its a very subtle rose - not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin, and prior to this we were using Ivory.</li>
            <li>Husband has sensitive skin and he also used this for daily use.</li>
            <li>Plus its better than putting unhealthy things on your skin every day.</li>
            <li>I also make my own natural laundry detergent (which cleans much better for me than cheaper store bought brands) which I had previously used fels-naptha or Ivory for the soap base.  </li>
            <li>It left my skin soft and not dry.</li>
            <li>Believe it or not, I have received more compliments due the smell of this soap than I have received from some of the relatively-expensive perfumes that I have worn in the past.</li>
            <li>I really think that employees from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s company have written the other 5 star reviews because this soap is not all that it&#x27;s hyped up to be.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out your skin</li>
            <li>The soap lathers well and a little goes a long way unlike regular bar soaps that you must keep recharging your wash cloth because it feels like its not cutting the grime unless you recharge.  </li>

            <li> Good stuff, clean and natural feeling.</li>
            <li> Each of the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s brand name is a rich, well-lathering, long-lasting bar of soap.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> But it still gets a body clean.</li>
            <li> One thing for certain is that this soap leaves you with a refreshing feeling after each shower.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to have my bathroom smell of roses and give me soft clean skin too.</li>
            <li> This soap is OK, but can&#x27;t hold a candle to real handmade cold-process soap.  </li>
            <li> Dr. Bronners soap is consistent excellence and we are loving the new choices in scents and size.</li>
            <li> I was impressed first by the ingredients and then by the positive reviews and thought to try a few varieties.</li>
            <li> This soap smells good, rinses off well, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.</li>
            <li> They thought that they tasted pretty pepperminty!  </li>
            <li> I personally prefer the bar to the liquid, but the liquid is nice also.</li>
            <li> My favorite so far is the Citrus Orange.</li>
            <li> It has a very subtle-rose scent that smells very fresh.</li>
            <li> Clean without drying and I like using pure soap with no detergents.</li>
            <li> Please, true castile soap is fabulous for sensitive skin; this isn&#x27;t castile.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice and lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> I really think you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance and will use the bars as room fresheners, but I had to go back to the Peppermint Oil fragrance to get my sexy back.</li>
            <li> My hand are easily dried out, and I really love this soap being gentle and refreshing.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of Dr Bronner&#x27;s anything.</li>
            <li> Better deal than buying locally as well.</li>
            <li> It was actually pretty funny</li>
            <li> Aside from the absence of animal products, this soap leaves my skin feeling better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is amazing, but the texture your skin is left with is far from the glassy look that the Peppermint oil fragrance leaves.  </li>
            <li> it lathers so well and it leaves your skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> so I buy a large supply when I order.  </li>
            <li> This was a smart buy.</li>
            <li> I have used the liquid Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Pure Castile Soaps for years.  </li>
            <li> Pure Castile Bar Soap, Almond 5 oz]] that I also tried.</li>
            <li> I grate this soap, put it in a processor to make it as fine as possible, and mix this with two parts of each borax and washing soda.</li>
            <li> As a daily bath soap I like how it cleans and as important, it&#x27;s organically certified.  </li>
            <li> , it dissolves fast if you do that.</li>
            <li> It cleans the body really well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;won&#x27;t buy again or really recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> True castile soap is made with nothing more than the liquid (usually water or goat&#x27;s milk) olive oil, and sodium hydroxide.  </li>
            <li> Your skin really feels clean and without any residue or the sense that a layer of something was left on it as a result of washing with the soap.</li>
            <li> Never leaves my skin itchy irritated, definitely better than your average soap bar</li>
            <li> I use about a fourth a cup for a full load</li>
            <li> It only takes a little of it to build a good lather and you can tell it is cleaning your skin.  </li>
            <li> There is no comparison to main stream bar soaps eg safeguard etc.  </li>
            <li> I do highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend all varieties of this soap.</li>
            <li> (One bar comes to roughly a cup of finely processed soap, so I mix this with two cups of borax and two cups of washing soda &#x3D;</li>
            <li> With the liquid soap u would be very very ashy, the bar soap does the same but not as much.</li>
            <li> I have really preferred the smell of the Citrus Orange so far.</li>
            <li> this soap loses the rose scent almost immediately after use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have had lots of trouble with acne for many years and have tried EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> I have very very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> With so many additives and toxins in our products and our environment, I am very careful about what I put in my body and use for personal hygiene.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this soap, it was very fragrant and pink.</li>
            <li> The scent of rose is so weak.</li>
            <li> last time I ordered Tom&#x27;s of Maine, I was referred to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Organic Bar Soaps Pure Castile Soaps by Amazon.</li>
            <li> (If you purchase the large, clear bottle, don&#x27;t let your child&#x27;s friend mistake it for canola oil when he uses it to make batter for deep frying Oreos.)  </li>
            <li> Sometimes, living in the sticks, it&#x27;s hard to find Dr Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps.</li>
            <li> I initially found this soap at Whole Foods here in Houston and got some for me and my Mom to try.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> With Dr. Bonner&#x27;s, there is no need to buy softener and its natural.</li>
            <li> It dried out my skin even more that regular soap.</li>
            <li> Because Dr. Bronner&#x27;s uses a high percentage of other cheaper oils such as coconut and palm, with citric acid, it is far more drying and not nearly as moisturizing as it should be.  </li>
            <li> It has the most subtle scent ever</li>
            <li> its a very subtle rose - not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> She has very sensitive skin, and prior to this we were using Ivory.</li>
            <li> Husband has sensitive skin and he also used this for daily use.</li>
            <li> Plus its better than putting unhealthy things on your skin every day.</li>
            <li> I also make my own natural laundry detergent (which cleans much better for me than cheaper store bought brands) which I had previously used fels-naptha or Ivory for the soap base.  </li>
            <li> It left my skin soft and not dry.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I have received more compliments due the smell of this soap than I have received from some of the relatively-expensive perfumes that I have worn in the past.</li>
            <li> I really think that employees from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s company have written the other 5 star reviews because this soap is not all that it&#x27;s hyped up to be.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out your skin</li>
            <li> The soap lathers well and a little goes a long way unlike regular bar soaps that you must keep recharging your wash cloth because it feels like its not cutting the grime unless you recharge.  </li>
            <li> I definitely had to use softener with either of those, making the detergent NOT natural.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this soap based on the other reviews.</li>
            <li> The lavender on the other hand definitely fulfills the aroma therapy aspect.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other soaps again.</li>
            <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> Maybe not quite as dry as it was.</li>
            <li> Put it in a dry soap dish after use.     </li>
            <li> I used to have to put lotion on my hands every time I washed them, &amp; even in between washings (VERY dry skin).</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> Started buying Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap a few years ago and recently switched to the bar soap.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re using this product during the winter pay attention to see if you&#x27;re less itchy due to dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I love Dr Bronner&#x27;s soaps but hate purchasing single bars in store.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this soap unless you try one and like it because now I am stuck with 5 other soaps yet to be used.</li>
            <li> And it reminded me that I need to review this item, as well as a couple of other things I&#x27;ve neglected to review yet.    </li>
            <li> The soap works just like any other soap.</li>
            <li> it made it a little too dry.</li>
            <li> But it leaves your body a little dry, so after washing apply 2 drops of coconut oil on your skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I have that slight greasy coating I get from using another soap brand.</li>
            <li> Before this I had been using Ivory, which I like, though it is a little drying.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t seem to be as harsh.</li>
            <li> The scents are not overwhelming for this purpose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find anything else to say about soap.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with these other oils in soap, but claiming this to be a castile bar is untruthful.</li>
            <li> probably not a good soap for children under 5 either.v</li>
            <li> Not any dramatic improvement, just an improvement.    </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and hate the feel from over the counter soaps.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the Dr. Bronner soap products.  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find this soap At stores</li>
            <li> Or got sick.  </li>
            <li> so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this soap.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A great smelling and feeling soap, just about the only affordable organic, vegan soap around.</li>
            <li> Roses! It is very difficult to find this soap At stores and I really enjoy anything rose scented.</li>
            <li> This soap is OK, but can&#x27;t hold a candle to real handmade cold-process soap.  While it is better for your skin than the synthetic detergent bars so often labeled as &#x27;soap&#x27; in stores, it&#x27;s a lot more drying to the skin than it should be.  And it&#x27;s not castile soap.  True castile soap is made with nothing more than the liquid (usually water or goat&#x27;s milk) olive oil, and sodium hydroxide.  Because Dr. Bronner&#x27;s uses a high percentage of other cheaper oils such as coconut and palm, with citric acid, it is far more drying and not nearly as moisturizing as it should be.  Please, true castile soap is fabulous for sensitive skin; this isn&#x27;t castile.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with these other oils in soap, but claiming this to be a castile bar is untruthful.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this soap.  I use it to make my own laundry soap (although the scent doesn&#x27;t stick) and as a body-bar in the shower.  It&#x27;s so silky and the bars are huge!  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> it a good soap for the price. ive bought the liquid dr.bonners soap and it does the job, but the bar soap is a much better. With the liquid soap u would be very very ashy, the bar soap does the same but not as much. good soap to buy.  tip...do not get it in your eyes u will regret it. probably not a good soap for children under 5 either.v</li>
            <li> I love this soap, smells great and clean really well!</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this soap, it was very fragrant and pink. This order, not so!!  It has no scent and is white. I got this order for my birthday...so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Non-drying, long-lasting, lovely.  I have been using this soap for several years.  Give it a try.  I think you will like it.</li>
            <li> This is very real thing, effective!</li>
            <li> I really think that employees from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s company have written the other 5 star reviews because this soap is not all that it&#x27;s hyped up to be. I actually bought this soap based on the other reviews. It has the most subtle scent ever and it doesn&#x27;t permeate the whole bathroom with its \\&quot;amazing smell\\&quot;. It dried out my skin even more that regular soap. I would never buy this soap ever again. I was so disappointed with this soap. Please don&#x27;t buy this soap unless you try one and like it because now I am stuck with 5 other soaps yet to be used. I might as well throw it all away.</li>
            <li> This is a good, old-fashioned cleansing soap, which reminds me of one that my grandma used to use. It has a very subtle-rose scent that smells very fresh. It leaves your skin feeling clean. Believe it or not, I have received more compliments due the smell of this soap than I have received from some of the relatively-expensive perfumes that I have worn in the past.</li>
            <li> This soap is fabulous.  The lather is smooth and creamy.  You really can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the Dr. Bronner soap products.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with the liquid soaps (even does a nice job on the laundry though a little pricey for that) and Sal Suds does a bang up job too for some of the tougher cleaning jobs.  And if you&#x27;re trying to avoid chemicals and add more organic products to your life, Dr Bronner fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I understand it, a lot of mainstream brand soap manufacturers remove the glycerol and sell it.  Glycerol is a byproduct of soap making.  Guess what?  The glycerol is what helps keep your skin from drying out.  So if you&#x27;re using this product during the winter pay attention to see if you&#x27;re less itchy due to dry skin.  I personally noticed quite a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also use only essential oils to scent the soaps instead of chemical fragrances (and some of those fragrance ingredients can be truly nasty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and give it a try.  I really think you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> I initially found this soap at Whole Foods here in Houston and got some for me and my Mom to try.  She loved it and so did I.  It does not dry out your skin and it cleans thoroughly.  It only takes a little of it to build a good lather and you can tell it is cleaning your skin.  The smell is nice and you get an overall pleasant experience from using this type of soap.  I don&#x27;t feel like I have that slight greasy coating I get from using another soap brand.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is amazing, but the texture your skin is left with is far from the glassy look that the Peppermint oil fragrance leaves.  I felt the need to add a skin finisher like mineral oil to add that luster I am used to.  I love the fragrance and will use the bars as room fresheners, but I had to go back to the Peppermint Oil fragrance to get my sexy back.</li>
            <li> As a daily bath soap I like how it cleans and as important, it&#x27;s organically certified.  There is no comparison to main stream bar soaps eg safeguard etc.  Been using Bronner&#x27;s for a couple of months now and won&#x27;t go back.  The soap lathers well and a little goes a long way unlike regular bar soaps that you must keep recharging your wash cloth because it feels like its not cutting the grime unless you recharge.  This got four stars and not five because I felt the fragrance of the rose could have been a bit stronger to experience the soothing aroma therapy of the scent while bathing.  The lavender on the other hand definitely fulfills the aroma therapy aspect.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap and feeling confident that I&#x27;m getting a good and healthy soap.</li>
            <li> My hand are easily dried out, and I really love this soap being gentle and refreshing. We also use it on our face, and body. I will never go back to any other soaps again.</li>
            <li> I love Dr Bronner&#x27;s soaps but hate purchasing single bars in store. I use the bars for making my own laundry detergent. The scents are not overwhelming for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap back in November of 2008, and I&#x27;ve still got a couple of bars left. I opened my pantry yesterday and it smells so good in there from the soap, LOL. And it reminded me that I need to review this item, as well as a couple of other things I&#x27;ve neglected to review yet.    This was my first purchase of Dr Bronner&#x27;s anything. This soap doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out. But it still gets a body clean. My skin did seem somewhat softer after using the soap for a couple of weeks. Maybe not quite as dry as it was. Not any dramatic improvement, just an improvement.    I have no complaints to make.    The soap smells really good, and it lathers well. My daughter likes the rose scent, that&#x27;s why I got it.    I&#x27;d like to try out the tea tree oil soap next.    Don&#x27;t leave it sitting in water though, it dissolves fast if you do that. Put it in a dry soap dish after use.     Oh. and my grand daughter can use it with no problems. She has very sensitive skin, and prior to this we were using Ivory. So It&#x27;s seems to be good for folks who have allergies and sensitive skin.     It&#x27;s hard to find anything else to say about soap. Heh.    But I do like this soap better than the stuff I buy off the shelf at the grocery store. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t seem to be as harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years. I have extremely sensitive skin and this does not irritate me at all. I personally prefer the bar to the liquid, but the liquid is nice also. I do like the eucalyptus when I have a stuffy nose; it&#x27;s great for opening up the sinuses. Otherwise it&#x27;s rose all the way. I do highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> I used this for making homemade laundry detergent.  Love the scent.  Great product!  Husband has sensitive skin and he also used this for daily use.</li>
            <li> This is my favourite bar of soap. The scent perks me up every time I use it so I buy a large supply when I order.  I will order again before I run out.</li>
            <li> I love this soap...it lathers so well and it leaves your skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Smells great, gets me clean, and lasts a lot longer and is more cost effective than shower gel.</li>
            <li> Awesome shipping time. Awesome product. This was a smart buy. I only needed 2 bars for my laundry soap which left me a couple bars for me and my daughter&#x27;s to use. Love the smell as well.</li>
            <li> This soap smells good, rinses off well, doesn&#x27;t dry the skin. That&#x27;s all one can ask of any soap.  I prefer castile soaps to tallow, which comes from boiling animal carcasses.  Dr. Bronner&#x27;s line of soaps are all vegetable oil based.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner soaps are a lot better than store bought soaps that have a lot of added chemicals you don&#x27;t need on your skin.&lt;br /&gt; I am allergic to any chemical fragrances and these soaps never bother me.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and lasts me a long time. Plus its better than putting unhealthy things on your skin every day. A healthier alternative for soap.</li>
            <li> Smells great and no chemicals.  I love this scent as well as the peppermint.  Better deal than buying locally as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get away from soap with Triclosan, but sometimes the online companies don&#x27;t list the ingredients. One website actually said, &amp;#34;For ingredients, please refer to your product container&amp;#34;. So, I had to buy it to read the ingredients? No thanks. While searching Amazon, I discovered Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps. I bought a bottle of the liquid, peppermint, to give it a try. I LOVED it. The bottle says not to use a pump dispenser, so I bought the bars to use at the sink. My hands haven&#x27;t been happier. I used to have to put lotion on my hands every time I washed them, &amp; even in between washings (VERY dry skin). Since using the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s bar soap, I have to use lotion only once a day. I will NEVER buy anything else.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, clean and natural feeling. Never leaves my skin itchy irritated, definitely better than your average soap bar</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!!!!  Non-drying and smells nice, no artificial smells.</li>
            <li> I love this soap....but no not get it in ur eyes!!!!!BURNS!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great for making vegan detergent with borax and washing soda!</li>
            <li> I have used the liquid Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Pure Castile Soaps for years.  (If you purchase the large, clear bottle, don&#x27;t let your child&#x27;s friend mistake it for canola oil when he uses it to make batter for deep frying Oreos.)  They thought that they tasted pretty pepperminty!  Nobody died!  Or got sick.  It was actually pretty funny and I still tease him about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Hemp Rose smell and made both liquid and powder landry detergent by adding washing powder and borax.  You can find the recipe online.  I have put some of them in mason jars and given them as gifts.  People love it!  Plus, it&#x27;s cheaper, biodegradable and  fewer toxins from what I understand.  You can use any scent for making the detergent.  I highly recommend the Hemp Rose!</li>
            <li> Lovely scent. Long-lasting bars</li>
            <li> Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap is a very good soap. I read comments that the rose soap is very strong scented. I didn&#x27;t smell anything. The scent of rose is so weak. It cleans the body really well. It left my skin soft and not dry. If The Dr.Bonner company upgrade their product, I would suggest, to make the rose soap smell like roses. It would be nice to have my bathroom smell of roses and give me soft clean skin too.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Tom&#x27;s of Maine products for years now. With so many additives and toxins in our products and our environment, I am very careful about what I put in my body and use for personal hygiene. The skin absorbs things we use just as our mouth and lungs do. Therefore, for some time now I have been using [[ASIN:B003EMKNPS Tom&#x27;s of Maine Moisturizing Bar Daily, 4-Ounces Bars (Pack of 6)]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time I ordered Tom&#x27;s of Maine, I was referred to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Organic Bar Soaps Pure Castile Soaps by Amazon. I was impressed first by the ingredients and then by the positive reviews and thought to try a few varieties. My favorite so far is the Citrus Orange. I have bought the [[ASIN:B001ET77PM Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, All-One Hemp Citrus Orange, 5-Ounce Bars (Pack of 6)]] several times. I have really preferred the smell of the Citrus Orange so far. So, I chosen to use this over the [[ASIN:B000177FXW Dr. Bronners Tea Tree Pure-Castile Bar Soap 5oz]] and the [[ASIN:B000168CIK Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps: Pure Castile Bar Soap, Almond 5 oz]] that I also tried. Trying this Hemp Rose for the first time, I find it too has its own wonderful and unique smell. Time &amp; use will tell. Each of the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s brand name is a rich, well-lathering, long-lasting bar of soap. One thing for certain is that this soap leaves you with a refreshing feeling after each shower. Your skin really feels clean and without any residue or the sense that a layer of something was left on it as a result of washing with the soap.</li>
            <li> Just what the wife asked for. Sometimes, living in the sticks, it&#x27;s hard to find Dr Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps. Amazon comes through again.</li>
            <li> Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service</li>
            <li> We love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps! They are gentle and so nice to use!</li>
            <li> Great soap that smells awesome! Rose is one of my favorite scents of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Soaps.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. Smells wonderful and cleans well.</li>
            <li> this soap loses the rose scent almost immediately after use.&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t buy again or really recommend to anyone. thank you</li>
            <li> So many uses for these bars!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Dr. Bronners soap is consistent excellence and we are loving the new choices in scents and size.</li>
            <li> I have very very sensitive skin. Before this I had been using Ivory, which I like, though it is a little drying.  I love the scent, its a very subtle rose - not overpowering. I also have had lots of trouble with acne for many years and have tried EVERYTHING. This bar is miraculous and I will be buying it for life. It moisturizes well, better than Ivory, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it for your hair...it made it a little too dry. I also make my own natural laundry detergent (which cleans much better for me than cheaper store bought brands) which I had previously used fels-naptha or Ivory for the soap base.  I definitely had to use softener with either of those, making the detergent NOT natural. With Dr. Bonner&#x27;s, there is no need to buy softener and its natural. I grate this soap, put it in a processor to make it as fine as possible, and mix this with two parts of each borax and washing soda. (One bar comes to roughly a cup of finely processed soap, so I mix this with two cups of borax and two cups of washing soda &#x3D; five cups of detergent) I use about a fourth a cup for a full load</li>
            <li> This is my second order for this soap.  I love it</li>
            <li> Started buying Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap a few years ago and recently switched to the bar soap. Aside from the absence of animal products, this soap leaves my skin feeling better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommend all varieties of this soap.</li>
            <li> Great product. Dr. Bronners products are family owned and operated. We love their products and all that they support, fair trade, organics, families.</li>
            <li> These bars are always consistantly made, and Amazon has the best deal in time when buying in bulk.  The soap works just like any other soap.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and hate the feel from over the counter soaps. This soap is just like I remember the soap at my grandmother&#x27;s house. The scent is wonderful. I put the unopened bars in my drawers to scent my clothing.</li>
            <li> Love Dr Bronner&#x27;s soaps. Clean without drying and I like using pure soap with no detergents. I&#x27;m also happy to support a fine company.</li>
            <li> I make my clothes soap using this product! I love it. Leaves a nice rose hint to the clothes.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, no chemicals at all. I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s as soap and bath gel. But it leaves your body a little dry, so after washing apply 2 drops of coconut oil on your skin.</li>
            <li> These are really good soaps, and came quick in mail.</li>
