            <li>It does leave your hair kind of sticky.</li>
            <li>Great product and very fast shipping...</li>
            <li>This Redken product is the best of its kind; have tried American Crew&#x27;s stuff and a german product, but the best results are from Redken.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have used it ever since (4 yr&#x27;s).Not in business any more.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I am not that sure about matte finish.</li>
            <li>, this doesn&#x27;t pull hair out of your head like some of the heavier products, and it works for my style much better.  </li>
            <li>My hair is longer - maybe this is more for those with shorter hair.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li>These are my two favorite hair products.</li>
            <li>It is really great for styling his hair, and then it stays in place for hours, if not all day, depending on how busy he is.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too greasy and washes off easily with water.  </li>
            <li>The wax washes out every easily from hair and from my hands after I put it on.  </li>
            <li>Hands down the best</li>
            <li>the alcohol in the spray was making my hair extremely fine.  </li>
            <li>my hair styles much more quickly</li>
            <li>lightly styling w/fingers thru hair,then leave alone,it lasts all day/night.</li>
            <li>I stock up on Maneuver and dread the day it isn&#x27;t available anymore.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS A GREAT HAIR PRODUCT FOR MEN OR WOMEN WITH SHORT HAIR.</li>
            <li>Important for work</li>
            <li>Light and not sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>and it is available for import.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do love American Crew as it washes out easily, gives good hold, has a great smell, but leaves my hair looking wet.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery:)</li>
            <li>I decided I wanted to have a good hold pomade that allowed my hair to look dry (as in, no product).  </li>
            <li>Washes out smoothly and doesn&#x27;t require too much scrubbing.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser&#x27;s been using it every time he styles my hair post cut, and it has just the right amount of hold for the style I wear.  </li>
            <li>The product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through all American Crew and Axe products, and I like this one the most.</li>
            <li>My husband used this the first time at the shop where he got his hair cut, and has been buying it ever since.  </li>
            <li>Great smell, matte finish, feels very thin in your hand, but once you work it in, it adds a great amount of body and texture, plus it does&#x27;t feel so heavy.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the *fragrance* to be very strong and disagreeable.</li>
            <li>I have used American crew fiber, compared to ac its easy to apply and holds my hair.</li>
            <li>Love how it works, holds all day long in high humidity.</li>
            <li>The product also allows for hair to be reworked later in the day which is another huge advantage over gel or the glue that I was using before.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot, it holds really well, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair shiny</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe your stylists when they say &amp;#34;It&#x27;s only available in a salon&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for eyebrows everywhere, oh, and hair also!</li>
            <li>If you need to re-style during the day, he can just use his fingers, and it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product, and the seller sent it really fast, and as described.  </li>
            <li>not too greasy and if you are only looking for a light hold</li>
            <li>There were no instructions which may have been the reason for using to much.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product if you don&#x27;t use to much.</li>
            <li>The end result is that my hair holds very well, appears to be dry and not slick, the smell is fantastic!, and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot.</li>
            <li>My hair has a fine texture but when I add a dime size dab of maneuver after I blow dry, it gives my hair body that it wouldn&#x27;t have on</li>
            <li>Finally threw out some of the old, heavier products I used to use that left your hair looking nice but a bit gummy, and went for a 2 pk of this.  </li>
            <li>Both were only 1/3 full of wax (product).  </li>
            <li>Depending on the length of my hair, I had previously used gel or more of a glue to reliably hold my hair in place.</li>
            <li>this particular one.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I converted over to this product after Redken discontinued their High Rise Wax.</li>
            <li>Both of them are extremely easy to wash off unlike other hair products which sticks in your hair even after shampooing.</li>
            <li>I may have used to much of the product which left my hair feeling very waxy.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t get too stiff.</li>
            <li>not stiff or goey, but keeps your hair in place with body</li>
            <li>;, that&#x27;s complete BS.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Redken Maneuver for nearly 6 years.</li>
            <li>Feels natural.</li>
            <li>In the heat and humidity of the south this product keeps my hair from getting wild strands/etc.  </li>
            <li>To top it off, I only need a small amount to manage my hairstyle.</li>
            <li>I have little spikes of hair that like to stand straight up right where I part my hair, and was looking for something to make them lie flat.</li>
            <li>easy to use, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>No other product out there like it.</li>
            <li>As far as hold, I compared it with several products from the drug store which were under $5</li>
            <li>The savings is Okay but not great with the multipack.  </li>
            <li>; you get with other products or add to your dry hair to mold with mild hold.  </li>
            <li>It always holds after a long day, and keeps a natural non-greasy look.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and in it&#x27;s natural state, I am what you would call a &amp;#34;mop top&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The product comfortably held my hair in place without the wet appearance that commonly occurs with gel.</li>

            <li> I have very long hair and in it&#x27;s natural state, I am what you would call a &amp;#34;mop top&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The product comfortably held my hair in place without the wet appearance that commonly occurs with gel.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for everyday use, especially if you are wanting hold but not a \\&quot;slick\\&quot; look.  </li>
            <li> Just a small amount holds hair in place yet leaves it soft and natural looking, without greasiness.</li>
            <li> Redken maneuver is good expensive wax that holds, gives a little wet look, but not pliable like fibre.</li>
            <li> IT ALSO LAST FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> I got used to this thing I long time ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products similar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this there for $10 per single, if you can get it cheaper than that go for it.</li>
            <li> Stats:  38 year old white male, shorter thick hair, lives in Tennessee in a lot of heat and humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this over my usual pomade, American Crew.  </li>
            <li> &quot; look (what this product gives), then use this product for the matte and perhaps American Crew regular pomade for the slick.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it lasts a long time as you only need a little dab!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really an expert on hair or anything, but it keeps my hair from clumping together and sticking out as it dries out.</li>
            <li> However, that is to your advantage if your hair gets messed up by the wind or some woman, you can just wet your hands a bit and restyle.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> The smell is not overbearing like some other brands.</li>
            <li> If you want to alternate between a slick look and a \\&quot;matte\\</li>
            <li> I am allergic to colognes and perfumes, but even if I weren&#x27;t I would find this product problematic because it would overpower any other fragrance I would choose to wear.</li>
            <li> little dab will keep all those loose ends in place,,I</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair slicked back without that hard feel to the hair.</li>
            <li> It gives a slight shine without being over-the-edge Jersey Shore look.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe anyone, much less men, would want to wear something so perfumy.</li>
            <li> For those who like a little &#x27;product&#x27; to keep the frizz down - without looking like</li>
            <li> Add to slightly wet hair to maintain that wet hair look without the serious &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Directions: on damp hair (not wet),put a little on finger tips,then spread thru hair</li>
            <li> It gives you a little bit of time before it solidifies and finishes with a matte wettish look.</li>
            <li> I may have been a little harsh about the product.</li>
            <li> This means the product lasts me a few weeks with ease.</li>
            <li> A little too stiff for me, though.  </li>
            <li> just enough control without being stiff and fake looking.</li>
            <li> even use it on my \\&quot;crazy old man\\&quot; eyebrows</li>
            <li> I like to keep a little inventory with this stuff cause running out is no good</li>

            <li> I love this stuff. You don&#x27;t need a lot, it holds really well, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair shiny so you don&#x27;t look like a greaseball, and it smells great (not overpowering though).  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Yea I&#x27;m a dude and this stuff rocks! I&#x27;m not really an expert on hair or anything, but it keeps my hair from clumping together and sticking out as it dries out. Good stuff, been told it smells nice too</li>
            <li> men ! trust me,this product I 1st used when working w/our own salon.I have used it ever since (4 yr&#x27;s).Not in business any more.Directions: on damp hair (not wet),put a little on finger tips,then spread thru hair lightly styling w/fingers thru hair,then leave alone,it lasts all day/night.No other product out there like it.</li>
            <li> I stock up on Maneuver and dread the day it isn&#x27;t available anymore.  The best &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; out there for your hair.  No greasy feel when applied.  Add to slightly wet hair to maintain that wet hair look without the serious &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; you get with other products or add to your dry hair to mold with mild hold.  Great smell as well.</li>
            <li> Lovely smell, great medium hold.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff and my wife loves the way it smells. It&#x27;s not too greasy and washes off easily with water.  The smell is not overbearing like some other brands.</li>
            <li> not stiff or goey, but keeps your hair in place with body</li>
            <li> Just a small amount holds hair in place yet leaves it soft and natural looking, without greasiness.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT HAIR PRODUCT FOR MEN OR WOMEN WITH SHORT HAIR. IT LETS ME SPIKE UP MY HAIR AND DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE IT LOOKING GREASY OR ROCK HARD. IT ALSO LAST FOR A LONG TIME. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> Excellent product ....fast delivery:)</li>
            <li> The same stuff I get at the salon but without the ridiculous mark up price! Don&#x27;t believe your stylists when they say &amp;#34;It&#x27;s only available in a salon&amp;#34;, that&#x27;s complete BS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Redken Maneuver for nearly 6 years. While it&#x27;s part of the Redken line for men, I&#x27;m a woman with relatively short hair. My hair has a fine texture but when I add a dime size dab of maneuver after I blow dry, it gives my hair body that it wouldn&#x27;t have on it&#x27;s own. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and in it&#x27;s natural state, I am what you would call a &amp;#34;mop top&amp;#34;. This is the only product that gets my hair under control and gets it to do what I want it to do. Important for work</li>
            <li> I have used American crew fiber, compared to ac its easy to apply and holds my hair. Smells gr8 but I am not that sure about matte finish. Redken maneuver is good expensive wax that holds, gives a little wet look, but not pliable like fibre.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this product. easy to use, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as described. It has a medium hold without being greasy. It gives a slight shine without being over-the-edge Jersey Shore look. Great product. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Great product all around. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair crusty. Feels natural. I will always use this product. Nothing beats it.</li>
            <li> Great product and very fast shipping...</li>
            <li> This stuff will glue your hair to your head, so if you have a bad hair day you won&#x27;t have to wear a helmet.</li>
            <li> Great product. Keeps my hair under control, makes it look thicker and lasts all day. Plus, it lasts a long time as you only need a little dab!</li>
            <li> excellent product,,a little dab will keep all those loose ends in place,,I even use it on my \\&quot;crazy old man\\&quot; eyebrows and it makes them behave. just enough control without being stiff and fake looking. Highly recommended for eyebrows everywhere, oh, and hair also!</li>
            <li> My go to hair wax. Keeps my hair slicked back without that hard feel to the hair. It does leave your hair kind of sticky. However, that is to your advantage if your hair gets messed up by the wind or some woman, you can just wet your hands a bit and restyle.</li>
            <li> I got used to this thing I long time ago. It&#x27;s really great for man hair, because it&#x27;s the ideal measure to have a disciplined hair.</li>
            <li> For those who like a little &#x27;product&#x27; to keep the frizz down - without looking like you have goop in your hair! Light and not sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser&#x27;s been using it every time he styles my hair post cut, and it has just the right amount of hold for the style I wear.  Finally threw out some of the old, heavier products I used to use that left your hair looking nice but a bit gummy, and went for a 2 pk of this.  Was a great decision...my hair styles much more quickly, this doesn&#x27;t pull hair out of your head like some of the heavier products, and it works for my style much better.  Great smell, matte finish, feels very thin in your hand, but once you work it in, it adds a great amount of body and texture, plus it does&#x27;t feel so heavy.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now.  Before this it was a traditional hairspray but the alcohol in the spray was making my hair extremely fine.  I was told to use this and it works great.  My hair stays put but doesn&#x27;t look like it has a bunch of stuff in it.  I like to keep a little inventory with this stuff cause running out is no good so I am happy to buy a couple at a time.  The savings is Okay but not great with the multipack.  Your best bet, if you have a Great Clips close by is to see when they put product on sale.  I&#x27;ve seen this there for $10 per single, if you can get it cheaper than that go for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through all American Crew and Axe products, and I like this one the most. It gives you a little bit of time before it solidifies and finishes with a matte wettish look.</li>
            <li> Depending on the length of my hair, I had previously used gel or more of a glue to reliably hold my hair in place. A friend (salon owner) used Redken&#x27;s Maneuver to style my hair after a recent cut. The product comfortably held my hair in place without the wet appearance that commonly occurs with gel. The product also allows for hair to be reworked later in the day which is another huge advantage over gel or the glue that I was using before. Good stuff!!</li>
            <li> My husband used this the first time at the shop where he got his hair cut, and has been buying it ever since.  It is really great for styling his hair, and then it stays in place for hours, if not all day, depending on how busy he is.  If you need to re-style during the day, he can just use his fingers, and it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product, and the seller sent it really fast, and as described.  Would buy from this seller anytime.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Good product with a great smell to it.  Holds my hair in place wiht a non-wet look.  A little too stiff for me, though.  Probably as a working wax should.  My hair is longer - maybe this is more for those with shorter hair.  Will continue to use, though, until it runs out.</li>
            <li> I swear by this product. Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t get too stiff. Holds all day</li>
            <li> Love how it works, holds all day long in high humidity. Washes out smoothly and doesn&#x27;t require too much scrubbing.</li>
            <li> This Redken product is the best of its kind; have tried American Crew&#x27;s stuff and a german product, but the best results are from Redken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a shame that they decided stop importing this product to Mexico City, its good to know that Amazon got it and it is available for import.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon: great packaging, great timing, great service as always.</li>
            <li> The best. I&#x27;ve tried other products similar. Hands down the best</li>
            <li> I converted over to this product after Redken discontinued their High Rise Wax. This is now my go-to hair product (and happier with it). It always holds after a long day, and keeps a natural non-greasy look. At the end of the day, it washes off with ease. To top it off, I only need a small amount to manage my hairstyle. This means the product lasts me a few weeks with ease.</li>
            <li> Good hair product.  Works well for my needs.</li>
            <li> purchased this for my husband.  not too greasy and if you are only looking for a light hold this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Stats:  38 year old white male, shorter thick hair, lives in Tennessee in a lot of heat and humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this over my usual pomade, American Crew.  I do love American Crew as it washes out easily, gives good hold, has a great smell, but leaves my hair looking wet.  I decided I wanted to have a good hold pomade that allowed my hair to look dry (as in, no product).  So, I gave this a try as the stylists in my salon use Redken products but not this particular one.  The end result is that my hair holds very well, appears to be dry and not slick, the smell is fantastic!, and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot. In the heat and humidity of the south this product keeps my hair from getting wild strands/etc.  Also, the wax is white and looks almost like lotion, but I have not had any flakes or clumps.  The wax washes out every easily from hair and from my hands after I put it on.  I highly recommend this product for everyday use, especially if you are wanting hold but not a \\&quot;slick\\&quot; look.  If you want to alternate between a slick look and a \\&quot;matte\\&quot; look (what this product gives), then use this product for the matte and perhaps American Crew regular pomade for the slick.  I will buy again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/23/2012 update:  I continue to use this product.  It is great.  And, I introduced my stylist to it.  He now uses it and recommends it to his male clients.</li>
            <li> I had written a review about Redken For Men.. I may have been a little harsh about the product. The service from this company was excellent, shipping and communication. I may have used to much of the product which left my hair feeling very waxy. There were no instructions which may have been the reason for using to much. I recommend this product if you don&#x27;t use to much. Sorry If I directed anyone in the wrong direction with my last review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott Sr.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these because of the great price.  Both were only 1/3 full of wax (product).  It doesn&#x27;t give you the same amount as in a store or salon.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this on amazon again.</li>
            <li> I have little spikes of hair that like to stand straight up right where I part my hair, and was looking for something to make them lie flat. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the *fragrance* to be very strong and disagreeable. I can&#x27;t believe anyone, much less men, would want to wear something so perfumy. I am allergic to colognes and perfumes, but even if I weren&#x27;t I would find this product problematic because it would overpower any other fragrance I would choose to wear. As far as hold, I compared it with several products from the drug store which were under $5 and it didn&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li> I love this wax! As the name says it allows you to &amp;#34;maneuver&amp;#34; and reapply a different style to the hair throughout the day. Yet it still holds your hair in place without the stiffness. I also bought the Redken Work Hard Molding Paste. Both of them are extremely easy to wash off unlike other hair products which sticks in your hair even after shampooing. These are my two favorite hair products. Will continue to buy these.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this stuff!</li>
