            <li>BEST GRABBER ON THE MARKET.</li>
            <li>My grabber buddy is perfect!</li>
            <li>Best of all reachers.</li>
            <li>These are the best grabbers I&#x27;ve had yet.  </li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Great for retrieving the paper off the front steps without having to bend over.  </li>
            <li>Great for picking up items and moving them</li>
            <li>Still a good quallity reacher.</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I must start my review with a mention of this outstanding company!</li>
            <li>This thing has a good length to it and the rubber grips on the claw holds your item securely.</li>
            <li>I love it work like a charm</li>
            <li>Still like the hand grip on these better.</li>
            <li>I love this grabber.</li>
            <li>STRONG, STURDY AND DURABLE.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this outstanding product!</li>
            <li>Best use:  picking up small branches in yard to deposit in bag.</li>
            <li>My new nifty handy dandy grabber buddy has allowed me to retire my step ladder.</li>
            <li>Super product.</li>
            <li>The grip is good and has a long reach (the reason I bought it)</li>
            <li>the grabber itself: wonderfully long, strong, easy to grip, handle adjusts easily to reach at any angle.</li>
            <li>But this company will serve you right.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>The first delivery came swiftly but maybe the delivery company mishandled the box.</li>
            <li>First time I used it, the handle loosened from the shaft.</li>
            <li>It is so handy to use and with its&#x27; extra long reach, I can live more independantly with this grabber/</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 31&amp;#34; like most others and I wanted something longer but this is way too long for anything</li>
            <li>This is certainly a work saver and a back/shoulder saver.  </li>
            <li>Again, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>They really care about the buyer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Please make an easy to use wall hanger so that I can hang them at opposite ends of my new house without walking so darn far...</li>
            <li>My older reach bar is going out.  </li>
            <li>I tried to straighten it, but it is was so well made and strong, not straight.</li>
            <li>Plenty long for reaching up high, would given higher rating if twisting handle were easier to unlock and turn, which is a cleaver idea.</li>
            <li>But, they sent me out the third one lightning fast.</li>
            <li>Very helpful for a short in stature person to reach needed items in tall cabinets, etc.</li>
            <li>The grip is easy on the hand; very much an improvement on all those pistol handled grabbers that had been so difficult to use.</li>
            <li>grip is stronger than any other reacher I&#x27;ve tried and it feels very sturdy.  </li>

            <li> Jaw width is less than advertised.  It wouldn&#x27;t pick up a package that it should have if the jaws were as wide as in listing.</li>
            <li> I love it work like a charm</li>
            <li> Grips well, but way too long.  Best use:  picking up small branches in yard to deposit in bag.</li>
            <li> I love it!  I bought it for picking up trash along our walking trail. The grip is good and has a long reach (the reason I bought it) I can see myself buying the shorter version to use around the house.</li>
            <li> BEST GRABBER ON THE MARKET. STRONG, STURDY AND DURABLE.</li>
            <li> Both of these arrived broken and unusable. I would not recommend these at all.</li>
            <li> It is way too long, when I grab something in my pantry.  I have to walk over to my kitchen table to release the item.  I guess it was mean&#x27;t for other reasons</li>
            <li> I live on a partially wooded lot, So I use this to pick up sticks while cutting grass so I don&#x27;t have to stop and get off the mower.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve down graded my review. I&#x27;ve as it turns out a little tortion on the jaws and they snap off. Still like the hand grip on these better. Wish they would make the jaws out of metal.</li>
            <li> Plenty long for reaching up high, would given higher rating if twisting handle were easier to unlock and turn, which is a cleaver idea.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT. WELL MADE</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m grabbin&#x27;, I&#x27;m using my Grabber Buddy.  You bet your ass.</li>
            <li> My grabber buddy is perfect! The kitchen cabinets in my home are oddly on the high side. My new nifty handy dandy grabber buddy has allowed me to retire my step ladder. This thing has a good length to it and the rubber grips on the claw holds your item securely. Shipping was super fast. A++ transaction!</li>
            <li> Super product. Best of all reachers.</li>
            <li> Plastic part on grabber broke with 2nd use.</li>
            <li> I must start my review with a mention of this outstanding company! The first delivery came swiftly but maybe the delivery company mishandled the box. The grabber was bent. I tried to straighten it, but it is was so well made and strong, not straight. I contacted the company. They instantly sent me a replacement (I sent pics). Again, fast delivery. First time I used it, the handle loosened from the shaft. Nothing to think of but contact the company again. I felt guilty bothering them. But, they sent me out the third one lightning fast. And this one is a keeper. They really care about the buyer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the grabber itself: wonderfully long, strong, easy to grip, handle adjusts easily to reach at any angle. With just a push of the button, the handle turns to adjust to your needs. The grip is easy on the hand; very much an improvement on all those pistol handled grabbers that had been so difficult to use. The gripper end is wide enough to grip small to large items. Rubberized lining and grip &#x27;teeth&#x27; picks up anything I want. It is so handy to use and with its&#x27; extra long reach, I can live more independantly with this grabber/reacher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not blame the company for the glitches and it probably wouldn&#x27;t happen to you. But this company will serve you right. I love this grabber. Thank you so much for this outstanding product!</li>
            <li> Great for retrieving the paper off the front steps without having to bend over.  Probably would be too long for someone in a sitting position or wheel chair.</li>
            <li> Actually this is a mistake.  My older reach bar is going out.  It&#x27;s 31&amp;#34; like most others and I wanted something longer but this is way too long for anything I need.&lt;br /&gt;The grip is stronger than any other reacher I&#x27;ve tried and it feels very sturdy.  Great for picking up items and moving them but it&#x27;s too long to retrieve the item with the other hand.&lt;br /&gt;Five stars.  Still a good quallity reacher.</li>
            <li> A well made product.  Very helpful for a short in stature person to reach needed items in tall cabinets, etc.</li>
            <li> was longer than I thought, will have to get a shorter one eventually.</li>
            <li> It is what it says it is!</li>
            <li> These are the best grabbers I&#x27;ve had yet.  I&#x27;ve had to use grabbers numerous times daily since suffering back and shoulder injuries awhile back.  This is certainly a work saver and a back/shoulder saver.  Please make an easy to use wall hanger so that I can hang them at opposite ends of my new house without walking so darn far...&lt;br /&gt;Thank You, HG</li>
