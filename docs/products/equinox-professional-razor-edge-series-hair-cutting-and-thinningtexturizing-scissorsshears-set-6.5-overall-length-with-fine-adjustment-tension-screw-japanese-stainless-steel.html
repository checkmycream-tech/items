            <li>I am really happy and excited about this scissors.</li>
            <li>They are high quality and perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>Scissors super sharp,work great for trimming hair.  </li>
            <li>The tension is very easy to change, as all you do is twist the screw, no tools required.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no hair stylist, but to trim my young child&#x27;s hair in between hair cuts, these have been great!</li>
            <li>My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li>but those $10 ones at Rite-Aid or K-mart are much more comfortable and cut almost just as good.</li>
            <li>Perfect for me, a beginner starting to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>The adjustment feature is nice and for the cost they would receive an EASY 5 starts if it wasn&#x27;t for the thumb hole.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super smooth and feel great in the hand.</li>
            <li>I was able to layer my hair almost effortlessly, and angle around my face with a very light touch.</li>
            <li>Love the storage case that came with it.</li>
            <li>Love these scissors,  I use them to trim my hair every 6 months</li>
            <li>Looking for many years of use.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I think they work better than scissors</li>
            <li>I love the adjustment wheel.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I also love the adjustable tension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am pleased to recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li>but I used them to cut my family&#x27;s hair and they were better than any I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>BUT the top is done with scissors.</li>
            <li>Great, I can cut my own hair now (to my stylist&#x27;s unhappiness when I go in there with my lovely crooked bangs now, yay!).  </li>
            <li>I cut men&#x27;s hair all day long and these are great!</li>
            <li>These are really good and sharp and beautifully made.</li>
            <li>They also have a nice style and fit well in my hands, the finger rest is perfectly comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable fit in the fingers also.</li>
            <li>They are perfectly made, highly polished, incredibly sharp, and come with a great case that can hold two pairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter was thrilled that I received these complimentary for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li>I cut hair for my family and these make it easy.</li>
            <li>Gold/Silver Tension and Adjustment Screw to easily Tighten or Loosen the Shears and built in finger</li>
            <li>Handles easily and the case was a bonus.</li>
            <li>Enjoying the angle, clean cut.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Comes in a nice zippered pouch for storage.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone who wants a pair of great quality shears for home us or professional use.</li>
            <li>Scissors work fine and seem to be well made.</li>
            <li>It made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>length of the blades is great for both head and facial hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are comfortable to use on myself</li>
            <li>Fast &amp; courteous service</li>
            <li>It cut the hair precisely and did not bend the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they fit her had well, and they have an adjustable tension nut.  </li>
            <li>Wish I had bought them 30 years ago instead of wasting my money on cheap drug store ones.</li>
            <li>received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li>Cheap materials</li>
            <li>I know they are a relatively cheap pair of scissors (when looking at the price)</li>
            <li>I am not a barber or professional stylist, but I do trim my own hair from time to time, and these will work better than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a professional but they cut hair great.  </li>
            <li>excellent scissors, sharp, ergonomically efficient, reasonably priced</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used for a full haircut yet</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have experience with professional shears, but these arrived in a timely manner, came with a nice leather case, and seem to work quite well.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, nicely adjustable, nice case.</li>
            <li>They work great and are sharp.</li>
            <li>These scissors are really sharp and cut great.</li>
            <li>All I need for a quick trim .</li>
            <li>very nice, well made, sharp scissors.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, work great.</li>
            <li>They were very easy to clean afterwards, I just wiped them off with a clean, dry towel.</li>
            <li>The finger rest is also nice because it gives you more control of the positioning of the scissors without having to grip them so tightly with your fingers.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s great because the kitchen scissors I&#x27;ve used for a few years don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied with the product thus far.</li>
            <li>Finally cut my own hair and used these.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for a quick trim of my daughter&#x27;s long blunt hair.</li>
            <li>Good solid scissors, sharp edge, nice heft.</li>
            <li>Using these fine scissors my haircut goes more smoothly and she is finished in much less time.  </li>
            <li>It arrived right on schedule too.</li>
            <li>Price is right for the product.</li>
            <li>Size is just right.</li>
            <li>It is really good and sharp!</li>
            <li>so I would assume the same could be said when using them on someone else&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;The holes of these scissors just barely fit my fingers comfortably</li>
            <li>I have made the mistake of trying to trim my hair with regular scissors and the difference between household scissors and professional shears was surprising.</li>
            <li>really pleased with these scissors, they are very precise and fit the hand well without creating unnecessary fatigue.</li>
            <li>Like a machine just cut sharply as fast as your hands/fingers can go!</li>
            <li>They cut hair like a hot knife cuts butter.</li>
            <li>it evident.</li>
            <li>My wife has cut my hair for the 37 years we have married  </li>
            <li>Cuts like a hot knife through butter - no grabbing or pulling.</li>
            <li>I would definitely order another pair if I need more.</li>
            <li>I know that they are stainless steel, but I will make sure they stay clean &amp; dry.</li>
            <li>I cut my hair with them night before last and was amazed at what a great job they did, I won&#x27;t be going back to my normal scissors now.</li>
            <li>Exquisitely sharp and nicely presented in a carrying case.</li>
            <li>I like how sharp they are and how easy it is to make accurate cuts.</li>
            <li>They are sharp smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Super sharp and super light.</li>
            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>Love these- nice and sharp, feel comfortable in a small hand.</li>
            <li>These scissors are very sharp and work well to trim my own hair.</li>
            <li>Comes with nice black case, scissors are comfortable to hold, and they make clean, sharp cuts.</li>
            <li>When they grow dull I just buy a new pair because the price is so great for the product.</li>
            <li>but it looks, feels, and certainly cuts like one.  </li>
            <li>These cut through large hunks of hair like butter.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality scissors at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Larger than I  thought but they  work fine</li>
            <li>If these last a few years it will be a great deal.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re much sharper than what you get with trimmer kits.</li>
            <li>These shears work very well.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised I could get such a good scissors at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Cuts hair very well.  </li>
            <li>They come in a case and seem very sturdy.</li>
            <li>These work really well.</li>
            <li>The shears are good, however they pull on a thick beard.</li>
            <li>anyone who cuts all day.&lt;br /&gt;The scissors were very smooth and sharp.</li>
            <li>Have only used a few times, and so far, so good!  </li>
            <li>If the thumb hole were to be that small I would suggest some kind of rubber lining in the inside.</li>
            <li>Super sharp and pretty!</li>
            <li>High quality steel, feels nice in your hand, but I do have to agree that the finger holes are just a tad small.</li>
            <li>Good home scissor, no split ends after cutting, good balance, sharp.</li>
            <li>Without a doubt, far and away these are the smoothest and best hair cutting scissors she has ever used.  </li>
            <li>would be better all black leather.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend.</li>
            <li>I found the Equinox Professional Razor Edge Series - Barber Hair Cutting Scissors/Shears - 6.5&amp;#34; Overall Length with Fine Adjustment Tension Screw - Japanese Stain to be an excellent scissor</li>
            <li>Good for facial hair and small trim jobs.</li>
            <li>These scissors are very sharp and cut hair easily.  </li>
            <li>These are really high quality professional scissor.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for my husband to replace a very old pair.  </li>
            <li>Ive purchased several &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; shears and these are the first that live up to that description.</li>
            <li>Awesome hair cutting scissors!</li>
            <li>But be aware, the opening for your thumb is on the smaller side.  </li>
            <li>Nicer than our old scissors!  </li>
            <li>home haircuts- way better than the craft and kitchen scissors I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>And as previously stated, they are still comfortable for me and my uses.</li>
            <li>I do NOT have abnormally large hands, fingers or thumbs for that matter (scratch that, my hands my be larger in size</li>
            <li>Great for cutting my mom&amp;#34;s hair.</li>
            <li>Like the feel of these scissors, shiny and professional looking.</li>
            <li>So far I am</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised for the money.</li>
            <li>Professional precision</li>
            <li>This may not be professional quality</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen professional hairdressers use on me.</li>
            <li>nothing a professional barber would use.</li>
            <li>Not being a professional, I can&#x27;t say they are 5 star</li>
            <li>She is 20 months old.</li>
            <li>I am a 30 year old man</li>
            <li>Sharp with a quiet, smooth cut.</li>
            <li>My thumb would slide out of it constantly and I have to apply a great deal of pressure to hold the scissors in place while cutting.</li>
            <li>My sample pair is really well crafted and they feel like they will last a very long time, especially with a protective case keeping them looking brand new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used them once so far</li>
            <li>and I am not sure they would stay comfortable through a full haircut or a full day of hair cutting.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased a pair Equinox Professional Razor Edge Series scissors and no kidding, they are razor edged.</li>
            <li>3 times what these cost for an equally good pair of hair cutting scissors.</li>
            <li>it nice, but the logo on it is lame.</li>
            <li>When they say sharp they really are.</li>
            <li>Makes cutting hair a breeze, sharp with nice finger tightening nut that really works well.</li>
            <li>sharp cutting I like these scissors so far soooooooo good.</li>

            <li> I am really happy and excited about this scissors.</li>
            <li> They are high quality and perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> Scissors super sharp,work great for trimming hair.  </li>
            <li> The tension is very easy to change, as all you do is twist the screw, no tools required.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no hair stylist, but to trim my young child&#x27;s hair in between hair cuts, these have been great!</li>
            <li> My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> but those $10 ones at Rite-Aid or K-mart are much more comfortable and cut almost just as good.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me, a beginner starting to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> The adjustment feature is nice and for the cost they would receive an EASY 5 starts if it wasn&#x27;t for the thumb hole.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super smooth and feel great in the hand.</li>
            <li> I was able to layer my hair almost effortlessly, and angle around my face with a very light touch.</li>
            <li> Love the storage case that came with it.</li>
            <li> Love these scissors,  I use them to trim my hair every 6 months</li>
            <li> Looking for many years of use.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> and I think they work better than scissors</li>
            <li> I love the adjustment wheel.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I also love the adjustable tension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am pleased to recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> but I used them to cut my family&#x27;s hair and they were better than any I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> BUT the top is done with scissors.</li>
            <li> Great, I can cut my own hair now (to my stylist&#x27;s unhappiness when I go in there with my lovely crooked bangs now, yay!).  </li>
            <li> I cut men&#x27;s hair all day long and these are great!</li>
            <li> These are really good and sharp and beautifully made.</li>
            <li> They also have a nice style and fit well in my hands, the finger rest is perfectly comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable fit in the fingers also.</li>
            <li> They are perfectly made, highly polished, incredibly sharp, and come with a great case that can hold two pairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter was thrilled that I received these complimentary for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li> I cut hair for my family and these make it easy.</li>
            <li> Gold/Silver Tension and Adjustment Screw to easily Tighten or Loosen the Shears and built in finger</li>
            <li> Handles easily and the case was a bonus.</li>
            <li> Enjoying the angle, clean cut.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Comes in a nice zippered pouch for storage.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone who wants a pair of great quality shears for home us or professional use.</li>
            <li> Scissors work fine and seem to be well made.</li>
            <li> It made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> length of the blades is great for both head and facial hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are comfortable to use on myself</li>
            <li> Fast &amp; courteous service</li>
            <li> It cut the hair precisely and did not bend the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they fit her had well, and they have an adjustable tension nut.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had bought them 30 years ago instead of wasting my money on cheap drug store ones.</li>
            <li> received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li> Cheap materials</li>
            <li> I know they are a relatively cheap pair of scissors (when looking at the price)</li>
            <li> I am not a barber or professional stylist, but I do trim my own hair from time to time, and these will work better than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional but they cut hair great.  </li>
            <li> excellent scissors, sharp, ergonomically efficient, reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used for a full haircut yet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have experience with professional shears, but these arrived in a timely manner, came with a nice leather case, and seem to work quite well.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, nicely adjustable, nice case.</li>
            <li> They work great and are sharp.</li>
            <li> These scissors are really sharp and cut great.</li>
            <li> All I need for a quick trim .</li>
            <li> very nice, well made, sharp scissors.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, work great.</li>
            <li> They were very easy to clean afterwards, I just wiped them off with a clean, dry towel.</li>
            <li> The finger rest is also nice because it gives you more control of the positioning of the scissors without having to grip them so tightly with your fingers.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s great because the kitchen scissors I&#x27;ve used for a few years don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with the product thus far.</li>
            <li> Finally cut my own hair and used these.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for a quick trim of my daughter&#x27;s long blunt hair.</li>
            <li> Good solid scissors, sharp edge, nice heft.</li>
            <li> Using these fine scissors my haircut goes more smoothly and she is finished in much less time.  </li>
            <li> It arrived right on schedule too.</li>
            <li> Price is right for the product.</li>
            <li> Size is just right.</li>
            <li> It is really good and sharp!</li>
            <li> so I would assume the same could be said when using them on someone else&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;The holes of these scissors just barely fit my fingers comfortably</li>
            <li> I have made the mistake of trying to trim my hair with regular scissors and the difference between household scissors and professional shears was surprising.</li>
            <li> really pleased with these scissors, they are very precise and fit the hand well without creating unnecessary fatigue.</li>
            <li> Like a machine just cut sharply as fast as your hands/fingers can go!</li>
            <li> They cut hair like a hot knife cuts butter.</li>
            <li> it evident.</li>
            <li> My wife has cut my hair for the 37 years we have married  </li>
            <li> Cuts like a hot knife through butter - no grabbing or pulling.</li>
            <li> I would definitely order another pair if I need more.</li>
            <li> I know that they are stainless steel, but I will make sure they stay clean &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair with them night before last and was amazed at what a great job they did, I won&#x27;t be going back to my normal scissors now.</li>
            <li> Exquisitely sharp and nicely presented in a carrying case.</li>
            <li> I like how sharp they are and how easy it is to make accurate cuts.</li>
            <li> They are sharp smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and super light.</li>
            <li> I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li> Love these- nice and sharp, feel comfortable in a small hand.</li>
            <li> These scissors are very sharp and work well to trim my own hair.</li>
            <li> Comes with nice black case, scissors are comfortable to hold, and they make clean, sharp cuts.</li>
            <li> When they grow dull I just buy a new pair because the price is so great for the product.</li>
            <li> but it looks, feels, and certainly cuts like one.  </li>
            <li> These cut through large hunks of hair like butter.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality scissors at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Larger than I  thought but they  work fine</li>
            <li> If these last a few years it will be a great deal.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re much sharper than what you get with trimmer kits.</li>
            <li> These shears work very well.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised I could get such a good scissors at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair very well.  </li>
            <li> They come in a case and seem very sturdy.</li>
            <li> These work really well.</li>
            <li> The shears are good, however they pull on a thick beard.</li>
            <li> anyone who cuts all day.&lt;br /&gt;The scissors were very smooth and sharp.</li>
            <li> Have only used a few times, and so far, so good!  </li>
            <li> If the thumb hole were to be that small I would suggest some kind of rubber lining in the inside.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and pretty!</li>
            <li> High quality steel, feels nice in your hand, but I do have to agree that the finger holes are just a tad small.</li>
            <li> Good home scissor, no split ends after cutting, good balance, sharp.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, far and away these are the smoothest and best hair cutting scissors she has ever used.  </li>
            <li> would be better all black leather.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> I found the Equinox Professional Razor Edge Series - Barber Hair Cutting Scissors/Shears - 6.5&amp;#34; Overall Length with Fine Adjustment Tension Screw - Japanese Stain to be an excellent scissor</li>
            <li> Good for facial hair and small trim jobs.</li>
            <li> These scissors are very sharp and cut hair easily.  </li>
            <li> These are really high quality professional scissor.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband to replace a very old pair.  </li>
            <li> Ive purchased several &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; shears and these are the first that live up to that description.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair cutting scissors!</li>
            <li> But be aware, the opening for your thumb is on the smaller side.  </li>
            <li> Nicer than our old scissors!  </li>
            <li> home haircuts- way better than the craft and kitchen scissors I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> And as previously stated, they are still comfortable for me and my uses.</li>
            <li> I do NOT have abnormally large hands, fingers or thumbs for that matter (scratch that, my hands my be larger in size</li>
            <li> Great for cutting my mom&amp;#34;s hair.</li>
            <li> Like the feel of these scissors, shiny and professional looking.</li>
            <li> So far I am</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised for the money.</li>
            <li> Professional precision</li>
            <li> This may not be professional quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen professional hairdressers use on me.</li>
            <li> nothing a professional barber would use.</li>
            <li> Not being a professional, I can&#x27;t say they are 5 star</li>
            <li> She is 20 months old.</li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old man</li>
            <li> Sharp with a quiet, smooth cut.</li>
            <li> My thumb would slide out of it constantly and I have to apply a great deal of pressure to hold the scissors in place while cutting.</li>
            <li> My sample pair is really well crafted and they feel like they will last a very long time, especially with a protective case keeping them looking brand new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them once so far</li>
            <li> and I am not sure they would stay comfortable through a full haircut or a full day of hair cutting.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased a pair Equinox Professional Razor Edge Series scissors and no kidding, they are razor edged.</li>
            <li> 3 times what these cost for an equally good pair of hair cutting scissors.</li>
            <li> it nice, but the logo on it is lame.</li>
            <li> When they say sharp they really are.</li>
            <li> Makes cutting hair a breeze, sharp with nice finger tightening nut that really works well.</li>
            <li> sharp cutting I like these scissors so far soooooooo good.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp and seem like high quality for the price.</li>
            <li> They feel sturdy and look built to last a long time.</li>
            <li> The fit is for small hands and well balanced for small hands.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to hold because my fingers cannot fit.</li>
            <li> I expect it will be a long time.</li>
            <li> Which then of course caused me to cut myself 3 inches long on my scalp.</li>
            <li> (for my needs, at least).&lt;br /&gt;They are sharp enough to have not caused me any problems initially.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Razor sharp and solid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for the past couple of years, and I&#x27;ve just been using regular household scissors.</li>
            <li> They cut OK, but the reason they only received 2 stars was because the thumb hole is way to small and EXTREMELY uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> single.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly shocked that they don&#x27;t cost more</li>
            <li> it closed every.</li>
            <li> They are really sharp so be careful.</li>
            <li> It is so sharp it makes hair trimming a breeze.</li>
            <li> These are so sharp that you can use one blade to use as a razors edge.</li>
            <li> Ridiculously sharp.  </li>
            <li> These are seriously sharp, high-quality scissors.</li>
            <li> I use these to cut my Grandson&#x27;s hair and boy, you have to be careful!</li>
            <li> Sharp and doesnt end up damaging the hair</li>
            <li> a sharp tip</li>
            <li> I have long hair and just do small trims myself every month or so.</li>
            <li> They are very quiet as they go about their work, making nervous little ones and pets less anxious.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Only question is how long the cutting edge will last...</li>
            <li> Very sharp scissors.</li>
            <li> The edges on the scissors are blunt, so that you don&#x27;t accidentally stab yourself or a client, but the blades are very sharp &amp; cut with ease.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> Sharp blades but the finger holes are little tight</li>
            <li> It arrived in a black, zippered pouch with velvet lining for storage so they don&#x27;t get lost or damaged.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend these to anyone who casually cuts hair for their family.</li>
            <li> Theyve made hair cutting so much easier and faster!</li>
            <li> I started cutting my husband hair and this work really well.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty.  </li>
            <li> It might be uncomfortable for a larger hand.</li>
            <li> They work wonderfully--better than any scissors I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure I will keep them.</li>
            <li> I was getting sick of spending $10 on new scissors every few months because they kept breaking</li>
            <li> have spend hundreds of dollars on  a few different pairs of shears for her to use while cutting professionally.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> they feel high quality and will keep buying these when these go bad if they ever do...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend them for men since the finger holes are very small.</li>
            <li> so it hard to be specific.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally decided to cave and order a pair of legitimate hair cutting shears.</li>
            <li> but by no means do I have thick fingers).</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy these again if needed, and at the price you can&#x27;t really go wrong!</li>
            <li> I got the scissors for my husband to use to trim his beard but the holes are to small for his fingers!</li>
            <li> - these are serious quality for the price.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;deluxe case&amp;#34; is laughable, just throw it away.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I will not be purchasing these again unless a model comes out with some type of rubber on the inside thumb hole or the hole</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like cutting through butter.  </li>

            <li> Got this as a gift for my mother who is a stylist (at home) and she says these are some of the best scissors she has ever used. They&#x27;re super smooth and feel great in the hand. Would definitely buy these again if needed, and at the price you can&#x27;t really go wrong!</li>
            <li> Very sharp.  Great for cutting my mom&amp;#34;s hair.</li>
            <li> good quality, very satisfied, I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t find this product sooner!  These scissors are wonderful in every way.  They are everything the company claims and have given me all I&#x27;ve ever looked for in good haircut scissors no matter what the hair texture or length.  I would buy them again and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Scissors super sharp,work great for trimming hair.  Love the storage case that came with it.</li>
            <li> Decided to &amp;#34;go big&amp;#34; on these after the TSA stole a pair of mine I had been using on my hair and beard for years.  So far I am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;The length of the blades is great for both head and facial hair (for my needs, at least).&lt;br /&gt;They are sharp enough to have not caused me any problems initially.&lt;br /&gt;They are comfortable to use on myself so I would assume the same could be said when using them on someone else&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;The holes of these scissors just barely fit my fingers comfortably and I am not sure they would stay comfortable through a full haircut or a full day of hair cutting.  That said, I&#x27;m a big guy with relatively chunky fingers... so this would likely not even be a concern for the the majority of folks.  And as previously stated, they are still comfortable for me and my uses.</li>
            <li> Wow.  These are really high quality professional scissor.  I was surprised for the money.</li>
            <li> Love these- nice and sharp, feel comfortable in a small hand.</li>
            <li> Excellent edge and very comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased with these scissors, they are very precise and fit the hand well without creating unnecessary fatigue. They are very quiet as they go about their work, making nervous little ones and pets less anxious. My sample pair is really well crafted and they feel like they will last a very long time, especially with a protective case keeping them looking brand new.</li>
            <li> Excellent scissors! When they say sharp they really are. Would definitely recommend. Fast &amp; courteous service</li>
            <li> These are really great razor edge scissors... i use this once a month to trim my ends and it cuts like butter... they feel high quality and will keep buying these when these go bad if they ever do...</li>
            <li> My wife has cut my hair for the 37 years we have married  Without a doubt, far and away these are the smoothest and best hair cutting scissors she has ever used.  They are beautifully finished and designed and fit her fingers perfectly and the tension adjustment is like icing on the cake.  It&#x27;s like cutting through butter.  Using these fine scissors my haircut goes more smoothly and she is finished in much less time.  I would have been happy spending 3 times what these cost for an equally good pair of hair cutting scissors.</li>
            <li> I received these scissors yesterday and they surpassed my expectations. Exquisitely sharp and nicely presented in a carrying case. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love these scissors,  I use them to trim my hair every 6 months</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with the handling and sharpness of the blades.  It arrived right on schedule too.</li>
            <li> Great, I can cut my own hair now (to my stylist&#x27;s unhappiness when I go in there with my lovely crooked bangs now, yay!).  Does a great job.</li>
            <li> Larger than I  thought but they  work fine</li>
            <li> Scissors work fine and seem to be well made. Looking for many years of use. Thank you</li>
            <li> Awesome shears for a great price! Received with with the Amazon trader and I&#x27;m trying to get another one!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a pair Equinox Professional Razor Edge Series scissors and no kidding, they are razor edged. I highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair very well.  I fix my bangs myself so I don&#x27;t have to spend money every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> sharp cutting I like these scissors so far soooooooo good. I clip my own edges . the trim is nice and neat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have experience with professional shears, but these arrived in a timely manner, came with a nice leather case, and seem to work quite well. They also have a nice style and fit well in my hands, the finger rest is perfectly comfortable. I am totally satisfied with the product thus far.</li>
            <li> These are great for my use. I cut hair for my family and these make it easy. They are sharp smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great value. These are so sharp that you can use one blade to use as a razors edge. They come in a case and seem very sturdy.</li>
            <li> These scissors are very sharp and work well to trim my own hair.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Professional precision</li>
            <li> These scissors came in a nice case and look nicer than the photo.  I am not a barber or professional stylist, but I do trim my own hair from time to time, and these will work better than I was expecting.  I plan to get another pair for my husband.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a licensed Cosmetologist and a good pair of scissors is a must!&lt;br /&gt;We have spend hundreds of dollars on  a few different pairs of shears for her to use while cutting professionally.&lt;br /&gt;She loved the look and feel of these 6.5 inch shears by Equinox. The nice angle is a must have for anyone who cuts all day.&lt;br /&gt;The scissors were very smooth and sharp. It cut the hair precisely and did not bend the hair.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter was very impressed with the quality of these shears.&lt;br /&gt;High quality Japanese steel. Gold/Silver Tension and Adjustment Screw to easily Tighten or Loosen the Shears and built in finger rest.&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a nice zippered pouch for storage.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone who wants a pair of great quality shears for home us or professional use. My daughter was thrilled that I received these complimentary for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li> Cuts like a hot knife through butter - no grabbing or pulling.</li>
            <li> These are very good scissors, they handle and cut well.</li>
            <li> Very good scissors which also come with a nice case.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife to cut my hair.  She likes these a lot...they fit her had well, and they have an adjustable tension nut.  If these last a few years it will be a great deal.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, nicely adjustable, nice case. But be aware, the opening for your thumb is on the smaller side.  It might be uncomfortable for a larger hand.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scissors! They feel sturdy and look built to last a long time. They work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great shears. I cut men&#x27;s hair all day long and these are great! When they grow dull I just buy a new pair because the price is so great for the product.</li>
            <li> you can feel the quality</li>
            <li> Finally cut my own hair and used these. They are awesome. Please, don&#x27;t hesitate on them if you are in the market for a pair.</li>
            <li> Ridiculously sharp.  Heavy duty.  Built to last.  I&#x27;m no hair stylist, but to trim my young child&#x27;s hair in between hair cuts, these have been great!</li>
            <li> This may not be professional quality but it looks, feels, and certainly cuts like one.  Handles easily and the case was a bonus. Only question is how long the cutting edge will last...I expect it will be a long time.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! These do a great job.</li>
            <li> Great sheers for a great price.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed &amp; wanted for my beard. Wish I had bought them 30 years ago instead of wasting my money on cheap drug store ones.</li>
            <li> These are seriously sharp, high-quality scissors. They aren&#x27;t kidding about razor edge - I sliced my finger open on either these or the thinning scissors! These cut through large hunks of hair like butter. I gave myself a haircut today and I think they work better than scissors I&#x27;ve seen professional hairdressers use on me. I&#x27;m truly shocked that they don&#x27;t cost more - these are serious quality for the price. They are perfectly made, highly polished, incredibly sharp, and come with a great case that can hold two pairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> Nicer than our old scissors!  Enjoying the angle, clean cut.  Have only used a few times, and so far, so good!  Will see how they hold up to know if they&#x27;re a 5-star or not.</li>
            <li> They work great! Just used them for home haircuts- way better than the craft and kitchen scissors I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> The best pair of scissors I have found in many years for trimming my beard and mustache.</li>
            <li> Very sharp scissors. I use these to cut my Grandson&#x27;s hair and boy, you have to be careful! The seller did an excellent job and I am very pleased with the purchase</li>
            <li> Scissors work great. Nice and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for a quick trim of my daughter&#x27;s long blunt hair. I just needed to trim off the ends without paying a fortune to have someone else do it. Got here quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Very nice pair of scissors.....nice travel case.</li>
            <li> The scissors are excellent quality &amp; workmanship. Very sharp, work great. I love the adjustment wheel. The &amp;#34;deluxe case&amp;#34; is laughable, just throw it away. Cheap materials and you&#x27;ll struggle to zip it closed every. single. time.</li>
            <li> The fit is for small hands and well balanced for small hands.  The cut is very good.</li>
            <li> Very nice. For the price even better!</li>
            <li> I have long hair and just do small trims myself every month or so. These are very sharp and seem like high quality for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to hold because my fingers cannot fit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome! The best for me.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used, but looks like they will be good.</li>
            <li> These work really well. I would definitely order another pair if I need more.</li>
            <li> Ive purchased several &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; shears and these are the first that live up to that description. I love them. Razor sharp and solid. Theyve made hair cutting so much easier and faster! I also love the adjustable tension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these to anyone who casually cuts hair for their family.</li>
            <li> These scissors work so well. I have made the mistake of trying to trim my hair with regular scissors and the difference between household scissors and professional shears was surprising. They are really sharp so be careful. I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend them for men since the finger holes are very small.</li>
            <li> These are really good and sharp and beautifully made. I am pleased to recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I started cutting my husband hair and this work really well.</li>
            <li> excellent scissors, sharp, ergonomically efficient, reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Sharp and doesnt end up damaging the hair</li>
            <li> Very nice shears.  Good for facial hair and small trim jobs. nothing a professional barber would use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, excellent price, nothing more need be said.</li>
            <li> It is really good and sharp! Especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Good solid scissors, sharp edge, nice heft. Shipping was punctual.</li>
            <li> very nice, well made, sharp scissors. this is saving money because I am now my own hairstylist.</li>
            <li> great product-----works well</li>
            <li> The shears are good, however they pull on a thick beard. Not quite what I was looking for but they will do for the price.</li>
            <li> These scissors work amazing. It is effortless to cut my own hair. These are made to last and that&#x27;s great because the kitchen scissors I&#x27;ve used for a few years don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> What a great pair of scissors! I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for the past couple of years, and I&#x27;ve just been using regular household scissors. I finally decided to cave and order a pair of legitimate hair cutting shears. It made a huge difference. It arrived in a black, zippered pouch with velvet lining for storage so they don&#x27;t get lost or damaged. In addition to the outer case, the product came in a plastic bag/sheath. I am storing them in the sheath within the holder just for added protection. The tension is very easy to change, as all you do is twist the screw, no tools required. The finger rest is also nice because it gives you more control of the positioning of the scissors without having to grip them so tightly with your fingers. I cut my hair with them night before last and was amazed at what a great job they did, I won&#x27;t be going back to my normal scissors now. The edges on the scissors are blunt, so that you don&#x27;t accidentally stab yourself or a client, but the blades are very sharp &amp; cut with ease. I was able to layer my hair almost effortlessly, and angle around my face with a very light touch. They were very easy to clean afterwards, I just wiped them off with a clean, dry towel. I know that they are stainless steel, but I will make sure they stay clean &amp; dry. I know they will last for years if taken care of. I received a discount on my purchase, and my review is honest &amp; of my own opinion.</li>
            <li> Very nice scissors... High quality steel, feels nice in your hand, but I do have to agree that the finger holes are just a tad small.</li>
            <li> They work great and are sharp. Not being a professional, I can&#x27;t say they are 5 star but I used them to cut my family&#x27;s hair and they were better than any I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I got the scissors for my husband to use to trim his beard but the holes are to small for his fingers!</li>
            <li> Bought these for when I need to trim my bangs in between haircuts. They are high quality and perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> These are the best Shears I have ever had. They work amazingly!</li>
            <li> This is a high quality scissors at a very reasonable price. The tension adjustment thumbscrew is serrated, providing incremental adjustment so the scissors is always under your control. Very comfortable fit in the fingers also.</li>
            <li> nice, bf uses for his beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good length blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not a sharp tip so it hard to be specific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;could take it or leave it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;case it nice, but the logo on it is lame. would be better all black leather. i just threw it away....</li>
            <li> Makes cutting hair a breeze, sharp with nice finger tightening nut that really works well.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and super light. Awesome product. I will buy it again in the future</li>
            <li> nice product, seems to work</li>
            <li> These scissors are really sharp and cut great. I&#x27;m not a professional but they cut hair great.  I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> Cuts nice. We use to cut our daughters hair. She is 20 months old.</li>
            <li> Amazing..I&#x27;d buy again</li>
            <li> As described. Very sharp. Well made. Would buy again.Price is right for the product. All I need for a quick trim .</li>
            <li> I found the Equinox Professional Razor Edge Series - Barber Hair Cutting Scissors/Shears - 6.5&amp;#34; Overall Length with Fine Adjustment Tension Screw - Japanese Stain to be an excellent scissor</li>
            <li> Nice and well made.  Should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> nice pair of barber shears</li>
            <li> I bought these scissors to trim my bangs.  They work wonderfully--better than any scissors I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old man and I have been cutting my own hair for years. I use clippers for the majority of my hair (fade and all) BUT the top is done with scissors. I was getting sick of spending $10 on new scissors every few months because they kept breaking so I decided to go a different route and order off here. I kind of wish I didn&#x27;t. They cut OK, but the reason they only received 2 stars was because the thumb hole is way to small and EXTREMELY uncomfortable. My thumb would slide out of it constantly and I have to apply a great deal of pressure to hold the scissors in place while cutting. Which then of course caused me to cut myself 3 inches long on my scalp. If the thumb hole were to be that small I would suggest some kind of rubber lining in the inside. I cut my hair every 2 weeks so I use these scissors a lot but unfortunately I will not be purchasing these again unless a model comes out with some type of rubber on the inside thumb hole or the hole is just simply made bigger. I know they are a relatively cheap pair of scissors (when looking at the price) but those $10 ones at Rite-Aid or K-mart are much more comfortable and cut almost just as good. The adjustment feature is nice and for the cost they would receive an EASY 5 starts if it wasn&#x27;t for the thumb hole. Buyer be wear I do NOT have abnormally large hands, fingers or thumbs for that matter (scratch that, my hands my be larger in size but by no means do I have thick fingers). Unless you have the hands of a 100 pound women I wouldn&#x27;t buy these....</li>
            <li> Really too heavy for me . Not sure I will keep them.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and pretty!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband to replace a very old pair.  He is very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Good home scissor, no split ends after cutting, good balance, sharp.</li>
            <li> Sharp blades but the finger holes are little tight</li>
            <li> These scissors are very sharp and cut hair easily.  Have a good ergonomic feel and love the storage case.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me, a beginner starting to cut my own hair. I like how sharp they are and how easy it is to make accurate cuts. Size is just right.</li>
