            <li>The texture feels pleasant on my skin and the scent is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and it feels nice on the skin - it is sort of cooling, so if you just want a nice mask to relax you.. it would work well for that purpose..</li>

            <li>amazing price.</li>
            <li>amazing product</li>
            <li>and when I woke up my skin felt amazing.</li>
            <li>the price point offered on amazon (amazing), i would recommend giving it a try.  </li>
            <li>It smells like the beach and feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>and my skin does feel really nice immediately after the application.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love!!</li>
            <li>The scent is strong but I think it is pleasant and does not seem to bother my skin at this time.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, so glad I found it for a cheaper price than what it is in Sephora for 65 ^ $$.</li>
            <li>Great Price and Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>GOOD,it is  a very good hydrating sleeping mask smell good, after using it I feel my face is smooth at next morning,</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need to use it more?</li>
            <li>I have more oily skin</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff....</li>
            <li>This received really great reviews, and was reasonable so I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>So, I decided to use it for another month to give it more time--but my skin still does not feel any better than before.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s actually really appealing to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not mind paying more if a product does what it claims, but this did not.</li>
            <li>The performance is outstanding.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so $$ that it took a while for me to bite the bullet, but I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>Thank you I love this product and will purchase again</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love glam glow products.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about four days now and my skin looks better each morning.</li>
            <li>but so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li>My favorite of all the Glam Glows &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>but I think my skin may need something more than just that.</li>
            <li>It does feel somewhat tingly though so be sure not to touch your eyes with any residue on your fingers.</li>
            <li>I am beyond in love with this product.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell delicious, but it is so moisturizing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I love, love, love this mask.  </li>
            <li>i love</li>
            <li>This is a very good hydrating sleeping mask, I feel my face is smooth at next morning, and cute sweet smell of this product, which I loved.</li>
            <li>And left my skin feeling amazing!!</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of 4 different Glam products, this one and Bright Eyes became MUST HAVES!!  </li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and experienced no irritation, redness, or breakouts from this product.</li>
            <li>Plus: This product leaves my skin soft, not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Minus: not that great for the price.</li>
            <li>I love, love the sweet coconut scent.  </li>
            <li>Wow, so happy with this product..</li>
            <li>Very sticky, but the smell is good.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li>skin is much more balanced and the overall appearance is greatly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for dry skin, its so hydrating and makes my skin feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>It is hands down the best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>She is not sure that she saw any amazing results, but the mask felt good on, and her skin looks nice.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is interesting - it smells a bit minty at first, then I get a whiff of something like Play-Doh !</li>
            <li>and this didn&#x27;t cause me to break out, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>My skin becomes so smooth after using, but I don&#x27;t like the smell -- like plasticine.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy putting this on before foundation and let it set for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>This GlamGlow Thirstymud Hydrating Treatment is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I also enjoy the experience of putting it on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it at night, 1-2 times per week, and so far so good.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite product :)</li>
            <li>but it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It was the original product in the original packaging..</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and hasn&#x27;t ever irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good product.</li>
            <li>The Glam Glow is cool and hydrating from the moment it touches your skin.  </li>
            <li>Pleased with the product but can&#x27;t notice any real difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>i really like the smell, which is a melange of honey and coconut, and the packaging is cute.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something more gentle but still hydrating, the First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Instant Oatmeal Mask is a great bet.  </li>
            <li>I really want to love this product</li>
            <li>I want to try the mud mask next which I also heard good things about.  </li>
            <li>and surprisingly it really worked and kept my skin very smooth the whole day and made it easy to apply foundation.</li>
            <li>Your face will be super hydrated.</li>
            <li>She wanted something super hydrating.</li>
            <li>Already use glam glow super mud, but will not use this again.</li>
            <li>my forehead n nose after a day was super oily</li>
            <li>I had a mild but distinct reaction.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a really good hydrating mask for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a amazing I highly recommend :)</li>
            <li>Maybe something to firm and add antioxidants would be great.</li>
            <li>It makes my foundation go on a lot more seamlessly.</li>
            <li>This is a product worth the price.</li>
            <li>but if it works, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>WORTH THE MONEY</li>
            <li>We got this from prime when the price was substantially less than full price, so was a good deal.  </li>
            <li>Got it on time, and the right product.</li>
            <li>I use it over night and it seems to absorb right away.</li>
            <li>Only used it once so far but smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I thought it was great, and then the next day my face broke out into red splotches EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li>I had a friend tell me how much she liked all the glamglow products and especially this hydrating treatment.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely pricey, but I am willing to pay that price as I have yet to find something better!</li>
            <li>The smell and texture are different and the color is lighter than the authentic one, however I applied it on my face given the reputation of Amazon.</li>
            <li>I was worried at first if this product was authentic or not because of the low price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry, but this is just the best stuff on Earth.</li>
            <li>This is the third GLAMGLOW product I&#x27;ve tried and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>it is beautiful and compares favorably to other moisturizing products in the 30-40 dollar range for similar volume in terms of performance, but it isn&#x27;t a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>My skin looks clean and clear and glowing.</li>
            <li>but overall i enjoy the product and smell it has its worth the buy</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m positive they will soon disappear.  </li>
            <li>It does cost more than other masks, but for me it is worth it for the results.</li>
            <li>I would say my skin is more dehydrated than dry, however when I wear foundation</li>
            <li>I try using it three times or more a week because my skin gets so dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>you can really see,</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and you can feel the hydrating effects instantly.</li>
            <li>I recommended this one cause it really does moisture my face a litter bit.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much, using it every day for six months</li>
            <li>but if you really are looking for something to hydrate your skin - I would look elsewhere..</li>
            <li>It really doe make a difference.</li>
            <li>so much I wanted to buy it.  </li>
            <li>and this doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot for me.</li>
            <li>I think I will need to give it a bit longer to really see if it works or not.</li>
            <li>so I really need this.</li>
            <li>Really brightens and moisturizers the skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very pricey for the amount in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I do not notice much of a difference in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I do however really like the scent</li>
            <li>I am a flight attendant</li>
            <li>The scent was strong for a long time.</li>
            <li>Great stuff and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I bought this and the white jar from Amazon(sold by a third party) last December thinking $40 is a really good deal.</li>
            <li>and I mean severe and this cream really hydrates my skin and gives it a glow like never before I love it!</li>
            <li>I am taking a medication that makes my skin extremely dry, this mask feels so good when my skin is especially dry.</li>
            <li>I did not find this to be super hydrating; and it is definitely overpriced.</li>
            <li>I read all the high ratings on Sephora and decided to buy it on Amazon for the cheaper price.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s hard to describe but it smells amazing, and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>The topical products I use to keep my acne at bay exasperate the dryness, especially in the winter, so for me products that hydrate my skin aren&#x27;t just a nice to have, they&#x27;re crucial.  </li>
            <li>Granted, because of the topicals my skin is more sensitive than average.  </li>
            <li>and i have normal skin</li>
            <li>I should note that I have very sensitive skin with the normal T-zone oiliness.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling refreshed and cool, doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive dry skin...perfect for winter peeling and drying out.  </li>
            <li>It was not damaged and had a new seal.</li>
            <li>I probably will not buy this again, but it would not do you any harm to try this new product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>I live in the south west where there is no humidity</li>
            <li>THIS product.. Couldn&#x27;t live without it..</li>
            <li>for those with sensitivity to fragrance and products in general, know that I am super sensitive to WAY too many products (it&#x27;s always a tense moment when trying any new product).</li>
            <li>It will give u a very soft skin</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and thought this might help, but unfortunately - I do not find it very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>This has completely transformed my skin!</li>
            <li>My skin has NEVER been so soft!</li>
            <li>B0083S44LM First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Instant Oatmeal Mask-2 oz.]] since it&#x27;s both hydrating and soothing, but after a ringing endorsement of Thirstymud, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I have always had super sensitive and dry skin and struggled with moisturizers that helped the dryness but didn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s useful for the dry skin.</li>
            <li>The mask is so cooling and really adds much needed moisture for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Disappointing after all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never been this clear and moisturized.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it as a night cream, just applying it like lotion and going to bed to wake up to velvety soft skin.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to fragrances Do Not Buy this product.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 of these for my wife and they arrived in early October 2014.</li>
            <li>The treatment leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated all day, even in the drier winter climate.</li>
            <li>has completely eliminated that problem.</li>
            <li>It is entirely up to you and how much hydration you feel that you need.</li>
            <li>After washing it off my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>i am keeping this one in the refrigerator in an attempt to head off early spoilage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really transports me to the spa facial experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the long list of ingredients, it could very well have the same hydrating stuff that is in Play-doh :) I will be definitely be adding a larger container on GlamGlow to my skincare shelf for future use.</li>
            <li>This product is essentially what I love for when I try to find a face cream/lotion, but am never able to find.</li>
            <li>but without foundation/powder, my skin is USUALLY silky smooth.</li>
            <li>one thing worth noting about it is that it does make my skin tingle a little.  </li>
            <li>The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is that I use it a couple of times a week at night and lightly and after a few months I am almost out, seems not to last.</li>
            <li>It is apparently a mask, but I use it as a moisturizer once a day before bed.</li>
            <li>I apply a thin layerat bedtime every night and my skin is 110% better than before.</li>
            <li>Has the original plastic covering and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face baby soft and the usual dry patches have significantly shrunk</li>
            <li>Not a single zit.</li>
            <li>When I used up my old GlamGlow(bought from Sephora at regular price $69), I opened the one I bought from Amazon (third party sold but shipped from Amazon warehouse).</li>
            <li>She had recently had a peel, so it may have been that her skin was simply too sensitive and not the fault of the product.  </li>
            <li>my skin is not dry (but also not that hydrated as it says your skin should be).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a bit spendy but a little goes a long way and does a stellar job!</li>
            <li>is also a little different (The First Aid mask has an even creamier texture with flecks of oatmeal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I highly recommend it if you do a lot of flying which can be extremely drying.  </li>
            <li>It turned out to be the real deal, I compared it with a thirsty mud I had previously bought at sephora</li>
            <li>For context, I have acne prone skin that is also dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>To avoid this, I apply a layer of Atralin (a strong prescription retinoid), wait an hour, and then apply to thin layer of GlamGlow Thirtymud.</li>
            <li>Really good for my thirsty skin, the only drawback is the lotion is dark brown, weird.</li>
            <li>Hydrating Marine Moisture Mask - are both superior and less expensive.  </li>

            <li> To date, I&#x27;ve loved [</li>
            <li> However it doesn&#x27;t smell quite as good as this mask and the texture</li>
            <li> Good product, except for its price the amount include is scarce.</li>
            <li> The texture feels pleasant on my skin and the scent is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and it feels nice on the skin - it is sort of cooling, so if you just want a nice mask to relax you.. it would work well for that purpose..</li>

            <li> amazing price.</li>
            <li> amazing product</li>
            <li> and when I woke up my skin felt amazing.</li>
            <li> the price point offered on amazon (amazing), i would recommend giving it a try.  </li>
            <li> It smells like the beach and feels amazing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> and my skin does feel really nice immediately after the application.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love!!</li>
            <li> The scent is strong but I think it is pleasant and does not seem to bother my skin at this time.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, so glad I found it for a cheaper price than what it is in Sephora for 65 ^ $$.</li>
            <li> Great Price and Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> GOOD,it is  a very good hydrating sleeping mask smell good, after using it I feel my face is smooth at next morning,</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need to use it more?</li>
            <li> I have more oily skin</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff....</li>
            <li> This received really great reviews, and was reasonable so I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> So, I decided to use it for another month to give it more time--but my skin still does not feel any better than before.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s actually really appealing to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not mind paying more if a product does what it claims, but this did not.</li>
            <li> The performance is outstanding.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so $$ that it took a while for me to bite the bullet, but I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Thank you I love this product and will purchase again</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love glam glow products.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about four days now and my skin looks better each morning.</li>
            <li> but so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> My favorite of all the Glam Glows &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> but I think my skin may need something more than just that.</li>
            <li> It does feel somewhat tingly though so be sure not to touch your eyes with any residue on your fingers.</li>
            <li> I am beyond in love with this product.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell delicious, but it is so moisturizing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I love, love, love this mask.  </li>
            <li> i love</li>
            <li> This is a very good hydrating sleeping mask, I feel my face is smooth at next morning, and cute sweet smell of this product, which I loved.</li>
            <li> And left my skin feeling amazing!!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of 4 different Glam products, this one and Bright Eyes became MUST HAVES!!  </li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and experienced no irritation, redness, or breakouts from this product.</li>
            <li> Plus: This product leaves my skin soft, not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Minus: not that great for the price.</li>
            <li> I love, love the sweet coconut scent.  </li>
            <li> Wow, so happy with this product..</li>
            <li> Very sticky, but the smell is good.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> skin is much more balanced and the overall appearance is greatly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for dry skin, its so hydrating and makes my skin feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> It is hands down the best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> She is not sure that she saw any amazing results, but the mask felt good on, and her skin looks nice.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is interesting - it smells a bit minty at first, then I get a whiff of something like Play-Doh !</li>
            <li> and this didn&#x27;t cause me to break out, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> My skin becomes so smooth after using, but I don&#x27;t like the smell -- like plasticine.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy putting this on before foundation and let it set for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This GlamGlow Thirstymud Hydrating Treatment is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I also enjoy the experience of putting it on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it at night, 1-2 times per week, and so far so good.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product :)</li>
            <li> but it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It was the original product in the original packaging..</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and hasn&#x27;t ever irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a good product.</li>
            <li> The Glam Glow is cool and hydrating from the moment it touches your skin.  </li>
            <li> Pleased with the product but can&#x27;t notice any real difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> i really like the smell, which is a melange of honey and coconut, and the packaging is cute.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something more gentle but still hydrating, the First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Instant Oatmeal Mask is a great bet.  </li>
            <li> I really want to love this product</li>
            <li> I want to try the mud mask next which I also heard good things about.  </li>
            <li> and surprisingly it really worked and kept my skin very smooth the whole day and made it easy to apply foundation.</li>
            <li> Your face will be super hydrated.</li>
            <li> She wanted something super hydrating.</li>
            <li> Already use glam glow super mud, but will not use this again.</li>
            <li> my forehead n nose after a day was super oily</li>
            <li> I had a mild but distinct reaction.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a really good hydrating mask for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a amazing I highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> Maybe something to firm and add antioxidants would be great.</li>
            <li> It makes my foundation go on a lot more seamlessly.</li>
            <li> This is a product worth the price.</li>
            <li> but if it works, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> WORTH THE MONEY</li>
            <li> We got this from prime when the price was substantially less than full price, so was a good deal.  </li>
            <li> Got it on time, and the right product.</li>
            <li> I use it over night and it seems to absorb right away.</li>
            <li> Only used it once so far but smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I thought it was great, and then the next day my face broke out into red splotches EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> I had a friend tell me how much she liked all the glamglow products and especially this hydrating treatment.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely pricey, but I am willing to pay that price as I have yet to find something better!</li>
            <li> The smell and texture are different and the color is lighter than the authentic one, however I applied it on my face given the reputation of Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first if this product was authentic or not because of the low price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but this is just the best stuff on Earth.</li>
            <li> This is the third GLAMGLOW product I&#x27;ve tried and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> it is beautiful and compares favorably to other moisturizing products in the 30-40 dollar range for similar volume in terms of performance, but it isn&#x27;t a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> My skin looks clean and clear and glowing.</li>
            <li> but overall i enjoy the product and smell it has its worth the buy</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m positive they will soon disappear.  </li>
            <li> It does cost more than other masks, but for me it is worth it for the results.</li>
            <li> I would say my skin is more dehydrated than dry, however when I wear foundation</li>
            <li> I try using it three times or more a week because my skin gets so dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> you can really see,</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and you can feel the hydrating effects instantly.</li>
            <li> I recommended this one cause it really does moisture my face a litter bit.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much, using it every day for six months</li>
            <li> but if you really are looking for something to hydrate your skin - I would look elsewhere..</li>
            <li> It really doe make a difference.</li>
            <li> so much I wanted to buy it.  </li>
            <li> and this doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot for me.</li>
            <li> I think I will need to give it a bit longer to really see if it works or not.</li>
            <li> so I really need this.</li>
            <li> Really brightens and moisturizers the skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very pricey for the amount in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I do not notice much of a difference in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I do however really like the scent</li>
            <li> I am a flight attendant</li>
            <li> The scent was strong for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the white jar from Amazon(sold by a third party) last December thinking $40 is a really good deal.</li>
            <li> and I mean severe and this cream really hydrates my skin and gives it a glow like never before I love it!</li>
            <li> I am taking a medication that makes my skin extremely dry, this mask feels so good when my skin is especially dry.</li>
            <li> I did not find this to be super hydrating; and it is definitely overpriced.</li>
            <li> I read all the high ratings on Sephora and decided to buy it on Amazon for the cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard to describe but it smells amazing, and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> The topical products I use to keep my acne at bay exasperate the dryness, especially in the winter, so for me products that hydrate my skin aren&#x27;t just a nice to have, they&#x27;re crucial.  </li>
            <li> Granted, because of the topicals my skin is more sensitive than average.  </li>
            <li> and i have normal skin</li>
            <li> I should note that I have very sensitive skin with the normal T-zone oiliness.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling refreshed and cool, doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive dry skin...perfect for winter peeling and drying out.  </li>
            <li> It was not damaged and had a new seal.</li>
            <li> I probably will not buy this again, but it would not do you any harm to try this new product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> I live in the south west where there is no humidity</li>
            <li> THIS product.. Couldn&#x27;t live without it..</li>
            <li> for those with sensitivity to fragrance and products in general, know that I am super sensitive to WAY too many products (it&#x27;s always a tense moment when trying any new product).</li>
            <li> It will give u a very soft skin</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and thought this might help, but unfortunately - I do not find it very hydrating.  </li>
            <li> This has completely transformed my skin!</li>
            <li> My skin has NEVER been so soft!</li>
            <li> B0083S44LM First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Instant Oatmeal Mask-2 oz.]] since it&#x27;s both hydrating and soothing, but after a ringing endorsement of Thirstymud, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have always had super sensitive and dry skin and struggled with moisturizers that helped the dryness but didn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useful for the dry skin.</li>
            <li> The mask is so cooling and really adds much needed moisture for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Disappointing after all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never been this clear and moisturized.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as a night cream, just applying it like lotion and going to bed to wake up to velvety soft skin.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to fragrances Do Not Buy this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these for my wife and they arrived in early October 2014.</li>
            <li> The treatment leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated all day, even in the drier winter climate.</li>
            <li> has completely eliminated that problem.</li>
            <li> It is entirely up to you and how much hydration you feel that you need.</li>
            <li> After washing it off my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> i am keeping this one in the refrigerator in an attempt to head off early spoilage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really transports me to the spa facial experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the long list of ingredients, it could very well have the same hydrating stuff that is in Play-doh :) I will be definitely be adding a larger container on GlamGlow to my skincare shelf for future use.</li>
            <li> This product is essentially what I love for when I try to find a face cream/lotion, but am never able to find.</li>
            <li> but without foundation/powder, my skin is USUALLY silky smooth.</li>
            <li> one thing worth noting about it is that it does make my skin tingle a little.  </li>
            <li> The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is that I use it a couple of times a week at night and lightly and after a few months I am almost out, seems not to last.</li>
            <li> It is apparently a mask, but I use it as a moisturizer once a day before bed.</li>
            <li> I apply a thin layerat bedtime every night and my skin is 110% better than before.</li>
            <li> Has the original plastic covering and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face baby soft and the usual dry patches have significantly shrunk</li>
            <li> Not a single zit.</li>
            <li> When I used up my old GlamGlow(bought from Sephora at regular price $69), I opened the one I bought from Amazon (third party sold but shipped from Amazon warehouse).</li>
            <li> She had recently had a peel, so it may have been that her skin was simply too sensitive and not the fault of the product.  </li>
            <li> my skin is not dry (but also not that hydrated as it says your skin should be).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit spendy but a little goes a long way and does a stellar job!</li>
            <li> is also a little different (The First Aid mask has an even creamier texture with flecks of oatmeal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I highly recommend it if you do a lot of flying which can be extremely drying.  </li>
            <li> It turned out to be the real deal, I compared it with a thirsty mud I had previously bought at sephora</li>
            <li> For context, I have acne prone skin that is also dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> To avoid this, I apply a layer of Atralin (a strong prescription retinoid), wait an hour, and then apply to thin layer of GlamGlow Thirtymud.</li>
            <li> Really good for my thirsty skin, the only drawback is the lotion is dark brown, weird.</li>
            <li> Hydrating Marine Moisture Mask - are both superior and less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Especially for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin especially in the winter and was hoping this would be the answer.  </li>
            <li> Put it on a little thick and use it as a treatment mask for 10 min and either wash it off for a clean feeling or wipe it off and leave a hydrating protective layer on the skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for long tern use, as nothing is ever permanent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would pay full price for this mask - it is simply too expensive.</li>
            <li> I just thought I would use it until it was gone and go back to my previous skin care regimen, but I can never go back!</li>
            <li> I use this every other night and alternate with tretinoid (retinol).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s oily, dry, combo, or whatever...</li>
            <li> put this product on anywhere I am feeling dry or after cleansing once a week and just let it set and marinate into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally dry skin and would have dryness and breakout problems when I traveled, both from the airplane as well as climate change, and using this</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and wanted something hydrating for my dry spots.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> I have severe dry skin</li>
            <li> My face has become dry and this product doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy with the price, because you can find a lot of similar products with much lower prices.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it overnight yet but 10-20 minutes (I usually opt for 20) makes my skin feel incredibly soft and supple and relieves me of the itchy feeling that often comes with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find any difference in hydration and in fact other products that are less expensive have better hydration.</li>
            <li> Likewise, if I get lazy and skip the GlamGlow, I can apply it the next day as a masque and my irritated skin is instantly</li>
            <li> If your skin is a little irritated, this treatment calms it almost instantly.</li>
            <li> (Thanks friend for hooking me on such an expensive face moisturizer)</li>
            <li> So expensive, but so worth it.</li>
            <li> but they give me a hydrated skin for a few hours only and because I&#x27;m Muslim</li>
            <li> The price seems to vary widely.  </li>
            <li> GlamGlow is a deep moisturizing treatment -- feels light, smells very faintly of coconut, and has done the job in alleviating some of the dry spots and tightness that I&#x27;ve been getting as a result of summer sun and harsh cleansers.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I received a small sample tube of this Hydrating Treatment and was instantly enamored with the results.</li>
            <li> I use it as a daily-every other day moisturizer after washing my face with my clairsonic, also a must have, rather than a mask and my skin is the softest and clearest that it has ever been.</li>
            <li> For 6 months I had a patch of eczema on my lower leg that refused to heal with any other treatment.</li>
            <li> Hard to describe how different your skin feels afterward - and the benefits continue as you work it into your routine.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> so not sure of long term results.</li>
            <li> When I dry off after the shower, I only have to use a very small amount of my usual moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> less than half the price is the aztec clay mask</li>
            <li> that a little seems to go a fairly long way, although i would have preferred it in a tube or other non-jar container since the contents do not seem to have a long shelf-life and would tend to be vulnerable to air exposure.  </li>
            <li> However, my skin didn&#x27;t look brighter but a little brown tone after using.</li>
            <li> It is all I expected to be !!!</li>
            <li> After using it a few times, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> The directions say to leave it on for a few minutes, or you can leave it on overnight and wash it off in the morning??</li>
            <li> Then a few seconds after applying, I noticed my skin felt like burning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few mud masks I can put on and leave on</li>
            <li> I ordered it and it arrived in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> product is one of the few that truly lives up to the hype!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to walk that line between hydrating and acne causing nightmare products.</li>
            <li> I have to wash my face five times a day for prayers which make it hard to keep my skin hydrated</li>
            <li> I have a very dry skin and tried a lot of expensive products to hydrate it</li>
            <li> Before sleep,i wear a thick cream to lock in the moisture.</li>
            <li> I have been putting on a thin layer before bed a few nights per week in place of my retinol to keep me from drying out</li>
            <li> glamglow is seriously overpriced.  </li>
            <li> I can have some problematic skin (dry but also, with some random acne because hey why not?!</li>
            <li> My skin once I hit 30 got really really confused.</li>
            <li> Just used a thin layer of product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I put on a thin layer at night and sleep with it in.  </li>
            <li> i just say put on a thin layer</li>
            <li> No need to worry that you are dropping some dough for false promises.</li>
            <li> It feels a little bit painful when using it</li>
            <li> Needless to say I never put it on my face.</li>
            <li> I got it as a gift, and when I realized how expensive it was</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> OBSESSED!</li>
            <li> So disappointed didn&#x27;t do anything fpr my skin.</li>
            <li> It was terrible for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have terrible psoriasis and a girlfriend of mine</li>
            <li> Had a terrible allergic reaction.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this hydrating cream!</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this product.  My skin felt great after.</li>
            <li> It was terrible for my skin. I broke out and my face peeled. Definitely not worth the money. I would never buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I love it.</li>
            <li> WOW AWESOME IT WORKS !!!!!</li>
            <li> It smells so good like coconut.Before sleep,i wear a thick cream to lock in the moisture.</li>
            <li> Got it on time, and the right product. It was not damaged and had a new seal. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how amazing this product is. I will try... My skin once I hit 30 got really really confused. It doesn&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s oily, dry, combo, or whatever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this product on anywhere I am feeling dry or after cleansing once a week and just let it set and marinate into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is much more balanced and the overall appearance is greatly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit spendy but a little goes a long way and does a stellar job!</li>
            <li> very good ! I will buy it in next time.</li>
            <li> I love this product and  It smells very good.</li>
            <li> 2nd jar and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> The product is good. But somewhere else is cheaper than Amazon.</li>
            <li> I read all the high ratings on Sephora and decided to buy it on Amazon for the cheaper price. Overall it is a good product. I use it as an overnight mask and the next morning my skin is not dry (but also not that hydrated as it says your skin should be). I looooove the smell and the texture of it also feels organic. I am not happy with the price, because you can find a lot of similar products with much lower prices. I probably will not buy this again, but it would not do you any harm to try this new product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve used it as a night cream, just applying it like lotion and going to bed to wake up to velvety soft skin. I&#x27;ve ised it as a mask as well, also hydrating that way as well. It has a pleasant smell almost like banana Cr&amp;egrave;me maybe? I&#x27;m not sure, it&#x27;s hard to describe but it smells amazing, and not overpowering. This is a great product for anyone dealing with dryness. I can have some problematic skin (dry but also, with some random acne because hey why not?! Ugh) and this didn&#x27;t cause me to break out, which is a huge plus. It&#x27;s hard to walk that line between hydrating and acne causing nightmare products.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to fragrances Do Not Buy this product. I did a patch test on the crease of my elbow with a tiny amount, about the size of the zero on your phone keypad. The scent was strong for a long time. I had a mild but distinct reaction. My nose clogged, ears itched, headache and then the spot on my arm began to itch. Needless to say I never put it on my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the hype. I bought it used it once.... Maybe I need to use it more? I have more oily skin I loved the glam glow mud mask but a great mud mask which is like less than half the price is the aztec clay mask omg does wonders!</li>
            <li> amazing price. amazing product</li>
            <li> My skin becomes so smooth after using, but I don&#x27;t like the smell -- like plasticine.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these for my wife and they arrived in early October 2014. She uses it once a week.  She loves this and claims it works.</li>
            <li> great stuff. works well.</li>
            <li> So expensive, but so worth it. I love this product. This product is essentially what I love for when I try to find a face cream/lotion, but am never able to find. I would say my skin is more dehydrated than dry, however when I wear foundation you can really see, but without foundation/powder, my skin is USUALLY silky smooth. I really enjoy putting this on before foundation and let it set for about 10 minutes. It makes my foundation go on a lot more seamlessly. Unlike any oil, lotion or cream I have every tried. Which is why I bought it. I have used this overnight and when I woke up my skin felt amazing. I can&#x27;t speak for long tern use, as nothing is ever permanent. But when I do use this, I notice a difference in the way my skin looks at feels. It is extremely pricey, but I am willing to pay that price as I have yet to find something better!</li>
            <li> OBSESSED! This product is amazing, so glad I found it for a cheaper price than what it is in Sephora for 65 ^ $$. This product is perfect for dry skin, its so hydrating and makes my skin feel smooth and clean. A little goes a long way. I try using it three times or more a week because my skin gets so dry in the winter. Overall it&#x27;s a amazing I highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> I received a small sample tube of this Hydrating Treatment and was instantly enamored with the results. The gel does look a bit muddy in color, though not gritty in texture. It goes on smoothly and you can feel the hydrating effects instantly. Surprisingly, it doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy at all. I put it on a while before showering in the morning and rinse it off in the shower. When I dry off after the shower, I only have to use a very small amount of my usual moisturizing cream. The treatment leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated all day, even in the drier winter climate. The fragrance is interesting - it smells a bit minty at first, then I get a whiff of something like Play-Doh ! With the long list of ingredients, it could very well have the same hydrating stuff that is in Play-doh :) I will be definitely be adding a larger container on GlamGlow to my skincare shelf for future use.</li>
            <li> the best beauty  product</li>
            <li> Love this stuff....my skin feels so good</li>
            <li> Very sticky, but the smell is good. Won&#x27;t buy it if there&#x27;s no deal tho.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this</li>
            <li> It will give u a very soft skin</li>
            <li> I was looking for a really good hydrating mask for my dry skin. This received really great reviews, and was reasonable so I decided to try it out. After using it a few times, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. So, I decided to use it for another month to give it more time--but my skin still does not feel any better than before. I also don&#x27;t care for the scent, and I don&#x27;t understand if this is supposed to be a mask for a night cream. The directions say to leave it on for a few minutes, or you can leave it on overnight and wash it off in the morning??</li>
            <li> I love the smelling of this product! I recommended this one cause it really does moisture my face a litter bit.</li>
            <li> I use prescription retinoids for anti-aging purposes. Even though I have used them since my twenties, I still can overindulge ... and the results tend to be red, irritated, peeling skin. To avoid this, I apply a layer of Atralin (a strong prescription retinoid), wait an hour, and then apply to thin layer of GlamGlow Thirtymud. I sleep with this on. (It can be used either as a masque or as an overnight super-moisturizer). It tends to prevent any adverse effects of the Atralin. Likewise, if I get lazy and skip the GlamGlow, I can apply it the next day as a masque and my irritated skin is instantly happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to layer a moisturizer and then an oil over a retinoid ... this product seems to allow me to skip that last step. For me, that &amp;#34;time-saver&amp;#34; means a great deal. My beauty/health routine is already demanding (what we won&#x27;t do to stave off lines and wrinkles!), so anything that lightens the process is always welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for those with sensitivity to fragrance and products in general, know that I am super sensitive to WAY too many products (it&#x27;s always a tense moment when trying any new product). Still, I had no adverse skin reaction to this (whatsoever). Likewise, the fragrance is a unisex and did not bother me at all (it&#x27;s actually really appealing to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is one of the few that truly lives up to the hype! Buy it with confidence!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!! Best moisturizer out there!</li>
            <li> This has completely transformed my skin! I got it as a gift, and when I realized how expensive it was I just thought I would use it until it was gone and go back to my previous skin care regimen, but I can never go back! (Thanks friend for hooking me on such an expensive face moisturizer) but it is worth every penny! I have naturally dry skin and would have dryness and breakout problems when I traveled, both from the airplane as well as climate change, and using this has completely eliminated that problem. I use it as a daily-every other day moisturizer after washing my face with my clairsonic, also a must have, rather than a mask and my skin is the softest and clearest that it has ever been. If your skin is on the oily side I would recommend to use once a week rather than every day. It smells amazing and hasn&#x27;t ever irritated my sensitive skin. You don&#x27;t need much, using it every day for six months I&#x27;m just starting to run low. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and thought this might help, but unfortunately - I do not find it very hydrating.  It smells great and it feels nice on the skin - it is sort of cooling, so if you just want a nice mask to relax you.. it would work well for that purpose.. but if you really are looking for something to hydrate your skin - I would look elsewhere.. Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin Recovery Hydrating Treatment Mask and H2O+ Hydrating Marine Moisture Mask - are both superior and less expensive.  glamglow is seriously overpriced.  I do not mind paying more if a product does what it claims, but this did not.</li>
            <li> Great as a mask but better as an overnight treatment.</li>
            <li> BUY FROM A REGULAR STORE!!! I bought this and the white jar from Amazon(sold by a third party) last December thinking $40 is a really good deal. When I used up my old GlamGlow(bought from Sephora at regular price $69), I opened the one I bought from Amazon (third party sold but shipped from Amazon warehouse). The smell and texture are different and the color is lighter than the authentic one, however I applied it on my face given the reputation of Amazon. Then a few seconds after applying, I noticed my skin felt like burning. Lessen learned, dont buy from a third party even though it&#x27;s shipped from Amazon warehouse.</li>
            <li> The GlamGlow Thirstymud Hydrating Treatment is really awesome.  I have combination skin and wanted something hydrating for my dry spots. This product smells so good too, like coconut and vanilla. The performance is outstanding. You apply this product all over your face and then you leave it on for about ten minutes or you can leave it on overnight. It is entirely up to you and how much hydration you feel that you need. After washing it off my skin feels so soft. I also have sensitive skin and experienced no irritation, redness, or breakouts from this product.</li>
            <li> Use this when you need that extra glow. It really doe make a difference. I use it as a lotion from time to time and apply my makeup over it. Seems to enhance color and maintain moisture longer.</li>
            <li> Very good in moisturizing</li>
            <li> GOOD,it is  a very good hydrating sleeping mask smell good, after using it I feel my face is smooth at next morning,</li>
            <li> Works great for my combination skin. Great Price and Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in my Ipsy bag and I like it so much I wanted to buy it.  It&#x27;s so $$ that it took a while for me to bite the bullet, but I&#x27;m glad I did.  My skin looks clean and clear and glowing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype. I have extremely dry skin and this doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot for me.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of 4 different Glam products, this one and Bright Eyes became MUST HAVES!!  The Glam Glow is cool and hydrating from the moment it touches your skin.  I travel a lot and now use it every flight to keep my skin hydrated.  I use it 2-3 nights per week as an overnight treatment and wash it off in the AM, followed by moisturizer.  Hard to describe how different your skin feels afterward - and the benefits continue as you work it into your routine.  I should note that I have very sensitive skin with the normal T-zone oiliness.</li>
            <li> If I could give it zero stars I would .. Glam glow products are NOT for people with acne this product did nothing but break me out and it left oil residue for hours</li>
            <li> I received it just now. I will give it to my girlfriend, let her try it! Hope it is what declared to be.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry skin and tried a lot of expensive products to hydrate it but they give me a hydrated skin for a few hours only and because I&#x27;m Muslim I have to wash my face five times a day for prayers which make it hard to keep my skin hydrated so I gave this product a shot and surprisingly it really worked and kept my skin very smooth the whole day and made it easy to apply foundation. This is my new favorite product :)</li>
            <li> Gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now people say I look GLAMorous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And my mom says my skin is GLOWing!</li>
            <li> I was worried at first if this product was authentic or not because of the low price but I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase. It turned out to be the real deal, I compared it with a thirsty mud I had previously bought at sephora and it had the same smell, consistency and results as the one I bought online. The mask has a delicious coconuty smell that reminds me of summer and a cooling and moisturizing feel when you apply it to your skin. I&#x27;m extremely happy I found a cheaper alternative for my favorite face masks!!!</li>
            <li> Feels great, nice and tingling! Product smells wonderful like coconut. The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is that I use it a couple of times a week at night and lightly and after a few months I am almost out, seems not to last.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, after reading a review by a fashion blogger that I follow.  GlamGlow is a deep moisturizing treatment -- feels light, smells very faintly of coconut, and has done the job in alleviating some of the dry spots and tightness that I&#x27;ve been getting as a result of summer sun and harsh cleansers.  It has the look and consistency of a dulce de leche sauce, but it absorbs into skin very nicely.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it at night, 1-2 times per week, and so far so good.</li>
            <li> This product rock!  I love how my skin feels after using it each time!</li>
            <li> Thank you I love this product and will purchase again</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> Great treatment. Your face will be super hydrated. But do not overdoit. Just used a thin layer of product.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure it is going to be a must for me!</li>
            <li> Pleased with the product but can&#x27;t notice any real difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> In love! Such a luxury!</li>
            <li> This is a product worth the price. I have severe dry skin and I mean severe and this cream really hydrates my skin and gives it a glow like never before I love it!</li>
            <li> My skin feels soo hydrated.  Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Only used it once so far but smells amazing! And left my skin feeling amazing!! Authentic product!!!!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t find this to be a holy grail item -- i like how moisturizing it is and that i can use it as an overnight mask, but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily kill wrinkles and the effect isn&#x27;t very lasting.  i really like the smell, which is a melange of honey and coconut, and the packaging is cute.  i do like that a little seems to go a fairly long way, although i would have preferred it in a tube or other non-jar container since the contents do not seem to have a long shelf-life and would tend to be vulnerable to air exposure.  i am keeping this one in the refrigerator in an attempt to head off early spoilage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at the price point offered on amazon (amazing), i would recommend giving it a try.  it is beautiful and compares favorably to other moisturizing products in the 30-40 dollar range for similar volume in terms of performance, but it isn&#x27;t a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> Not as good as others&#x27; reviews!</li>
            <li> This GlamGlow Thirstymud Hydrating Treatment is fantastic. I know it&#x27;s expensive but it works. No need to worry that you are dropping some dough for false promises. You can use it in different ways. Put it on a little thick and use it as a treatment mask for 10 min and either wash it off for a clean feeling or wipe it off and leave a hydrating protective layer on the skin. Or use it lightly as a sheer mask and go to sleep and wake up to extra hydration on your skin. If your skin is a little irritated, this treatment calms it almost instantly. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> My wife got this after a recommendation from her dermatologist.  She wanted something super hydrating. She says that it smells really good.  She tried to leave it on overnight as recommended by the manufacturer, but it burned her skin and she had to remove it.  She had recently had a peel, so it may have been that her skin was simply too sensitive and not the fault of the product.  She has used it several times since that incident, and only left it on for the recommended 10-20 minutes.  She is not sure that she saw any amazing results, but the mask felt good on, and her skin looks nice.  The price seems to vary widely.  We got this from prime when the price was substantially less than full price, so was a good deal.  I don&#x27;t think I would pay full price for this mask - it is simply too expensive.</li>
            <li> Another winner from these amazing company!!</li>
            <li> This is a very good hydrating sleeping mask, I feel my face is smooth at next morning, and cute sweet smell of this product, which I loved. However, my skin didn&#x27;t look brighter but a little brown tone after using. Somebody may like that, not me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still debating on this face mask.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times and don&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin.  My face has become dry and this product doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping.  I think I will need to give it a bit longer to really see if it works or not.</li>
            <li> I use this periodically as a mask...but I use it DAILY as my moisturizer!  Leaves skin feeling refreshed and cool, doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive dry skin...perfect for winter peeling and drying out.  100% my favorite moisturizer of all time!</li>
            <li> So disappointed didn&#x27;t do anything fpr my skin.</li>
            <li> This has helped my dryness. I live in the south west where there is no humidity so I really need this.</li>
            <li> It was really great!! Especially for dry skin. It feels a little bit painful when using it but when you wash your mask with water, it turns out great! Will buy it again next winter.</li>
            <li> I use this under my eyes each night, my eyes look bright each morning!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin glow. Love it.</li>
            <li> It smells like coconut! I love it</li>
            <li> I like it. I love glam glow products.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product. It is hands down the best moisturizer I have ever used. It is apparently a mask, but I use it as a moisturizer once a day before bed. I noticed results the NEXT MORNING. My skin does not look greasy and any redness has been reduced. I have been using it for about four days now and my skin looks better each morning. Not a single zit. I 100% recommend this gold</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but this is just the best stuff on Earth. I have terrible psoriasis and a girlfriend of mine that&#x27;s a makeup artist recommended it to me. My skin has NEVER been so soft!</li>
            <li> Was a bit hesitant to order a makeup product online but so glad I did. The mask is so cooling and really adds much needed moisture for my dry skin. Bit pricey.....but if it works, it&#x27;s worth it. Only used about a week or so.....so not sure of long term results.</li>
            <li> Love product! Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great, I love glam glow.</li>
            <li> My favorite of all the Glam Glows &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Plus: This product leaves my skin soft, not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Minus: not that great for the price.</li>
            <li> Works well to hydrate but I think my skin may need something more than just that. Maybe something to firm and add antioxidants would be great.</li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e been using this moisturizer for a couple months.  It is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  I put on a thin layer at night and sleep with it in.  It smells like the beach and feels amazing.  I&#x27;ve already ordered it again for a gift.</li>
            <li> I am taking a medication that makes my skin extremely dry, this mask feels so good when my skin is especially dry. I use it once a week and it helps a lot. It does feel somewhat tingly though so be sure not to touch your eyes with any residue on your fingers.</li>
            <li> I am beyond in love with this product. My skin looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I have always had super sensitive and dry skin and struggled with moisturizers that helped the dryness but didn&#x27;t clog my pores. I apply a thin layerat bedtime every night and my skin is 110% better than before.</li>
            <li> LOVEEEEE THIS product.. Couldn&#x27;t live without it.. It was the original product in the original packaging.. WORTH THE MONEY</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a mask so if you&#x27;re having issues with it and using it as such that is probably why. This is a fantastic cleanser.  It leaves my face baby soft and the usual dry patches have significantly shrunk and I&#x27;m positive they will soon disappear.  The scent is strong but I think it is pleasant and does not seem to bother my skin at this time.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Not only does it smell delicious, but it is so moisturizing. I had heard of it from a friend who raved about it and now I agree. I have been putting on a thin layer before bed a few nights per week in place of my retinol to keep me from drying out, I haven&#x27;t tried using it as a mask yet, but will soon.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Has the original plastic covering and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Had a terrible allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Really good for my thirsty skin, the only drawback is the lotion is dark brown, weird.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useful for the dry skin. The moisturize and the smell are very nice.</li>
            <li> Really brightens and moisturizers the skin. 4 stars Bc it&#x27;s very pricey for the amount in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I did not find this to be super hydrating; and it is definitely overpriced.</li>
            <li> This is the third GLAMGLOW product I&#x27;ve tried and I absolutely love it.  For context, I have acne prone skin that is also dry and sensitive.  The topical products I use to keep my acne at bay exasperate the dryness, especially in the winter, so for me products that hydrate my skin aren&#x27;t just a nice to have, they&#x27;re crucial.  To date, I&#x27;ve loved [[ASIN:B0083S44LM First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Instant Oatmeal Mask-2 oz.]] since it&#x27;s both hydrating and soothing, but after a ringing endorsement of Thirstymud, I decided to give it a try.  Truth be told, it&#x27;s a wonderful product.  I haven&#x27;t tried it overnight yet but 10-20 minutes (I usually opt for 20) makes my skin feel incredibly soft and supple and relieves me of the itchy feeling that often comes with dry skin.  I also enjoy the experience of putting it on.  The texture feels pleasant on my skin and the scent is amazing.  I love, love the sweet coconut scent.  It really transports me to the spa facial experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing worth noting about it is that it does make my skin tingle a little.  Granted, because of the topicals my skin is more sensitive than average.  If you&#x27;re looking for something more gentle but still hydrating, the First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Instant Oatmeal Mask is a great bet.  However it doesn&#x27;t smell quite as good as this mask and the texture is also a little different (The First Aid mask has an even creamier texture with flecks of oatmeal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love, love, love this mask.  It&#x27;s such a treat.  It does cost more than other masks, but for me it is worth it for the results.</li>
            <li> I thought it was great, and then the next day my face broke out into red splotches EVERYWHERE. Already use glam glow super mud, but will not use this again.</li>
            <li> Wow, so happy with this product.. I well be sticking to it!</li>
            <li> This make your skin look awesome I only use 2 or 3 times a week. Will order again</li>
            <li> I love Glam Glow Thirstymud! It&#x27;s one of the few mud masks I can put on and leave on and it hydrates my skin. My skin has never been this clear and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Hydrated my skin and made my skin feel softer in one use.</li>
            <li> Good product, except for its price the amount include is scarce.</li>
            <li> i love this brand a lot!!  very good!</li>
            <li> It is all I expected to be !!!</li>
            <li> Two notable effects on me: (1) I steam my face while using the mask and it significantly moisturizers AND minimizes my pores afterwards (due to the cooling effect). (2) For 6 months I had a patch of eczema on my lower leg that refused to heal with any other treatment. I put a bit of the mask on the spot and steamed it, it&#x27;s now beginning to heal after two days (once daily).</li>
            <li> I really want to love this product but I find it to be not as hydrating as I was expecting. I have really dry skin especially in the winter and was hoping this would be the answer.  I use it over night and it seems to absorb right away. I do not notice much of a difference in the morning.  I do however really like the scent and my skin does feel really nice immediately after the application.  It just does not seem to last.</li>
            <li> i love this mask def give great moisture i just say put on a thin layer cuz after awhile it gets oily and i have normal skin my forehead n nose after a day was super oily but overall i enjoy the product and smell it has its worth the buy</li>
            <li> I had a friend tell me how much she liked all the glamglow products and especially this hydrating treatment.  I ordered it and it arrived in just a few days.  I put some on my face and neck before I went to bed and was amazed at how my skin looked and felt when I woke up.  I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but this stuff is amazing.  I want to try the mud mask next which I also heard good things about.  I&#x27;m currently using a mud mask now that I&#x27;m not too fond of, but want to use it up before ordering this.  I use this every other night and alternate with tretinoid (retinol).</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the Aztec Indian Healing clay which I use for deep cleansing. The glamglow totally moisturizes my face for days!  I am a flight attendant so I highly recommend it if you do a lot of flying which can be extremely drying.  Great stuff and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Disappointing after all the great reviews.  I didn&#x27;t find any difference in hydration and in fact other products that are less expensive have better hydration.</li>
