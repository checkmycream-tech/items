            <li>This product  was OK but didn&#x27;t  work like it was said to do.</li>

            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I also love the scent..</li>
            <li>but it works even better with some sort of belly band because your body heat activates it</li>
            <li>I have ordered more where ever I can find them.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li>Be sure to anticipate the burning sensation.</li>
            <li>Smells good, it feels hot.</li>
            <li>the only reason I didn&#x27;t purchase more is because I didn&#x27;t remember the guy name I purchase it from ,and amazon didn&#x27;t have it ,but I&#x27;m happy I find I will buy another bottle today.</li>
            <li>Only good thing is you can feel it work the warm sensation does indeed burn fat.</li>
            <li>It Provo ly work quickly to us akin better...</li>
            <li>very pretty!</li>
            <li>I had HUGE arms</li>
            <li>Pretty glad I didnt have nothing special for the holidays</li>
            <li>this stuff really works gives off a great burn, also i have a lower back pain and it feels great on my back...</li>
            <li>It does help with you belly, specially if you put it on to work out.</li>
            <li>You must of not used it right!.</li>
            <li>, I feel like jumping in the snow to cool off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more, because the heating sensation can help me burn more calories on my problem areas when I work out.</li>
            <li>However, I do got to say there is a huge price difference between the one being sold here vs the one from the website indicated on the videos, about $21 to be exact.</li>
            <li>It feels so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I feel less stomach  :p</li>
            <li>right now becasue</li>
            <li>Received it right away!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>remember the first time I put it on it was so hot I was jumping around  to cool it off</li>
            <li>ONE time it was a real real rrreeeaallll hot day</li>
            <li>Hot is an understatement, this cream is Smokin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the authentic cream as I mentioned above.</li>
            <li>i will be ordering more in the future</li>
            <li>May by u need to be in sauna first...or after hot shower rub it on us stomatc immediately..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Today is my first day i took measurement and a before picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27; probably feels hot for about an hour then</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was working at first</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend especially with wearing my cincher.</li>
            <li>like i said i used it once so dont think it burn that much fat.</li>
            <li>and I really do hope it works for me like it has for others</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t workout as much as I should</li>
            <li>Once I start my work out , I sweat so much</li>
            <li>This cream really work</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t, it actually felt cool.</li>
            <li>I think it actually softens it better than my regular lotion!</li>
            <li>It smells different in the jar than when it is completely absorbed in the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just received this project and use it right away, after testing the product on my arm and thigh area above my knees.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell yet, but came earlier then expected, smells good &amp; doesn&#x27;t burn the skin</li>
            <li>I think this cream is ok to use a cream and makes you feel a little smaller</li>
            <li>This is something serious love this product</li>
            <li>theyve gone down so much!!</li>
            <li>it is hot but like the other products that I have I dont use regularly ;-/</li>

            <li> it is hot but like the other products that I have I dont use regularly ;-/</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because I still have cellulite, but I think it&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet.</li>
            <li> Used the whole jar and it didn&#x27;t even help me break a sweat what a waste of money and hope!</li>
            <li> But it does fell the same as the other one I had bought</li>
            <li> after I rub on I let dry and also sleep with work out belt and Nike work out tights...</li>
            <li> so i am including this lotion with my work out anad hopefully loose all this baby</li>
            <li> I did notice a slight change in my arms and mid section.</li>
            <li> It doesnt do what I expected it to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it actually does what it claims to do</li>
            <li> Gave me horrible rash, took like 3 showers to finally get it all off, made my skin very irritated also highly recommend if you do use it be careful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m consider myself in average frame, 5&#x27;2&amp;#34;, 118lbs but all my fat stores in my gut area.  </li>
            <li> and I took screen shots of both the cream on Amazon and on the website and noted there are slight differences on the packaging of both creams as Evelyn mentioned in the previous review.</li>
            <li> I will not consider purchasing this ever again though less harsher products out there.</li>
            <li> but after a half hour my skin started to heat up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll write another review after I&#x27;ve continued to try it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I will continue this cream everyday.  </li>
            <li> where you apply it inner thighs not a good idea!</li>
            <li> The first day it was burning badly but Im used to it now</li>
            <li> Now shown on the photos is the after math :-/</li>
            <li> I have to say the packaging is different not sure if this one is a fake...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I would order this product again</li>
            <li> Learned that the hard way.</li>
            <li> been using at least once every day two hours before going into the shower</li>
            <li> I need to lose at least 10 - 15 lbs from this flabby abs.</li>
            <li> My fiance forced me to take a shower</li>
            <li> but I also been drinking green tea!!</li>
            <li> This makes me a little skeptical about the authenticity of this cream.</li>
            <li> omg u will be shocked next morning...</li>
            <li> and you can definitely see what has happened to me :-(</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of the product is not attractive to me, either.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t work at least I won&#x27;t feel too bad because this cream is under $10.</li>
            <li> , maybe it&#x27;s just in my head that I think one of them could be a fake ( the price was way cheaper on here though)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this crap....</li>
            <li> talking about Makes you want to trow yourself in a cold pool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and after i was done the burning started.&lt;br /&gt;i will be using it again since the cold is here.</li>
            <li> Works and doesn&#x27;t burn bad</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t place a lot on my skin so the heat wasn&#x27;t as bad as some of the reviews say.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed these cream did not work as promised.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> ..........does not slim the waist as promised :(</li>
            <li> I woke up in the worst pain!!!</li>
            <li> It burns horribly, but I also use saran wrap to keep it on my skin.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It does help with you belly, specially if you put it on to work out. Good product.</li>
            <li> This product combined with exercise is a miracle, you can almost feel how your fat is melting. Put it on your skin better before working out.</li>
            <li> Works well. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> I received my order, used it (on all my legs/ thighs) the 1st night. After an hour of not feeling anything and going to bed I woke up in the worst pain!!! My inner things felt literally on fire! My fiance forced me to take a shower lol. I thought that was the end of it...a week later I started getting big rashes in between my legs. Now shown on the photos is the after math :-/ Smh!! I&#x27;m a mixed girl and you can definitely see what has happened to me :-(</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing I cant believe I bought something that actually works I thought people be all hype to get u to buy the product but this stuff set me on fire  and im takeing garcinia lean xtream im losing weing faster then I ever thought pissible</li>
            <li> Yea man it works, eat rite and excercise rite and yea u will tell the diff, hooooah!!</li>
            <li> I had bought one on eBay and I bought the second one on here... I have to say the packaging is different not sure if this one is a fake... But it does fell the same as the other one I had bought, maybe it&#x27;s just in my head that I think one of them could be a fake ( the price was way cheaper on here though)</li>
            <li> Does heat ya body up but didn&#x27;t use enough to know if it aids in melting the fat away</li>
            <li> Hot is an understatement, this cream is Smokin. It makes me sweat like nobody&#x27;s business, and the smell is nice too.  I did notice a slight change in my arms and mid section. To avoid burning my skin, I mix it with baby oil before applying it.</li>
            <li> This is Avery good product I will recommend my family to try it also and I also let my mom use it she love it  great job seller</li>
            <li> This product  was OK but didn&#x27;t  work like it was said to do.</li>
            <li> I have only had the product three days and it works great! The first day it was burning badly but Im used to it now and I can see result but I also been drinking green tea!! I would tell everybody to buy this product you can also put saran wrap on with it!! I love it!! I see results already!!</li>
            <li> You must of not used it right!. This is the most efective cream ive EVER used!!! I had HUGE arms nd theyve gone down so much!! Stomach ..hips ect...very effective!!!</li>
            <li> I purchase this product two years ago from a guy on eBay .I watch a video of how he use the cream on YouTube to lose weight .I remember the first time I put it on it was so hot I was jumping around  to cool it off lol.I put it on before I work out ,and I did see a big difference on my stomach the only reason I didn&#x27;t purchase more is because I didn&#x27;t remember the guy name I purchase it from ,and amazon didn&#x27;t have it ,but I&#x27;m happy I find I will buy another bottle today.I had paid $35 for it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought this cream yet therefore I cannot comment or rate on whether this cream is affective or not. But, what I would like to comment on and point out is that I googled this cream and found a couple of videos on YouTube regarding this cream. I went to the website that was mentioned in the videos of where you can buy this product and I took screen shots of both the cream on Amazon and on the website and noted there are slight differences on the packaging of both creams as Evelyn mentioned in the previous review. This makes me a little skeptical about the authenticity of this cream. However, I do got to say there is a huge price difference between the one being sold here vs the one from the website indicated on the videos, about $21 to be exact. With that said I think I&#x27;ll give this one a shot, and hope it works and it&#x27;s not a scam. If it doesn&#x27;t work at least I won&#x27;t feel too bad because this cream is under $10. Wish me luck! I&#x27;ll post my results review, once I get the cream and start using it. :)    **Update***  Extremely disappointed these cream did not work as promised. I used it as directed but did not see any results whatsoever! I don&#x27;t think this is the authentic cream as I mentioned above. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It does burn like hell but it makes you sweat the same! while burning the fat i love it!!  :D</li>
            <li> OMG this product BURNS!!&lt;br /&gt;im talking about Makes you want to trow yourself in a cold pool.&lt;br /&gt;i used it ONE time it was a real real rrreeeaallll hot day and i used im guessing alot and i was about to die.&lt;br /&gt;i finished taking a shower and rubbed it all over my body and face and after i was done the burning started.&lt;br /&gt;i will be using it again since the cold is here. YAY. but i do recommend it. its great.&lt;br /&gt;if you want to feel fire on your body try this. like i said i used it once so dont think it burn that much fat. ha. but i will be using it after thanksgiving. :)</li>
            <li> I received my cream today and put it on along with my waist cincher. I can feel the heat from it so I&#x27;m for sure this will help with my workouts! It doest 🔥 burn like a lot of the comments read bit i can deal with how it feels which is a plus to me. I strongly recommend especially with wearing my cincher. Also using it on my inner thighs too.</li>
            <li> Yes, it works. I put it on the desired area, it burns and makes me sweat a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found though that I can&#x27;t wear clothe after putting it on. I workout at home so it&#x27;s not a big deal, if you workout at a gym you&#x27;ll have to figure it out.</li>
            <li> I have been rubbing this on my belly for 3 or 4 weeks it have not done anything for me</li>
            <li> I think this cream is ok to use a cream and makes you feel a little smaller but I dont see any difference my thighs. I&#x27;m not sure if I would order this product again</li>
            <li> It makes you sweat.  I use it to do my body wraps.  I like it a lot.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Do not recommend this! Gave me horrible rash, took like 3 showers to finally get it all off, made my skin very irritated also highly recommend if you do use it be careful where you apply it inner thighs not a good idea! It spreads everywhere you touch or your cloths rub against. Learned that the hard way. Only good thing is you can feel it work the warm sensation does indeed burn fat. I will not consider purchasing this ever again though less harsher products out there. Maybe just try applying it under a waist band so you can&#x27;t accidently spread it anywhere.</li>
            <li> i like the heat effect, how this actually burn the fat...i can&#x27;t say i know that one. maybe if it was ingested then that would probably work.</li>
            <li> It doesnt do what I expected it to</li>
            <li> this stuff burns!!! it did make me sweat, but only when i wrapped with saran wrap .. helped me sweat but the burn is unbareable</li>
            <li> this stuff really works gives off a great burn, also i have a lower back pain and it feels great on my back... i will be ordering more in the future</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything. I feel a burning sensation that just itches, and it doesn&#x27;t come off in the shower. Have I lost weight? nooo! I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 months.</li>
            <li> Smells good, it feels hot.</li>
            <li> Works and doesn&#x27;t burn bad</li>
            <li> Used the whole jar and it didn&#x27;t even help me break a sweat what a waste of money and hope!</li>
            <li> May by u need to be in sauna first...or after hot shower rub it on us stomatc immediately.. It Provo ly work quickly to us akin better...⏰</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell yet, but came earlier then expected, smells good &amp; doesn&#x27;t burn the skin</li>
            <li> I gave it a one for right now becasue I ordered it Dec 13th and it saying I wont get it until January 13 or 15 ...Pretty glad I didnt have nothing special for the holidays...I can&#x27;t wait to use it and I really do hope it works for me like it has for others nothing doesn&#x27;t ever work for me</li>
            <li> So i just ordered thsi product. Received it right away!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is my first day i took measurement and a before picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work out so i am including this lotion with my work out anad hopefully loose all this baby fat!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will come back and let you all know how this product worked!! wish me luck</li>
            <li> I sweat and feel a burn but there is no change been using at least once every day two hours before going into the shower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just received this project and use it right away, after testing the product on my arm and thigh area above my knees. I waited for over an hour for it to heat up but it didn&#x27;t, it actually felt cool. I went to the gym, took a shower and decided to use it again, this time trying it on my stomach area then putting on my waist trimmer belt. Within 5 to 10 minutes after that I started feeling the cream heat up, the heat felt like it was penetrating the layers of fat on my stomach. It&#x27; probably feels hot for about an hour then has a tingling warming feel afterwards. I didn&#x27;t place a lot on my skin so the heat wasn&#x27;t as bad as some of the reviews say. I&#x27;ll write another review after I&#x27;ve continued to try it for a few weeks. I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more, because the heating sensation can help me burn more calories on my problem areas when I work out.</li>
            <li> Love it it&#x27;s the only cream that works</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because I still have cellulite, but I think it&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet. I&#x27;m about to order my second jar.  I definitely notice a difference in the texture of my skin! It feels so soft and smooth! I also love the scent..very pretty! I think by the end of my second jar, I will definitely see a difference.  Oh yeah, I love the way it burns too!!!!</li>
            <li> This cream so  wonderful it smells nice but it works even better with some sort of belly band because your body heat activates it I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 2 months and i dont see any improvement...I&#x27;m consider myself in average frame, 5&#x27;2&amp;#34;, 118lbs but all my fat stores in my gut area.  I need to lose at least 10 - 15 lbs from this flabby abs. :( I don&#x27;t workout as much as I should but I try to atleast walk 30 - 60 mins/day.  I don&#x27;t eat junk/fast food but I do have a flab belly..ugh.  I&#x27;ll continue my quest to look for a perfect cream to help with my goal.</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome.  I have literally lost 4 lbs in 2 weeks and this without changing anything.  I also read that it was good for the face, so I tried it and OMG....my breakouts disappeared.  It also helped my pores close.  I have ordered more where ever I can find them.  I will continue this cream everyday.  It&#x27;s cheaper than using the one from GNC.</li>
            <li> This product works yes burns but my baby tummy I&#x27;ve had for 6 yrs is now gone...after I rub on I let dry and also sleep with work out belt and Nike work out tights...omg u will be shocked next morning...I doubted it at first..but not now..</li>
            <li> It burns horribly, but I also use saran wrap to keep it on my skin. Once I start my work out , I sweat so much, I feel like jumping in the snow to cool off. Love it!</li>
            <li> This cream really work I see the different  I feel less stomach  :p</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it actually does what it claims to do but it definitely heats up! My arms do appear to be slimmer but I haven&#x27;t actually measured so I can&#x27;t be sure. Be sure to anticipate the burning sensation. I didn&#x27;t think it was working at first but after a half hour my skin started to heat up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the product is not attractive to me, either. My son likened it to petrol-like smell. It smells different in the jar than when it is completely absorbed in the skin. It might just be the way my body chemistry reacts to the product, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely softens your skin. I think it actually softens it better than my regular lotion!</li>
            <li> This is something serious love this product</li>
            <li> it is hot but like the other products that I have I dont use regularly ;-/</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this crap....burns and that&#x27;s all it does. ..........does not slim the waist as promised :(</li>
            <li> Did not heat up my skin and saw no results but it smells good.</li>
