            <li>I love this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>the licorice/fennel taste is wonderful and all the ingredients, being ayurvedic, are totally pure.</li>
            <li>but once I tried it, it was amazing</li>
            <li>Surprisingly effective.</li>
            <li>Just as effective as Sensodyne.</li>
            <li>but when I couldn&#x27;t I was thrilled to find that Amazon carried it.</li>
            <li>toothpaste also liked to stick in places.</li>
            <li>I love Ayurveda and this is good stuff.</li>
            <li>I really liked it a lot</li>
            <li>So I ended up really stocking up by buying this pack of four, however, it&#x27;s a quality product that I&#x27;m very happy with.</li>
            <li>This is a nice mild toothpaste with great flavor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update May 7, 2012:&lt;br /&gt;Herbodent toothpaste by Dr. Jaikaran (not sold on amazon but sold online) is also a great ayurvedic toothpaste with neem but has a more strong mediciny taste/feel than auromere.  </li>

            <li>At first I thought the taste would put me off, but this toothpaste is great.  </li>
            <li>It is very good for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>My dentist is pleased with the results too :-)</li>
            <li>So, some people may be able to handle SLS more than others can.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for years.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to like Licorice to be OK with it.</li>
            <li>So glad I switched from a fluoride toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste but of course I love the flavor of licorice.</li>
            <li>I really love this one.  </li>
            <li>I have a toddler and when he&#x27;s able to brush his teeth on his own, years from now, I&#x27;ll feel comfortable with him using this.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Was given a sample tube of this many years ago, and have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li>Some are more licorice-y, some mintier.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>SURE know</li>
            <li>but when I added Trader Joe&#x27;s Myrrh propolis toothpaste, the spreading was better.  </li>
            <li>I only brush once a day and still get excellent results.  </li>
            <li>I only brush once a day and still get excellent results.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I helps my gums to be healthy ,not to bleed.</li>
            <li>otherwise it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 3 different brands and this is the best one.</li>
            <li>This tastes great and leaves my mouth clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean!  </li>
            <li>It does a good job keeping teeth clean and mouth fresh</li>
            <li>- it feels more like a cream smeared lightly in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Cleans well, rinses easily and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>My breath smells fresher and cleaner without needing a strong listerine mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My breath smells fresher and cleaner without needing a strong listerine mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Knowing that it&#x27;s made with such great ingredients is reassuring, as well.</li>
            <li>Its an added bonus that it ships for free too.  </li>
            <li>It is not SLS free but whats in the toothpaste is derived from Indian coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>The price on four pack is great, compared to what I can purchase locally.</li>
            <li>This works on my sensitive teeth WAY better than the commercially available products, tastes better, cleaner, and feels better putting in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Love how my teeth stays clean and fresh all day.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It does feel and taste clean.  </li>
            <li>This has made my teeth actually whiter and not to mention that it is literally better for you in y honest opinion.</li>
            <li>The old product was licorice...which I really liked.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good toothpaste to use occasionally to give your teeth a thorough polish</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with how clean my teeth have been staying using this product , which is further far more healthier than using something like Arm &amp; Hammer (1 of the few that I felt was effective in the cosmetic sense).</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth clean and mouth fresh breath</li>
            <li>Have been a loyal Tom&#x27;s user for a couple decades until trying this one.</li>
            <li>The Licorice taste is mild</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s made in India and not some mainstream greedy US corporate-infested corporation that has backwards reductionist non-holistic, greedy profit-driven USA thinking regarding dental health and whose main goal is to make the most profit by giving it to the mainstream at the cheapest price but which also results in them cheapening the ingredients by quality and quantity&lt;</li>
            <li>This toothpaste not only does not have them but does not need them and all their flavor taste amazing and makes your mouth feel fabulous.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>Auromere is my favorite brand of toothpaste, i have been using it for years and it makes my teeth feel smooth and clean like no other toothpaste, plus it feels much more natural than the super foamy minty stuff.</li>
            <li>What I like about this is that it&#x27;s all natural, has a great taste and my teeth feel cleaner than with regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Those with sensitive teeth will love it.</li>
            <li>It was good as I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li>and if anything my gums have become more sensitive.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>and it lacks the punch of my former favorite ayurvedic toothpaste, but it leaves my teeth feeling clean without the use of chemicals.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend the original stuff.</li>
            <li>I have capped teeth which have remained beautiful for 20 years in spite of the fact that I consume tea and coffee on a regular basis for these same years.</li>
            <li>teeth, gums, and tongue feel a lot better when using this product over some of the major tooth paste brands I have used.</li>
            <li>Especially the strong taste over all the mints available.</li>
            <li>I love the mild licorice flavor and it does a terrific job of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>, I wish they had stuck with the pure licorice flavor!</li>
            <li>But those were the only redeeming qualities for me.</li>
            <li>I feel like this toothpaste REALLY cleans and leaves my breath fresh.</li>
            <li>I have had stellar dentist visits for years since I have been using Auromere.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what was advertised.</li>
            <li>This is not the EXACT Auromere toothpaste I used - it was the one with cardamom and fennel.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>There is another flavor I prefer, but whichever flavor I get is better than standard brand toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Auromere is very easy on the mouth with absolutely no stinging, just a smoooooth mouthfeel when brushing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first natural toothpaste where I really have clean feeling teeth when I&#x27;m done brushing.</li>
            <li>Even though it is all natural, it does clean my teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still haven&#x27;t been able to wean myself off the regular foaming action of most toothpastes which makes me FEEL as if my mouth is all clean and alive</li>
            <li>I received the shipment very quickly... would definitely recommend both the toothpaste and the shipper!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The taste in kind of bland.</li>
            <li>I find that using only a half of a brush of either auromere or herbodent are great for my teeth along with the trader joe&#x27;s myrrh propolis toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I find that using only a half of a brush of either auromere or herbodent are great for my teeth along with the trader joe&#x27;s myrrh propolis toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this because I do like the way it works and at least it isn&#x27;t as strong a mint taste as most &amp;#34;commercial&amp;#34; toothpastes, but</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it works really well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really taste licorice</li>
            <li>I still really like this stuff</li>
            <li>I was going to return them and decided it was too much hassle.</li>
            <li>I feel this is much safer than fluoride toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>because when you rinse...it leave a very sticky residue in the sink which requires a sink cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li>Since I started using this toothpaste my gums are so much healthier.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like chemicals and it cleans my teeth really well.</li>
            <li>I first got the &amp;#34;fresh mint&amp;#34; a while ago, but wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of goopy and grey--like other truly natural toothpastes</li>
            <li>The licorice flavor is nice... not strong at all.</li>
            <li>It really works well to clean my teeth and feels as though the tartar is almost totally removed, even with one brushing.  </li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s different and will get a unique experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it has many other helpful healing Indian Ayurvedic herbs that help your mouth and body</li>
            <li>it holds its form better than other neem toothpastes without SLS like Himalaya</li>
            <li>this is not as good as other natural toothpaste I used to use, but it is better than other commercial ones.</li>
            <li>I was able to get it locally until recently</li>
            <li>This is a quality product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>neem is high on its ingredients list</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t go back to any other kind again</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra dimes.</li>
            <li>Other flavors are available if licorice/fennel is not a favorite but as for me, I also love the sublte taste it leaves in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Auromere is around for us health conscious folks!</li>
            <li>I have tried other natural products that don&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dissolve on your teeth like other natural toothpastes and has a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much either, so it lasts a long while.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that all ingredients in this toothpaste are natural, and also I like the taste and texture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to completely remove fluoride from my diet.</li>
            <li>No whitening at all is a far cry from the &amp;#34;Super tooth whitener&amp;#34; it claims to be in the description.</li>
            <li>so if you want all that \\&quot;foam\\&quot; or \\&quot;lather\\&quot; in your mouth (which it would have if it contained SLS), don&#x27;t expect it in this toothpaste - you can barely really tell it&#x27;s actually toothpaste</li>
            <li>B00016XAAU Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil and Neem Toothpaste Wintergreen -- 6.25 oz]] as the finishing toothpaste after I brush with auromere.&lt;br</li>
            <li>B00016XAAU Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil and Neem Toothpaste Wintergreen -- 6.25 oz]] with either one.  </li>
            <li>It contains traces of minerals vital to teeth, bones and connective</li>
            <li>It contains traces of minerals vital to teeth, bones and connective</li>
            <li>This gets rid of plaque &amp; stains with natural products.</li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this brand of toothpaste at my local Whole Foods, and it lasted such a long time.</li>
            <li>I still alternate with a national brand to get daily fluoride, but this concoction is ever so much nicer.</li>

            <li> I LOVE this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> SURE know</li>
            <li> but when I added Trader Joe&#x27;s Myrrh propolis toothpaste, the spreading was better.  </li>
            <li> I only brush once a day and still get excellent results.  </li>
            <li> I only brush once a day and still get excellent results.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I helps my gums to be healthy ,not to bleed.</li>
            <li> otherwise it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 different brands and this is the best one.</li>
            <li> This tastes great and leaves my mouth clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean!  </li>
            <li> It does a good job keeping teeth clean and mouth fresh</li>
            <li> - it feels more like a cream smeared lightly in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Cleans well, rinses easily and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> My breath smells fresher and cleaner without needing a strong listerine mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My breath smells fresher and cleaner without needing a strong listerine mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Knowing that it&#x27;s made with such great ingredients is reassuring, as well.</li>
            <li> Its an added bonus that it ships for free too.  </li>
            <li> It is not SLS free but whats in the toothpaste is derived from Indian coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> The price on four pack is great, compared to what I can purchase locally.</li>
            <li> This works on my sensitive teeth WAY better than the commercially available products, tastes better, cleaner, and feels better putting in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Love how my teeth stays clean and fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It does feel and taste clean.  </li>
            <li> This has made my teeth actually whiter and not to mention that it is literally better for you in y honest opinion.</li>
            <li> The old product was licorice...which I really liked.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good toothpaste to use occasionally to give your teeth a thorough polish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with how clean my teeth have been staying using this product , which is further far more healthier than using something like Arm &amp; Hammer (1 of the few that I felt was effective in the cosmetic sense).</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth clean and mouth fresh breath</li>
            <li> Have been a loyal Tom&#x27;s user for a couple decades until trying this one.</li>
            <li> The Licorice taste is mild</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s made in India and not some mainstream greedy US corporate-infested corporation that has backwards reductionist non-holistic, greedy profit-driven USA thinking regarding dental health and whose main goal is to make the most profit by giving it to the mainstream at the cheapest price but which also results in them cheapening the ingredients by quality and quantity&lt;</li>
            <li> This toothpaste not only does not have them but does not need them and all their flavor taste amazing and makes your mouth feel fabulous.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> Auromere is my favorite brand of toothpaste, i have been using it for years and it makes my teeth feel smooth and clean like no other toothpaste, plus it feels much more natural than the super foamy minty stuff.</li>
            <li> What I like about this is that it&#x27;s all natural, has a great taste and my teeth feel cleaner than with regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Those with sensitive teeth will love it.</li>
            <li> It was good as I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> and if anything my gums have become more sensitive.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> and it lacks the punch of my former favorite ayurvedic toothpaste, but it leaves my teeth feeling clean without the use of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend the original stuff.</li>
            <li> I have capped teeth which have remained beautiful for 20 years in spite of the fact that I consume tea and coffee on a regular basis for these same years.</li>
            <li> teeth, gums, and tongue feel a lot better when using this product over some of the major tooth paste brands I have used.</li>
            <li> Especially the strong taste over all the mints available.</li>
            <li> I love the mild licorice flavor and it does a terrific job of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> , I wish they had stuck with the pure licorice flavor!</li>
            <li> But those were the only redeeming qualities for me.</li>
            <li> I feel like this toothpaste REALLY cleans and leaves my breath fresh.</li>
            <li> I have had stellar dentist visits for years since I have been using Auromere.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what was advertised.</li>
            <li> This is not the EXACT Auromere toothpaste I used - it was the one with cardamom and fennel.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> There is another flavor I prefer, but whichever flavor I get is better than standard brand toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Auromere is very easy on the mouth with absolutely no stinging, just a smoooooth mouthfeel when brushing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first natural toothpaste where I really have clean feeling teeth when I&#x27;m done brushing.</li>
            <li> Even though it is all natural, it does clean my teeth very well.  </li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still haven&#x27;t been able to wean myself off the regular foaming action of most toothpastes which makes me FEEL as if my mouth is all clean and alive</li>
            <li> I received the shipment very quickly... would definitely recommend both the toothpaste and the shipper!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The taste in kind of bland.</li>
            <li> I find that using only a half of a brush of either auromere or herbodent are great for my teeth along with the trader joe&#x27;s myrrh propolis toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I find that using only a half of a brush of either auromere or herbodent are great for my teeth along with the trader joe&#x27;s myrrh propolis toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this because I do like the way it works and at least it isn&#x27;t as strong a mint taste as most &amp;#34;commercial&amp;#34; toothpastes, but</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it works really well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really taste licorice</li>
            <li> I still really like this stuff</li>
            <li> I was going to return them and decided it was too much hassle.</li>
            <li> I feel this is much safer than fluoride toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> because when you rinse...it leave a very sticky residue in the sink which requires a sink cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li> Since I started using this toothpaste my gums are so much healthier.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like chemicals and it cleans my teeth really well.</li>
            <li> I first got the &amp;#34;fresh mint&amp;#34; a while ago, but wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of goopy and grey--like other truly natural toothpastes</li>
            <li> The licorice flavor is nice... not strong at all.</li>
            <li> It really works well to clean my teeth and feels as though the tartar is almost totally removed, even with one brushing.  </li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s different and will get a unique experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it has many other helpful healing Indian Ayurvedic herbs that help your mouth and body</li>
            <li> it holds its form better than other neem toothpastes without SLS like Himalaya</li>
            <li> this is not as good as other natural toothpaste I used to use, but it is better than other commercial ones.</li>
            <li> I was able to get it locally until recently</li>
            <li> This is a quality product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> neem is high on its ingredients list</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t go back to any other kind again</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the extra dimes.</li>
            <li> Other flavors are available if licorice/fennel is not a favorite but as for me, I also love the sublte taste it leaves in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Auromere is around for us health conscious folks!</li>
            <li> I have tried other natural products that don&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dissolve on your teeth like other natural toothpastes and has a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much either, so it lasts a long while.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that all ingredients in this toothpaste are natural, and also I like the taste and texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to completely remove fluoride from my diet.</li>
            <li> No whitening at all is a far cry from the &amp;#34;Super tooth whitener&amp;#34; it claims to be in the description.</li>
            <li> so if you want all that \\&quot;foam\\&quot; or \\&quot;lather\\&quot; in your mouth (which it would have if it contained SLS), don&#x27;t expect it in this toothpaste - you can barely really tell it&#x27;s actually toothpaste</li>
            <li> B00016XAAU Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil and Neem Toothpaste Wintergreen -- 6.25 oz]] as the finishing toothpaste after I brush with auromere.&lt;br</li>
            <li> B00016XAAU Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil and Neem Toothpaste Wintergreen -- 6.25 oz]] with either one.  </li>
            <li> It contains traces of minerals vital to teeth, bones and connective</li>
            <li> It contains traces of minerals vital to teeth, bones and connective</li>
            <li> This gets rid of plaque &amp; stains with natural products.</li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this brand of toothpaste at my local Whole Foods, and it lasted such a long time.</li>
            <li> I still alternate with a national brand to get daily fluoride, but this concoction is ever so much nicer.</li>
            <li> The size of the toothpaste is small compared to other toothpastes, even compared to non-mainstream toothpastes, but considering all the benefits it gives, it&#x27;s worth the $$&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I alternate using it with regular floride toothpaste, or often one after the other.</li>
            <li> I thought that is what I was getting again, but, they have added a slight minty flavor as well which tastes odd and really destroys the flavor.  </li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to this toothpaste long ago.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s been that I&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
            <li> but I would still end up in the dentist&#x27;s chair getting cavities plugged up or having a root canal or having long teeth/gum cleanings.  </li>

            <li> If I do they last less than a day and never get very big.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine changing back to other toothpastes!</li>
            <li> I found a partial tube and tried it again.  </li>
            <li> I ALWAYS look for toothpastes with neem since neem is highly anti-bacterial and so prevents plaques and cavities and saves me from spending $$$&#x27;s and time and energy and stress going to the dentist which unfortunately has been a constant habit for me ever since childhood.  </li>

            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so the tube lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Other than that I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> , perhaps it is due to this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other neem toothpastes and some have SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) which is corrosive and causes canker sores</li>
            <li> unlike other neem toothpastes like Desert Essence and unlike mainstream USA toothpastes without neem, there&#x27;s no stinging/irritation in the mouth&lt;</li>

            <li> I only have one complaint:</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go back to the fake taste of big brands after using this.  </li>
            <li> You use less of this toothpaste then typical so it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> (When I got a spin-brush, I had to start using even less as it foams so well.)</li>

            <li> licorice taste takes a little getting used to like mouthing licorice candy but after a while, it grows on you.  </li>
            <li> Like another reviewer said, a little goes</li>
            <li> I heard that licorice helps to stop cold sores in their tracks, so I bought some licorice oil and it seemed to really help</li>
            <li> I got this toothpaste from a company that sends me natural products every month for $15 and this was included and I was a bit skeptical</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had cavities in the few years that I have been using it.</li>
            <li> It has been very difficult because I didn&#x27;t realize how much stuff has fluoride in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works</li>
            <li> but i am not satisfied as it did not whitens my teeth after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I ordered the liquorice flavored toothpaste which I think was giving me dry mouth.</li>

            <li> The problem I had with Auromere&#x27;s toothpaste was because it had no SLS, it was hard to spread it in all the corners of my mouth on every tooth</li>
            <li> In fact, if I am forced to use name-brand toothpaste (hotel, etc) the tooth pain returns within a day.  </li>

            <li> Store toothpaste tasted like chemicals and artificial flavoring compared to the Auromere.</li>
            <li> and I almost never get cold sores or canker sores now.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to artificial sweeteners and just about every toothpaste contains some form of them.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Surprisingly effective. Have been a loyal Tom&#x27;s user for a couple decades until trying this one. Mouth feels cleaner. Gums are healthier. My dentist is pleased with the results too :-)</li>
            <li> There is no mention on this page that there is Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) inside this toothpaste. I didn&#x27;t realize there was SLS inside until after brushing my teeth and then looking at the ingredients. It&#x27;s my fault that I trusted the description from the Amazon page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a racy heart, hyperactive, and then passed out in a sleep for 11 hours. However, my husband got NO side effects at all. So, some people may be able to handle SLS more than others can. It all depends on the individual&#x27;s current physicalities, current medications/supplements and genetic make-up. Everyone&#x27;s different and will get a unique experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it again the next day. Same problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste? The taste was great and my teeth felt nice afterward as well. But those were the only redeeming qualities for me. One star as SLS should not be in toothpaste, skin, or any hair products. But that&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love licorice and I love this organic toothpaste!  I received the shipment very quickly... would definitely recommend both the toothpaste and the shipper!</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste ever! I first got the &amp;#34;fresh mint&amp;#34; a while ago, but wanted to try something new. I feel like this toothpaste REALLY cleans and leaves my breath fresh. You don&#x27;t need very much either, so it lasts a long while. Knowing that it&#x27;s made with such great ingredients is reassuring, as well. There are a lot of junk toothpastes out there with harmful ingredients. Glad Auromere is around for us health conscious folks!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that all ingredients in this toothpaste are natural, and also I like the taste and texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  been ordering this toothpaste for a couple years now,love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Hope they will never change the formula or stop making it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for years. It is very good for sensitive teeth. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  You can&#x27;t go back to the fake taste of big brands after using this.  Also, no fluoride, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> What I like about this is that it&#x27;s all natural, has a great taste and my teeth feel cleaner than with regular toothpaste. Though I was a little dissappointed in that it doesn&#x27;t seem to whiten my teeth. Other than that I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Been using about three years. Go to the dentist twice a year. Teeth are still healthy and have no cavities!</li>
            <li> You use less of this toothpaste then typical so it lasts longer. I saw whiter teeth in a couple of weeks. Those with sensitive teeth will love it. I&#x27;m not sure how it works but my teeth are not sensitive to hot or cold after using it. Just as effective as Sensodyne. The Licorice taste is mild so you don&#x27;t have to like Licorice to be OK with it. This is a quality product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this toothpaste.  So glad I switched from a fluoride toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this is probably the best herbal toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.  My teeth feel so clean!  I used to pay $6.50 for just one at WF.  To pay a little over $18 for a pack of 4?  Thats such a relief for me.  Its an added bonus that it ships for free too.  Id like to see a multi flavor pack but no biggie.  It is not SLS free but whats in the toothpaste is derived from Indian coconut oil.  Definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> This is a nice mild toothpaste with great flavor.  Even though it is all natural, it does clean my teeth very well.  I have tried other natural products that don&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> It was good as I expected it to be.  Especially the strong taste over all the mints available.</li>
            <li> The best toothpaste in regards to taste and cleaning.  I have had stellar dentist visits for years since I have been using Auromere.  A little goes a long way and good price.</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth clean and mouth fresh breath but i am not satisfied as it did not whitens my teeth after 2 weeks of use. No results noted</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and my dental appointments are always very good.  I have capped teeth which have remained beautiful for 20 years in spite of the fact that I consume tea and coffee on a regular basis for these same years.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste but of course I love the flavor of licorice. It doesn&#x27;t ruin your taste buds like mint flavors do. It does a good job keeping teeth clean and mouth fresh</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve been using it for years.  does what toothpaste is supposed to do and with none of the wrong ingredients.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste ever.</li>
            <li> I really love this one.  After getting this one in a monthly beauty box (eco -emi)  I didn&#x27;t want to be without it.  Love how my teeth stays clean and fresh all day. I love the Licorice flavor and benefits too!</li>
            <li> No Sodium Lauryl Sulfate so it leaves the mouth happier and healthier. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what was advertised.</li>
            <li> Love love love! My favorite toothpaste and what a bargain!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of goopy and grey--like other truly natural toothpastes and it lacks the punch of my former favorite ayurvedic toothpaste, but it leaves my teeth feeling clean without the use of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I had &amp;#34;ghost&amp;#34; pain after a root canal.  My dentist, in frustration, suggested just switching toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve always used non-fluoride, but the switch paid off immediately.  In fact, if I am forced to use name-brand toothpaste (hotel, etc) the tooth pain returns within a day.  Plus, I&#x27;m a licorice fan.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste ever!!!! Wouldn&#x27;t go back to any other kind again I&#x27;m hooked on this my mouth health has exceeded expectations for me on this toothpaste!!!!  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Auromere is my favorite brand of toothpaste, i have been using it for years and it makes my teeth feel smooth and clean like no other toothpaste, plus it feels much more natural than the super foamy minty stuff. My teeth are also very white, people always comment on that, perhaps it is due to this toothpaste. I like the foam it gets and though the texture is different than standard toothpastes, i prefer it. A little goes a long way so the tube lasts a while. I can&#x27;t imagine changing back to other toothpastes!</li>
            <li> At first I thought the taste would put me off, but this toothpaste is great.  I am used to the taste and it&#x27;s not unpleasant.  It does feel and taste clean.  My teeth do seem whiter after using it too.  I will keep ordering as I run out since this seems so much safer than all the other toothpastes out there with weird ingredients.  I have a toddler and when he&#x27;s able to brush his teeth on his own, years from now, I&#x27;ll feel comfortable with him using this.</li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to this toothpaste long ago.  I found a partial tube and tried it again.  It really works well to clean my teeth and feels as though the tartar is almost totally removed, even with one brushing.  It foams a lot which I suppose helps get between teeth (?).  The reason I gave only four stars is the flavor.  The old product was licorice...which I really liked.  I thought that is what I was getting again, but, they have added a slight minty flavor as well which tastes odd and really destroys the flavor.  I will continue to use this because I do like the way it works and at least it isn&#x27;t as strong a mint taste as most &amp;#34;commercial&amp;#34; toothpastes, but, I wish they had stuck with the pure licorice flavor!</li>
            <li> I have used this for several months and I had a very good checkup at the Dentist.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested this! I love it. My grandson (2yrs) also likes flavor. After two tubes I get complements, and asked for my dentist name. The price on four pack is great, compared to what I can purchase locally.</li>
            <li> Was given a sample tube of this many years ago, and have been using it ever since. Taste is wonderful, cleans well. And actually cheaper than the usual brands, since a very little bit goes a very long way. (When I got a spin-brush, I had to start using even less as it foams so well.) I still alternate with a national brand to get daily fluoride, but this concoction is ever so much nicer.</li>
            <li> The best toothpaste ever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with how clean my teeth have been staying using this product , which is further far more healthier than using something like Arm &amp; Hammer (1 of the few that I felt was effective in the cosmetic sense).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s been that I&#x27;ve used this product. I was able to get it locally until recently but when I couldn&#x27;t I was thrilled to find that Amazon carried it. the licorice/fennel taste is wonderful and all the ingredients, being ayurvedic, are totally pure. Cleans well, rinses easily and leaves no residue. Other flavors are available if licorice/fennel is not a favorite but as for me, I also love the sublte taste it leaves in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it works really well. I don&#x27;t really taste licorice but you can smell it. It doesn&#x27;t dissolve on your teeth like other natural toothpastes and has a clean feeling. I only have one complaint: fruit flies are attracted to it. (Believe it or not, when I leave the cap off, here comes the flies.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Otherwise, really great stuff!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years - great toothpaste and dentist says my teeth have a great sheen to them.</li>
            <li> very good and pleasant tasting.  Also has whitening power...will use it again and again.</li>
            <li> Exceptional toothpaste! After trying it recently I will never again use anything else. Store toothpaste tasted like chemicals and artificial flavoring compared to the Auromere. I encourage anyone who may be hesitant to try this to go ahead, you wont be disappointed! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for over 3 yrs-great toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to completely remove fluoride from my diet. It has been very difficult because I didn&#x27;t realize how much stuff has fluoride in it. This has brought me one step closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste in kind of bland. I hate licorice, so that&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth, gums, and tongue feel a lot better when using this product over some of the major tooth paste brands I have used.</li>
            <li> This tastes great and leaves my mouth clean and fresh.  I will buy this again and like that it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/6/14 follow up:  I still really like this stuff but I&#x27;m finding that every tube tastes slightly different.  I just bought a 4-pack and tasted every tube - all slightly different.  Some are more licorice-y, some mintier. I was going to return them and decided it was too much hassle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this best natural toothpaste for years. I believe that it is actually great for gum health. I alternate using it with regular floride toothpaste, or often one after the other. I absolutely recommend the original stuff. There is no better product for mouth health, and I never want to be without it!</li>
            <li> Fluoride can be toxic and throw off our immune system.  I feel this is much safer than fluoride toothpaste.  I find the taste pleasant, too.  All I use is a pea-sized amount on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I used it every day for over a year and saw no sign of whitening whatsoever. No whitening at all is a far cry from the &amp;#34;Super tooth whitener&amp;#34; it claims to be in the description. For that, it gets 1 star.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothpaste.  I ALWAYS look for toothpastes with neem since neem is highly anti-bacterial and so prevents plaques and cavities and saves me from spending $$$&#x27;s and time and energy and stress going to the dentist which unfortunately has been a constant habit for me ever since childhood.  I have serious dental problems with cavities, root canals, and gum disease but not when I use toothpastes with neem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other neem toothpastes and some have SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) which is corrosive and causes canker sores and so I was looking for one without SLS.  This is not the EXACT Auromere toothpaste I used - it was the one with cardamom and fennel.[[ASIN:B000L425PI Herbal Toothpaste Cardamon-Fennel 4.16 Ounces]]  This licorice version without cardamom and fennel seems to have SLS.  I like Auromere because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  it has no SLS&lt;br /&gt;2.  neem is high on its ingredients list&lt;br /&gt;3.  it has many other helpful healing Indian Ayurvedic herbs that help your mouth and body&lt;br /&gt;4.  it holds its form better than other neem toothpastes without SLS like Himalaya&lt;br /&gt;5. unlike other neem toothpastes like Desert Essence and unlike mainstream USA toothpastes without neem, there&#x27;s no stinging/irritation in the mouth&lt;br /&gt;6.  it&#x27;s made in India and not some mainstream greedy US corporate-infested corporation that has backwards reductionist non-holistic, greedy profit-driven USA thinking regarding dental health and whose main goal is to make the most profit by giving it to the mainstream at the cheapest price but which also results in them cheapening the ingredients by quality and quantity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its licorice taste takes a little getting used to like mouthing licorice candy but after a while, it grows on you.  Auromere is very easy on the mouth with absolutely no stinging, just a smoooooth mouthfeel when brushing.  As another reviewer said, it does NOT foam up like other toothpastes so if you want all that \\&quot;foam\\&quot; or \\&quot;lather\\&quot; in your mouth (which it would have if it contained SLS), don&#x27;t expect it in this toothpaste - you can barely really tell it&#x27;s actually toothpaste - it feels more like a cream smeared lightly in your mouth.  I have felt NO pain nor sensitivity in my teeth or gums since using this toothpaste and my gums have never bled.  Hard to believe that there&#x27;s a toothpaste without any pain or irritation while brushing.  The size of the toothpaste is small compared to other toothpastes, even compared to non-mainstream toothpastes, but considering all the benefits it gives, it&#x27;s worth the $$&#x27;s.  Like another reviewer said, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still haven&#x27;t been able to wean myself off the regular foaming action of most toothpastes which makes me FEEL as if my mouth is all clean and alive and so I still use tea tree oil, neem-containing  [[ASIN:B00016XAAU Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil and Neem Toothpaste Wintergreen -- 6.25 oz]] as the finishing toothpaste after I brush with auromere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve been using the non-SLS [[ASIN:B000L425PI Herbal Toothpaste Cardamon-Fennel 4.16 Ounces]] AT THE SAME TIME ON EVERY TOOTHBRUSHING with [[ASIN:B004GYM90A Trader Joe&#x27;s Antiplaque Toothpaste with Fennel, Propolis &amp; Myrrh]] for over a month to increase my anti-cavity/anti-plaque/gum healing protection and I&#x27;ve got to say that my mouth has never tasted/felt fresher and cleaner and I FOR SURE know I don&#x27;t need to go to any dentist (no gum bleeding, no pain in my gums/teeth) and the toothpastes together are not as abrasive as when I use [[ASIN:B00016XAAU Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil and Neem Toothpaste Wintergreen -- 6.25 oz]] with either one.  The problem I had with Auromere&#x27;s toothpaste was because it had no SLS, it was hard to spread it in all the corners of my mouth on every tooth but when I added Trader Joe&#x27;s Myrrh propolis toothpaste, the spreading was better.  So in the 2 combinations of toothpaste, everytime I brush my teeth, I know my teeth and gums are protectedby:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-neem (which helps prevent plaque with antimicrobial properties which can treat periodontal disease and reverse gingivitis)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-and other healing herbs from the non-SLS [[ASIN:B000L425PI Herbal Toothpaste Cardamon-Fennel 4.16 Ounces]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and from the [[ASIN:B004GYM90A Trader Joe&#x27;s Antiplaque Toothpaste with Fennel, Propolis &amp; Myrrh]]:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-myrrh (which helps fight infection of mouth and gums. Has a stimulating effect on the gums)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-and propolis which is a sticky substance gathered by bees from the leaf buds of trees and plastered over hives for strength which is also an antibiotic and antiseptic that helps fight infections of the throat and mouth and speeds healing of gums. It contains traces of minerals vital to teeth, bones and connective tissues.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update May 7, 2012:&lt;br /&gt;Herbodent toothpaste by Dr. Jaikaran (not sold on amazon but sold online) is also a great ayurvedic toothpaste with neem but has a more strong mediciny taste/feel than auromere.  I find that using only a half of a brush of either auromere or herbodent are great for my teeth along with the trader joe&#x27;s myrrh propolis toothpaste.  I only brush once a day and still get excellent results.  My teeth have been complimented by friends as being VERY white and they&#x27;ve asked me what toothpaste I use!!  My breath smells fresher and cleaner without needing a strong listerine mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I would brush constantly with the mainstream toothpastes and even would switch to  sensodyne by my dentist but I would still end up in the dentist&#x27;s chair getting cavities plugged up or having a root canal or having long teeth/gum cleanings.  Now that I use these ayurvedic toothpastes, any pain in my teeth from bacteria have been eliminated, especially using the herbodent toothpaste.  I have less colds and less severe colds than I did before I used these toothpastes.by:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-neem (which helps prevent plaque with antimicrobial properties which can treat periodontal disease and reverse gingivitis)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-and other healing herbs from the non-SLS [[ASIN:B000L425PI Herbal Toothpaste Cardamon-Fennel 4.16 Ounces]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and from the [[ASIN:B004GYM90A Trader Joe&#x27;s Antiplaque Toothpaste with Fennel, Propolis &amp; Myrrh]]:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-myrrh (which helps fight infection of mouth and gums.

            <li> I love this product. There is another flavor I prefer, but whichever flavor I get is better than standard brand toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I got this toothpaste from a company that sends me natural products every month for $15 and this was included and I was a bit skeptical but once I tried it, it was amazing how well it cleaned my teeth compared to a leading brand that I used for years. This has made my teeth actually whiter and not to mention that it is literally better for you in y honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other toothpaste. This gets rid of plaque &amp; stains with natural products.</li>
            <li> I heard that licorice helps to stop cold sores in their tracks, so I bought some licorice oil and it seemed to really help, I decided to step it up and get a daily toothpaste to maybe stop them before they start and I almost never get cold sores or canker sores now. If I do they last less than a day and never get very big. I don&#x27;t know what I will do if they ever discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  I love the mild licorice flavor and it does a terrific job of cleaning my teeth.  And, it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients.  It&#x27;s great all the way around!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I ordered the liquorice flavored toothpaste which I think was giving me dry mouth. So I discontinued use.&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste also liked to stick in places. It&#x27;s good toothpaste to use occasionally to give your teeth a thorough polish but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it after every meal.&lt;br /&gt; </li>
            <li> this is not as good as other natural toothpaste I used to use, but it is better than other commercial ones.</li>
            <li> I helps my gums to be healthy ,not to bleed.</li>
            <li> the taste gets some getting used to. my eldest daughter even likes it.&lt;br /&gt;why did i give it 3 stars? because when you rinse...it leave a very sticky residue in the sink which requires a sink cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;also it becomes crusty and sticky at the opening. otherwise it&#x27;s ok. i haven&#x27;t noticed my teeth being whiter as some reviews have mentioned that....and if anything my gums have become more sensitive. i prefer marvis toothpaste over this...worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love it. A friend of mine recommended it to me</li>
            <li> Since I started using this toothpaste my gums are so much healthier. Worth every penny</li>
            <li> Excellent Fluoride Free Toothpaste, and we&#x27;ve tried many.  This is the only toothpaste we will use anymore.  Great product, Great Taste and FLUORIDE FREE!  Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> I love Ayurveda and this is good stuff. This works on my sensitive teeth WAY better than the commercially available products, tastes better, cleaner, and feels better putting in my mouth. It&#x27;s worth the extra dimes.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste ever!</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  It is all I use.  I haven&#x27;t had cavities in the few years that I have been using it.</li>
            <li> I first bought this brand of toothpaste at my local Whole Foods, and it lasted such a long time. I really liked it a lot but WF didn&#x27;t have it when I went to repurchase. So I ended up really stocking up by buying this pack of four, however, it&#x27;s a quality product that I&#x27;m very happy with. The licorice flavor is nice... not strong at all.</li>
            <li> This product is great!</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t feel like chemicals and it cleans my teeth really well.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has the best taste that lasts and is so refreshing! I&#x27;ve tried 3 different brands and this is the best one.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste in the world!!! Amazon has also the best price !! I am allergic to artificial sweeteners and just about every toothpaste contains some form of them. This toothpaste not only does not have them but does not need them and all their flavor taste amazing and makes your mouth feel fabulous.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste!  It&#x27;s the first natural toothpaste where I really have clean feeling teeth when I&#x27;m done brushing.</li>
