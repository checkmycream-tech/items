            <li>Excellent for my dry skin and great smell.</li>
            <li>but DOVE is the best soap on the market as far as I am concerned --- this seller here lived up to promises to deliver -- came wrapped well --- delivered as promised</li>
            <li>this well make smell good in the morning  and give that fresh burst</li>

            <li>My favorite for my face is the Velvet.</li>
            <li>but it seems like none of the stores keep these any more.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find the DOVE PEACHIE SOAP ----</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>this girl said that i Smelled very Fresh and Nice.</li>
            <li>Dove soap is great and this scent is my favorite so far, I will buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li>You feel fresh, clean and the pleasant scent makes you feel divine.</li>
            <li>Love the light scent of this one also.</li>
            <li>Dove really makes good products.</li>
            <li>I just love the clean smell of this soap.  </li>
            <li>but not to strong im</li>
            <li>However, I like the cool cucumber better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean, on the sweet side but not over the top.  </li>
            <li>I love the fruity fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It works great and has a slight fragrance that we both love.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and leaves your skin softly scented and smooth!!</li>
            <li>and I was delighted to find this particular PEACHY SOAP -- which is indeed rare at such a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to all You Made My Day.....</li>
            <li>and I always come out clean.</li>
            <li>someone noted the color was ORANGE -- this wears off, but the smell of this soap I love - so fresh and for peachy skins who are sensitive - which I have --- this is a fine soap.....</li>
            <li>First of all, this Dove bath bar does indeed burst with freshness, like the wrapper says!</li>
            <li>The Dove Go fresh bar</li>
            <li>No reason to doubt it so far and the price for this 8 pack was proportionately more than the 6 pack at walmart.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find the soap onine and could hardly wait until it arrived.  </li>
            <li>so i switched to dove and iv&#x27;e used most of the different bar soaps.</li>
            <li>You feel like the cross between a fruit salad and some sort of exotic tropical smoothie - without being cloying.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After finding one bar of the Dove Nectarine/White Ginger from probably five years ago, I opened and used it and find that now I like it well enough to buy more.  </li>
            <li>And to Dove&#x27;s stellar reputation for being moisturizing, it&#x27;s on point as it&#x27;s always been.  </li>
            <li>(although I still use it because I like smelling like a girl ;-) )</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Nectarine and White Ginger\\&quot; is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>It went fast because everyone was using it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon and their \\&quot;subscribe and save\\</li>
            <li>haha :  </li>
            <li>So i really do like it and keeps my skin moisturized .</li>
            <li>It is gentle, nondrying like all Dove soaps that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>So we did not feel that we spent more on this.</li>
            <li>I really like dove up here</li>
            <li>The gentle skin cleanser is a plus also.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance and don&#x27;t buy any other cleansing bar anywhere.  </li>
            <li>The soap did not have that wonderful aroma and even had an unpleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>Big fan of Dove soap... washes away very cleanly and seems to moisturized - not left with that dry/tight feeling in your skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy and use this because most of the mens care soap is to harsh on my skin</li>
            <li>It is difficult to find a hydrating soap from a good brand like Dove, so I bought this online since amazon seemed like the only place where it was still available.</li>
            <li>If you live in an area that has Shoppers Drug Marts, buy the Balea version of this.</li>
            <li>where I live</li>
            <li>All of a sudden, I had trouble finding my favorite soap in the whole world.  </li>
            <li>Now on to the Second part my Brother used this soap and was complaining how it really irritated his skin</li>
            <li>hes got Sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Dove also has a bar Called Sensitive Soap you might want to look into it</li>
            <li>I really prefer Irish Spring</li>
            <li>--- yes they can have my Sensitive sking Dove and my cheaper brands I use from time to time for hands -- BUT NO WAY WILL I PART WITH MY PEACHY SOAP......</li>
            <li>it is real dry and in the summer its hot but</li>
            <li>Also, I think this product does not have as much moisturizer as the basic white bar.</li>
            <li>It leaves such a soft feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li>I much prefer soap and even though Dove is not really soap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s half the price and literally the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>I have been unable to find this particular scent in the local grocery stores and was fortunate to find it on Amazon.</li>

            <li> After buying both, I refuse to go back to expensive body washes.</li>
            <li> I like this product by dove since it is one of the very few hydrating soaps that you can find out there</li>
            <li> I hate regular soap, and have converted a family member or two!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for body washes as they feel cold and slimy to me when applying to skin, brush or washcloth.  </li>
            <li> SO CAN&#x27;T SAY ANYTHING BAD.</li>
            <li> If this is for those who are accustomed to Dove products, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I bought after reading the reviews but found the smell awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I smelt so good that I did not want to get out of the bath. It went fast because everyone was using it. Thanks</li>
            <li> This is a subscription purchase for me.  I hate regular soap, and have converted a family member or two!  Love the fragrance and don&#x27;t buy any other cleansing bar anywhere.  Great deal.</li>
            <li> All of a sudden, I had trouble finding my favorite soap in the whole world.  I have used Dove soap all my 51 years.  The \\&quot;Nectarine and White Ginger\\&quot; is my absolute favorite.  I realized it wasn&#x27;t Dove that discontinued it, it was the stores in my area.  Thanks to Amazon and their \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot;, I get an eight pack delivered to my door on a regular basis, and save $$. How great is that?</li>
            <li> As expected.  Happy to have had the opportunity to get it again.</li>
            <li> The Dove Go fresh bar is great. I&#x27;m a guy and use this because most of the mens care soap is to harsh on my skin so i switched to dove and iv&#x27;e used most of the different bar soaps. When i saw this i was i said to my self this well make smell good in the morning  and give that fresh burst so i bought. To my surprise it was fantastic it smelled very nice but not to strong im my 1st period class this girl said that i Smelled very Fresh and Nice. Hint the Name of the soap haha :  So i really do like it and keeps my skin moisturized . Now on to the Second part my Brother used this soap and was complaining how it really irritated his skin hes got Sensitive skin so i just wanted to bring that up. So if you have sensitive skin i suggest you go to CVS and buy a 1 Bar Soap and test it so you dont buy it in Bulk and have it wasted. Dove also has a bar Called Sensitive Soap you might want to look into it</li>
            <li> First of all, this Dove bath bar does indeed burst with freshness, like the wrapper says! You feel just enveloped in delicious scents (nectarine/white ginger) and 1/4 hydrating lotion. You feel like the cross between a fruit salad and some sort of exotic tropical smoothie - without being cloying. It lifts your senses and makes you feel happy. Something I couldn&#x27;t even expect in a soap. Who needs aromatherapy, when you can just take a shower or simply lather up with this luscious creation?</li>
            <li> Big fan of Dove soap... washes away very cleanly and seems to moisturized - not left with that dry/tight feeling in your skin.  Love the light scent of this one also.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  Not available from stores anymore.  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love this scent!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> If you live in an area that has Shoppers Drug Marts, buy the Balea version of this. It&#x27;s half the price and literally the exact same thing. Smells the same, same ingredients, same bar shape, the only thing different is it reads Balea instead of Dove. After buying both, I refuse to go back to expensive body washes. Smells fantastic and leaves your skin softly scented and smooth!!</li>
            <li> I like all Dove soaps; this one smells great.  It is gentle, nondrying like all Dove soaps that I&#x27;ve used.  Price was good.</li>
            <li> I saw this at my mother in law&#x27;s home and decided to try it.  I am not available to find in anywhere else except for Amazon. The scent is delightful and leaves my skin softer than Lever 100.</li>
            <li> Mom loves this soap and we can no longer find it locally - so back to Amazon I go to order it. It works great and has a slight fragrance that we both love.</li>
            <li> Really amazing smell lasts after shower and leaves no residue on skin. bought it just to try it out and i will be buying more.</li>
            <li> love that they did an awesome job getting my order to me</li>
            <li> This is a very nice smelling soap and lathers well. However, I like the cool cucumber better. To me it has a better scent that lasts longer on the soap while it is in the dish. My favorite for my face is the Velvet. It leaves such a soft feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li> I LIKE DOVE SO CAN&#x27;T SAY ANYTHING BAD. BUT DON&#x27;T SEE WHERE THIS IS SO SPECTACULAR.&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S A LIE SMELL THAT DOESN&#x27;T STAY ON YOU. WELL FOR ME SOON AS THE SHOWER WAS OVER IT WAS OVER.</li>
            <li> I like this product by dove since it is one of the very few hydrating soaps that you can find out there and it has a good fragrance too. I used to buy a 6 pack from walmart but it seems like none of the stores keep these any more. It is difficult to find a hydrating soap from a good brand like Dove, so I bought this online since amazon seemed like the only place where it was still available. Will have to find another alternative soap once amazon runs out of it too. I have not used it yet, but it has all indications of being the soap that we have been using. No reason to doubt it so far and the price for this 8 pack was proportionately more than the 6 pack at walmart. So we did not feel that we spent more on this.</li>
            <li> I bought after reading the reviews but found the smell awful. Also, I think this product does not have as much moisturizer as the basic white bar.</li>
            <li> If this is for those who are accustomed to Dove products, you will not be disappointed. You feel fresh, clean and the pleasant scent makes you feel divine.</li>
            <li> This is the ONE Dove bar that I like the scent of.  I have an oily complexion but my body is not oily and I bought this to use in the shower for the winter.  I really prefer Irish Spring but I will use this as well.  I don&#x27;t care for body washes as they feel cold and slimy to me when applying to skin, brush or washcloth.  I much prefer soap and even though Dove is not really soap it does have some cleansing agents in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finding one bar of the Dove Nectarine/White Ginger from probably five years ago, I opened and used it and find that now I like it well enough to buy more.  I didn&#x27;t know if they still made it but they do.  I have been unable to find this particular scent in the local grocery stores and was fortunate to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely a beauty bar. The beautiful scent of nectar and ginger combined are just delightful. I can wait to use.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find the DOVE PEACHIE SOAP ---- someone noted the color was ORANGE -- this wears off, but the smell of this soap I love - so fresh and for peachy skins who are sensitive - which I have --- this is a fine soap.....The price on this was less than you would pay here...but DOVE is the best soap on the market as far as I am concerned --- this seller here lived up to promises to deliver -- came wrapped well --- delivered as promised ---- and I was delighted to find this particular PEACHY SOAP -- which is indeed rare at such a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to all You Made My Day.....by the way I keep ini my dresser drawers for my kids often say HEY MOM I AM ABOUT OF SOAP GOT ANY --- yes they can have my Sensitive sking Dove and my cheaper brands I use from time to time for hands -- BUT NO WAY WILL I PART WITH MY PEACHY SOAP......even for my always out of something kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Connie</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the smell of the soap and I was upset when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.  I was happy to find the soap onine and could hardly wait until it arrived.  When I opened it, I was very disappointed.  The soap did not have that wonderful aroma and even had an unpleasant smell.  I will not use it and probably just toss it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I really like dove up here where I live it is real dry and in the summer its hot but in the dry winters it is very hard on skin and it starts iching and burning well this body soap work just great I will use nothing else. it is a good deal for the money!</li>
            <li> Lots of moisturizing elements...very good soap! Dove really makes good products. Maybe it can bring two variants - one for summer and one for winter!</li>
            <li> Excellent for my dry skin and great smell. I stick with Dove and Tone as the two types which work best for me.</li>
            <li> This smells so good! Dove soap is great and this scent is my favorite so far, I will buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I thought these were a great price for the amount of soap.  I love the smell and I always come out clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dove for years but only recently started using this scent. I love the fruity fresh scent. The gentle skin cleanser is a plus also.</li>
            <li> I just love the clean smell of this soap.  It&#x27;s clean, on the sweet side but not over the top.  And to Dove&#x27;s stellar reputation for being moisturizing, it&#x27;s on point as it&#x27;s always been.  I&#x27;ve got very dry skin and don&#x27;t need lotion (although I still use it because I like smelling like a girl ;-) )</li>
            <li> Love the smell and skin feels great</li>
            <li> This soap smells great and leaves skin feeling nice. Just like all the Dove soap products. Very good. This will be a regular purchase.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great product</li>
