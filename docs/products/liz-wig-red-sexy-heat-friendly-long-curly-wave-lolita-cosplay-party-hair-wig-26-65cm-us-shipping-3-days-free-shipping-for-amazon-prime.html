            <li>Super cute!</li>
            <li>Plus it looks super cute with hair accessories.</li>
            <li>$10 made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Shiny and lightly wavy.</li>
            <li>and I like the heat friendly.......</li>
            <li>curls are a little more noticeable than in the picture, it has nice bouncy loose, flippy sort of curls (would make a great Ariel wig!)</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s a whole lot better than most of the $10-$20 wigs I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>Its a good medium red.</li>
            <li>Some people thought it was my real hair :)</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have a pretty good starting point for how this wig</li>
            <li>real looking wig  easy to care for .</li>
            <li>and they were either Ronald McDonald red or more of a mahogany color or even mulberry!</li>
            <li>most wigs are either much longer or much shorter than this one.</li>
            <li>I might even wear it for fun here and there.</li>
            <li>The length is just right too...</li>
            <li>Not TOO bright but also not too dark.</li>
            <li>I am an avid wig wearer and I bought this to blend with my own hair which is a red dye I get from Hot Topic</li>
            <li>But the wig arrived here rather quickly and packed wonderfully, not to mention it&#x27;s very nice quality!</li>
            <li>i absolutly love this red wig.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 4&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d honestly wear this wig out normally if I ever wanted to rock red hair again!</li>
            <li>There was plenty of hair to hide the band under and make it look extra authentic.</li>
            <li>I have bought numerous wigs on Amazon and eBay in the past couple months, and most of them are the nice and natural-looking kanekalon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and shiny, smooth and thick too!</li>
            <li>it feels so real and the color is like the picture.</li>
            <li>We bought this true red colored wig after having gotten it in light blue.  </li>
            <li>Looks so Natural and Real when worn!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Love this hair, every time I wear it I have to break into songs from &#x27;The Little Mermaid&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I also was able to brush the wig with no problem and little to no shedding.</li>
            <li>it hit just around the dead center of my back at it&#x27;s longest point, which is great because that&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finishing for Halloween and such and it is the perfect wig, it doesn&#x27;t even look fake!</li>
            <li>The hair is light and soft and the wig is full but not so much that it looks fake.</li>
            <li>look natural enough to pass (think of how hair models have that nice sleek shiny hair (especially in advertisements for those little bottles of stuff to make your hair shine)</li>
            <li>I got this for a halloween costume and was pleasantly surprised at the quality.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised.</li>
            <li>I myself, needed a straight wig and have never used heat tools on a wig before, but using the lower setting on my flat iron</li>
            <li>This wig however is just the right sort of dark, intense, natural looking red!</li>
            <li>The curls are soft and adds just enough volume.</li>
            <li>My 12 year old daughter was a blue girl cat for Halloween and a girl Reindeer for our Christmas Party.  </li>

            <li> Will definitely hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li> have to wait too long for shipping arrived as promised</li>
            <li> and it seems to be a harder length to find (especially in this color)</li>
            <li> I ordered this one (in red) for an Ariel costume and for $10 less I ordered a different pink wig for a Princess Bubblegum costume.</li>
            <li> admit I was a little scared because I had never ordered a wig from Amazon before (marketplace or otherwise) and had only used cosplay stores, wig stores, and eBay before.</li>
            <li> One thing I would warn buyers about is that the bang style shown isn&#x27;t quite what you&#x27;ll receive, and you might have to style them yourself, but that&#x27;s not much of a problem.</li>
            <li> These wigs come carefully packed.  </li>
            <li> I will probably order it in pink to replace the other cheaper pink wig that I bought and threw away after one wear.</li>
            <li> but thats due to my ignorance on wig care.</li>
            <li> The other wig was tangled and matted before I even wore it.  </li>
            <li> And am even considering some of the other colors as well.</li>
            <li> I needed an intense, dark red and had tried buying other wigs online (on places like eBay) before and was always disappointed when I got them in</li>
            <li> Not bright red</li>
            <li> Bangs were a little too bulky for my likes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having trouble styling the bangs</li>
            <li> Thick, heavy and not overly-shiny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly thick for the price.</li>
            <li> I usually wear my wigs as falls because I hate the bangs</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Not bad. Not bright red if that&#x27;s what you are looking for. Matches Color on pic. Bangs were a little too bulky for my likes but I just tamed them.down</li>
            <li> This wig is fantastic, a great price and perfect for cosplay. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Super cute! I love this wig. My favorite wig thusfar in 7 years of wig wearing.</li>
            <li> I wore this wig for a poison ivy costume... I got TONS of compliments. It&#x27;s really nice quality for the price. If I need another color, I would order this brand again.</li>
            <li> A surprisingly excellent wig for the price! I got this for a halloween costume and was pleasantly surprised at the quality. Will definitely hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great wig.. it feels so real and the color is like the picture. Shiny and lightly wavy. I might need to cut the bangs.</li>
            <li> nice quality for a cosplay wig&lt;br /&gt;color was same a picture&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t have to wait too long for shipping arrived as promised</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig literally about 3 days ago and received it this morning. I bought this for my Ariel cosplay I&#x27;m finishing for Halloween and such and it is the perfect wig, it doesn&#x27;t even look fake! It looks real!&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely so happy about this purchase. :)</li>
            <li> this product was REALLY good. it was exactly as said, it fits perfectly and is adjustable and no i dont work for amazon to write this review. i absolutly love this red wig. i got many complements on it. :) it was a vary good buy.</li>
            <li> I have bought numerous wigs on Amazon and eBay in the past couple months, and most of them are the nice and natural-looking kanekalon.  This is a beautiful and brilliant red, and the cap is really great quality.  But I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s a whole lot better than most of the $10-$20 wigs I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for a cosplay I&#x27;ve been wanting to do. I needed an intense, dark red and had tried buying other wigs online (on places like eBay) before and was always disappointed when I got them in and they were either Ronald McDonald red or more of a mahogany color or even mulberry! This wig however is just the right sort of dark, intense, natural looking red! It&#x27;s nice and shiny, smooth and thick too! It borders on almost being too shiny...but it stills look natural enough to pass (think of how hair models have that nice sleek shiny hair (especially in advertisements for those little bottles of stuff to make your hair shine) and you&#x27;ll have a pretty good starting point for how this wig looks.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls are a little more noticeable than in the picture, it has nice bouncy loose, flippy sort of curls (would make a great Ariel wig!) The length is just right too...on me (I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 4&amp;#34;) it hit just around the dead center of my back at it&#x27;s longest point, which is great because that&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and it seems to be a harder length to find (especially in this color) most wigs are either much longer or much shorter than this one. It&#x27;s also heat resistant which is wonderful if you plan on styling it or altering it any. I myself, needed a straight wig and have never used heat tools on a wig before, but using the lower setting on my flat iron I had it completely straight in just a few minutes and it still looks beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit I was a little scared because I had never ordered a wig from Amazon before (marketplace or otherwise) and had only used cosplay stores, wig stores, and eBay before. But the wig arrived here rather quickly and packed wonderfully, not to mention it&#x27;s very nice quality! I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and can&#x27;t wait till I finish the rest of my cosplay so I can show it off!</li>
            <li> The color and style is lovely, and the net fits perfectly snug. One thing I would warn buyers about is that the bang style shown isn&#x27;t quite what you&#x27;ll receive, and you might have to style them yourself, but that&#x27;s not much of a problem. Thick, heavy and not overly-shiny. Very excited to wear this on Halloween.</li>
            <li> PERFECT! Love this hair, every time I wear it I have to break into songs from &#x27;The Little Mermaid&#x27;. We are thinking of using it in making a movie!&lt;br /&gt;5+ STARS&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend this Product! Looks so Natural and Real when worn!</li>
            <li> Great wig, fits amazing. I was so surprised. Beautiful color!! I will definitely be coming back!! I&#x27;m wearing this wig to the Disneyland Halloween party and it is going to make a perfect Sally.</li>
            <li> I needed a Mary Jane wig for cosplay and this is perfect. Its very thick and full. The curls are soft and adds just enough volume. I&#x27;d honestly wear this wig out normally if I ever wanted to rock red hair again!</li>
            <li> Looks great! Nice wig for the price.</li>
            <li> Was the perfect shade of red for my purposes. Not TOO bright but also not too dark. Its a good medium red. I&#x27;m having trouble styling the bangs but thats due to my ignorance on wig care. What Im most happy about is the quality for the price. Plus it looks super cute with hair accessories.</li>
            <li> Was perfect for the Halloween costume I was using. Some people thought it was my real hair :) Used it the rest of the day even without the costume</li>
            <li> This was the perfect color that I was looking for. This wig is of very great quality, and I would easily recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I ordered two wigs for two different costumes. I ordered this one (in red) for an Ariel costume and for $10 less I ordered a different pink wig for a Princess Bubblegum costume. $10 made a huge difference. The other wig was tangled and matted before I even wore it.  This wig for the price is outstanding. I used it for a Disneyland Halloween night. I wore it for hours. I was outdoors and rode all the rides and was still able to run my fingers through. I also was able to brush the wig with no problem and little to no shedding. It&#x27;s surprisingly thick for the price. I might even wear it for fun here and there. Highly recommended. I will probably order it in pink to replace the other cheaper pink wig that I bought and threw away after one wear. And am even considering some of the other colors as well. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I am an avid wig wearer and I bought this to blend with my own hair which is a red dye I get from Hot Topic and it was brilliant. I usually wear my wigs as falls because I hate the bangs but I didn&#x27;t find this problem with this style. The hair is light and soft and the wig is full but not so much that it looks fake. I will be buying over and over, this product it perfect!</li>
            <li> love it ...real looking wig  easy to care for . Great foe costume... and I like the heat friendly.......</li>
            <li> We bought this true red colored wig after having gotten it in light blue.  These wigs come carefully packed.  They keep their curl, are comfortable and look great!  My 12 year old daughter was a blue girl cat for Halloween and a girl Reindeer for our Christmas Party.  Both times she wore headbands with ears and/or horns.  There was plenty of hair to hide the band under and make it look extra authentic.</li>
