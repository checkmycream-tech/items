            <li>LOVE this hair oil.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>My hair and I absolutely love this oil.</li>
            <li>i love this healing oil treatment.</li>
            <li>It appears to look and feel as though it&#x27;s authentic.</li>
            <li>I do however, prefer the scent of the Moroccan Oil much better than the macadamia healing oil treatment.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair product</li>
            <li>This large bottle is perfect and will definitely last longer.</li>
            <li>The only oil I want to use in my hair to give it a smooth finish, protection, and great shine without looking greasy.</li>
            <li>The trick to this is even and light distribution.</li>
            <li>This was such a great find.</li>
            <li>SIGNIFICANTLY</li>
            <li>I prefer it far more than the Moroccan oil line and its cheaper!</li>
            <li>Let hair dry normal is the best way to go.</li>
            <li>This treatment makes it feel nice, soft, and look shiny.  </li>
            <li>love this product and it was shipped fast</li>
            <li>I got the product quickly and it was as described.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this stuff, use it on skin, hair, mix in my body lotions...love the smell, hard to describe but a bit patchouli musk but light.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>have used Morrocan oil on my hair and just didn&#x27;t feel like it did very much.</li>
            <li>I love the larger size offered by this seller.</li>
            <li>Healing Oil Treament Unisex Treatment is exactly as the name implies...</li>
            <li>The scent is the first thing that got me hooked- tropical without being sunscreen or coconut-y.</li>
            <li>My hair is nice &amp; soft after using it and it seems to style much easier; I hold the curling iron in place for lesser time.  </li>
            <li>Then I tried mac oil, half the price and just as effective.</li>
            <li>but way to much money.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use to much or will make your hair oily.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly dominican hair</li>
            <li>it treats my male hail, tames it and ensures I have soft, healthy hair for my lady to run her hands through.  </li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance without the oily feeling that weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd bottle already and definitely will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended,</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for the line and was sorely dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday on the ends and the health of my hair has improved significantly!</li>
            <li>I wish I had gone to a local salon and smelt this product before purchasing such a huge bottle.  </li>
            <li>now my hair is soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>It makes it so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone&#x27;s hair is different and responds to products differently, this is worth trying.</li>
            <li>I liked the other scent of the other hair products from macadamia such as their hair mask, shampoo etc... but not this oil!  </li>
            <li>Be careful not to use too much or too often as it can make your hair oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, and since I only use it on the ends of my hair, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Not sure it is real or not ...</li>
            <li> I started using argon (moroccian) oil several years ago for dry hair &amp; scalp.</li>
            <li> l recently bleached my hair so it is extremely dry.  </li>

            <li> I used to buy the smaller size bottle, but I use it everyday</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> nice product. good quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now and it&#x27;s an outstanding product.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Morrocan oil on my hair and just didn&#x27;t feel like it did very much. My hair tends to be dry and Morrocan oil left my hair a little greasy looking.  Macadamia healing oil is been great.  It has a nice smell that&#x27;s not overpowering, helps my hair look great and leaves no oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s hair is different and responds to products differently, this is worth trying.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it, is perfect for my curls</li>
            <li> Great seller with great product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I hope they never quit making it. Do not use to much however, but just a few drops rubbed in your hand. Let hair dry normal is the best way to go. The trick to this is even and light distribution. The girl who cuts my hair at the salon says my hair is in great shape. You can even skip the conditioner and just dab on some of this.</li>
            <li> Best oil ever, only thing I use</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have damaged hair, yet my hair dresser suggested this product for routine maintenance to keep my hair healthy.  I absolutely love this treatment.

Will definitely be purchasing this again when I run out. I prefer it far more than the Moroccan oil line and its cheaper!</li>
            <li> Love this product. but way to much money. found a cheaper version from HSI. will be buying that one next.</li>
            <li> This product exactly what I wanted and is great but after each use there is always some leaking out ..</li>
            <li> smells great, love it</li>
            <li> I like this product and use it twice monthly.</li>
            <li> Smells so wonderful and Makes hair so soft.  Just don&#x27;t use to much or will make your hair oily.  Highly recommended,</li>

            <li> Healing Oil Treament Unisex Treatment is exactly as the name implies... it treats my male hail, tames it and ensures I have soft, healthy hair for my lady to run her hands through.  This is a phenominal product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;It works as described, and smells great.</li>
            <li> I got the product quickly and it was as described. Macadamia oil is the best oil I&#x27;ve tried and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I have very processed hair and like an oil that truly absorbs and does not look oily and this is the best one.  Highly recommended</li>

            <li> Made my usual shiny hair dull dull dull!!! I had high hopes for the line and was sorely dissapointed. Back to Biolage for me!</li>
            <li> l recently bleached my hair so it is extremely dry.  This treatment makes it feel nice, soft, and look shiny.  l am very pleased with it and plan to continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff, use it on skin, hair, mix in my body lotions...love the smell, hard to describe but a bit patchouli musk but light.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I use it as a facial moisturizer and a conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I used to buy the smaller size bottle, but I use it everyday so I ran out every couple months. This large bottle is perfect and will definitely last longer. Also, the seller is great. I received the item well before the due date. I will definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> My hair and I absolutely love this oil. It is moisterizing without being greasy. Well worth the price. Terrific and it works for me.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRICE,EXCELLENT PRODUCT :)</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance without the oily feeling that weighs down my hair. This is my 3rd bottle already and definitely will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Love it! And the customer service was great!</li>
            <li> i love this healing oil treatment. in fact i have the cream and i mix them together and it works really good. now my hair is soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Makes my bleached hair feel ten times nicer.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair everyday. I use it only on the tips to protect them. It also helps my hair grow.</li>
            <li> It appears to look and feel as though it&#x27;s authentic. Packaged well but my bottle was leaking.</li>
            <li> This was such a great find. I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 years. I buy it on Amazon now because it&#x27;s the cheapest place I can find it. I use two pumps everyday. I have short hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy in the least.</li>
            <li> This stuff does wonders to my hair. It makes it so soft and shiny. It&#x27;s not heavy, and since I only use it on the ends of my hair, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy. It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it. Also, it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I am not fond of the scent of this product.  I wish I had gone to a local salon and smelt this product before purchasing such a huge bottle.  I liked the other scent of the other hair products from macadamia such as their hair mask, shampoo etc... but not this oil!  In comparison to the Moroccan Oil, I believe that it works just as well.  I do however, prefer the scent of the Moroccan Oil much better than the macadamia healing oil treatment.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product</li>
            <li> The scent is the first thing that got me hooked- tropical without being sunscreen or coconut-y. The only oil I want to use in my hair to give it a smooth finish, protection, and great shine without looking greasy.
