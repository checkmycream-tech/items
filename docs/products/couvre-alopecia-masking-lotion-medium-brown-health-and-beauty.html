            <li>Works Perfectly!</li>
            <li>Best thinning hair product on the market</li>
            <li>Best of luck.</li>
            <li>LOL.  </li>
            <li>This is a incredible product and so so easy to use!</li>
            <li>Maybe all couvre is good for is the scalp part.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing I decided to do a test run with this product one evening when I was not going anywhere.</li>
            <li>I have been pretty happy with DermMatch for coloring my crown for bald spot and thickening my hair.  </li>
            <li>my hair dresser thought my hair look great and couldn&#x27;t figure what was going on when I first walked into the salon until I told her about Couve.  </li>
            <li>Been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it covered it OK, however, it didn&#x27;t stick to my scalp.  </li>
            <li>sort of ok..</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not one that I absolutely love, its a tricky issue to cover believably.</li>
            <li>Its even better as a cover for gray on the temples.</li>
            <li>sure...</li>
            <li>I think this is MUCH better than Toppik or Magic Hair because, with those, I was always worried about rain.</li>
            <li>Also, It doesn&#x27;t seem to come in many color options, so perhaps you won&#x27;t be able to find one that matches your hair.</li>
            <li>The medium brown doesn&#x27;t perfectly match my hair, but it&#x27;s close enough where you can&#x27;t tell.     </li>
            <li>I can darken them and comb over the spots and my hair looks so much better.</li>
            <li>I love it - it gives me peace of mind.</li>
            <li>As far as the product&#x27;s intended purpose, it didn&#x27;t look so great, but I imagine its appearance might improve as one got more practice applying it.  </li>
            <li>Plus it rubs of too easily.  </li>
            <li>Another great thing about this, compared to Toppik or Magic Hair, is that I don&#x27;t have the crusty feeling on the top of my head, like I get with those other fiber-like products.</li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff.  </li>
            <li>My pillow case took two cycles to get clean after an evening of wearing the colored creamy stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>make sure not to use to much and blend it into you scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>it is not bad</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually very surprised because so many of these products claim to work wonders and don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Noticed smell of product right away, checked ingredients, of course \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; was listed.</li>
            <li>Couvre is very easy to use and made such a difference in my appearance.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to apply and style with hair dryer and NOT LOOSE any volume to my hair...</li>
            <li>Trying to get exactly the right amount can be tricky and leave your scalp looking patchy.</li>
            <li>The medium brown is pretty dark, but the light brown is very light.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to cover up my thinning hair.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;any volume I suggest tying DermMatch first.</li>
            <li>, this works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the casual touch up in between hair coloring.  </li>
            <li>This product is an alive to people who are losing  hair every day, specially women-</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and stays until the next shampoo.</li>
            <li>The real surprise was</li>
            <li>For that, it works really well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so much</li>
            <li>Other than that, its one of the better ones on the market.</li>
            <li>Discreetly tones down the scalp color, thereby giving the appearance of having more hair.</li>
            <li>So....if you have fine hair and don&#x27;t want to loose</li>
            <li>I am able to use just a little at a time, rub it on with what looks like a makeup sponge, and not have to use Toppik like I used to when I wanted to take away the shine of my scalp.</li>
            <li>A learning curve how to apply but really looks natural.  </li>
            <li>messy and derma match covered much better</li>
            <li>After it drys I complete the look with keratin fibers to help the hair look fuller.</li>
            <li>I put this on right after I get out of the shower while my hair is still wet.  </li>
            <li>I apply Couvre in just a few minutes each morning starting from the top back and working forward blending with finger tips and using a cosmetic sponge to soften and blend.</li>
            <li>I tried the new formula only to</li>
            <li>Seemed kinda dumb, but I figured perhaps it was added to mask some less pleasant chemical ingredient odor.</li>

            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>

            <li> following up with you probably like they do the the 100&#x27;s of other products they push.  </li>
            <li> A little messy to use, but makes my hair look so much thicker</li>
            <li> After a half-an-hour, it didn&#x27;t dry.  </li>
            <li> but ceratainly not the dry feel after blow drying.  </li>
            <li> I style my hair as usual after and don&#x27;t have to spend extra time to \\&quot;hide\\&quot; the bare spots.  </li>
            <li> I comes with a triangle sponge that I run under water first and the sponge this around the thin spots.  </li>
            <li> It was what I expected and I like the product.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from PCOS and I have extremely thinning hair on the crown of my head.  </li>
            <li> This is just a darkening cream and will cover thin spots on your scalp, but it&#x27;s far too messy for me.</li>
            <li> what little hair I have...</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t look artificial, only covers the scalp in the same shade of your hair giving an appereance of fullness in your scalp.</li>
            <li> Washed and dried my hair, applied product to areas of scalp.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> , you need to wash your hair everyday using it.</li>
            <li> waste of my time anyways....</li>
            <li> but it is messy!</li>
            <li> But this stuff is just a cream that you apply with a small foam applicator and it thickens up the small hairs around it and blends in with the rest.</li>
            <li> I also use it as brow filler using a small makeup brush.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have complained about staining their pillow</li>
            <li> Not a good look for a 30-something girl.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical that it would work but for $25 I decided to roll the dice.</li>
            <li> I got this product after someone recommended it to me by replying to a review I did of a really bad masking product (you can search through my reviews to see what I&#x27;m talking about).</li>
            <li> They were always a problem if I ever ran my hand through my hair (a bad habit I have) or scratched an itch.</li>
            <li> &gt;:(</li>
            <li> Dreadful stuff.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been pretty happy with DermMatch for coloring my crown for bald spot and thickening my hair.  Maybe all couvre is good for is the scalp part.  But without thickening the hair, you still can see through the hair and see an obviously colored scalp.  Plus it rubs of too easily.  So after trying every product out there, I&#x27;m sticking with DermMatch.  Been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> Couvre takes away the shine of your head, which makes your hair appear thicker.  I am able to use just a little at a time, rub it on with what looks like a makeup sponge, and not have to use Toppik like I used to when I wanted to take away the shine of my scalp. I will buy it again. A little bit goes a long way, so it is economical in the long run. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> At 56 I thought the only solution was to buy a wig. Couvre is very easy to use and made such a difference in my appearance. No more odd glances at my pale scalp which emphasized my thinning hair especially in the front and top of my head. I apply Couvre in just a few minutes each morning starting from the top back and working forward blending with finger tips and using a cosmetic sponge to soften and blend. I style my hair as usual after and don&#x27;t have to spend extra time to \\&quot;hide\\&quot; the bare spots.  The real surprise was my hair dresser thought my hair look great and couldn&#x27;t figure what was going on when I first walked into the salon until I told her about Couve.  She wants the product info to pass on to other clients that have hair just like mine.  I will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> Yeah, it covered it OK, however, it didn&#x27;t stick to my scalp.  After a half-an-hour, it didn&#x27;t dry.  So, when I put my hand on it, my hand was &#x27;Couver&#x27;d&#x27; with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advertisement says that it immediately adheres to your scalp and existing hair and won&#x27;t come off until you shampoo it off...Bull!  My pillow case took two cycles to get clean after an evening of wearing the colored creamy stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear with caution!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
            <li> This stuff works sort of ok..but it is messy! Trying to get exactly the right amount can be tricky and leave your scalp looking patchy. It also comes off on your hands, pillow cases, etc, so you can&#x27;t touch your hair. Personally, I prefer Toppik. This is just a darkening cream and will cover thin spots on your scalp, but it&#x27;s far too messy for me. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected and I like the product.  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Works Perfectly! Exactly what I needed to cover up my thinning hair. I use it with Toppik Medium Brown Fibers. No one ever knows!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing I decided to do a test run with this product one evening when I was not going anywhere. Washed and dried my hair, applied product to areas of scalp. Noticed smell of product right away, checked ingredients, of course \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; was listed. Seemed kinda dumb, but I figured perhaps it was added to mask some less pleasant chemical ingredient odor. Problem was that an hour later (product was by then of course definitely completely dry), the fragrance had not faded and was driving me nuts. I did not want to end up with my pillow or anything else smelling of the fragrance, so had to wash my hair again.  As far as the product&#x27;s intended purpose, it didn&#x27;t look so great, but I imagine its appearance might improve as one got more practice applying it.  Due to the darn smell, though, I tossed the whole tube into the trash. What a waste.</li>
            <li> it is not bad but i find that it itches my scalp, you need to wash your hair everyday using it. It itches after a day on your scalp.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been struggling with hair loss for years now and I needed something to cover up the thinned out areas. This is a incredible product and so so easy to use!</li>
            <li> I have hair thinning due to thyroid issues--I&#x27;m only 40 and have been dealing with it for years so I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of scalp covering products. There&#x27;s not one that I absolutely love, its a tricky issue to cover believably. But as far as products go, I&#x27;ve gone back to this one a few times. I put it on the scalp when my hair is still wet, trying to conceal the bare parts before my hair dries. then I touch up with a bit of water on the sponge to areas I might miss. Its even better as a cover for gray on the temples. The medium brown is pretty dark, but the light brown is very light. wishing there was a color in between. Other than that, its one of the better ones on the market.</li>
            <li> CEO should bring back Couvre in Auburn!!! People like me were using it! Don&#x27;t want Topik fibers, already have it ! They don&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> Best thinning hair product on the market</li>
            <li> There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way to apply this stuff that doesn&#x27;t look like a painted scalp.  Dreadful stuff.</li>
            <li> ****BUYER BEWARE!!!****  Couvre has changed it&#x27;s formula.  I used this product for over 7 years and recently noticed the&lt;br /&gt;product has changed.  I used to be able to apply and style with hair dryer and NOT LOOSE any volume to my hair...&lt;br /&gt;or what little hair I have...LOL.  Now the formula is NOTICEABLY DIFFERENT!!!.  I tried the new formula only to&lt;br /&gt;find it weighs the hair down...not a greasy feel but ceratainly not the dry feel after blow drying.  I called customer&lt;br /&gt;service about it and they claim to have changed nothing....yeah sure...waste of my time anyways....it&#x27;s just a call&lt;br /&gt;center following up with you probably like they do the the 100&#x27;s of other products they push.  I now use DermMatch&lt;br /&gt;and will not go back to Couvre.  They lost a customer forever.  So....if you have fine hair and don&#x27;t want to loose&lt;br /&gt;any volume I suggest tying DermMatch first.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the casual touch up in between hair coloring.  It goes on easy and stays until the next shampoo.</li>
            <li> I suffer from PCOS and I have extremely thinning hair on the crown of my head.  Not a good look for a 30-something girl.  I put this on right after I get out of the shower while my hair is still wet.  I comes with a triangle sponge that I run under water first and the sponge this around the thin spots.  After it drys I complete the look with keratin fibers to help the hair look fuller.</li>
            <li> I got this product after someone recommended it to me by replying to a review I did of a really bad masking product (you can search through my reviews to see what I&#x27;m talking about). I was skeptical that it would work but for $25 I decided to roll the dice. And I have to say, this works pretty well. I&#x27;m actually very surprised because so many of these products claim to work wonders and don&#x27;t. I think this is MUCH better than Toppik or Magic Hair because, with those, I was always worried about rain. And that&#x27;s not an issue with this product. You actually have to wash it off with shampoo. I was concerned it would stain my head, but it hasn&#x27;t. Supposedly you can even swim with it on but, personally, I wouldn&#x27;t risk that. Another great thing about this, compared to Toppik or Magic Hair, is that I don&#x27;t have the crusty feeling on the top of my head, like I get with those other fiber-like products. They were always a problem if I ever ran my hand through my hair (a bad habit I have) or scratched an itch. But this stuff is just a cream that you apply with a small foam applicator and it thickens up the small hairs around it and blends in with the rest. BUT it does take a little practice to make it look right.    A COUPLE OF CAVEATS: I&#x27;m not saying this will work for everyone. My balding spot is on the crown of my head and about 3\\&quot; x 1\\&quot;. For that, it works really well. I&#x27;ve read where this is much more difficult to use on the front hairline. So if you have the receding hairline, this probably isn&#x27;t what you want. Also, It doesn&#x27;t seem to come in many color options, so perhaps you won&#x27;t be able to find one that matches your hair. The medium brown doesn&#x27;t perfectly match my hair, but it&#x27;s close enough where you can&#x27;t tell.     Best of luck.</li>
            <li> A little messy to use, but makes my hair look so much thicker</li>
            <li> messy and derma match covered much better</li>
            <li> I depend on this lotion and find that it helps to cover the balding areas on my head.  I can darken them and comb over the spots and my hair looks so much better.</li>
            <li> Discreetly tones down the scalp color, thereby giving the appearance of having more hair.</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff.  A learning curve how to apply but really looks natural.  Some reviewers have complained about staining their pillow but I have not had this problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products for thinning hair and have found Couvre to be the BEST!&lt;br /&gt;Combined with the aerosal Mane America, you wouldn&#x27;t know my hair is thinning!</li>
            <li> This product is an alive to people who are losing  hair every day, specially women- it doesn&#x27;t look artificial, only covers the scalp in the same shade of your hair giving an appereance of fullness in your scalp. I love it - it gives me peace of mind.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin on top and when the gray starts to come in it&#x27;s so much worse.this basically colors your scalp so the thinning isn&#x27;t as obvious.I&#x27;m med brown and also use it to cover my roots in a pinch.I also use it as brow filler using a small makeup brush. make sure not to use to much and blend it into you scalp and hair.Lasts a long time.</li>
