            <li>In any event, I do use this shampoo and find it very effective, and a bargain for what ingredients it has.  </li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even seem to get as much static!</li>
            <li>Lots of bubbly minty fresh pleasantly nice !!</li>
            <li>If you like these kind of shampoos, go for it.</li>
            <li>Organic products have smells all their own as this does.</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice scent on your hair.</li>
            <li>VERY happy so far.</li>
            <li>I have been very happy with the old formulation.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>Even so, it&#x27;s one of those shampoos that won&#x27;t give u very smooth rub on your hair..</li>
            <li>Her hair is thinning and the shampoo seems to be making her hair thicker surprisingly and more full than before.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s an okay shampoo.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve accidentally pulled my hair many times bcoz of the texture this shampoo gives.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>So far so good and the product smells good, too.</li>
            <li>and my hair is in better condition.</li>
            <li>What I am sure of is that I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo exclusively for 6 months</li>
            <li>I look forward to using this product more.</li>
            <li>I also love the brand Avalon Organics because I&#x27;m not pumping up my hair with chemicals, I&#x27;m giving my hair the nutrients and love it needs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>and she didn&#x27;t get any better after using most of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>a couple months later was just a wonderful bonus!  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner and have recommended it to my mother because her hair is thinning.</li>
            <li>I feel as though my hair is more manageable when I use this shampoo</li>
            <li>For starters I want to make sure everyone knows I am a man.  </li>
            <li>has seen healthier days, and I am taking all the steps I can to make sure that my hair won&#x27;t be something just reminisced about in my memoirs.  </li>
            <li>Most thickening shampoos cost much more than this to be sure.  </li>
            <li>I am most satisfied with this Avalon brand and am keeping it in stock as part of my anti hair thinning arsenal from now on.  </li>
            <li>3 bottles to many try packing up in just 2 bottles.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I am sure I would love (5 stars)</li>
            <li>but I grew to love it.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Then I tried Aveeno shampoo and was happily pleased.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s runnier and takes a lot more product to work up a lather in my hair.</li>
            <li>hair is much more better after I use this</li>
            <li>Also love the scent.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>He feels his hair is in better shape and less&lt;br /&gt;fly</li>
            <li>I called the 800# listed on the bottle to leave customer feedback and their representative was very nice and said customer feedback is very important so they can know if the new formulation is working well for their customers.</li>
            <li>Also, my scalp and hair feel very clean after using it.</li>
            <li>and hers is fine and has been thinning for many years.  </li>
            <li>LOVED this shampoo so much I&#x27;d bought 9 bottles ((3)</li>
            <li>I say that for its obvious that for whatever reason the great many reviews available for this shampoo and many like it are from women.  </li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t really sure, but then after I started using it more and more</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still does a great job on my hair, whether I&#x27;ve been working out in the yard all day or just coming back from a 30-mile bike ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 4/29/10</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair with a most luxurious feel and is well worth buying in the three pack offered.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair with a most luxurious feel and is well worth buying in the three pack offered.  </li>
            <li>Light not perfumey.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>to achieve a smooth, tangle-free hair, you have to use a lot of amount.  </li>
            <li>Besides if i keep treating my hair good, I wont go bald when i&#x27;m an old lady!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of wild looking, now, and I actually love just letting it do</li>
            <li>I have to say this product really does WORK!!!  </li>
            <li>Her hairdresser was so excited after years of problems he didn&#x27;t believe this $8 bottle of shampoo did the job.  </li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t the first biotin shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s certainly my favorite.</li>
            <li>I will say I noticed more loss the first couple of weeks</li>
            <li>It is definitely a thicker, more abundant feeling that can be well felt and seen.</li>
            <li>A quick search of thickening shampoos here on Amazon will show you that any vanity by us in this area does not come cheap.  </li>
            <li>A sound reasonable investment in your hair for sure...</li>
            <li>A sound reasonable investment in your hair for sure...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried jason and avalon, and it never feels quite as clean compared to this.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t notice anything but clean hair.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and leave my hair feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It seemed to thicken my hair a bit right away, and I think that&#x27;s because it dries it out a bit (which is fine for me</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s better products out there, I feel this product strips too much of our oils.</li>
            <li>I had to use all kinds of shampoo and couldn&#x27;t use them more then two days straight without needing a break.</li>
            <li>I still really like the shampoo, but I may start looking for something more concentrated</li>
            <li>Full volume</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had extremely thick hair until about 2 years ago when I noticed that it was thinning a lot, especially on top.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad thing, i will still use it.</li>
            <li>There is no real hair growth shampoo as far as I know, but a true thickening shampoo does do the job of making the best out of what you have.</li>
            <li>The color was getting better and I was starting to get more compliments on it.</li>
            <li>I have bought this several times, it may not thicken but it removes residue, I love the smell though  :)</li>
            <li>More time needed to use this product -  I really haven&#x27;t decided since everything effects my fine straight hair that has begun thinning -</li>
            <li>the top of bottles with the new formulation</li>
            <li>It smells good, but that is about the only positive that I had from it.</li>
            <li>I have fine white hair and this gives me more volume and shine.  </li>
            <li>(At 47, I&#x27;d been noticing definite thinning on the front top of my scalp when I look in the mirror with the overhead light on.)</li>
            <li>My hair is medium-thickness, naturally wavy and frizzy and thinning at the top.</li>
            <li>Not only does it make my thinning hair feel fuller, but it is so much more silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I ordered this right away and the product can be drying</li>
            <li>This shampoo used to make my hair so thick and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Further, my hair no longer feels good as it did with the old formulation.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice and lathers up in the shower, but you do not smell it when hair is dry and none of us have noticed that its made our hair thicker looking...</li>
            <li>Came packed very well and quickly.</li>
            <li>I feel like this cleans my hair really well, jason natural products you often have to shampoo twice (it actually recommends this on the bottle) which seems remarkably inefficient to me.  </li>
            <li>I didnt notice any particular change in my hair except for the fact that it remains clean as always ;).</li>
            <li>The thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it requires a pretty big amount if you want it properly dispersed throughout your hair and get that nice smooth soapy feeling.</li>
            <li>Great biotin complex shampoo</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say enough how healthy my hair looks (and feels) after each wash.  </li>
            <li>Please do not ask me to review this item again in the future, as I&#x27;m sure I will be re-ordering.</li>
            <li>This shampoo seems more like a clarify product one would use occasionally.</li>
            <li>i purchased it and used it for a while but didn&#x27;t really feel that it thickened my hair, however i went through an incident where my head scalp got oily and this was the only shampoo that solved the problem :)</li>
            <li>but I wanted to help my hair to grow back strong.</li>
            <li>but I will say this it definitely slows the process down and makes the best of what hair you have left augmented.</li>
            <li>MORE SUSTAINABLE\\&quot; is printed in bold yellow print and you can find the \\&quot;NSF\\&quot; circle at the bottom left of the front label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really, really, really like everything about it...</li>
            <li>so much I bought 3 of them.</li>
            <li>This product was very drying for me</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a thinning scalp nearly as much.</li>
            <li>My hair wasn&#x27;t falling out as much.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Does not do much to thicken hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so much cleaner and thicker.  </li>
            <li>and it really seems to have made a difference in my hair</li>
            <li>have very fine, shoulder-length hair and need at least a tablespoon to get a full lather.</li>
            <li>With the new formulation, on \\&quot;first squirt\\&quot; the shampoo can come out watery.</li>
            <li>I have since moved on to other products that provide more bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>My hair gets oily easily but after using this, it actually stays dry and nice for a long time.</li>
            <li>I am surprised they do not add Polysorbate 80 to the formula which removes the culprit DHT from the scalp that is the villain that makes you lose your hair in the first place.</li>
            <li>He also has very fine limp hair.</li>
            <li>new formulation seems very watered down (in fact, the #2 listed ingredient is water) requiring much more shampoo to work up a lather.</li>
            <li>My hair still sheds, but less than before, but I love the thickness that the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an older man who&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>Some positives would be that my hair did not fall out as much in the shower, my hair was very silky and soft.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are sold on this product and would highly recommend it to anyone with hair and/or scalp problems.</li>
            <li>After 1 use my hair feels fuller and even a little bit more volume.</li>
            <li>I really wanted the old one</li>
            <li>I  use this Shampoo everyday and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and found that this shampoo did not clean very well.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;NEW</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sadly I must once again go hunting for a new shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is the new formulation or else I will not have purchased.</li>
            <li>have normal hair and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that in the first couple of days using it</li>
            <li>Then I tried this and WOW!</li>
            <li>On other words, not really the most aromatic shampoo I have used to be sure, but not very strong in that area in any event.</li>
            <li>b/c I have naturally oily hair and live in a humid climate).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job by stripping all the dirt and oils (good &amp; bad) from the hair leaving it super gangly and unmanageably.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving it three stars is because it does in fact clean and was very affordable, other than that, I&#x27;d leave this product alone.</li>
            <li>Perhaps its because more women are interested in approaching a thin hair problem from a standpoint of using a special shampoo, since actually losing it like men is not very likely.</li>
            <li>This one is all natural and it does not.</li>
            <li>I wanted to go natural and decided to give them a try.</li>
            <li>I also feel like this product has helped with my oily-ness (I am naturally oily).</li>
            <li>But it wasn&#x27;t as soft and natural as I wanted.</li>
            <li>My professional hairdresser recommended that i take Biotin supplements and buy shampoo with Biotin in it as well to combat the problem.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair feeling soft, looking shiny and smelling like lavender.</li>
            <li>I use an all natural argan oil based product.</li>
            <li>Available on this website from other suppliers a bit cheaper and in local stores also.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this shampoo makes hair appear fuller or if one actually grows more hair.</li>
            <li>But the price was decent enough that I thought I&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li>My first wash with it made my hair very dry...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced dramatic diffuse hair loss due to telogen effluvium.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, I highly recommend this shampoo for any man or woman that is in need or want of such a formula.  </li>
            <li>I recently ordered another 3-set thing and received the new set unexpectedly.</li>
            <li>No more scabby stuff, just healthy pink, normal looking scalp.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo smells kinda funky, it is super runny but does foam a little.</li>
            <li>and I had to discontinue after about 2 weeks of use (I have fine, thin hair that is mostly straight).</li>
            <li>After using it for about a week straight (yes, straight!), I noticed my hair was starting to get fuller, less dandruff, and silkier.</li>
            <li>In the last few days I&#x27;ve suddenly noticed the temple and hair line areas are full of short (1/4-1/2 inch), normal texture new hair!</li>
            <li>I do not use the conditioner as the shampoo leaves my hair very soft, which is enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is pretty thick in texture and smells okay, but this particular set sucks,  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any major improvements</li>
            <li>It also helps that I only shampoo every 2-3 days and not every day (don&#x27;t totally strip your hair of its natural oils!!).</li>
            <li>I have been out looking for a grate organic shampoo &amp; conditioner set for weak fine hair, so when I saw this product get such high reviews</li>
            <li>Please bring back the old formula.</li>
            <li>It works just as well as far as lathering as any other shampoo, is nice and thick and rich, and as far as the smell, I think it is very subtle.  </li>
            <li>I think this shampoo would be great for someone who suffers from dry scalp issues.  </li>
            <li>I  found that my hair felt very weighed down.  </li>
            <li>You will see a whole lot less hair in your comb or if you have a hair trap/snag for your shower drain</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and at the same time, it feels full and thick.  </li>
            <li>2nd wash very weighed down..</li>
            <li>not great for fine hair</li>
            <li>and I have thin fine hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I found that purchasing the 3 pack from Amazon.com works out to be a good savings.  </li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even seem to get as much static!</li>
            <li> Lots of bubbly minty fresh pleasantly nice !!</li>
            <li> If you like these kind of shampoos, go for it.</li>
            <li> Organic products have smells all their own as this does.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice scent on your hair.</li>
            <li> VERY happy so far.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with the old formulation.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> Even so, it&#x27;s one of those shampoos that won&#x27;t give u very smooth rub on your hair..</li>
            <li> Her hair is thinning and the shampoo seems to be making her hair thicker surprisingly and more full than before.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s an okay shampoo.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve accidentally pulled my hair many times bcoz of the texture this shampoo gives.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> So far so good and the product smells good, too.</li>
            <li> and my hair is in better condition.</li>
            <li> What I am sure of is that I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo exclusively for 6 months</li>
            <li> I look forward to using this product more.</li>
            <li> I also love the brand Avalon Organics because I&#x27;m not pumping up my hair with chemicals, I&#x27;m giving my hair the nutrients and love it needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> and she didn&#x27;t get any better after using most of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> a couple months later was just a wonderful bonus!  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner and have recommended it to my mother because her hair is thinning.</li>
            <li> I feel as though my hair is more manageable when I use this shampoo</li>
            <li> For starters I want to make sure everyone knows I am a man.  </li>
            <li> has seen healthier days, and I am taking all the steps I can to make sure that my hair won&#x27;t be something just reminisced about in my memoirs.  </li>
            <li> Most thickening shampoos cost much more than this to be sure.  </li>
            <li> I am most satisfied with this Avalon brand and am keeping it in stock as part of my anti hair thinning arsenal from now on.  </li>
            <li> 3 bottles to many try packing up in just 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I am sure I would love (5 stars)</li>
            <li> but I grew to love it.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Then I tried Aveeno shampoo and was happily pleased.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s runnier and takes a lot more product to work up a lather in my hair.</li>
            <li> hair is much more better after I use this</li>
            <li> Also love the scent.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> He feels his hair is in better shape and less&lt;br /&gt;fly</li>
            <li> I called the 800# listed on the bottle to leave customer feedback and their representative was very nice and said customer feedback is very important so they can know if the new formulation is working well for their customers.</li>
            <li> Also, my scalp and hair feel very clean after using it.</li>
            <li> and hers is fine and has been thinning for many years.  </li>
            <li> LOVED this shampoo so much I&#x27;d bought 9 bottles ((3)</li>
            <li> I say that for its obvious that for whatever reason the great many reviews available for this shampoo and many like it are from women.  </li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t really sure, but then after I started using it more and more</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still does a great job on my hair, whether I&#x27;ve been working out in the yard all day or just coming back from a 30-mile bike ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 4/29/10</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair with a most luxurious feel and is well worth buying in the three pack offered.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair with a most luxurious feel and is well worth buying in the three pack offered.  </li>
            <li> Light not perfumey.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> to achieve a smooth, tangle-free hair, you have to use a lot of amount.  </li>
            <li> Besides if i keep treating my hair good, I wont go bald when i&#x27;m an old lady!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of wild looking, now, and I actually love just letting it do</li>
            <li> I have to say this product really does WORK!!!  </li>
            <li> Her hairdresser was so excited after years of problems he didn&#x27;t believe this $8 bottle of shampoo did the job.  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t the first biotin shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s certainly my favorite.</li>
            <li> I will say I noticed more loss the first couple of weeks</li>
            <li> It is definitely a thicker, more abundant feeling that can be well felt and seen.</li>
            <li> A quick search of thickening shampoos here on Amazon will show you that any vanity by us in this area does not come cheap.  </li>
            <li> A sound reasonable investment in your hair for sure...</li>
            <li> A sound reasonable investment in your hair for sure...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried jason and avalon, and it never feels quite as clean compared to this.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice anything but clean hair.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and leave my hair feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> It seemed to thicken my hair a bit right away, and I think that&#x27;s because it dries it out a bit (which is fine for me</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s better products out there, I feel this product strips too much of our oils.</li>
            <li> I had to use all kinds of shampoo and couldn&#x27;t use them more then two days straight without needing a break.</li>
            <li> I still really like the shampoo, but I may start looking for something more concentrated</li>
            <li> Full volume</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had extremely thick hair until about 2 years ago when I noticed that it was thinning a lot, especially on top.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad thing, i will still use it.</li>
            <li> There is no real hair growth shampoo as far as I know, but a true thickening shampoo does do the job of making the best out of what you have.</li>
            <li> The color was getting better and I was starting to get more compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I have bought this several times, it may not thicken but it removes residue, I love the smell though  :)</li>
            <li> More time needed to use this product -  I really haven&#x27;t decided since everything effects my fine straight hair that has begun thinning -</li>
            <li> the top of bottles with the new formulation</li>
            <li> It smells good, but that is about the only positive that I had from it.</li>
            <li> I have fine white hair and this gives me more volume and shine.  </li>
            <li> (At 47, I&#x27;d been noticing definite thinning on the front top of my scalp when I look in the mirror with the overhead light on.)</li>
            <li> My hair is medium-thickness, naturally wavy and frizzy and thinning at the top.</li>
            <li> Not only does it make my thinning hair feel fuller, but it is so much more silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I ordered this right away and the product can be drying</li>
            <li> This shampoo used to make my hair so thick and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Further, my hair no longer feels good as it did with the old formulation.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and lathers up in the shower, but you do not smell it when hair is dry and none of us have noticed that its made our hair thicker looking...</li>
            <li> Came packed very well and quickly.</li>
            <li> I feel like this cleans my hair really well, jason natural products you often have to shampoo twice (it actually recommends this on the bottle) which seems remarkably inefficient to me.  </li>
            <li> I didnt notice any particular change in my hair except for the fact that it remains clean as always ;).</li>
            <li> The thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it requires a pretty big amount if you want it properly dispersed throughout your hair and get that nice smooth soapy feeling.</li>
            <li> Great biotin complex shampoo</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say enough how healthy my hair looks (and feels) after each wash.  </li>
            <li> Please do not ask me to review this item again in the future, as I&#x27;m sure I will be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> This shampoo seems more like a clarify product one would use occasionally.</li>
            <li> i purchased it and used it for a while but didn&#x27;t really feel that it thickened my hair, however i went through an incident where my head scalp got oily and this was the only shampoo that solved the problem :)</li>
            <li> but I wanted to help my hair to grow back strong.</li>
            <li> but I will say this it definitely slows the process down and makes the best of what hair you have left augmented.</li>
            <li> MORE SUSTAINABLE\\&quot; is printed in bold yellow print and you can find the \\&quot;NSF\\&quot; circle at the bottom left of the front label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really, really, really like everything about it...</li>
            <li> so much I bought 3 of them.</li>
            <li> This product was very drying for me</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a thinning scalp nearly as much.</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t falling out as much.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Does not do much to thicken hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so much cleaner and thicker.  </li>
            <li> and it really seems to have made a difference in my hair</li>
            <li> have very fine, shoulder-length hair and need at least a tablespoon to get a full lather.</li>
            <li> With the new formulation, on \\&quot;first squirt\\&quot; the shampoo can come out watery.</li>
            <li> I have since moved on to other products that provide more bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> My hair gets oily easily but after using this, it actually stays dry and nice for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am surprised they do not add Polysorbate 80 to the formula which removes the culprit DHT from the scalp that is the villain that makes you lose your hair in the first place.</li>
            <li> He also has very fine limp hair.</li>
            <li> new formulation seems very watered down (in fact, the #2 listed ingredient is water) requiring much more shampoo to work up a lather.</li>
            <li> My hair still sheds, but less than before, but I love the thickness that the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an older man who&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> Some positives would be that my hair did not fall out as much in the shower, my hair was very silky and soft.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are sold on this product and would highly recommend it to anyone with hair and/or scalp problems.</li>
            <li> After 1 use my hair feels fuller and even a little bit more volume.</li>
            <li> I really wanted the old one</li>
            <li> I  use this Shampoo everyday and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and found that this shampoo did not clean very well.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;NEW</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly I must once again go hunting for a new shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is the new formulation or else I will not have purchased.</li>
            <li> have normal hair and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that in the first couple of days using it</li>
            <li> Then I tried this and WOW!</li>
            <li> On other words, not really the most aromatic shampoo I have used to be sure, but not very strong in that area in any event.</li>
            <li> b/c I have naturally oily hair and live in a humid climate).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job by stripping all the dirt and oils (good &amp; bad) from the hair leaving it super gangly and unmanageably.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it three stars is because it does in fact clean and was very affordable, other than that, I&#x27;d leave this product alone.</li>
            <li> Perhaps its because more women are interested in approaching a thin hair problem from a standpoint of using a special shampoo, since actually losing it like men is not very likely.</li>
            <li> This one is all natural and it does not.</li>
            <li> I wanted to go natural and decided to give them a try.</li>
            <li> I also feel like this product has helped with my oily-ness (I am naturally oily).</li>
            <li> But it wasn&#x27;t as soft and natural as I wanted.</li>
            <li> My professional hairdresser recommended that i take Biotin supplements and buy shampoo with Biotin in it as well to combat the problem.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair feeling soft, looking shiny and smelling like lavender.</li>
            <li> I use an all natural argan oil based product.</li>
            <li> Available on this website from other suppliers a bit cheaper and in local stores also.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this shampoo makes hair appear fuller or if one actually grows more hair.</li>
            <li> But the price was decent enough that I thought I&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li> My first wash with it made my hair very dry...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced dramatic diffuse hair loss due to telogen effluvium.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, I highly recommend this shampoo for any man or woman that is in need or want of such a formula.  </li>
            <li> I recently ordered another 3-set thing and received the new set unexpectedly.</li>
            <li> No more scabby stuff, just healthy pink, normal looking scalp.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo smells kinda funky, it is super runny but does foam a little.</li>
            <li> and I had to discontinue after about 2 weeks of use (I have fine, thin hair that is mostly straight).</li>
            <li> After using it for about a week straight (yes, straight!), I noticed my hair was starting to get fuller, less dandruff, and silkier.</li>
            <li> In the last few days I&#x27;ve suddenly noticed the temple and hair line areas are full of short (1/4-1/2 inch), normal texture new hair!</li>
            <li> I do not use the conditioner as the shampoo leaves my hair very soft, which is enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is pretty thick in texture and smells okay, but this particular set sucks,  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any major improvements</li>
            <li> It also helps that I only shampoo every 2-3 days and not every day (don&#x27;t totally strip your hair of its natural oils!!).</li>
            <li> I have been out looking for a grate organic shampoo &amp; conditioner set for weak fine hair, so when I saw this product get such high reviews</li>
            <li> Please bring back the old formula.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as far as lathering as any other shampoo, is nice and thick and rich, and as far as the smell, I think it is very subtle.  </li>
            <li> I think this shampoo would be great for someone who suffers from dry scalp issues.  </li>
            <li> I  found that my hair felt very weighed down.  </li>
            <li> You will see a whole lot less hair in your comb or if you have a hair trap/snag for your shower drain</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and at the same time, it feels full and thick.  </li>
            <li> 2nd wash very weighed down..</li>
            <li> not great for fine hair</li>
            <li> and I have thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> For me the hair loss seemed to be due to hormonal changes and stress and this has kicked my hair back into action.</li>
            <li> I tried many other brands for thin hair , nothing worked like this.</li>
            <li> As far as the way it works, the softness it leaves you with in your hair is nothing like I have felt in any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo with the hopes of improving my locks, overall it does clean the hair well but left it feeling and looking very dry and weak,</li>
            <li> I spent months on only-natural shampoos from various brands and have finally given up and returned to regular shampoo despite the chemicals.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it does what it&#x27;s supposed</li>
            <li> After 4 months of use this is the only shampoo I&#x27;ll be using for a long time!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s only bcoz of dat, dat my hair remains dry, un-oily, and strong(er)</li>
            <li> I also occasionally take the biotin supplement 5000 mcg/day, but I am not consistent with that and would attribute the improvement in my hair to the regular use of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> have baby fine hair, I can wrap a small elastic around my pony at least twice.</li>
            <li> One goes a long way</li>
            <li> but since the hair dye it has thinned out lately not like balding thin but just not as full and thick.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and gets oily fast.</li>
            <li> The bottle claims no harsh sulfates,  however sodium coco sulfate is essentially a lesser refined version of sodium lauryl sulfate which is a very harsh sulfate (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate).  </li>
            <li> This product was awful, but might be good for your horse&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> I was running out of my last bottle of the old formulation which I purchased a little over half a year ago.</li>
            <li> However it also made my hair feel like dry straw even with the complimenting conditioner.</li>
            <li> However, it can leave hair too dry</li>
            <li> Since I already have dry hair, I now find that I need a product to help with the dryness.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sud up like chemical products, due to the absence of lauryl sulfate.</li>
            <li> This new formula does not make my hair thick.</li>
            <li> I realized just how thick it was making my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is not much better and does not make up for the dry, stringy, hair left after shampooing.</li>
            <li> Essentially sodium coco sulfate just foams less but is still quite harsh for the hair.  </li>
            <li> So, when you&#x27;re rubbing your hair with the shampoo, your hair gets stuck to each other or something.</li>
            <li> In the past I have also used Matrix for Men, Redken for Men and American Crew.</li>
            <li> It takes such a small amount.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product at first because it claims to be organic.  </li>
            <li> Your hair will feel and look thicker after only a few shampoos!</li>
            <li> She loves it and won&#x27;t use any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> After getting used to that difference, it is just like any other shampoo . .</li>
            <li> It doesnt do any of the things other reviewers have said</li>
            <li> From reading other reviews I noticed some saying it made their hair grow faster</li>
            <li> I was told from my hairdresser that part of the reason why my scalp was itchy and dry was because of harsh chemicals, so i switched to organic</li>
            <li> It carries a light medicinal scent that is not that bad at all in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Usually, I only have to do this 1 or 2 times in the beginning, and the shampoo stays thick for the rest of the use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair soft and moisturized without any fake dry feeling.</li>
            <li> I noticed less shedding of hair too.</li>
            <li> you will see less hair there as well.</li>
            <li> Now I go through the shampoo so quickly it&#x27;s not cost-effective.</li>
            <li> Since using this shampoo, about two weeks now, I seem to be shedding less hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> Ithinnk the formula has changed since I previously purchased this item, but I still like the smell and the results.  </li>
            <li> I remember having thin hair for quite a while in my adolescent years (unfortunately for me, my parents have the pictures to prove it)- it would get oily really easily, and after finding out that washing daily was unhealthy, I decided to find a solution.</li>
            <li> So sadly, they changed the formulation to comply with new organics NSF label standards which require a product to be 70% organic.</li>
            <li> Hair feels a little oily after using it b/c it doesn&#x27;t lather.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for products that are organic and contain little or no chemicals.</li>
            <li> but nothing a little hair product can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month now.</li>
            <li> The new formulation (70% organic) is awful and drying and feels nothing similar to the old.</li>
            <li> tried an organic Lavender shampoo+conditioner and that dried out my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> Will update after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a few times since I received this a yesterday.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly harsh and drying to one&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> It is limp.</li>
            <li> Green decision</li>
            <li> If you do decide to give this shampoo a try I would suggest to use it a few times before you make your mind up on it...</li>
            <li> I used to be a Pantene Pro-V baby and then got tired of the dried out feel of my hair despite it being pretty soft (that&#x27;s why sodium laureth sulfate is bad!).</li>
            <li> So if you are unhappy with the new formulation please let them know.</li>
            <li> It is not a revolting smell and really does not smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> I usually can&#x27;t use comercial shampoo because they all make my hair go grease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about it&#x27;s thickening effect.</li>
            <li> No more dandruff with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I doubt it&#x27;s the biotin since there is little evidence it penetrates the scalp, but SLS free is why I bought it since the prescription shampoo she was using for nasty welts on her scalp had Sodium Laurel Sulfate in it!  </li>
            <li> It was getting expensive and ridiculous to constantly swapping shampoos every day.</li>
            <li> I always had very thick hair (my pony tail was as think as my wrist) and is probably half what it used to be.</li>
            <li> At least my hair quit falling out now</li>
            <li> I take bath once (at least) or twice a day, but I do not know why my head got itchy when some times after 12 hours I take a bath.</li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t have limp or thin hair that needs thickening.</li>
            <li> My hair use to be thick as a kid</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The texture isn&#x27;t as bad as some all-natural shampoos that leave your hair in a big tangled clump, but I felt like my hair was drying out, and falling out, after using it.</li>
            <li> The amount of hair lost during a shower has decreased to almost no hair loss during showers.</li>
            <li> Like, sometimes I take a bath in the morning but do not take one at night because I were tired from work</li>
            <li> After my baby was born I started shedding hair like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I guess it was stripping my hair of the bad stuff?</li>

            <li> My hair gets oily easily but after using this, it actually stays dry and nice for a long time. I haven&#x27;t had any major improvements, it&#x27;s an okay shampoo. The thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it requires a pretty big amount if you want it properly dispersed throughout your hair and get that nice smooth soapy feeling. Even so, it&#x27;s one of those shampoos that won&#x27;t give u very smooth rub on your hair.. So, when you&#x27;re rubbing your hair with the shampoo, your hair gets stuck to each other or something. So, I&#x27;ve accidentally pulled my hair many times bcoz of the texture this shampoo gives. But it&#x27;s only bcoz of dat, dat my hair remains dry, un-oily, and strong(er) I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s okay. If you like these kind of shampoos, go for it.</li>
            <li> I have fine white hair and this gives me more volume and shine.  I order three bottles at a time and give my daughter one.</li>
            <li> Hair feels a little oily after using it b/c it doesn&#x27;t lather.  It&#x27;s not a bad thing, i will still use it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best for my hair.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 11/29/13 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for over 3 years, and yes, the formulation has changed. With the new formulation, on \\&quot;first squirt\\&quot; the shampoo can come out watery. If it does, close the cap and ... SHAKE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shake it like you would watery ketchup or mustard. This will help mix up the contents and thicken up the shampoo. Usually, I only have to do this 1 or 2 times in the beginning, and the shampoo stays thick for the rest of the use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still does a great job on my hair, whether I&#x27;ve been working out in the yard all day or just coming back from a 30-mile bike ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 4/29/10 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal hair and sensitive skin - I don&#x27;t have limp or thin hair that needs thickening. I was looking for products that are organic and contain little or no chemicals. Avalon Organic fits the bill and I use both the shampoo and conditioner. So far so good and the product smells good, too. My hair feels great and it&#x27;s good to know that I&#x27;m not dumping a bunch of chemicals on my head every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried an organic Lavender shampoo+conditioner and that dried out my hair and scalp. In the past I have also used Matrix for Men, Redken for Men and American Crew. They just never did it for me.</li>
            <li> With the inevitable hormonal changes, my hair started falling out.... A LOT.  This line of shampoo and conditioner was one of the ways I began to tackle this problem.    I really, really, really like everything about it... the no chemicals, the smell, the texture, the price, oh and IT WORKS!      I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I usually can&#x27;t use comercial shampoo because they all make my hair go grease. This one is all natural and it does not. I like it so much I bought 3 of them.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and leave my hair feeling clean and soft. The amount of hair lost during a shower has decreased to almost no hair loss during showers.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s better products out there, I feel this product strips too much of our oils.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  Used it years ago and them somehow we parted ways and I tried all sorts of organic shampoos (and even the no-poo for awhile).  None were for me.  But, I came across this shampoo again and my hair looks GREAT!</li>
            <li> This product was very drying for me and I had to discontinue after about 2 weeks of use (I have fine, thin hair that is mostly straight). The texture isn&#x27;t as bad as some all-natural shampoos that leave your hair in a big tangled clump, but I felt like my hair was drying out, and falling out, after using it. I spent months on only-natural shampoos from various brands and have finally given up and returned to regular shampoo despite the chemicals. At least my hair quit falling out now and my hair is in better condition. Scalp is also happier.</li>
            <li> Updated 1-star review 7-30-2012:&lt;br /&gt;I LOVED this shampoo so much I&#x27;d bought 9 bottles ((3) 3-packs)and shared with family. So sadly, they changed the formulation to comply with new organics NSF label standards which require a product to be 70% organic. I learned this from a company representative I just spoke with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new formulation seems very watered down (in fact, the #2 listed ingredient is water) requiring much more shampoo to work up a lather. Further, my hair no longer feels good as it did with the old formulation. I called the 800# listed on the bottle to leave customer feedback and their representative was very nice and said customer feedback is very important so they can know if the new formulation is working well for their customers. So if you are unhappy with the new formulation please let them know. With enough feedback they may again change the formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the top of bottles with the new formulation \\&quot;NEW MORE SUSTAINABLE\\&quot; is printed in bold yellow print and you can find the \\&quot;NSF\\&quot; circle at the bottom left of the front label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly I must once again go hunting for a new shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original 5-star Review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this shampoo makes hair appear fuller or if one actually grows more hair. What I am sure of is that I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo exclusively for 6 months and when I look in the mirror I don&#x27;t notice a thinning scalp nearly as much. (At 47, I&#x27;d been noticing definite thinning on the front top of my scalp when I look in the mirror with the overhead light on.) VERY happy so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for several months, almost a year.  My hair is medium-thickness, naturally wavy and frizzy and thinning at the top. I wish I could say it&#x27;s helped with the thinning but it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 and I have dyed my hair every color you can think of! My hair use to be thick as a kid but since the hair dye it has thinned out lately not like balding thin but just not as full and thick. After 1 use my hair feels fuller and even a little bit more volume. I look forward to using this product more. I also love the brand Avalon Organics because I&#x27;m not pumping up my hair with chemicals, I&#x27;m giving my hair the nutrients and love it needs. Besides if i keep treating my hair good, I wont go bald when i&#x27;m an old lady!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update I&#x27;ve been using this product non stop since march 2012 and I get complements on my hair all the time, my hair gets a good amount of volume even with out blow drying it. My hair looks/feels and is thicker. I&#x27;m in love with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great biotin complex shampoo</li>
            <li> Mom is 80 now and I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and we&#x27;ve both been using this for over a year now.  I have very fine hair and hers is fine and has been thinning for many years.  After a couple months of using this - BIG DIFFERENCE!  I doubt it&#x27;s the biotin since there is little evidence it penetrates the scalp, but SLS free is why I bought it since the prescription shampoo she was using for nasty welts on her scalp had Sodium Laurel Sulfate in it!  The HARSHEST of the shampoo chemicals out there - and she didn&#x27;t get any better after using most of the bottle.  Her scalp problems cleared up in 10 days with this stuff.  No more scabby stuff, just healthy pink, normal looking scalp.  Her hairdresser was so excited after years of problems he didn&#x27;t believe this $8 bottle of shampoo did the job.  Having her hair look great a couple months later was just a wonderful bonus!  Cut the chemicals for a couple months - see if it helps you.  Available on this website from other suppliers a bit cheaper and in local stores also.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner and have recommended it to my mother because her hair is thinning. I feel as though my hair is more manageable when I use this shampoo and, hopefully, it will show some improvement for my mother. Will update after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I  use this Shampoo everyday and I love it. It takes such a small amount. This is a great product and will definatly order again.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on recommendations here and I can&#x27;t say enough how healthy my hair looks (and feels) after each wash.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> For starters I want to make sure everyone knows I am a man.  I say that for its obvious that for whatever reason the great many reviews available for this shampoo and many like it are from women.  Perhaps its because more women are interested in approaching a thin hair problem from a standpoint of using a special shampoo, since actually losing it like men is not very likely. Or perhaps it is because a lot of men just don&#x27;t like leaving reviews for products such as this.  In any event, I do use this shampoo and find it very effective, and a bargain for what ingredients it has.  I&#x27;m an older man who&#x27;s hair has seen healthier days, and I am taking all the steps I can to make sure that my hair won&#x27;t be something just reminisced about in my memoirs.  There is no real hair growth shampoo as far as I know, but a true thickening shampoo does do the job of making the best out of what you have. It works just as well as far as lathering as any other shampoo, is nice and thick and rich, and as far as the smell, I think it is very subtle.  On other words, not really the most aromatic shampoo I have used to be sure, but not very strong in that area in any event. It carries a light medicinal scent that is not that bad at all in my opinion. As far as the way it works, the softness it leaves you with in your hair is nothing like I have felt in any other shampoo. It is definitely a thicker, more abundant feeling that can be well felt and seen. I have been using this Avalon brand for some time now and not only like the feel of how it leaves my hair, but I like the price too.  A quick search of thickening shampoos here on Amazon will show you that any vanity by us in this area does not come cheap.  Most thickening shampoos cost much more than this to be sure.  I have never tried one of the more expensive brands, nor do I plan too.  I am most satisfied with this Avalon brand and am keeping it in stock as part of my anti hair thinning arsenal from now on.  In conclusion, I highly recommend this shampoo for any man or woman that is in need or want of such a formula.  It leaves your hair with a most luxurious feel and is well worth buying in the three pack offered.  A sound reasonable investment in your hair for sure...nd this shampoo for any man or woman that is in need or want of such a formula.

            <li> My hair is thick and gets oily fast. I was also having problems with dandruff. I had to use all kinds of shampoo and couldn&#x27;t use them more then two days straight without needing a break. It was getting expensive and ridiculous to constantly swapping shampoos every day. Enter Avalon. I wanted to go natural and decided to give them a try. It smells great, and not overpowering. After using it for about a week straight (yes, straight!), I noticed my hair was starting to get fuller, less dandruff, and silkier. My hair wasn&#x27;t falling out as much. The color was getting better and I was starting to get more compliments on it. I love it! It doesn&#x27;t even seem to get as much static! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that in the first couple of days using it (Mom noticed this to on hers), my hair was really oily and limp. I guess it was stripping my hair of the bad stuff? Anyways, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is by the best I tried. It really makes a difference. Its not watery as some suggested and it smells good too. I tried many other brands for thin hair , nothing worked like this. I noticed less shedding of hair too. I will buy again once I am out of my pack of 3.</li>
            <li> 3 bottles to many try packing up in just 2 bottles. One goes a long way</li>
            <li> I take bath once (at least) or twice a day, but I do not know why my head got itchy when some times after 12 hours I take a bath. Like, sometimes I take a bath in the morning but do not take one at night because I were tired from work, the next morning I would wake up with itchy on my head. I used it once and my itchy stopped, that makes me happy. It smells like herbs, which is also a reason that I like this product.</li>
            <li> After my baby was born I started shedding hair like crazy.  Mounds of hair would be all over the house.  I was skeptical about this product at first because it claims to be organic.  But the price was decent enough that I thought I&#x27;d try it.  I LOVE this shampoo.  Immediately the next day I felt my hair was thicker and stronger.  My hair still sheds, but less than before, but I love the thickness that the shampoo.  I have to say this product really does WORK!!!  After 4 months of use this is the only shampoo I&#x27;ll be using for a long time!</li>
            <li> I have bought this several times, it may not thicken but it removes residue, I love the smell though  :)</li>
            <li> I am sure I would love (5 stars) this shampoo if I also used the conditioner… I&#x27;ll have to try it too!</li>
            <li> Avalon Organics Shampoo, Biotin B-Complex, Thickening, 14-Ounces described as it is and arrived on time with out any issue. Great</li>
            <li> I have used this product a few times since I received this a yesterday. Not only does it make my thinning hair feel fuller, but it is so much more silky smooth. Organic products have smells all their own as this does. It is not a revolting smell and really does not smell bad at all. It is just a different smell that you don&#x27;t get in your brand name commercial products.</li>
            <li> been using this shampoo for a couple of years now....since my hair started to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this shampoo was recomended to me and works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo with the hopes of improving my locks, overall it does clean the hair well but left it feeling and looking very dry and weak, will no repeat. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it three stars is because it does in fact clean and was very affordable, other than that, I&#x27;d leave this product alone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since summer of 2014. I was 4 months PP when my hair started falling out at the front of my hairline. I ordered this right away and the product can be drying so I suggest using a great moisturizing conditioner. I know PP hairloss grows back and my hair has grown back but I wanted to help my hair to grow back strong. I also feel like this product has helped with my oily-ness (I am naturally oily). I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year and I like it.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I ever used. Not sticky but cleans perfectly. I&#x27;ll keep using this.</li>
            <li> great organic shampoo and it delivers what it says it will. Your hair will feel and look thicker after only a few shampoos!</li>
            <li> I buy this regularly.  Best shampoo for  my hair.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a try since it was organic. I didn&#x27;t notice any thickening after about 6 bottles over 6 months. It smells good, but that is about the only positive that I had from it. I have since moved on to other products that provide more bang for the buck. I would probably stick with it if I cared about organic skin care products though.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom. She loves this product and swears it work for her. Her hair is thinning and the shampoo seems to be making her hair thicker surprisingly and more full than before. She loves it and won&#x27;t use any other shampoo. This package came in good wrapped in plastic bag in case of leakage which there was none, it was great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now. I do feel that my hair is getting stronger than before.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s made with some organic products. I eat organic, why not use organic soap and shampoo. Shipped fast. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this shampoo from now on. It works just as advertised. Chemical-y smell but I grew to love it.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite.  I&#x27;ve tried jason and avalon, and it never feels quite as clean compared to this.  I feel like this cleans my hair really well, jason natural products you often have to shampoo twice (it actually recommends this on the bottle) which seems remarkably inefficient to me.  I was told from my hairdresser that part of the reason why my scalp was itchy and dry was because of harsh chemicals, so i switched to organic and it&#x27;s helped a lot (no itchy scalp!)</li>
            <li> I used to be a Pantene Pro-V baby and then got tired of the dried out feel of my hair despite it being pretty soft (that&#x27;s why sodium laureth sulfate is bad!). Then I tried Aveeno shampoo and was happily pleased. But it wasn&#x27;t as soft and natural as I wanted. Then I tried this and WOW! It also helps that I only shampoo every 2-3 days and not every day (don&#x27;t totally strip your hair of its natural oils!!). This product leaves your hair soft and moisturized without any fake dry feeling. I still condition with Aveeno conditioner and the combination of the two products is really great! A final touch is the Culligan showerhead [...] which removes chlorine which is drying to the skin and hair. I have the softest hair I&#x27;ve ever had, even softer than when I used Biolage as a kid (my mother&#x27;s product of course!)!</li>
            <li> I have ALREADY reviewed this product.  Please check your archives.  Please do not ask me to review this item again in the future, as I&#x27;m sure I will be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> not great for fine hair</li>
            <li> I wish I could have given 5 stars in that the product DID make my hair feel thicker.  However it also made my hair feel like dry straw even with the complimenting conditioner.</li>
            <li> Does not do much to thicken hair.</li>
            <li> Lots of bubbly minty fresh pleasantly nice !! Love it. Hair stops falling out after 1 month use. I think it is a result of a combination of stress reduction, No sulfate shampoo like this one, and argan oil conditioner, and this shampoo formula. Love it.</li>
            <li> Smells good, and my fiance loves it, it appears to thicken hair, she noticed results after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I do not like this product at all.  It is incredibly harsh and drying to one&#x27;s hair.  I will not be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not a cure for baldness but I will say this it definitely slows the process down and makes the best of what hair you have left augmented. No petrochemicals in this formula either. You will see a whole lot less hair in your comb or if you have a hair trap/snag for your shower drain you will see less hair there as well. It definitely adds volume and strength to every strand of hair on your head. I am surprised they do not add Polysorbate 80 to the formula which removes the culprit DHT from the scalp that is the villain that makes you lose your hair in the first place.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this is the best shampoo that I&#x27;ve found and I use it all the time.  It makes my hair shiny and at the same time, it feels full and thick.  I ordered the three pack from Amazon.</li>
            <li> More time needed to use this product -  I really haven&#x27;t decided since everything effects my fine straight hair that has begun thinning -</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice anything but clean hair.</li>
            <li> switched my husband shampoo to this for a while no complains</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it does what it&#x27;s supposed to because both of us in the house in Colorado find it way too drying.</li>
            <li> Every person may have different results but as for me I started taking thyroid medication and had been warned about hair loss. My professional hairdresser recommended that i take Biotin supplements and buy shampoo with Biotin in it as well to combat the problem.I did as she suggested and I have to say that I now have the longest and healthiest hair than I have had In 24 years. This works and my husband loves the product as well.</li>
            <li> It seems they&#x27;ve changed the formula since I bought this shampoo last. It&#x27;s runnier and takes a lot more product to work up a lather in my hair. The consistency is similar to aloe gel. I still really like the shampoo, but I may start looking for something more concentrated so I don&#x27;t have to use as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, shoulder-length hair and need at least a tablespoon to get a full lather. Now I go through the shampoo so quickly it&#x27;s not cost-effective.</li>
            <li> This shampoo used to make my hair so thick and beautiful. This new formula does not make my hair thick. It is limp. Please bring back the old formula.</li>
            <li> This is the shampoo invented. At first I wasn&#x27;t really sure, but then after I started using it more and more I realized just how thick it was making my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> Package says 70 percent organic ingredients . . .nice. It smells yum. Doesn&#x27;t sud up like chemical products, due to the absence of lauryl sulfate. That is what I wanted though. After getting used to that difference, it is just like any other shampoo . . .minus the animal and earth hurting parts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced dramatic diffuse hair loss due to telogen effluvium. Since using this shampoo, about two weeks now, I seem to be shedding less hair in the shower. I&#x27;m not sure about it&#x27;s thickening effect. Time will tell. Also, my scalp and hair feel very clean after using it.</li>
            <li> No more dandruff with this shampoo. However, it can leave hair too dry but nothing a little hair product can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> My husband, age 72, has had a problem with losing hair in recent years. He also has very fine limp hair. After using this shampoo, I noticed the fullness of his hair and he hasn&#x27;t lost hair since using this product. He also uses the conditioner.  My husband shampoos his hair daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is NO shampoo on the market that will regrow hair despite what the infomericals tout. But by using this shampoo you can maintain the hair you do have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then decided to try it on myself. Yes, I have had some hair thinning too (age 65). Since using this shampoo, my hair never looked so good. Full volume and it is wonderful smelling. Light not perfumey.  I was breaking out on my scalp but not anymore. This shampoo treats your scalp also. I do not use the conditioner as the shampoo leaves my hair very soft, which is enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that the ingredients are organic. No sulfates, etc. I found that purchasing the 3 pack from Amazon.com works out to be a good savings.  For the price I would pay for 2 bottles, I get an extra bottle free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are sold on this product and would highly recommend it to anyone with hair and/or scalp problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently purchased this product.  I&#x27;ve always had extremely thick hair until about 2 years ago when I noticed that it was thinning a lot, especially on top.  Since using this shampoo for only about 2 weeks, I&#x27;ve found that it does make my hair appear thicker.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it also appears to be drying my hair.  Since I already have dry hair, I now find that I need a product to help with the dryness.</li>
            <li> This product is excelente!&lt;br /&gt;I will use it forever...&lt;br /&gt;My hair is much more better after I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;.......</li>
            <li> My hair feels so much cleaner and thicker.  Non irratating as well.  Also love the scent.</li>
            <li> WARNING:  Contains sodium coco-sulfate.  The bottle claims no harsh sulfates,  however sodium coco sulfate is essentially a lesser refined version of sodium lauryl sulfate which is a very harsh sulfate (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate).  Essentially sodium coco sulfate just foams less but is still quite harsh for the hair.  So if you are about the sulfates caveat emptor!    It cleans my hair which is what I bought it for.  It doesnt do any of the things other reviewers have said and I wouldnt expect it to since it is shampoo.  I didnt notice any particular change in my hair except for the fact that it remains clean as always ;).</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. I remember having thin hair for quite a while in my adolescent years (unfortunately for me, my parents have the pictures to prove it)- it would get oily really easily, and after finding out that washing daily was unhealthy, I decided to find a solution. This wasn&#x27;t the first biotin shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s certainly my favorite. I like the way it smells and it really seems to have made a difference in my hair texture- it&#x27;s kind of wild looking, now, and I actually love just letting it do it&#x27;s thing.</li>
            <li> to achieve a smooth, tangle-free hair, you have to use a lot of amount.  It leaves a nice scent on your hair. Decrease hairfall was observed if used with avalon biotin shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was running out of my last bottle of the old formulation which I purchased a little over half a year ago. I have been very happy with the old formulation. The new formulation (70% organic) is awful and drying and feels nothing similar to the old. I recently ordered another 3-set thing and received the new set unexpectedly. I really wanted the old one and I wish amazon had updated the description to say that the ones being shipped out is the new formulation or else I will not have purchased. Planning on returning the shipment soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month now. I purchased it on 9/13/12. It seemed to thicken my hair a bit right away, and I think that&#x27;s because it dries it out a bit (which is fine for me b/c I have naturally oily hair and live in a humid climate). The last year or so my hair has been thinning diffusely and especially around my temples and hairline (just turned 30), especially when I pull it back. In the last few days I&#x27;ve suddenly noticed the temple and hair line areas are full of short (1/4-1/2 inch), normal texture new hair! My widows peak is even coming back! I shampoo 3-4 times per week and use the conditioner with it every couple of weeks. I also occasionally take the biotin supplement 5000 mcg/day, but I am not consistent with that and would attribute the improvement in my hair to the regular use of this shampoo. For me the hair loss seemed to be due to hormonal changes and stress and this has kicked my hair back into action. I always had very thick hair (my pony tail was as think as my wrist) and is probably half what it used to be. Thankfully it seems to be on the mend! I will say I noticed more loss the first couple of weeks (so don&#x27;t panic if that happens), but from what I understand that was b/c my hair was entering a growth phrase. It also leaves my hair feeling soft, looking shiny and smelling like lavender. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. From reading other reviews I noticed some saying it made their hair grow faster, I haven&#x27;t had that effect, but I am still a fan. Good luck!</li>
            <li> The volume of hair seems thicker, though I am still losing hair.</li>
            <li> Quality and price...Green decision</li>
            <li> longtime user of these products.</li>
            <li> Do your homework! The stuff you&#x27;re trying to avoid with an organic shampoo is the stuff that makes a shampoo lather. This doesn&#x27;t lather well but it doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have baby fine hair, I can wrap a small elastic around my pony at least twice. I&#x27;ve been using it now for 3 months and I definitely notice a difference. I don&#x27;t think my hair is getting thicker but the volume makes it appear that it has. I also use the conditioner even though I don&#x27;t think it works as a conditioner that well. I believe you should use joining products if you expect results.  I do need to use an additional detangler after I get out of the shower.  I use an all natural argan oil based product.</li>
            <li> Ithinnk the formula has changed since I previously purchased this item, but I still like the smell and the results.  I used it after giving birth to my children, to combat the the hairloss.</li>
            <li> This product was awful, but might be good for your horse&#x27;s hair! I have been out looking for a grate organic shampoo &amp; conditioner set for weak fine hair, so when I saw this product get such high reviews I was convinced that this was it! NOT!! The shampoo smells kinda funky, it is super runny but does foam a little. It feel like the shampoo does it&#x27;s job by stripping all the dirt and oils (good &amp; bad) from the hair leaving it super gangly and unmanageably. This shampoo seems more like a clarify product one would use occasionally. The conditioner is not much better and does not make up for the dry, stringy, hair left after shampooing. It is pretty thick in texture and smells okay, but this particular set sucks,  I would never buy this product again. If your not already a user &amp; want to try it, I recommend just sampling it by purchasing the smallest amount as possible before spend $20 on 3-14oz bottles, I wished it worked for me but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Both of my kids and I have thin fine hair. It smells really nice and lathers up in the shower, but you do not smell it when hair is dry and none of us have noticed that its made our hair thicker looking...</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Used it for years.</li>
            <li> i purchased it and used it for a while but didn&#x27;t really feel that it thickened my hair, however i went through an incident where my head scalp got oily and this was the only shampoo that solved the problem :)</li>
            <li> Husband uses this product. He feels his hair is in better shape and less&lt;br /&gt;fly away than before.  Came packed very well and quickly.</li>
            <li> I think this shampoo would be great for someone who suffers from dry scalp issues.  I have fine hair and found that this shampoo did not clean very well. I found the smell to be a bit overpowering. It does not provide any volume... I  found that my hair felt very weighed down.  Some positives would be that my hair did not fall out as much in the shower, my hair was very silky and soft. If you do decide to give this shampoo a try I would suggest to use it a few times before you make your mind up on it... My first wash with it made my hair very dry... 2nd wash very weighed down.. 3rd wash I started noticing the health of my hair improve.</li>
