            <li> I had just started having some really bad dandruff when I moved from the US to Australia. No shampoo that I had tried in the US was working. My husband and I were shopping in Woolworth&#x27;s in our home town and I noticed that they had this new shampoo on the shelf. I gave it a go, and OMG it totally got rid of the dandruff and itchy scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to use it everyday for about 2 weeks before I felt like everything was under control, but after that every other day was sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After moving back to the US, I could not find this shampoo anywhere, so I tried using another product. Even using this other really strong dandruff shampoo, my flakes came back. I am currently in the process of doing my two weeks of everyday use, but I can already tell that thing are getting better.</li>
            <li> It took long to come here. I used the shampoo while I was living in germany and it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> Very pleased...it makes my thinning hair look thicker and I have shared it with my son who also likes it.  Leaves hair very clean.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a horrible product. Like other hair loss sufferers, I have tried  the gamut of products, and based on great reviews decided to give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Bottle opened in the mail, I got half a bottle and the package was nearly soaked through; I almost got no product. After using it, I now wish I&#x27;d gotten no product and gotten a refund instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It was horrible as a product. It was HEAVILY PERFUMED. I am a woman and it smells STRONGLY of really bad male cologne. It caused my hair to reek of this every time I used it. I began washing twice, first with this and then with my normal shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I was also washing twice because this left my hair greasy with residue, and stringy. It reduced the volume of my hair and did not rinse clean. It made my hair look notably worse if used alone and not-rewashed with a normal shampoo (Medeceuticals is what I use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Low quality ingredients including lauryl sulfates and parabens. These ingredients are part of the problem in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really bad experience. I do not recommend and it did not help my hair in any way. Indeed, made it worse. I used the remaining half bottle to get my moneys worth, but for no other reason.</li>
            <li> tried different shampoos for dandruff, met with minimal success. tried this and it has worked the best so far. on a scale of 1-10 this product is a ten plus. already purchased this item multiple times</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I tried many other shampoos and this one is only right to me! It works and recommend if you have trouble with your hair.</li>
            <li> if you have hair losing. this is what u need do not wast ur time and ur hair. all u need to do is keep using it</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;Works very well&lt;br /&gt;Affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Rough on the eyes, more so than other shampoos, keep your head back while the shampoo is sitting.</li>
            <li> The quantity is rather small and the international shipping kind of stinks but it arrived pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;USE: It is suggested to leave in for 2 minutes and then rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;Effects: There&#x27;s no cooling or menthol effect (the product does have menthol as an ingredient). The smell is pretty good. I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my dandruff. I am about halfway through the bottle. The smell is ok, but not as good as others said it was.&lt;br /&gt;Results: None really. I will finish off this bottle and try a TEA TREE OIL shampoo for my dandruff. I have heard that works.</li>
            <li> It actually seems to work unlike Nioxin.</li>
            <li> i like this shampoo very much, it helped me to improve my hair, and tit helped to end with dundraff</li>
            <li> i like this product, i wont know if it helps with the thinning of my hair for a while, but it seems good</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking that it might help me with my seborrheic dermatitis. I have been trying countless shampoos over the years and nothing seems to calm my flare-ups, itchiness and redness. I invested money in this shampoo that looked promising.  I have so far used it 5 times and I can tell that I do not find it helpful at all. Maybe with hair loss is ok, but for dandruff/dermatitis is horrible. My whole scalp is red and flaky . No No No No No</li>
            <li> Perfect thank you for fast shipping</li>
            <li> Not sure about hair loss part, but it definitely stopped my dandruff, so I would recommend it based on that part</li>
            <li> Never in my life did i wear a black shirt, untill i started using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Now i put on a black shirt without worrying about people coming up to me, and asking if its snowing outside..</li>
            <li> I started using Alpecin while living in Europe last year.  My hair is doing great.  It&#x27;s thicker and healthier than its been for a while and my landing strip of light hair is fading away. The best thing I can say though is that my dandruff is completely gone.  GONE!  This shampoo does what other shampoos have never been able to do for me.  Alpecin has gotten rid of my itchy scalp and all the little flakes.  Since using Alpecin I can wear black again without worries and I&#x27;ve grown my hair longer because I&#x27;m not worried about it falling out!  5 Stars Indeed!  The only place you can get this in the USA is Amazon.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for the last three months and have noticed that the hair density is not decreasing anymore.  As a matter of fact the number of follicles per square inch seems to have recovered much more.</li>
            <li> Female, I have seborrheic dermatitis flareups and hair loss. I have tried all kinds of shampoos to control the SD (ketoconazole, zinc pyrithoine, selsun blue, salicylic acid); i bought this on my last trip to Switzerland and it makes my scalp feel great! no trace of pain or itchiness, or flakes. I haven&#x27;t felt this comfortable in a long time. The caffein complex also gives my hair lots of volume which helps with styling.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo cleans well without stripping; yes it does smell like men&#x27;s cologne but the scent dissipates after drying so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I wish they would not put sulfates and parabens in the formula (I took 1 star off) but I&#x27;m still going to use it, it&#x27;s hard to get piroctone olamine shampoos in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from scalp SD this is definitely worth keeping in your arsenal, the price is right on Amazon (I paid 9.90CHF per bottle at a drugstore).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great and useful for us to do good by</li>
            <li> Great product , had used Nizoral and this product beats it. I have less flaking and also my hair looks and smells better. I suffer from hair loss and this product seems to improve my condition</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I tried many other shampoos such as H&amp;S ,....and this one is only right to me!&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;It is cheap but it works more that expensive products in the market.&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend it to anybody that wants to get rid of dandruff.</li>
