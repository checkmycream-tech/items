    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Else the waterpik works flawlessly</li>
            <li>Waterpik brand is the best!!!</li>
            <li>Best thing we ever invested in for the health of our teeth - our gums.</li>
            <li>plus S&amp;H. If the motor holds out for another 5 years, I&#x27;ll be very happy.</li>
            <li>Excellent product indeed.</li>
            <li>This is a great Water pik!</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>I am so suprised because my dentist said it was the best thing going.  </li>
            <li>But I am impressed with this unit.</li>
            <li>Product cleans teeth perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect for me because I have a number of crowns and food gets stuck to the underside of the crowns as my gums recede.  </li>
            <li>A very good buy and as been advised by our dentist, we need to use a water pick everytime we brush teeth.</li>
            <li>A very good product for this purpose.</li>
            <li>Great transaction with speedy delivery and a very good price!</li>
            <li>We laughed a lot while trying to figure it out--there was water EVERYWHERE!  </li>
            <li>The 1st one worked great for 2 years then the hose cracked.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it a piece of junk as others have because it works great when it works.</li>
            <li>It works great for my sinuses.  </li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>great service.</li>
            <li>The product worked great, when it worked.  </li>
            <li>It worked great.</li>
            <li>It came ahead of your commitment time and is working out great.</li>
            <li>Works Great, It is noisy but does a great job of removing food particles from the teeth.  </li>
            <li>This was a great product and did a great job until this morning (it stopped working).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>the best way to keep your teeth healthy.</li>
            <li>this product works great and looks good.  </li>
            <li>I too loved the way this cleans, but also found that mine broke after about 6 months (the curly hose detached from the handheld unit).</li>
            <li>The dentist always comments on how good my gums look.</li>
            <li>It has a selection of pressures, and good size reservoir and the tip conveniently rotates.</li>
            <li>Does a good job of removing food particles from gums and teeth, but wears out and needs to be replaced every 6 months or so.  </li>
            <li>Works good, no complaints.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist says that my Waterpik is doing a good job.  </li>
            <li>life&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the product is great and the price is good, but I will go to Amazon more if I see all the terms (price, tax and delivery date) before I submit.</li>
            <li>I am a happy and satisfied customer of Amazon........</li>
            <li>I concur with most reviewers that the waterpik works great when it works.</li>
            <li>It also makes a great gift for my Grand kids.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the purchase of the Water Pik.  </li>
            <li>this is a great product, wonderful for complete dental hygene.</li>
            <li>Ok so the dentist still thinks that flossing is the best to clean in between teeth</li>
            <li>I must say that it is impressive, and gratifying, to give your teeth the best brushing you know how, then turn on the water jet and watch all the hidden bits of detritus get chased out of their hiding places.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed it and loved the way my teeth and gums felt.</li>
            <li>and it has been extremely effective in keeping my periodontal disease in check.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that it is really effective.</li>
            <li>Nice.  </li>
            <li>The Waterpik is highly effective.  </li>
            <li>I liked them both, when they worked, as they had plenty of pressure.</li>
            <li>Reliable and nice quality.</li>
            <li>Great way to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the Waterpik WP70/70W Family dental water jet and pleased with the Amazon source and service.    </li>
            <li>Very easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The slider on the handle is  a: very easy to bump it up from 2 to 6 and powerwash a gouge in your mouth  </li>
            <li>I have used Waterpik for many years and been an appreciative user.  </li>
            <li>I have been impressed with their durability in general, with a Waterpik I bought 20 years ago still operational</li>
            <li>I had my first WaterPik for over three years and it worked great.</li>
            <li>It works ok.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with my amazon purchase and especially with the price for this water pik.</li>
            <li>I tried to be more conscientious about the way I held the nozzle, and even strapped a tape around the area of attachment.</li>
            <li>And once you learn how to use it properly it makes a wonderful difference in gum health and freshness of breath.  </li>
            <li>This model (70) has been out for many years...</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Waterpik Model WP-70W for many, many years</li>
            <li>We had used a WaterPik for many years and just wore it out.</li>
            <li>Twice I&#x27;ve had the problem of more water beginning to come out of the nozzle swivel than the nozzle itself; once or twice the switch became hung and wouldn&#x27;t move.</li>
            <li>The unit is quite noisy, and I&#x27;m sure that could be improved.    </li>
            <li>I have owned and used Waterpik oral irrigator products for many years.</li>
            <li>but it sure does get stuff out that brushing couldn&#x27;t remove.</li>
            <li>Has more power than I can use.</li>
            <li>Seems to make my gums feel better also.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than periodontic treatments on the budget.</li>
            <li>We Love it.</li>
            <li>I am not at all pleased.</li>
            <li>So you are stuck having to order the WaterPik replacement hose at top dollar.  </li>
            <li>If you want the most cleaning power this is it.</li>
            <li>Both died in about two years though, one with a hose leak, and my latest one, which died today, leaking in the attachment handle.  </li>
            <li>sure wish I could get more than 2 years out of these units.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the unit works okay.</li>
            <li>Hope I can find something better.</li>
            <li>I have been using oral irrigation appliances for years and this one is outstanding in both quality and cost.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been sitting on the counter taking up space while I search for replacement parts, but the hose seems integral to the handle, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement hose for this model.    </li>
            <li>It should go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 but the one on mine is more like 1, 2, 5, 5, 5, 6    </li>
            <li>Maybe another product will work better.</li>
            <li>I have used WaterPik Dental Water Jets for many years.</li>
            <li>Comes with four color-coded jet tips so each person knows which one is his or hers, perfect for the entire family.</li>
            <li>works great and has for years but will wake up the whole house while you use it.</li>
            <li>With a chemistry background, I&#x27;m very familiar with the difference between disintegration crumbling and breakage.  </li>
            <li>If you are in the use-and-toss category then I would rate this higher as it did do a good job.  </li>
            <li>Good and easily adjustable pressure, easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product for helping maintain good gum and teeth maintenance.</li>
            <li>I used the old Water Pik irrigators for many years: they performed very well and the quality was excellent.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;special tools\\&quot; needed are screwdrivers!</li>
            <li>A WaterPik is a very useful for dental care, but this unit could be much better designed and manufactured.</li>
            <li>We have had other ones but like this one the best.</li>
            <li>Each unit makes a lot of noise but has the most power to clean...</li>
            <li>the on/off switch is easy to operate (unlike the wp90).  </li>
            <li>Way better than flossing and our teeth feel really clean as well.</li>
            <li>Cord stores easily.  </li>
            <li>the water pick accessory is slim and easy to position just where it is needed.</li>
            <li>Replacement of the whole unit is more cost effective than pump replacement.</li>
            <li>such a great price for a very useful appliance - my gums are happier already!</li>
            <li>The first one was really noisy, but it did a great job.</li>
            <li>I think that it is available in Amazon Market Place as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this unit for several years and up until this week it has worked great.</li>
            <li>I found how important the quality of the Waterpik was.</li>
            <li>This was a great device for several years.</li>
            <li>The handpiece is cheaply molded onto the tubing and can&#x27;t be disassembled for repair, and the parts don&#x27;t seem to be available.</li>
            <li>The closest I came is some rubber windshield washer hose (avaiable at auto parts stores, cheap)</li>
            <li>This unit is the most powerful on the market.</li>
            <li>yes I did have to to lube the pump and shorten the hose once after about three years, but these things are so cheap to buy, so</li>
            <li>More powerful.</li>
            <li>The older ones from my same family model worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>this is better than the new model with the pressure control built into the tower because its way more convenient.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t remember what my original purchase price was</li>
            <li>This is my first impression with it, I&#x27;ll add more if I change my mind.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted many years.</li>
            <li>even if I brush and floss first, the pik cleans more material from my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a special attachment for it.  </li>
            <li>&quot; Yeah right!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming this is true for all models made by the company,</li>
            <li>This was my first dental water jet and while the water jet works fine, the control to change the pressure of the water jet is on the handle used to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t increase the cost much, but is more environmental friendly and the right thing to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>The Waterpik WP-70W turned out to be a good, powerful dental tool that seems to be cleaning my teeth far better than my old manual or even my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But, other than that we think its great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more entertaining than regular flossing.  </li>
            <li>It is super.</li>
            <li>The noises and rattling lead me to believe that I&#x27;ll be lucky to get a year&#x27;s usage from it.</li>
            <li>Wish there was a way to quiet the sound as it is used but how it works is still more important.</li>
            <li>They last a really long time and do the best job--buy one!</li>
            <li>it is very easy to use, very reasonably priced and hnopefully will help my teeth and gums from getting too old!</li>
            <li>It blows off plaque like no other and it is the most powerful model available.</li>
            <li>It allows you to control the speed which is very important for those with sensitive or bleeding gums.</li>
            <li>I purchased the WaterPik Ultra, and I am pleased with the design, size and operation thus far.  </li>
            <li>Powerful stream blasting junk from between one&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li>If it lasts a year, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It was also so powerful it could have been substituted as a paint stripper on the highest setting.</li>
            <li>On my most recent purchase, the handle head turns smoothly so the cord doesn&#x27;t twist and after being used, the water drains out of the cord more completely.</li>
            <li>Spray is powerful and gets in places I have been too yet.    </li>
            <li>It may, however, be partially responsible for my recent good dental checkups.</li>
            <li>I will try to find an alternate hose to repair the unit with, one that is more flexible and longer than the original hose.  </li>
            <li>This one gets it right.  </li>
            <li>and I must use it with the unit sitting right by the sink.     </li>
            <li>I have used WaterPik Dental Water Jets for many, many years and typically have to replace every two or three years.  </li>
            <li>i like this better than toothpicks or dental floss as its much more sanitary and really gets into tight cracks along the gum line.</li>
            <li>This is a great device for cleaning between teeth and hard to reach places that your toothbrush misses.</li>
            <li>This is our 3rd unit over many years.</li>
            <li>The latest one I have is a lot quieter than earlier ones.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described. . .</li>
            <li>Water Pik is apparently aware of the problem and has a replacement handle kit for about $9</li>
            <li>Our first unit lasted about almost 2 months.</li>
            <li>The quality of this Water Pik has dropped dramatically since I purchased my first one years ago.</li>
            <li>The first having sprung a leak where the hose joins the handle after two years.</li>
            <li>After you do this about a dozen times you are ready to scream!  </li>
            <li>My first units lasted about 3yrs until the end piece came off at the connection.</li>
            <li>The water pic saved saved my teeth over twenty years ago, I think dentists don&#x27;t want people to know about these because it costs them to much business!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better at getting below the gumline, but doesn&#x27;t do as well above it.</li>
            <li>I always followed the directions in the manual exactly as written.</li>
            <li>I am currently searching for a better alternative to Waterpik.</li>
            <li>My friend has a different model and her pressure control is on the unit body instead of the handle, which is a better choice, but I did not know this when I purchased mine.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it till it quits, but next time, I&#x27;ll know more about what to look for in a dental water jet.</li>
            <li>It did work pretty well as for getting in between the teeth but breaking after</li>
            <li>While I think the product concept is a good one, and it really provides a superior oral cleaning, it&#x27;s a piece of junque that reeks of manufacturing corner cutting.    </li>
            <li>Now this is a very useful tool, it really makes a diference when compared against normal teethbrush and dental floss</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud, but it gets my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>It was simple enough to do and offered an opportunity to give the unit a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to use it, but wish more that I would have started long ago.</li>
            <li>When I told them it wasn&#x27;t worth the cost they suggested that I buy a new machine - for about $60.00.</li>
            <li>If I paid the listed retail of $50, I feel like it should have certainly lasted longer.</li>
            <li>Its noisy, certainly couldn&#x27;t use it if someone was asleep in the house.  </li>
            <li>I ended up tossing the whole unit and buying a new (more quiet) model.</li>
            <li>When I asked the customer service rep from Waterpik why I couldn&#x27;t repair the machine myself as I had done many times in the past, I was told \\&quot;special tools are needed.\\</li>
            <li>I bought 2, and getting ready to get one as a gift.</li>
            <li>The basic idea of cleaning with a pulsed water jet seems sound to me.</li>
            <li>I really recommend  a water irrigation device as an adjunct to brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li>The others don&#x27;t have as much power and don&#x27;t blow out as well under bridges and through braces.</li>
            <li>It really gives you that just flossed feeling.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very noisy.  </li>
            <li>Waterpick working very well.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd unit of this same kind.</li>
            <li>I never found the extra attachments very useful as I just use the water pick if I have something under the gum-line that I can&#x27;t otherwise get to.</li>
            <li>This new unit is much quieter than my previous one and it seems more powerful also.  </li>
            <li>just like with Sears, I buy almost everything from Amazon from books, CD to DVD and many other necessities.</li>
            <li>It came as scheduled and was a better price than any other source.  </li>
            <li>It seems other manufacturers don&#x27;t do any better than WaterPik in addressing customer needs.</li>
            <li>&quot; BY the time you pay for shipping and the repair facility&#x27;s charges, you could buy a new machine!</li>
            <li>WaterPik makes another (and a bit more expensive) model that has somewhat better reviews.</li>
            <li>Now it just emits a steady hum.</li>
            <li>I was so disappointed, as it was wonderful the first five times.</li>
            <li>The main cover comes off with plastic tabs at the bottom of the unit that need to be depressed.  </li>
            <li>I got about 6 months of light (single person-once-a-day) use before it quit.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>A high speed jet will detachb the gum from the teeth causing the root to be exposed to attack by bacteris thus causing decay of the tooth.</li>
            <li>and most importantly; no baboons were injured in making this reply[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Despite the relatively short lifespan, I thought the product was worth it considering the dirt-cheap price.</li>
            <li>When my family first bought a Water Pik irrigation appliance back in the sixties, it was a very well crafted piece of equipment.  </li>
            <li>It really does clean in places the brush can&#x27;t reach, and if your teeth are tightly packed (like mine), it is much easier than flossing.  </li>
            <li>Well, I just got my new WaterPik (same model) and it isn&#x27;t nearly as powerful.</li>
            <li>While most of the reviews that I read on this product were somewhat negative, my experience with the Waterpik has always been positive.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could have just bought a new plastic hose.</li>
            <li>It costs almost as much as a new unit to replace them.</li>
            <li>NEW \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot; ... a world of difference.  </li>
            <li>I asked the repair guy \\&quot;Hey mister, if you had a two year old car that needed a new radiator hose, would you junk the car and buy a new one?</li>
            <li>The new hose coupling piece would not stay put in the old hose section as this area was brittle and cracking plastic.</li>
            <li>They made a simple machine that was extremely easy to use much more difficult.</li>
            <li>So I bought the replacement hose on-line (about $15 with shipping for a 50 cent part!!!) and opened up the unit (have to use a couple small screwdrivers to pry open the tabs on the bottom, but pretty easy).  </li>
            <li>Too many little attachments for the storage space in the lid on the individual model.  </li>
            <li>It does what it is designed to do, but you have to be very careful about the setting, it can be strong enough to make tender gums bleed a bit.  </li>
            <li>My advice, based on my experience is to steer clear of this one.      </li>
            <li>I solved that problem by fixing the control in place with a strip of clear duct tape.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud</li>
            <li>I have an old one at another sink</li>
            <li>Add that to the fact that it is loud as heck, and I don&#x27;t understand how this retails for $40+.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Waterpik really need to redesign the host/handle and reenforce the host where it connects to the handle, so that it last longer.</li>
            <li>Its apparently short service life does leave much to be desired though.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my E.N.T. doctor because I get frequent sinus infections.  </li>
            <li>I do use the old units in my shop.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Waterpik to replace my old waterpik which was working</li>
            <li>Our old unit performed the cleaning with a \\&quot;volume\\&quot; of water, thus flushing out anything between thec teth.</li>
            <li>I purchased this \\&quot;Water Pic\\&quot; as a replacement for one that was about twenty years old.</li>
            <li>The old one still worked, but the plastic hose leaked, and got water everywhere.</li>
            <li>I really like that it gives a stong stream of water to loosen food from inbetween my back teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I really think there&#x27;s room left in the market (the aging-boomer-healthcare market that is) for a quality, well-made dental irrigator.  </li>
            <li>Only complaint I have is that it make kind of loud noise for its size.</li>
            <li>Be sure to read the instructions on how to use prior to using or you will have a mess on the counter and mirror!</li>
            <li>I firmly believe that WaterPik could easily provide their units with a higher quality plastic supply line that doesn&#x27;t get brittle after just a few years use, but they won&#x27;t do that because they want you to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>If I go for a few days without using it, my teeth don&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li>My last one lasted longer (a year and a half) than many others, but still this is too short.</li>
            <li>The handle opened with difficulty on the main vertical seam using a screwdriver to pry it open, and I will probably have to glue that together again.</li>
            <li>I only use them once or twice a week, so that&#x27;s a pretty short working life span, I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li>big improvement of the older model.</li>
            <li>I finally found it here on Amazon and will now make it my first choice when looking for specific items!  </li>
            <li>If you need to repair your unit, be careful in removing the hose in the handle and the main unit as the nipple is pretty thin and can easily break.</li>
            <li>If you turn up the pressure to get more volume, the water jet is very hard on the gums.</li>
            <li>Although they haven&#x27;t really varied all that much across the models, this one seems to be a little nicer overall.</li>
            <li>wish we were back with our old unit and not this supposed newer technology.</li>
            <li>I replaced a five year old of the same model and this one is showing where Waterpick has made improvements in it.</li>
            <li>The entire old hose needs to be replaced since you can&#x27;t make it flexible enough to seal around the coupling link.</li>
            <li>And after reading comments on the lower pressure and decreased durability of the latest model (\\&quot;Ultra Dental\\&quot;) I opted to try to repair my current unit.  </li>
            <li>Now the machine - with total flight hours of, what?, maybe a few hours worth of use?</li>
            <li>only a few uses isn&#x27;t really worth it.      </li>
            <li>one I&#x27;ve just ordered will be my third or fourth, but they have all worked fine for at least three years each.</li>
            <li>They do last only a few years, but it&#x27;s well worth the 3 cents a day to use.</li>
            <li>i removes more dirty out of the little corners and can even clean your toungue.</li>
            <li>When I called the authorized repair center and tried to purchase a new hose, they wouldn&#x27;t sell it to me and wanted me to send in the entire machine so they could relace the hose - a 5 minute job.</li>
            <li>because it was impossible to find the \\&quot;old style\\&quot; we liked.  </li>
            <li>My Water Pik sounds like a little jackhammer running, the tubing to the handpiece is stiff and tangles easily, and... mine sprang a leak where the tubing enters the handpiece after about four months.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Else the waterpik works flawlessly</li>
            <li> Waterpik brand is the best!!!</li>
            <li> Best thing we ever invested in for the health of our teeth - our gums.</li>
            <li> plus S&amp;H. If the motor holds out for another 5 years, I&#x27;ll be very happy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product indeed.</li>
            <li> This is a great Water pik!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> I am so suprised because my dentist said it was the best thing going.  </li>
            <li> But I am impressed with this unit.</li>
            <li> Product cleans teeth perfectly.  </li>
            <li> This is perfect for me because I have a number of crowns and food gets stuck to the underside of the crowns as my gums recede.  </li>
            <li> A very good buy and as been advised by our dentist, we need to use a water pick everytime we brush teeth.</li>
            <li> A very good product for this purpose.</li>
            <li> Great transaction with speedy delivery and a very good price!</li>
            <li> We laughed a lot while trying to figure it out--there was water EVERYWHERE!  </li>
            <li> The 1st one worked great for 2 years then the hose cracked.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it a piece of junk as others have because it works great when it works.</li>
            <li> It works great for my sinuses.  </li>
            <li> great product.</li>
            <li> great service.</li>
            <li> The product worked great, when it worked.  </li>
            <li> It worked great.</li>
            <li> It came ahead of your commitment time and is working out great.</li>
            <li> Works Great, It is noisy but does a great job of removing food particles from the teeth.  </li>
            <li> This was a great product and did a great job until this morning (it stopped working).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> the best way to keep your teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> this product works great and looks good.  </li>
            <li> I too loved the way this cleans, but also found that mine broke after about 6 months (the curly hose detached from the handheld unit).</li>
            <li> The dentist always comments on how good my gums look.</li>
            <li> It has a selection of pressures, and good size reservoir and the tip conveniently rotates.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of removing food particles from gums and teeth, but wears out and needs to be replaced every 6 months or so.  </li>
            <li> Works good, no complaints.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist says that my Waterpik is doing a good job.  </li>
            <li> life&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the product is great and the price is good, but I will go to Amazon more if I see all the terms (price, tax and delivery date) before I submit.</li>
            <li> I am a happy and satisfied customer of Amazon........</li>
            <li> I concur with most reviewers that the waterpik works great when it works.</li>
            <li> It also makes a great gift for my Grand kids.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the purchase of the Water Pik.  </li>
            <li> this is a great product, wonderful for complete dental hygene.</li>
            <li> Ok so the dentist still thinks that flossing is the best to clean in between teeth</li>
            <li> I must say that it is impressive, and gratifying, to give your teeth the best brushing you know how, then turn on the water jet and watch all the hidden bits of detritus get chased out of their hiding places.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed it and loved the way my teeth and gums felt.</li>
            <li> and it has been extremely effective in keeping my periodontal disease in check.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that it is really effective.</li>
            <li> Nice.  </li>
            <li> The Waterpik is highly effective.  </li>
            <li> I liked them both, when they worked, as they had plenty of pressure.</li>
            <li> Reliable and nice quality.</li>
            <li> Great way to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the Waterpik WP70/70W Family dental water jet and pleased with the Amazon source and service.    </li>
            <li> Very easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The slider on the handle is  a: very easy to bump it up from 2 to 6 and powerwash a gouge in your mouth  </li>
            <li> I have used Waterpik for many years and been an appreciative user.  </li>
            <li> I have been impressed with their durability in general, with a Waterpik I bought 20 years ago still operational</li>
            <li> I had my first WaterPik for over three years and it worked great.</li>
            <li> It works ok.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy with my amazon purchase and especially with the price for this water pik.</li>
            <li> I tried to be more conscientious about the way I held the nozzle, and even strapped a tape around the area of attachment.</li>
            <li> And once you learn how to use it properly it makes a wonderful difference in gum health and freshness of breath.  </li>
            <li> This model (70) has been out for many years...</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Waterpik Model WP-70W for many, many years</li>
            <li> We had used a WaterPik for many years and just wore it out.</li>
            <li> Twice I&#x27;ve had the problem of more water beginning to come out of the nozzle swivel than the nozzle itself; once or twice the switch became hung and wouldn&#x27;t move.</li>
            <li> The unit is quite noisy, and I&#x27;m sure that could be improved.    </li>
            <li> I have owned and used Waterpik oral irrigator products for many years.</li>
            <li> but it sure does get stuff out that brushing couldn&#x27;t remove.</li>
            <li> Has more power than I can use.</li>
            <li> Seems to make my gums feel better also.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than periodontic treatments on the budget.</li>
            <li> We Love it.</li>
            <li> I am not at all pleased.</li>
            <li> So you are stuck having to order the WaterPik replacement hose at top dollar.  </li>
            <li> If you want the most cleaning power this is it.</li>
            <li> Both died in about two years though, one with a hose leak, and my latest one, which died today, leaking in the attachment handle.  </li>
            <li> sure wish I could get more than 2 years out of these units.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the unit works okay.</li>
            <li> Hope I can find something better.</li>
            <li> I have been using oral irrigation appliances for years and this one is outstanding in both quality and cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been sitting on the counter taking up space while I search for replacement parts, but the hose seems integral to the handle, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement hose for this model.    </li>
            <li> It should go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 but the one on mine is more like 1, 2, 5, 5, 5, 6    </li>
            <li> Maybe another product will work better.</li>
            <li> I have used WaterPik Dental Water Jets for many years.</li>
            <li> Comes with four color-coded jet tips so each person knows which one is his or hers, perfect for the entire family.</li>
            <li> works great and has for years but will wake up the whole house while you use it.</li>
            <li> With a chemistry background, I&#x27;m very familiar with the difference between disintegration crumbling and breakage.  </li>
            <li> If you are in the use-and-toss category then I would rate this higher as it did do a good job.  </li>
            <li> Good and easily adjustable pressure, easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Other than that, great product for helping maintain good gum and teeth maintenance.</li>
            <li> I used the old Water Pik irrigators for many years: they performed very well and the quality was excellent.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;special tools\\&quot; needed are screwdrivers!</li>
            <li> A WaterPik is a very useful for dental care, but this unit could be much better designed and manufactured.</li>
            <li> We have had other ones but like this one the best.</li>
            <li> Each unit makes a lot of noise but has the most power to clean...</li>
            <li> the on/off switch is easy to operate (unlike the wp90).  </li>
            <li> Way better than flossing and our teeth feel really clean as well.</li>
            <li> Cord stores easily.  </li>
            <li> the water pick accessory is slim and easy to position just where it is needed.</li>
            <li> Replacement of the whole unit is more cost effective than pump replacement.</li>
            <li> such a great price for a very useful appliance - my gums are happier already!</li>
            <li> The first one was really noisy, but it did a great job.</li>
            <li> I think that it is available in Amazon Market Place as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this unit for several years and up until this week it has worked great.</li>
            <li> I found how important the quality of the Waterpik was.</li>
            <li> This was a great device for several years.</li>
            <li> The handpiece is cheaply molded onto the tubing and can&#x27;t be disassembled for repair, and the parts don&#x27;t seem to be available.</li>
            <li> The closest I came is some rubber windshield washer hose (avaiable at auto parts stores, cheap)</li>
            <li> This unit is the most powerful on the market.</li>
            <li> yes I did have to to lube the pump and shorten the hose once after about three years, but these things are so cheap to buy, so</li>
            <li> More powerful.</li>
            <li> The older ones from my same family model worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> this is better than the new model with the pressure control built into the tower because its way more convenient.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t remember what my original purchase price was</li>
            <li> This is my first impression with it, I&#x27;ll add more if I change my mind.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted many years.</li>
            <li> even if I brush and floss first, the pik cleans more material from my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a special attachment for it.  </li>
            <li> &quot; Yeah right!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming this is true for all models made by the company,</li>
            <li> This was my first dental water jet and while the water jet works fine, the control to change the pressure of the water jet is on the handle used to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t increase the cost much, but is more environmental friendly and the right thing to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> The Waterpik WP-70W turned out to be a good, powerful dental tool that seems to be cleaning my teeth far better than my old manual or even my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But, other than that we think its great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more entertaining than regular flossing.  </li>
            <li> It is super.</li>
            <li> The noises and rattling lead me to believe that I&#x27;ll be lucky to get a year&#x27;s usage from it.</li>
            <li> Wish there was a way to quiet the sound as it is used but how it works is still more important.</li>
            <li> They last a really long time and do the best job--buy one!</li>
            <li> it is very easy to use, very reasonably priced and hnopefully will help my teeth and gums from getting too old!</li>
            <li> It blows off plaque like no other and it is the most powerful model available.</li>
            <li> It allows you to control the speed which is very important for those with sensitive or bleeding gums.</li>
            <li> I purchased the WaterPik Ultra, and I am pleased with the design, size and operation thus far.  </li>
            <li> Powerful stream blasting junk from between one&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li> If it lasts a year, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It was also so powerful it could have been substituted as a paint stripper on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> On my most recent purchase, the handle head turns smoothly so the cord doesn&#x27;t twist and after being used, the water drains out of the cord more completely.</li>
            <li> Spray is powerful and gets in places I have been too yet.    </li>
            <li> It may, however, be partially responsible for my recent good dental checkups.</li>
            <li> I will try to find an alternate hose to repair the unit with, one that is more flexible and longer than the original hose.  </li>
            <li> This one gets it right.  </li>
            <li> and I must use it with the unit sitting right by the sink.     </li>
            <li> I have used WaterPik Dental Water Jets for many, many years and typically have to replace every two or three years.  </li>
            <li> i like this better than toothpicks or dental floss as its much more sanitary and really gets into tight cracks along the gum line.</li>
            <li> This is a great device for cleaning between teeth and hard to reach places that your toothbrush misses.</li>
            <li> This is our 3rd unit over many years.</li>
            <li> The latest one I have is a lot quieter than earlier ones.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. . .</li>
            <li> Water Pik is apparently aware of the problem and has a replacement handle kit for about $9</li>
            <li> Our first unit lasted about almost 2 months.</li>
            <li> The quality of this Water Pik has dropped dramatically since I purchased my first one years ago.</li>
            <li> The first having sprung a leak where the hose joins the handle after two years.</li>
            <li> After you do this about a dozen times you are ready to scream!  </li>
            <li> My first units lasted about 3yrs until the end piece came off at the connection.</li>
            <li> The water pic saved saved my teeth over twenty years ago, I think dentists don&#x27;t want people to know about these because it costs them to much business!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better at getting below the gumline, but doesn&#x27;t do as well above it.</li>
            <li> I always followed the directions in the manual exactly as written.</li>
            <li> I am currently searching for a better alternative to Waterpik.</li>
            <li> My friend has a different model and her pressure control is on the unit body instead of the handle, which is a better choice, but I did not know this when I purchased mine.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it till it quits, but next time, I&#x27;ll know more about what to look for in a dental water jet.</li>
            <li> It did work pretty well as for getting in between the teeth but breaking after</li>
            <li> While I think the product concept is a good one, and it really provides a superior oral cleaning, it&#x27;s a piece of junque that reeks of manufacturing corner cutting.    </li>
            <li> Now this is a very useful tool, it really makes a diference when compared against normal teethbrush and dental floss</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud, but it gets my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> It was simple enough to do and offered an opportunity to give the unit a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to use it, but wish more that I would have started long ago.</li>
            <li> When I told them it wasn&#x27;t worth the cost they suggested that I buy a new machine - for about $60.00.</li>
            <li> If I paid the listed retail of $50, I feel like it should have certainly lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Its noisy, certainly couldn&#x27;t use it if someone was asleep in the house.  </li>
            <li> I ended up tossing the whole unit and buying a new (more quiet) model.</li>
            <li> When I asked the customer service rep from Waterpik why I couldn&#x27;t repair the machine myself as I had done many times in the past, I was told \\&quot;special tools are needed.\\</li>
            <li> I bought 2, and getting ready to get one as a gift.</li>
            <li> The basic idea of cleaning with a pulsed water jet seems sound to me.</li>
            <li> I really recommend  a water irrigation device as an adjunct to brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li> The others don&#x27;t have as much power and don&#x27;t blow out as well under bridges and through braces.</li>
            <li> It really gives you that just flossed feeling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very noisy.  </li>
            <li> Waterpick working very well.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd unit of this same kind.</li>
            <li> I never found the extra attachments very useful as I just use the water pick if I have something under the gum-line that I can&#x27;t otherwise get to.</li>
            <li> This new unit is much quieter than my previous one and it seems more powerful also.  </li>
            <li> just like with Sears, I buy almost everything from Amazon from books, CD to DVD and many other necessities.</li>
            <li> It came as scheduled and was a better price than any other source.  </li>
            <li> It seems other manufacturers don&#x27;t do any better than WaterPik in addressing customer needs.</li>
            <li> &quot; BY the time you pay for shipping and the repair facility&#x27;s charges, you could buy a new machine!</li>
            <li> WaterPik makes another (and a bit more expensive) model that has somewhat better reviews.</li>
            <li> Now it just emits a steady hum.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed, as it was wonderful the first five times.</li>
            <li> The main cover comes off with plastic tabs at the bottom of the unit that need to be depressed.  </li>
            <li> I got about 6 months of light (single person-once-a-day) use before it quit.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A high speed jet will detachb the gum from the teeth causing the root to be exposed to attack by bacteris thus causing decay of the tooth.</li>
            <li> and most importantly; no baboons were injured in making this reply[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Despite the relatively short lifespan, I thought the product was worth it considering the dirt-cheap price.</li>
            <li> When my family first bought a Water Pik irrigation appliance back in the sixties, it was a very well crafted piece of equipment.  </li>
            <li> It really does clean in places the brush can&#x27;t reach, and if your teeth are tightly packed (like mine), it is much easier than flossing.  </li>
            <li> Well, I just got my new WaterPik (same model) and it isn&#x27;t nearly as powerful.</li>
            <li> While most of the reviews that I read on this product were somewhat negative, my experience with the Waterpik has always been positive.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could have just bought a new plastic hose.</li>
            <li> It costs almost as much as a new unit to replace them.</li>
            <li> NEW \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot; ... a world of difference.  </li>
            <li> I asked the repair guy \\&quot;Hey mister, if you had a two year old car that needed a new radiator hose, would you junk the car and buy a new one?</li>
            <li> The new hose coupling piece would not stay put in the old hose section as this area was brittle and cracking plastic.</li>
            <li> They made a simple machine that was extremely easy to use much more difficult.</li>
            <li> So I bought the replacement hose on-line (about $15 with shipping for a 50 cent part!!!) and opened up the unit (have to use a couple small screwdrivers to pry open the tabs on the bottom, but pretty easy).  </li>
            <li> Too many little attachments for the storage space in the lid on the individual model.  </li>
            <li> It does what it is designed to do, but you have to be very careful about the setting, it can be strong enough to make tender gums bleed a bit.  </li>
            <li> My advice, based on my experience is to steer clear of this one.      </li>
            <li> I solved that problem by fixing the control in place with a strip of clear duct tape.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud</li>
            <li> I have an old one at another sink</li>
            <li> Add that to the fact that it is loud as heck, and I don&#x27;t understand how this retails for $40+.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Waterpik really need to redesign the host/handle and reenforce the host where it connects to the handle, so that it last longer.</li>
            <li> Its apparently short service life does leave much to be desired though.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my E.N.T. doctor because I get frequent sinus infections.  </li>
            <li> I do use the old units in my shop.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Waterpik to replace my old waterpik which was working</li>
            <li> Our old unit performed the cleaning with a \\&quot;volume\\&quot; of water, thus flushing out anything between thec teth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this \\&quot;Water Pic\\&quot; as a replacement for one that was about twenty years old.</li>
            <li> The old one still worked, but the plastic hose leaked, and got water everywhere.</li>
            <li> I really like that it gives a stong stream of water to loosen food from inbetween my back teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I really think there&#x27;s room left in the market (the aging-boomer-healthcare market that is) for a quality, well-made dental irrigator.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is that it make kind of loud noise for its size.</li>
            <li> Be sure to read the instructions on how to use prior to using or you will have a mess on the counter and mirror!</li>
            <li> I firmly believe that WaterPik could easily provide their units with a higher quality plastic supply line that doesn&#x27;t get brittle after just a few years use, but they won&#x27;t do that because they want you to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> If I go for a few days without using it, my teeth don&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li> My last one lasted longer (a year and a half) than many others, but still this is too short.</li>
            <li> The handle opened with difficulty on the main vertical seam using a screwdriver to pry it open, and I will probably have to glue that together again.</li>
            <li> I only use them once or twice a week, so that&#x27;s a pretty short working life span, I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> big improvement of the older model.</li>
            <li> I finally found it here on Amazon and will now make it my first choice when looking for specific items!  </li>
            <li> If you need to repair your unit, be careful in removing the hose in the handle and the main unit as the nipple is pretty thin and can easily break.</li>
            <li> If you turn up the pressure to get more volume, the water jet is very hard on the gums.</li>
            <li> Although they haven&#x27;t really varied all that much across the models, this one seems to be a little nicer overall.</li>
            <li> wish we were back with our old unit and not this supposed newer technology.</li>
            <li> I replaced a five year old of the same model and this one is showing where Waterpick has made improvements in it.</li>
            <li> The entire old hose needs to be replaced since you can&#x27;t make it flexible enough to seal around the coupling link.</li>
            <li> And after reading comments on the lower pressure and decreased durability of the latest model (\\&quot;Ultra Dental\\&quot;) I opted to try to repair my current unit.  </li>
            <li> Now the machine - with total flight hours of, what?, maybe a few hours worth of use?</li>
            <li> only a few uses isn&#x27;t really worth it.      </li>
            <li> one I&#x27;ve just ordered will be my third or fourth, but they have all worked fine for at least three years each.</li>
            <li> They do last only a few years, but it&#x27;s well worth the 3 cents a day to use.</li>
            <li> i removes more dirty out of the little corners and can even clean your toungue.</li>
            <li> When I called the authorized repair center and tried to purchase a new hose, they wouldn&#x27;t sell it to me and wanted me to send in the entire machine so they could relace the hose - a 5 minute job.</li>
            <li> because it was impossible to find the \\&quot;old style\\&quot; we liked.  </li>
            <li> My Water Pik sounds like a little jackhammer running, the tubing to the handpiece is stiff and tangles easily, and... mine sprang a leak where the tubing enters the handpiece after about four months.  </li>
            <li> Not worth trying to get a new pump for it.    </li>
            <li> but so far other than resorting to duck tape I haven&#x27;t succeeded.</li>
            <li> While the hose broke on my previous model, it was over ten years old</li>
            <li> This is my first attempt at any type of water irrigation device, but I&#x27;m not thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully THIS ONE will last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Maybe a new one lasts a little longer?</li>
            <li> But when I tried attaching the new hose to the little plastic nipple on the pump that it attaches to, the nipple broke.  </li>
            <li> As with anything mechanical, certain parts wear out and the manufacturer used to sell those commonly replaced parts such as hoses and handles on its website.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these WP-70s and noticed off the bat the dramatic change in quality from the original product.  </li>
            <li> I had a newer model (100), it did not last very long and never had the power this unit has.</li>
            <li> The tight and overly rigid curl of the hose means I can&#x27;t stretch the hose far</li>
            <li> But the 2nd one also sprung a leak in the same place after some months of (less than daily) use.</li>
            <li> I read some of the other reviews on this before I bought it, seems alot of people have problems with the hoses and pumps, I&#x27;ve had the same model as this one for the last five years,</li>
            <li> However, once I got the hang of it, I made a lot less mess and really could tell a difference after using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled at the idea of replacing the whole system because a 10 cent piece of plastic broke.  </li>
            <li> It does come with 4 color coded jets, 2 are pink, 2 are blue.</li>
            <li> They changed the design of the new one and it&#x27;s not only harder to use they moved the location of the plastic hose to the right side of the machine making it almost impossible to use by a left handed person without turning the machine every time it&#x27;s used.  </li>
            <li> Hitting one&#x27;s uvula is not pleasant on the higher settings.  </li>
            <li> I had to return my recent purchase due to a defect.  </li>
            <li> neighbors bought the same model, tried to use it a few times and have not tried to use it since for the same reasons we gave.</li>
            <li> Brushing just wasn&#x27;t effective enough between teeth and around the base of the crowns.  </li>
            <li> Once it gets brittle there is no fixing it, as cutting off a little piece on the end and reattaching it to the handle only works for maybe one or two more uses, then it starts leaking</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth to try to collect on the $35 item&#x27;s warrenty, if you have to ship it back to the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I had not used it that long, and did not think I&#x27;d been rough on it.     </li>
            <li> Sprayed up the walls like a loose fire hose, while I panicked to turn it off.  </li>
            <li> Was unable to locate the model Water Pik I wanted locally, ordered the exact one I needed from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> is that it looks slightly cooler and has a smaller footprint.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this model Waterpik for one year now and it just died the same way the previous Waterpik died: the hose became brittle and broke.</li>
            <li> No more, but no less.  </li>
            <li> There is a regular jet and a tongue cleaner for each color, so while there are 4 jet tips, the description is a little misleading.</li>
            <li> The new pulsating action is very poor.</li>
            <li> The WaterPik works well, although selecting a comfortable strength for the water jet can be a little difficult.</li>
            <li> However, this more recent purchase began leaking badly after a little over 2 years.  </li>
            <li> The strength (power?) is controlled by a slider on the handle sucks compared to the old (when I was a kid) way it used to be controlled by a knob on the unit.    </li>
            <li> Just be careful you turn it off before removing the appliance from your mouth.</li>
            <li> But it is not very durable.</li>
            <li> you dont get a few of the extra pieces, but you&#x27;re not buying a pump for the attachments.  </li>
            <li> My dentist warned me that if I didn&#x27;t start using a WaterPik, especially around my bridges and crowns, I was going to have trouble.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last year and used it a few times and put it away.  </li>
            <li> However, the second unit we got leaked water at the base during its first use; so, it went back to Amazon the very same day it arrived our home.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m downgrading it to 4 stars is because the handle leaks a little and the whole device seem just a wee bit cheesy.</li>
            <li> The 2nd one had a weak motor, so we used the 2nd one&#x27;s hose on the 1st one.</li>
            <li> Other products and brands exist.</li>
            <li> No more; now they tell you that there are no user replaceable parts and one must send off the entire unit to an \\&quot;authorized repair facility.\\</li>
            <li> I did try finding some other hose that would work.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d advise trying any of the other brands.    </li>
            <li> Just like the other comments/reviews say here....      </li>
            <li> When I disassembled it, I found that some of the white plastic holding things had crumbled into small pieces.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews that also said quality Waterpik has gone down, I decided not to buy this again.  </li>
            <li> While it performs the same as the older model, I did find the hose on the WP70 to be overly rigid, curled, and awkward.  </li>
            <li> Over all the Water pik is an average product.</li>
            <li> the flow is not nearly as powerful as the plastic tubing.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, you cannot change the hose to the hand unit on this device, you have to throw the whole thing away.</li>
            <li> Before they just pushed in, and now you have to pull down a collar, insert the tip</li>
            <li> All I can say is that if you need a dental irrigator don&#x27;t waste your time and money on any other brand.</li>
            <li> If you do, be VERY careful attaching it to the pump!</li>
            <li> This is a replacement to a previous Waterpik.</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, of the two things that can go wrong with it, local replacement of the handle is only $19.98 and replacement of the pump is $30.00.  </li>
            <li> In both previous units, the hose wore out where it connects to the nozzle and on these units you have to replace both the hose and nozzle.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve owned it less than two months.</li>
            <li> But less than 30 months use is not for me.</li>
            <li> I did purchase another brand for a few dollars less, once.</li>
            <li> But considering that I used it only once or twice a week, it didn&#x27;t take long for the product to fail.  </li>
            <li> A little bit noisy.</li>
            <li> My recommendation is to be patient--it takes a little while to get it all figured out.  </li>
            <li> A little messy and noisy</li>
            <li> Its messy, shoots water everywhere</li>
            <li> The issue with this is the strength of the jet can be accidentally adjusted and if someone has sensitive gums/teeth that could be extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I asked a few dentists for advise -</li>
            <li> I just took it out a few days ago to use it for the 5th time and it sprung a leak on the handle and water</li>
            <li> It is a little noisy, but you need raw power to blow out food particles.</li>
            <li> The small hose to the pick itself seems a little brittle to me.</li>
            <li> And environmentally, the idea of building this half way around the planet and shipping it to the US only to drop it into already overburdened landfills seems somewhat absurd.</li>
            <li> It was just a small piece of plastic where the hose connects to the pump.</li>
            <li> I will definitely miss this product but will not buy again from waterpik unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> In about a year, the hose sprung a small leak.  </li>
            <li> i have one location (way in the back) that is difficult to reach with dental floss.</li>
            <li> My first cracked around the base of the handle and began to leak after 2.5 years.</li>
            <li> I also wonder if some of the problems people have had have been caused by hard water or over clorinated water.</li>
            <li> The gum massage that you receive when using it has helped me a lot and turned around the negative reports I used to get from my dentist.   </li>
            <li> Another complaint is the noise level.</li>
            <li> The product should have a regulator to slow down/speeed up the jet of water.</li>
            <li> We bought the new version of WP-70/WP-70-W and have been very unhappy with the oeration of this unit.</li>
            <li> Actually less expensive than my tooth brush.</li>
            <li> But then a bad leak developed in the jet handle, and it is useless now.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to receive a defective product but began shopping locally for another dental water jet.  </li>
            <li> However, it is difficult to use, extremely messy and the on/off button on handle is difficult to press.  </li>
            <li> I personally would rather have the setting control on the base where it can&#x27;t be accidentally moved.</li>
            <li> Floss shreds and gets stuck between my very close teeth and fillings, which is miserable.</li>
            <li> I bought another brand (Teledyne) about 4 years ago, and was not really happy with the lower cleaning pressure it produced,</li>
            <li> Coincidence, or just poor workmanship?</li>
            <li> The new models are horrible cost reduced version of the originals, built with inferior materials, unreliable and difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> The pressure of course dropped to a useless level even at the highest setting.</li>
            <li> The pump on each one has failed after 6-8 months.  </li>
            <li> I do not want to give it even one lousy star.</li>
            <li> That is laughable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 3-4 of these things and they are very poorly made.  </li>
            <li> This product is so dangerous.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think $35 is too bad of a deal.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> (I wore earplugs) but it served the purpose, UNTil the tube sprung a leak at the base of its permanent attachment to the nozzle piece.</li>
            <li> Removing the hand unit from the base may result in dislodging the water bowl from the base.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great way to clean your teeth. Very easy to use once you get the hang of it. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It works ok.  If you intend to use for dental purposes as well as sinus get.  If just for sinuses, use a netipot.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my amazon purchase and especially with the price for this water pik.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement to a previous Waterpik. In short, this Water Jet eaisly helps remove food sometimes imbedded between teeth at the gumline. It allows you to control the speed which is very important for those with sensitive or bleeding gums. Very easy to use. Just be careful you turn it off before removing the appliance from your mouth. It does spray the water rapidly and could end up on your bathroom mirror. Other than that, great product for helping maintain good gum and teeth maintenance.</li>
            <li> Purchased in February, the motor froze up in June.</li>
            <li> Over all the Water pik is an average product. The product should have a regulator to slow down/speeed up the jet of water. A high speed jet will detachb the gum from the teeth causing the root to be exposed to attack by bacteris thus causing decay of the tooth. Else the waterpik works flawlessly</li>
            <li> A very good buy and as been advised by our dentist, we need to use a water pick everytime we brush teeth. It helps cleanse all the debris flossing does not take away. It also massages the gums to keep it from getting any inflamation.    I am a happy and satisfied customer of Amazon........just like with Sears, I buy almost everything from Amazon from books, CD to DVD and many other necessities.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik WP-70W turned out to be a good, powerful dental tool that seems to be cleaning my teeth far better than my old manual or even my electric toothbrush. Only time will tell whether it is made well enough to last. The small hose to the pick itself seems a little brittle to me.</li>
            <li> 5 Waterpiks in 10 years, only use if for sinus irrigation, so it gets maybe 30 days use a year.    The plastic hose usually goes first and it is a pain to fix. UGH</li>
            <li> I use the Waterpik with a nasal irrigator. A very good product for this purpose.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do. A little bit noisy. This is my second unit. My first cracked around the base of the handle and began to leak after 2.5 years. Overall, an A-minus.</li>
            <li> With braces on my teeth, I needed some way to dislodge food that would stick between the wires. I bought this model.     It&#x27;s loud (I wore earplugs) but it served the purpose, UNTil the tube sprung a leak at the base of its permanent attachment to the nozzle piece. I had not used it that long, and did not think I&#x27;d been rough on it.     I tried to pull the tube out to recut and reattach, but couldn&#x27;t. I foolishly bought a 2nd water pic. I tried to be more conscientious about the way I held the nozzle, and even strapped a tape around the area of attachment. But the 2nd one also sprung a leak in the same place after some months of (less than daily) use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more entertaining than regular flossing.  And once you learn how to use it properly it makes a wonderful difference in gum health and freshness of breath.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs extra dental care.</li>
            <li> This model (70) has been out for many years... I have an old one at another sink I use often. I had a newer model (100), it did not last very long and never had the power this unit has. Each unit makes a lot of noise but has the most power to clean... I use it after each meal... the best way to keep your teeth healthy. Won&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
            <li> I too loved the way this cleans, but also found that mine broke after about 6 months (the curly hose detached from the handheld unit). Add that to the fact that it is loud as heck, and I don&#x27;t understand how this retails for $40+.</li>
            <li> I concur with most reviewers that the waterpik works great when it works. But it is not very durable. It need to be replaced about every 2 years when the hose cracks where it connects to the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received my 3rd waterpik. The 1st one worked great for 2 years then the hose cracked. The 2nd one had a weak motor, so we used the 2nd one&#x27;s hose on the 1st one. The hose cracked again after 2 years. The motor on the 1st one lasted about 3 years. I just got the 3rd one and I expect it the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik really need to redesign the host/handle and reenforce the host where it connects to the handle, so that it last longer. This won&#x27;t increase the cost much, but is more environmental friendly and the right thing to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I found a hose/handle replacement kit in waterpik web site for $9 + $4 shipping. I may try that the next time. I think that it is available in Amazon Market Place as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this unit for several years and up until this week it has worked great. Good and easily adjustable pressure, easy to clean and easy to use. I never found the extra attachments very useful as I just use the water pick if I have something under the gum-line that I can&#x27;t otherwise get to. This means often going weeks or months without use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time I used it was probably several months ago and all was well. I needed it this week and it started pouring water from inside the handle. I tried several times to remove and re-seat the tip to no avail. The pressure of course dropped to a useless level even at the highest setting. All increasing the pressure setting does is increase the amount of water pouring from the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t remember what my original purchase price was but I don&#x27;t think $35 is too bad of a deal. If I paid the listed retail of $50, I feel like it should have certainly lasted longer. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a piece of junk as others have because it works great when it works. Its apparently short service life does leave much to be desired though.</li>
            <li> The waterpik is recommended by our dentists. It is super. If I go for a few days without using it, my teeth don&#x27;t feel clean. The dentist always comments on how good my gums look. This is our 3rd unit over many years.</li>
            <li> While most of the reviews that I read on this product were somewhat negative, my experience with the Waterpik has always been positive.  While the hose broke on my previous model, it was over ten years old and I think someone mishandled it while cleaning the bathroom.  This new unit is much quieter than my previous one and it seems more powerful also.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0001J3U8Y Waterpik WP-70/WP-70W Family Dental Water Jet]]  This is my first attempt at any type of water irrigation device, but I&#x27;m not thrilled.  Its noisy, certainly couldn&#x27;t use it if someone was asleep in the house.  Its messy, shoots water everywhere, I am hoping that with experience will come finesse!  It does what it is designed to do, but you have to be very careful about the setting, it can be strong enough to make tender gums bleed a bit.  This is my first impression with it, I&#x27;ll add more if I change my mind.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my E.N.T. doctor because I get frequent sinus infections.  I ordered a special attachment for it.  It works great for my sinuses.  I also like using it for its intended purpose, a dental instrument.</li>
            <li> Ok so the dentist still thinks that flossing is the best to clean in between teeth but if you&#x27;re not a flosser (like my husband) then this is the way to go!  I enjoyed it and loved the way my teeth and gums felt.</li>
            <li> Was unable to locate the model Water Pik I wanted locally, ordered the exact one I needed from Amazon.  It came as scheduled and was a better price than any other source.  Very pleased with the Waterpik WP70/70W Family dental water jet and pleased with the Amazon source and service.    Bill Johnson</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 3-4 of these things and they are very poorly made.  The pump on each one has failed after 6-8 months.  So, I suggest you go find another brand.  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do!</li>
            <li> I used the old Water Pik irrigators for many years: they performed very well and the quality was excellent.  The new models are horrible cost reduced version of the originals, built with inferior materials, unreliable and difficult to use.  Save your money and avoid frustration-try someting else (I will!!!)</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk.  Why is the company still producing this model?  It wasn&#x27;t even three weeks before it stopped working--no power and it sounds like a jack hammer.  I want to buy another oral irrigator but I&#x27;m reluctant to trust any Waterpik product. I do not want to give it even one lousy star.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth unit I&#x27;ve bought. They do last only a few years, but it&#x27;s well worth the 3 cents a day to use. Actually less expensive than my tooth brush. I did purchase another brand for a few dollars less, once. I found how important the quality of the Waterpik was. It has a selection of pressures, and good size reservoir and the tip conveniently rotates. The latest one I have is a lot quieter than earlier ones. I have had to repair a leaky line. It was simple enough to do and offered an opportunity to give the unit a good cleaning.  Although I do not care to participate in a Throw Away World, I find it still feasible just to replace the unit after a couple years use. I do use the old units in my shop. It also makes a great gift for my Grand kids.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Waterpik to replace my old waterpik which was working but I could no longer get replacement tips for. All I can say is that if you need a dental irrigator don&#x27;t waste your time and money on any other brand. Waterpik brand is the best!!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Waterpik Model WP-70W for many, many years and it has been extremely effective in keeping my periodontal disease in check. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The one I&#x27;ve just ordered will be my third or fourth, but they have all worked fine for at least three years each. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, of the two things that can go wrong with it, local replacement of the handle is only $19.98 and replacement of the pump is $30.00.  Replacement of the whole unit is more cost effective than pump replacement. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bill Adams</li>
            <li> I had to return my recent purchase due to a defect.  I have used WaterPik Dental Water Jets for many, many years and typically have to replace every two or three years.  I was disappointed to receive a defective product but began shopping locally for another dental water jet.  I purchased the WaterPik Ultra, and I am pleased with the design, size and operation thus far.  I just hope WaterPik can maintain quality of their products and that my current purchase will provide another two to three years of service.</li>
            <li> We had used a WaterPik for many years and just wore it out. We bought the new version of WP-70/WP-70-W and have been very unhappy with the oeration of this unit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Apparently,over the years, WaterPik has redesigned their units to give a \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; flow of water. Our old unit performed the cleaning with a \\&quot;volume\\&quot; of water, thus flushing out anything between thec teth. The new pulsating action is very poor. If you turn up the pressure to get more volume, the water jet is very hard on the gums. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I wish we were back with our old unit and not this supposed newer technology.</li>
            <li> A WaterPik is a very useful for dental care, but this unit could be much better designed and manufactured. I&#x27;ve gone through four over the years. My last one lasted longer (a year and a half) than many others, but still this is too short. Twice I&#x27;ve had the problem of more water beginning to come out of the nozzle swivel than the nozzle itself; once or twice the switch became hung and wouldn&#x27;t move. The unit is quite noisy, and I&#x27;m sure that could be improved.    Other products and brands exist. WaterPik makes another (and a bit more expensive) model that has somewhat better reviews. It seems other manufacturers don&#x27;t do any better than WaterPik in addressing customer needs.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of removing food particles from gums and teeth, but wears out and needs to be replaced every 6 months or so.  Dick</li>
            <li> I purchased this \\&quot;Water Pic\\&quot; as a replacement for one that was about twenty years old. The old one still worked, but the plastic hose leaked, and got water everywhere. They changed the design of the new one and it&#x27;s not only harder to use they moved the location of the plastic hose to the right side of the machine making it almost impossible to use by a left handed person without turning the machine every time it&#x27;s used.  They also changed the way the tips get inserted into the end. Before they just pushed in, and now you have to pull down a collar, insert the tip and them raise the collar.  They made a simple machine that was extremely easy to use much more difficult. I wish I could have just bought a new plastic hose.</li>
            <li> this is a great product, wonderful for complete dental hygene.</li>
            <li> We bought this at suggestion of our dentist.  However, it is difficult to use, extremely messy and the on/off button on handle is difficult to press.  We used it a couple of times but have not used it since because of messiness and inconvenience. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Our neighbors bought the same model, tried to use it a few times and have not tried to use it since for the same reasons we gave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Save your money and go back to flossing!!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd WaterPick. I really like that it gives a stong stream of water to loosen food from inbetween my back teeth. Wish there was a way to quiet the sound as it is used but how it works is still more important. I recommend treating you gums with care by getting one yourself.</li>
            <li> This is my third WaterPik and it is the quietest yet.  All of the units I have had have worked well and my dentist agrees.  I would have rated this unit a 5 if it was not for the fact that the prior units water hoses both wore out and started leaking.  It costs almost as much as a new unit to replace them. In both previous units, the hose wore out where it connects to the nozzle and on these units you have to replace both the hose and nozzle.</li>
            <li> amazon is ama-zing!  this product works great and looks good.  the rubber water plug/stopper does not need to be removed for the water to flow. this is better than the new model with the pressure control built into the tower because its way more convenient.  i&#x27;ve used the wp90 and the only advantage is that it looks slightly cooler and has a smaller footprint.  the advantage of having the wp70 is that it&#x27;s reservoir is also an enclosure. the on/off switch is easy to operate (unlike the wp90).  you dont get a few of the extra pieces, but you&#x27;re not buying a pump for the attachments.  great product. great service.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. . . No more, but no less.  You get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> The product worked great, when it worked.  The pump stopped working and I&#x27;ve owned it less than two months. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I understand what they were trying to accomplish with the water control being located on the handle. The issue with this is the strength of the jet can be accidentally adjusted and if someone has sensitive gums/teeth that could be extremely uncomfortable. I personally would rather have the setting control on the base where it can&#x27;t be accidentally moved.</li>
            <li> Best thing we ever invested in for the health of our teeth - our gums. I bought 2, and getting ready to get one as a gift. [[ASIN:B0001J3U8Y Waterpik WP-70/WP-70W Family Dental Water Jet]]</li>
            <li> Works good, no complaints. and most importantly; no baboons were injured in making this reply[[ASIN:B0012JZVIO Cara Douche Syringe Bulb - Luxury Size]]</li>
            <li> This was a great device for several years. It&#x27;s loud, but it gets my teeth clean. After 8 years of intermittent use, the seals in the handle blew and it leaked hideously. Water Pik is apparently aware of the problem and has a replacement handle kit for about $9 plus S&amp;H. If the motor holds out for another 5 years, I&#x27;ll be very happy. If I start using it daily, my dentist will be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 07APR11: I&#x27;ve knocked off a star since the repair kit only lasted 3 months. The new hose coupling piece would not stay put in the old hose section as this area was brittle and cracking plastic. The entire old hose needs to be replaced since you can&#x27;t make it flexible enough to seal around the coupling link. I ended up tossing the whole unit and buying a new (more quiet) model.</li>
            <li> I must say that it is impressive, and gratifying, to give your teeth the best brushing you know how, then turn on the water jet and watch all the hidden bits of detritus get chased out of their hiding places.  It really does clean in places the brush can&#x27;t reach, and if your teeth are tightly packed (like mine), it is much easier than flossing.  The basic idea of cleaning with a pulsed water jet seems sound to me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That said, I really think there&#x27;s room left in the market (the aging-boomer-healthcare market that is) for a quality, well-made dental irrigator.  My Water Pik sounds like a little jackhammer running, the tubing to the handpiece is stiff and tangles easily, and... mine sprang a leak where the tubing enters the handpiece after about four months.  A leak that sprays water all the way across the room, mind you.  The handpiece is cheaply molded onto the tubing and can&#x27;t be disassembled for repair, and the parts don&#x27;t seem to be available. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m here on Amazon shopping for an alternate brand, but it seems that they have similar shortcomings -- short life heading the list.  So I repeat my remark, and hope that someone from Bosch or  Panasonic or somewhere were they value quality stuff is reading... what this country (USA) needs is an irrigator that works well, stays together, and doesn&#x27;t wake up the house!</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 6 monyhs daily. It worked great. But then a bad leak developed in the jet handle, and it is useless now. It&#x27;s not worth to try to collect on the $35 item&#x27;s warrenty, if you have to ship it back to the manufacturer. Maybe a new one lasts a little longer?</li>
            <li> my dentist and dental hygienist recommended that i get this to prevent gum recession.  it is very easy to use, very reasonably priced and hnopefully will help my teeth and gums from getting too old!</li>
            <li> Our first unit lasted about almost 2 months. Despite the relatively short lifespan, I thought the product was worth it considering the dirt-cheap price. However, the second unit we got leaked water at the base during its first use; so, it went back to Amazon the very same day it arrived our home. This product is so dangerous. Without exercising some safety precaution, it can cause electrocution!</li>
            <li> I have owned and used Waterpik oral irrigator products for many years. As with anything mechanical, certain parts wear out and the manufacturer used to sell those commonly replaced parts such as hoses and handles on its website. No more; now they tell you that there are no user replaceable parts and one must send off the entire unit to an \\&quot;authorized repair facility.\\&quot; BY the time you pay for shipping and the repair facility&#x27;s charges, you could buy a new machine! When I asked the customer service rep from Waterpik why I couldn&#x27;t repair the machine myself as I had done many times in the past, I was told \\&quot;special tools are needed.\\&quot; Yeah right! The \\&quot;special tools\\&quot; needed are screwdrivers! When I called the authorized repair center and tried to purchase a new hose, they wouldn&#x27;t sell it to me and wanted me to send in the entire machine so they could relace the hose - a 5 minute job. When I told them it wasn&#x27;t worth the cost they suggested that I buy a new machine - for about $60.00. I asked the repair guy \\&quot;Hey mister, if you had a two year old car that needed a new radiator hose, would you junk the car and buy a new one? He had no answer.</li>
            <li> My dentist warned me that if I didn&#x27;t start using a WaterPik, especially around my bridges and crowns, I was going to have trouble. Brushing just wasn&#x27;t effective enough between teeth and around the base of the crowns.  I didn&#x27;t listen and paid the price -  money and discomfort from a root canal plus a lot of \\&quot;I told you so\\&quot;s from him and my wife. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not wanting to help my dentist pay for yet another Lexus, I caved and bought the WaterPik. I have to admit that it is really effective. A little messy and noisy but it sure does get stuff out that brushing couldn&#x27;t remove. Has more power than I can use. Seems to make my gums feel better also.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wish I didn&#x27;t have to use it, but wish more that I would have started long ago. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m downgrading it to 4 stars is because the handle leaks a little and the whole device seem just a wee bit cheesy. Wish I there was a lid for the reservoir so I wouldn&#x27;t have to leave it open or take it apart after use.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Too many little attachments for the storage space in the lid on the individual model.  This one gets it right.  Powerful stream blasting junk from between one&#x27;s teeth.  Nice.  Hitting one&#x27;s uvula is not pleasant on the higher settings.  It&#x27;s better than periodontic treatments on the budget. If it lasts a year, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> We like the size of the water bowl and the force of the water jet. We have had other ones but like this one the best. A 5 star item.</li>
            <li> We Love it. Way better than flossing and our teeth feel really clean as well. My son loves the tongue cleaner, I can&#x27;t wait to do the in/out at the dentists office on teeth cleaning day. Be sure to read the instructions on how to use prior to using or you will have a mess on the counter and mirror! A bit noisy until you feel the benefits.</li>
            <li> I got about 6 months of light (single person-once-a-day) use before it quit. Now it just emits a steady hum. This is intended for family use? That is laughable. You should get the extended warrantee if you buy this turkey.</li>
            <li> The quality of this Water Pik has dropped dramatically since I purchased my first one years ago. The noises and rattling lead me to believe that I&#x27;ll be lucky to get a year&#x27;s usage from it. I am not at all pleased. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> The line connecting the hand held water pik to the water reservoir came apart on the fifth use. Sprayed up the walls like a loose fire hose, while I panicked to turn it off.  I have tried several things  to fix it but so far other than resorting to duck tape I haven&#x27;t succeeded. I am calling customer service for a repair kit...if I can ever be home during the hours they are open. I was so disappointed, as it was wonderful the first five times. It was also so powerful it could have been substituted as a paint stripper on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> The WaterPik works well, although selecting a comfortable strength for the water jet can be a little difficult. This is my second one. The first having sprung a leak where the hose joins the handle after two years.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the purchase of the Water Pik.  It came ahead of your commitment time and is working out great.</li>
            <li> I really recommend  a water irrigation device as an adjunct to brushing and flossing. Of the different brands the waterpik seems to last the longest.  The ones I had as a kid seemed to last 10 years. The one I purchased on Amazon just broke after 3 years of regular use.  It was just a small piece of plastic where the hose connects to the pump.</li>
            <li> I have owned several WaterPiks over the years and the biggest problem is the junky plastic supply hose that gets brittle over time.  Once it gets brittle there is no fixing it, as cutting off a little piece on the end and reattaching it to the handle only works for maybe one or two more uses, then it starts leaking and you have to do it again.  After you do this about a dozen times you are ready to scream!  So I bought the replacement hose on-line (about $15 with shipping for a 50 cent part!!!) and opened up the unit (have to use a couple small screwdrivers to pry open the tabs on the bottom, but pretty easy).  But when I tried attaching the new hose to the little plastic nipple on the pump that it attaches to, the nipple broke.  Poor, cheap design...the nipple should be made of metal!!!  So now the unit is toast.  Not worth trying to get a new pump for it.    I firmly believe that WaterPik could easily provide their units with a higher quality plastic supply line that doesn&#x27;t get brittle after just a few years use, but they won&#x27;t do that because they want you to buy a new one.  And they don&#x27;t want you to try fixing it either.      Note -- I did try finding some other hose that would work.  The closest I came is some rubber windshield washer hose (avaiable at auto parts stores, cheap) that is 3/32\\&quot; ID and 5/32\\&quot; OD.  But the problem with the rubber hose it that it restricts the flow of water...the flow is not nearly as powerful as the plastic tubing.  And I couldn&#x27;t find any plastic hose of that size at Home Depot, Lowes, hardware stores, etc.  So you are stuck having to order the WaterPik replacement hose at top dollar.  If you do, be VERY careful attaching it to the pump!</li>
            <li> We have had several WaterPiks over the years. Although they haven&#x27;t really varied all that much across the models, this one seems to be a little nicer overall.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd unit of this same kind. My first units lasted about 3yrs until the end piece came off at the connection. The motor still worked I just could not re-connect it. This unit is the most powerful on the market. It blows off plaque like no other and it is the most powerful model available. I checked their motor specifications on their website. If you want the most cleaning power this is it. If you have bridges or braces you will want to buy the rubber tipped bridge adapters. The older ones from my same family model worked perfectly. They last a really long time and do the best job--buy one! The others don&#x27;t have as much power and don&#x27;t blow out as well under bridges and through braces. This is the one! Buy it! It is a little noisy, but you need raw power to blow out food particles. The hand held self-contained units don&#x27;t cut it! *****</li>
            <li> I bought my Waterpik WP70 about 5 years ago and use it as needed instead of floss. Floss shreds and gets stuck between my very close teeth and fillings, which is miserable. My dental hygienist says that my Waterpik is doing a good job.  Indeed, water irrigation is the only thing that will work for me.    I have had several Waterpiks over the years and it&#x27;s an essential appliance for me.  I have been impressed with their durability in general, with a Waterpik I bought 20 years ago still operational (I&#x27;m dubious that current units can match that durability).  The much larger reservoir on the WP70 attracted me to it.  While it performs the same as the older model, I did find the hose on the WP70 to be overly rigid, curled, and awkward.  The tight and overly rigid curl of the hose means I can&#x27;t stretch the hose far and I must use it with the unit sitting right by the sink.     Recently, the hose outright broke.  I&#x27;m not thrilled at the idea of replacing the whole system because a 10 cent piece of plastic broke.  And after reading comments on the lower pressure and decreased durability of the latest model (\\&quot;Ultra Dental\\&quot;) I opted to try to repair my current unit.  The main cover comes off with plastic tabs at the bottom of the unit that need to be depressed.  The handle opened with difficulty on the main vertical seam using a screwdriver to pry it open, and I will probably have to glue that together again. If you need to repair your unit, be careful in removing the hose in the handle and the main unit as the nipple is pretty thin and can easily break. I will try to find an alternate hose to repair the unit with, one that is more flexible and longer than the original hose.  Will update once I do this.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik is highly effective.  It really gives you that just flossed feeling.  The gum massage that you receive when using it has helped me a lot and turned around the negative reports I used to get from my dentist.   The only downside is that it is a bit noisey, they could try to make it quieter.</li>
            <li> Now this is a very useful tool, it really makes a diference when compared against normal teethbrush and dental floss i removes more dirty out of the little corners and can even clean your toungue. Excellent product indeed.</li>
            <li> This product needs to be taken off the market. It does not work, &lt;br /&gt;and I would like to return the one I have.</li>
            <li> The motor is noisy.  Removing the hand unit from the base may result in dislodging the water bowl from the base. There is no cover for the water bowl which holds enough water for a gigantic family. Any water remaining in the bowl will drain out unless the water pic if left in the hand unit.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to use--he is 31 and recently had to get braces--and thought I&#x27;d use it, as well.  We laughed a lot while trying to figure it out--there was water EVERYWHERE!  However, once I got the hang of it, I made a lot less mess and really could tell a difference after using it.  My recommendation is to be patient--it takes a little while to get it all figured out.  This is a great Water pik!</li>
            <li> Upon recommendation from my dentist I have been using Waterpik for about three years. Recently the supply tube broke off at the joint and there was no way for me to fix it.  This is the reason that made me buy a replacement at Amazon which works well.</li>
            <li> I read some of the other reviews on this before I bought it, seems alot of people have problems with the hoses and pumps, I&#x27;ve had the same model as this one for the last five years, yes I did have to to lube the pump and shorten the hose once after about three years, but these things are so cheap to buy, so what. I also wonder if some of the problems people have had have been caused by hard water or over clorinated water. The water pic saved saved my teeth over twenty years ago, I think dentists don&#x27;t want people to know about these because it costs them to much business! Buy the cheapest Waterpik brand and throw it away when it breaks,then buy another.</li>
            <li> I had my first WaterPik for over three years and it worked great. Finally, the hose started leaking, but I didn&#x27;t mind replacing it.    Well, I just got my new WaterPik (same model) and it isn&#x27;t nearly as powerful. I don&#x27;t know if they changed it or if I got a defective one. The first one was really noisy, but it did a great job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two waterpiks over the years.  I liked them both, when they worked, as they had plenty of pressure. Both died in about two years though, one with a hose leak, and my latest one, which died today, leaking in the attachment handle.  I need the machine, so I&#x27;m torn about what to do.  I bought another brand (Teledyne) about 4 years ago, and was not really happy with the lower cleaning pressure it produced, so when it croaked, I bought the second Waterpik, which cleaned well, but doesn&#x27;t last either.&lt;br /&gt;I sure wish I could get more than 2 years out of these units. I only use them once or twice a week, so that&#x27;s a pretty short working life span, I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this model Waterpik for one year now and it just died the same way the previous Waterpik died: the hose became brittle and broke. Unfortunately, you cannot change the hose to the hand unit on this device, you have to throw the whole thing away. I suggest spending an extra $12 and getting the Ultra version so that you can change hand-unit hoses when they break after a year. Otherwise, the unit works okay.</li>
            <li> such a great price for a very useful appliance - my gums are happier already!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Hopefully THIS ONE will last for a long time.  If not, I will come back for another one..</li>
            <li> Works Great, It is noisy but does a great job of removing food particles from the teeth.  This is my second one.  The first one lasted many years.</li>
            <li> We like the way the machine is built.  Only complaint I have is that it make kind of loud noise for its size. &lt;br /&gt;But, other than that we think its great.</li>
            <li> This was a great product and did a great job until this morning (it stopped working). Today, while using the product I noticed a variation on the pressure and suddenly no pressure at all, now it just makes noise but no water comes out.  Warranty if over for me, so I will try to take it apart and try to fix it.  I will definitely miss this product but will not buy again from waterpik unfortunately.  Hope I can find something better.</li>
            <li> The way Amazon jump by placing the order and sending an email, without showing confirmation page with all the details and a submit button bathers me.  When I ordered this item I selected 9 b days, but when it shows the order it started the counting 5 bd later and it was delivered even later. &lt;br /&gt;Although the product is great and the price is good, but I will go to Amazon more if I see all the terms (price, tax and delivery date) before I submit. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have been using oral irrigation appliances for years and this one is outstanding in both quality and cost.</li>
            <li> When my family first bought a Water Pik irrigation appliance back in the sixties, it was a very well crafted piece of equipment.  It lasted for years and years.    I bought one of these WP-70s and noticed off the bat the dramatic change in quality from the original product.  Flimsier, lighter, and noisier.     But considering that I used it only once or twice a week, it didn&#x27;t take long for the product to fail.  In about a year, the hose sprung a small leak.  And because of the pressure in the hose, the leak created a tiny stream that sprayed all over the bathroom .      Within days, the leak increased, and then became a crack, and then simply broke into two separate pieces.  Now the machine - with total flight hours of, what?, maybe a few hours worth of use?, the product is kaput.      It&#x27;s been sitting on the counter taking up space while I search for replacement parts, but the hose seems integral to the handle, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement hose for this model.    My advice, based on my experience is to steer clear of this one.      While I think the product concept is a good one, and it really provides a superior oral cleaning, it&#x27;s a piece of junque that reeks of manufacturing corner cutting.    And environmentally, the idea of building this half way around the planet and shipping it to the US only to drop it into already overburdened landfills seems somewhat absurd.</li>
            <li> The strength (power?) is controlled by a slider on the handle sucks compared to the old (when I was a kid) way it used to be controlled by a knob on the unit.    The slider on the handle is  a: very easy to bump it up from 2 to 6 and powerwash a gouge in your mouth  b: inaccurate.  It should go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 but the one on mine is more like 1, 2, 5, 5, 5, 6    Otherwise, it does what it says.  I have yet to be back to the dentist to see if it&#x27;s helping though    I asked a few dentists for advise - Unless told otherwise, don&#x27;t use this every day.  You can do damage to your gums.  Also,  it&#x27;s not a substitute for regular flossing.  It&#x27;s better at getting below the gumline, but doesn&#x27;t do as well above it.</li>
            <li> Same ol water pik i grew up w!  Reliable and nice quality.</li>
            <li> I have just returned my third Waterpik WP-70. In three months time, the motors froze up on all three. Coincidence, or just poor workmanship? I always followed the directions in the manual exactly as written. Another complaint is the noise level. I am currently searching for a better alternative to Waterpik.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!  MY UNIT QUIT THE SECOND TIME I TRIED TO USE IT!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reading the reviews, I am not alone.  I am so suprised because my dentist said it was the best thing going.  Maybe another product will work better. &lt;br /&gt;Believe me, I will read those reviews BEFORE I buy the thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very noisy.  Once unpacked, you will NEVER get the cord stored again ... which also means you have to leave the reservoir laying on your sink.  Leaks develop after several months.  Dies within a year.  I&#x27;m assuming this is true for all models made by the company, so I&#x27;d advise trying any of the other brands.    NEW \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot; ... a world of difference.  Quieter.  Cord stores easily.  More powerful. Just out of the box, it&#x27;s 4 Stars.</li>
            <li> I have used WaterPik Dental Water Jets for many years. Finally, the WP-70 seems to be improved. On my most recent purchase, the handle head turns smoothly so the cord doesn&#x27;t twist and after being used, the water drains out of the cord more completely.</li>
            <li> Well made. big improvement of the older model. Spray is powerful and gets in places I have been too yet.    But I am impressed with this unit. I replaced a five year old of the same model and this one is showing where Waterpick has made improvements in it.</li>
            <li> Product cleans teeth perfectly.  even if I brush and floss first, the pik cleans more material from my teeth.  This is perfect for me because I have a number of crowns and food gets stuck to the underside of the crowns as my gums recede.  This product removes all stuck material.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This was my first dental water jet and while the water jet works fine, the control to change the pressure of the water jet is on the handle used to clean your teeth. The control is a hair-trigger of sorts, and you can end up slicing your gums if you accidentally bump the control, causing the pressure to be turned up. I solved that problem by fixing the control in place with a strip of clear duct tape.     My friend has a different model and her pressure control is on the unit body instead of the handle, which is a better choice, but I did not know this when I purchased mine.    In the description of this appliance, it said:    Comes with four color-coded jet tips so each person knows which one is his or hers, perfect for the entire family. Also included is a tongue cleaner to freshen breath.    I should have looked at the picture. It does come with 4 color coded jets, 2 are pink, 2 are blue. There is a regular jet and a tongue cleaner for each color, so while there are 4 jet tips, the description is a little misleading. It says a tongue cleaner, not two tongue cleaners.    I&#x27;ll use it till it quits, but next time, I&#x27;ll know more about what to look for in a dental water jet.</li>
            <li> After years of using the Water Pik daily, it was time for a replacement.  Numerous unsatisfactory styles and brands were found and purchased (and tossed out!) because it was impossible to find the \\&quot;old style\\&quot; we liked.  I finally found it here on Amazon and will now make it my first choice when looking for specific items!  Great transaction with speedy delivery and a very good price!</li>
            <li> I bought this product last year and used it a few times and put it away.  I just took it out a few days ago to use it for the 5th time and it sprung a leak on the handle and water gushes out all over the place.  Just like the other comments/reviews say here....      It did work pretty well as for getting in between the teeth but breaking after only a few uses isn&#x27;t really worth it.      I&#x27;m going to buy the 100 watt one and try it out since there is a Nov 2008 coupon for 10 [...] off.  Lets see if this one can last 10 uses....</li>
            <li> works great and has for years but will wake up the whole house while you use it. Wish it had a cover for the water reservoir but oh well</li>
            <li> Waterpick working very well. Fest shiping. Thank you</li>
            <li> This is a great device for cleaning between teeth and hard to reach places that your toothbrush misses. But it won&#x27;t replace your toothbrush. It may, however, be partially responsible for my recent good dental checkups. (I bought this item about three years ago and forgot to review it!?)...</li>
            <li> i like this better than toothpicks or dental floss as its much more sanitary and really gets into tight cracks along the gum line. i have one location (way in the back) that is difficult to reach with dental floss. the water pick accessory is slim and easy to position just where it is needed. life&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I have used Waterpik for many years and been an appreciative user.  However, this more recent purchase began leaking badly after a little over 2 years.  When I disassembled it, I found that some of the white plastic holding things had crumbled into small pieces.  With a chemistry background, I&#x27;m very familiar with the difference between disintegration crumbling and breakage.  This seemed to come from a substandard formulation of the plastic itself.  I used this 10 - 15 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;When I read other reviews that also said quality Waterpik has gone down, I decided not to buy this again.  If you are in the use-and-toss category then I would rate this higher as it did do a good job.  But less than 30 months use is not for me.</li>
