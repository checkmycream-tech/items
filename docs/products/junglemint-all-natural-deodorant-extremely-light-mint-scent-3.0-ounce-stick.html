            <li>Junglemint has worked flawlessly for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best deodorant that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>deodorant I&#x27;ve tried and I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed.  </li>
            <li>Jungleman&#x27;s Junglemint Deodorant worked great for me!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li>I love this product!!!</li>
            <li>This is totally amazing!!  </li>
            <li>Works good but hurts going on!  </li>
            <li>This worked great for a guy who was looking for hypoallergenic deodorant.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>and it was great that i didn&#x27;t smell like BO.</li>
            <li>Truly a great product, btw!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This deodrant is great</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>but I pair with the Burt&#x27;s Bees spray as a body spray and it pairs very nicely.</li>
            <li>Smelled pleasant and I didn&#x27;t get allergies but did not work at all.  </li>
            <li>and I’m good for the day.  </li>
            <li>Does not stop sweat at all, but sweating is good for you.</li>
            <li>But i think that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is really good too.  </li>
            <li>It would be good for a day where I wasn&#x27;t going anywhere except my house.</li>
            <li>I think the biggest tip is to try to keep it in an area that is a good temperature.</li>
            <li>Great very light scent.</li>
            <li>I love these deodorants!</li>
            <li>I am ordering more !</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t the kind for me.</li>
            <li>(Keep it out of warm places.</li>
            <li>Jungleman is absolutely effective protection for a guy like me who sweats obscenely, profusely.</li>
            <li>I sweat (which IS a healthy good thing- purging toxins, flushing out pores, etc.)</li>
            <li>Antiperspirant causes your sweat glands to become overactive because they can&#x27;t effectively release toxins from the body.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant is extremely effective.</li>
            <li>it does not spread very easily.</li>
            <li>They even throw in an ice pack to keep the product cool!!  </li>
            <li>Quality, safe, and effective, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>This one does have a very, very light mint scent.</li>
            <li>I like the scent, which is very light.</li>
            <li>but so far all signs point to being very good.</li>
            <li>Bathroom is OK, just not in a car during the summer, etc.)</li>
            <li>I am now odor free!</li>
            <li>Love the texture and protection it gives to fight BO.</li>
            <li>Both deodorants are better than any non-natural brand I&#x27;ve used for smell.</li>
            <li>Oh, and my acne is getting better every day.  </li>
            <li>I feel so much more at ease knowing that I&#x27;m not pumping my body with aluminum</li>
            <li>I promise it will work a lot better, guys.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have found my two favorite deodorants that I will be using indefinitely.</li>
            <li>Can it get any better than that?</li>
            <li>It worked much better than the Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant that I tried before this.</li>
            <li>It also seems to work better if you have issues with it</li>
            <li>The mint scented works better (on me) than the unscented.</li>
            <li>He was happy with it for a week or so, but then the mint scent faded away from the stick entirely, and it could not keep him smelling good.</li>
            <li>This works 10x better than Degree Maximum Strength, and has none of the chemicals.</li>
            <li>Amazing – the first of it&#x27;s kind to work this well.</li>
            <li>Jungleman products have always provided great protection and I love that they are all natural.</li>
            <li>Should you have any questions in the future, please feel free to contact us and we&#x27;ll be more than happy to help you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants and this is by far the best one yet!</li>
            <li>so you have to let it warm up on your skin first before applying.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used hands down.</li>
            <li>Hands down, bar none, best product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>It applies easy and keeps me odor free literally all day.  </li>
            <li>but this product is one huge</li>
            <li>I also like that it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>This a great simple ingredient deodorant but t</li>
            <li>I understand that the deodorant is listed as having an &amp;#34;extremely light mint scent,&amp;#34; but there is no detectable scent in my deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It is indeed lightly scented with mint, but man does it hurt to apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You really can&#x27;t smell the mint scent when you use this; it&#x27;s effectively odorless.  </li>
            <li>No need to over apply, just lightly swipe it across your armpit, works all day.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; is extremely light in scent, and I don&#x27;t think you would notice it at all.  </li>
            <li>beyond that, so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>was looking for something that would be ingredient friendly, not make me break out, and that would be masculine/feminine neutral in scent</li>
            <li>So when I found out about this version with peppermint oil instead of tea tree, I was so excited.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easier than the original version, goes on clearer.</li>
            <li>I have now tried several all natural deodorants and this one is the best of the bunch for me.</li>
            <li>star for the quick shipping and secure packaging.</li>
            <li>Recieved this superfast, has a super light mint smell.</li>
            <li>Just tank top it or wear wicking cotton materials when it&#x27;s super hot</li>
            <li>It really is true.</li>
            <li>No scent after application really, but that&#x27;s ok for us.</li>
            <li>I already wrote a full review on the Unscented Jungleman Deodorant stick.  </li>
            <li>However, with this, I&#x27;m good all the way through the entire day.</li>
            <li>Junglemint has the addition of peppermint which is a natural antibacterial  and smells pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>Smell is very mild, but this deodorant really works well!</li>
            <li>The best deodorant on the market, seriously.</li>
            <li>or you&#x27;re super nervous/</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I have searched a long time to find the best all-natural deodorant that actually works and this one seems to do the job!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the odor control is pretty good and has a 10-12 hour limit (for me) depending on my physical activity.</li>
            <li>and I sweat a lot in HOT YOGA!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best natural deodorant I have ever used, and I have used several.</li>
            <li>and I can come back from a workout without any odor on my or my clothes; this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>but I give it five stars simply for its amazing ability to keep you fresh all day.</li>
            <li>To have such a great option that is completely natural (you literally could eat this product without harming you)</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>staining on my clothes, and keeps me fresh all day - school, work, exercise - one application in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the box, the deodorant is wrapped in foil that (I&#x27;m assuming) blocks infrared/heat radiation from getting into the product and melting it as many natural deodorants are susceptible to.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s made of only 4 ingredients.</li>
            <li>You could probably tell the difference between unscented and mint if you tried to smell your pits right after putting it on, but after a couple of hours there is no smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been wanting to use Jungleman All-Natural Deodorant for so long, based on the really great reviews, but unfortunately, I&#x27;m sensitive to tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t leave it in your gym bag on a hot day because it will all melt and reform sideways.</li>
            <li>This was the first one which his skin didn&#x27;t react to.</li>
            <li>Since I am trying this product during winter I can not fully attest to the efficacy of the product during hot weather.</li>
            <li>I dab a tiny bit of cocoa butter lotion on the top of the deodorant and apply -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as advertised - all natural, extremely light scented.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Put your head into your t shirt first, then your arms.</li>
            <li>This is the first &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I could not be more excited to find a natural deodorant that actually works for me!</li>
            <li>JungleMINT is a new variety of my tried and true Jungleman  deodorant.</li>
            <li>If you apply it right after getting out of the shower then the moisture allows it to spread reasonably well.</li>
            <li>that has NO dangerous short term or long term hazardous chemicals makes me smile.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Jungleman Mint is actually pretty much like the Unscented.  </li>
            <li>It feels more like trying to rub dry soap on your armpits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a busy hairstylist who works at a fast paced salon and tend to start sweating quick into the work day.</li>
            <li>Wow really works!!</li>
            <li>It truly is amazing how well this works with such simple ingredients.</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t stink so.... haha</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m finding that I don&#x27;t sweat as much.  </li>
            <li>This company really knows what they&#x27;re doing</li>
            <li>I know this is going to sound corny, but this product actually works!</li>
            <li>I really thought this was going to be snake oil.</li>
            <li>Finally was able to find a natural deodorant that works all day and that I don&#x27;t need to reapply midway even on a 90 degree day.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t always go on super smoothly (dampening it slightly does help)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other &amp;#34;natural deodorants&amp;#34; and nothing compares.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love the scent, it works for me</li>
            <li>I always order direct from the manufacturer because the shipments are ALWAYS sent out very fast and well packaged</li>
            <li>, I usually wake up with stinky pit but not with this amazing</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, what I can attest to is that with a physically demanding job this product provides a full days protection against odor.</li>
            <li>This is the first natural deodorant that has worked for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Certain scents of Old Spice are all that work for me.</li>
            <li>, you will still perspire (which is healthy) and be &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; a little.  </li>
            <li>None of them have held up all day under normal conditions.</li>
            <li>Love that there are few ingredients, but it wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li>You still sweat (as there are no crazy chemicals that clogg your pores) but you don&#x27;t smell and your shirts don&#x27;t turn yellow colors in the underarm area!</li>
            <li>After putting on the deodorant it ruined a new t-shirt and stripped the fabric of any color in the underarms.  </li>
            <li>Expensive when you add the shipping in, wish it were Prime, and it often arrives melted and reformed into weird shapes, but it works really well, has almost no smell so very good for chemically sensitive people and nice to know you are using a non-toxic product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a solid white bar, which is apparently the only kind of deodorant</li>
            <li>I find that I like the thicker deodorants rather than the thinner, more liquid like ones, hence why I prefer this over other brands such as Herban Cowboy.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a natural deodorant that works and this is it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, not hard like some reviews I read.</li>
            <li>It does have an odd consistency and has to be rubbed in rather than just applied, but it&#x27;s worth it for how well it works!</li>
            <li>Had to wash it off as it was clear</li>
            <li>After switching to this my wetness problem is almost entirely gone, and it prevents BO very well.</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s All Natural, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using this for over a year, I tried the arm and hammer natural deodorant and it burned my skin.</li>
            <li>This deodorant claims to be made of natural ingredients, yet I have a rash in ky underarms after months of usage, this should not be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural deodorant, so I need to remember to hit the gym at lunch and reapply.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice deodorant which is decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The deodorant completely works.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been using Degree antiperspirant for years but wanted to try out a natural deodorant because I heard that using antiperspirant causes acne.  </li>
            <li>thing to note is that you kinda need to trim your armpit hair for natural deodorants to work.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone looking for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>The deodorants are all with natural ingredients and they work.....</li>
            <li>IT WORKS and its natural.</li>
            <li>For a natural product, exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Overly solid, doesn&#x27;t spread very well and tends to pull out armpit hair.</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant I buy now, and only in the cooler months (in order to prevent melting issues if shipped during the hot summer months).</li>
            <li>It did keep me odor free for the entire day, but due to the difficulties in application and the garment discoloration, I will continue my search for the ultimate in natural armpit odor care.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would have to say is that unlike the toxic deodorants, when using this one and you do a lot of exercise or are prone to sweat often, one would have to apply it a few times more than the regular store-bought brands, but that is not an issue for me as I know it is not made with toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>Works really well for me and no more hippy chick smell like other natural deodorants that have a strong tea tree smell, there is none of that.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it didn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin ( for some reason every other natural deodorant has), it lasted all night into the next morning with my pits smelling like peppermint!  </li>
            <li>The stick is extremely solid, and it seems as though I need to use a whole lot of force to get product to apply properly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting really pissed paying shipping for every single piece even if I buy 4 at a time.</li>
            <li>This is the first one to pass the test!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After meeting a guy who suffered from aluminum poisoning and then learning about all the other chemical ingredients people put into deodorant (just look at your label), I concluded that I needed something all-natural.  </li>
            <li>I apply a little of coconut oil to armpits before applying deodorant and that&#x27;s all I need to do ..... and keeps me fresh and no BO for the rest of the day even while I&#x27;m working out.</li>
            <li>Apparently the heat melts them in the box.  </li>
            <li>Only natural one I&#x27;ve found that works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 21-year old male</li>
            <li>only downside is that no place near me carries it, so I have to order online.</li>
            <li>Toms and some other brand from whole foods and another brand from sprouts.</li>
            <li>I have never before found a natural deodorant that actually prevents me from smelling for at least a full day, even after a workout.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading several other positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I recently decided to switch to all natural deodorants after reading about the long-term health hazards of using commercial deodorants.</li>
            <li>If everyone realized that all you need is some corn starch, baking soda, and essential oils to completely eliminate body odor, all the commercial deodorant companies would be out of business.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty heavy sweater</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge sweater, so maybe this helps some people, but i did go out walking in the hot weather</li>
            <li>Other users noted that the product is difficult to apply - once it is kept at room temp it goes on easily and although it goes on white it absorbs well and more or less disappears.</li>
            <li>Because of the consistency, I used the trick of cupping it in the armpit to use your body heat to soften it before you glide it, only problem, spreads a little too much and def gets in the clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This deodrant is great</li>
            <li> It works great</li>
            <li> but I pair with the Burt&#x27;s Bees spray as a body spray and it pairs very nicely.</li>
            <li> Smelled pleasant and I didn&#x27;t get allergies but did not work at all.  </li>

            <li> I think the biggest tip is to try to keep it in an area that is a good temperature.</li>
            <li> Great very light scent.</li>
            <li> I love these deodorants!</li>
            <li> I am ordering more !</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t the kind for me.</li>
            <li> (Keep it out of warm places.</li>
            <li> Jungleman is absolutely effective protection for a guy like me who sweats obscenely, profusely.</li>
            <li> I sweat (which IS a healthy good thing- purging toxins, flushing out pores, etc.)</li>
            <li> Antiperspirant causes your sweat glands to become overactive because they can&#x27;t effectively release toxins from the body.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant is extremely effective.</li>
            <li> it does not spread very easily.</li>
            <li> They even throw in an ice pack to keep the product cool!!  </li>
            <li> Quality, safe, and effective, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> This one does have a very, very light mint scent.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, which is very light.</li>
            <li> but so far all signs point to being very good.</li>
            <li> Bathroom is OK, just not in a car during the summer, etc.)</li>
            <li> I am now odor free!</li>
            <li> Love the texture and protection it gives to fight BO.</li>
            <li> Both deodorants are better than any non-natural brand I&#x27;ve used for smell.</li>
            <li> Oh, and my acne is getting better every day.  </li>
            <li> I feel so much more at ease knowing that I&#x27;m not pumping my body with aluminum</li>
            <li> I promise it will work a lot better, guys.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found my two favorite deodorants that I will be using indefinitely.</li>
            <li> Can it get any better than that?</li>
            <li> It worked much better than the Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant that I tried before this.</li>
            <li> It also seems to work better if you have issues with it</li>
            <li> The mint scented works better (on me) than the unscented.</li>
            <li> He was happy with it for a week or so, but then the mint scent faded away from the stick entirely, and it could not keep him smelling good.</li>
            <li> This works 10x better than Degree Maximum Strength, and has none of the chemicals.</li>
            <li> Amazing – the first of it&#x27;s kind to work this well.</li>
            <li> Jungleman products have always provided great protection and I love that they are all natural.</li>
            <li> Should you have any questions in the future, please feel free to contact us and we&#x27;ll be more than happy to help you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants and this is by far the best one yet!</li>
            <li> so you have to let it warm up on your skin first before applying.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used hands down.</li>
            <li> Hands down, bar none, best product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> It applies easy and keeps me odor free literally all day.  </li>
            <li> but this product is one huge</li>
            <li> I also like that it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> This a great simple ingredient deodorant but t</li>
            <li> I understand that the deodorant is listed as having an &amp;#34;extremely light mint scent,&amp;#34; but there is no detectable scent in my deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It is indeed lightly scented with mint, but man does it hurt to apply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You really can&#x27;t smell the mint scent when you use this; it&#x27;s effectively odorless.  </li>
            <li> No need to over apply, just lightly swipe it across your armpit, works all day.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; is extremely light in scent, and I don&#x27;t think you would notice it at all.  </li>
            <li> beyond that, so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> was looking for something that would be ingredient friendly, not make me break out, and that would be masculine/feminine neutral in scent</li>
            <li> So when I found out about this version with peppermint oil instead of tea tree, I was so excited.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easier than the original version, goes on clearer.</li>
            <li> I have now tried several all natural deodorants and this one is the best of the bunch for me.</li>
            <li> star for the quick shipping and secure packaging.</li>
            <li> Recieved this superfast, has a super light mint smell.</li>
            <li> Just tank top it or wear wicking cotton materials when it&#x27;s super hot</li>
            <li> It really is true.</li>
            <li> No scent after application really, but that&#x27;s ok for us.</li>
            <li> I already wrote a full review on the Unscented Jungleman Deodorant stick.  </li>
            <li> However, with this, I&#x27;m good all the way through the entire day.</li>
            <li> Junglemint has the addition of peppermint which is a natural antibacterial  and smells pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> Smell is very mild, but this deodorant really works well!</li>
            <li> The best deodorant on the market, seriously.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;re super nervous/</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I have searched a long time to find the best all-natural deodorant that actually works and this one seems to do the job!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the odor control is pretty good and has a 10-12 hour limit (for me) depending on my physical activity.</li>
            <li> and I sweat a lot in HOT YOGA!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best natural deodorant I have ever used, and I have used several.</li>
            <li> and I can come back from a workout without any odor on my or my clothes; this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> but I give it five stars simply for its amazing ability to keep you fresh all day.</li>
            <li> To have such a great option that is completely natural (you literally could eat this product without harming you)</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> staining on my clothes, and keeps me fresh all day - school, work, exercise - one application in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the box, the deodorant is wrapped in foil that (I&#x27;m assuming) blocks infrared/heat radiation from getting into the product and melting it as many natural deodorants are susceptible to.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s made of only 4 ingredients.</li>
            <li> You could probably tell the difference between unscented and mint if you tried to smell your pits right after putting it on, but after a couple of hours there is no smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been wanting to use Jungleman All-Natural Deodorant for so long, based on the really great reviews, but unfortunately, I&#x27;m sensitive to tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t leave it in your gym bag on a hot day because it will all melt and reform sideways.</li>
            <li> This was the first one which his skin didn&#x27;t react to.</li>
            <li> Since I am trying this product during winter I can not fully attest to the efficacy of the product during hot weather.</li>
            <li> I dab a tiny bit of cocoa butter lotion on the top of the deodorant and apply -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as advertised - all natural, extremely light scented.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Put your head into your t shirt first, then your arms.</li>
            <li> This is the first &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I could not be more excited to find a natural deodorant that actually works for me!</li>
            <li> JungleMINT is a new variety of my tried and true Jungleman  deodorant.</li>
            <li> If you apply it right after getting out of the shower then the moisture allows it to spread reasonably well.</li>
            <li> that has NO dangerous short term or long term hazardous chemicals makes me smile.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Jungleman Mint is actually pretty much like the Unscented.  </li>
            <li> It feels more like trying to rub dry soap on your armpits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy hairstylist who works at a fast paced salon and tend to start sweating quick into the work day.</li>
            <li> Wow really works!!</li>
            <li> It truly is amazing how well this works with such simple ingredients.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t stink so.... haha</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m finding that I don&#x27;t sweat as much.  </li>
            <li> This company really knows what they&#x27;re doing</li>
            <li> I know this is going to sound corny, but this product actually works!</li>
            <li> I really thought this was going to be snake oil.</li>
            <li> Finally was able to find a natural deodorant that works all day and that I don&#x27;t need to reapply midway even on a 90 degree day.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t always go on super smoothly (dampening it slightly does help)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other &amp;#34;natural deodorants&amp;#34; and nothing compares.</li>
            <li> Other than that I love the scent, it works for me</li>
            <li> I always order direct from the manufacturer because the shipments are ALWAYS sent out very fast and well packaged</li>
            <li> , I usually wake up with stinky pit but not with this amazing</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, what I can attest to is that with a physically demanding job this product provides a full days protection against odor.</li>
            <li> This is the first natural deodorant that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Certain scents of Old Spice are all that work for me.</li>
            <li> , you will still perspire (which is healthy) and be &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; a little.  </li>
            <li> None of them have held up all day under normal conditions.</li>
            <li> Love that there are few ingredients, but it wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> You still sweat (as there are no crazy chemicals that clogg your pores) but you don&#x27;t smell and your shirts don&#x27;t turn yellow colors in the underarm area!</li>
            <li> After putting on the deodorant it ruined a new t-shirt and stripped the fabric of any color in the underarms.  </li>
            <li> Expensive when you add the shipping in, wish it were Prime, and it often arrives melted and reformed into weird shapes, but it works really well, has almost no smell so very good for chemically sensitive people and nice to know you are using a non-toxic product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid white bar, which is apparently the only kind of deodorant</li>
            <li> I find that I like the thicker deodorants rather than the thinner, more liquid like ones, hence why I prefer this over other brands such as Herban Cowboy.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a natural deodorant that works and this is it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, not hard like some reviews I read.</li>
            <li> It does have an odd consistency and has to be rubbed in rather than just applied, but it&#x27;s worth it for how well it works!</li>
            <li> Had to wash it off as it was clear</li>
            <li> After switching to this my wetness problem is almost entirely gone, and it prevents BO very well.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s All Natural, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this for over a year, I tried the arm and hammer natural deodorant and it burned my skin.</li>
            <li> This deodorant claims to be made of natural ingredients, yet I have a rash in ky underarms after months of usage, this should not be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural deodorant, so I need to remember to hit the gym at lunch and reapply.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice deodorant which is decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The deodorant completely works.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using Degree antiperspirant for years but wanted to try out a natural deodorant because I heard that using antiperspirant causes acne.  </li>
            <li> thing to note is that you kinda need to trim your armpit hair for natural deodorants to work.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone looking for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> The deodorants are all with natural ingredients and they work.....</li>
            <li> IT WORKS and its natural.</li>
            <li> For a natural product, exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Overly solid, doesn&#x27;t spread very well and tends to pull out armpit hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I buy now, and only in the cooler months (in order to prevent melting issues if shipped during the hot summer months).</li>
            <li> It did keep me odor free for the entire day, but due to the difficulties in application and the garment discoloration, I will continue my search for the ultimate in natural armpit odor care.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would have to say is that unlike the toxic deodorants, when using this one and you do a lot of exercise or are prone to sweat often, one would have to apply it a few times more than the regular store-bought brands, but that is not an issue for me as I know it is not made with toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> Works really well for me and no more hippy chick smell like other natural deodorants that have a strong tea tree smell, there is none of that.</li>
            <li> Firstly, it didn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin ( for some reason every other natural deodorant has), it lasted all night into the next morning with my pits smelling like peppermint!  </li>
            <li> The stick is extremely solid, and it seems as though I need to use a whole lot of force to get product to apply properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting really pissed paying shipping for every single piece even if I buy 4 at a time.</li>
            <li> This is the first one to pass the test!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After meeting a guy who suffered from aluminum poisoning and then learning about all the other chemical ingredients people put into deodorant (just look at your label), I concluded that I needed something all-natural.  </li>
            <li> I apply a little of coconut oil to armpits before applying deodorant and that&#x27;s all I need to do ..... and keeps me fresh and no BO for the rest of the day even while I&#x27;m working out.</li>
            <li> Apparently the heat melts them in the box.  </li>
            <li> Only natural one I&#x27;ve found that works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 21-year old male</li>
            <li> only downside is that no place near me carries it, so I have to order online.</li>
            <li> Toms and some other brand from whole foods and another brand from sprouts.</li>
            <li> I have never before found a natural deodorant that actually prevents me from smelling for at least a full day, even after a workout.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading several other positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to switch to all natural deodorants after reading about the long-term health hazards of using commercial deodorants.</li>
            <li> If everyone realized that all you need is some corn starch, baking soda, and essential oils to completely eliminate body odor, all the commercial deodorant companies would be out of business.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty heavy sweater</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge sweater, so maybe this helps some people, but i did go out walking in the hot weather</li>
            <li> Other users noted that the product is difficult to apply - once it is kept at room temp it goes on easily and although it goes on white it absorbs well and more or less disappears.</li>
            <li> Because of the consistency, I used the trick of cupping it in the armpit to use your body heat to soften it before you glide it, only problem, spreads a little too much and def gets in the clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rely on powerful (and potentially harmful) chemicals to keep you odorless like the usual grocery store deodorants, so it will never stay scent-free as long.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a bit different to put on than other deodorants (i.e. don&#x27;t dry your pits after the shower), but it&#x27;s worth it to me not to have any stinging/burning that I get with other</li>
            <li> Other natural deodorants don&#x27;t last all day but this one does.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as deodorants that aren&#x27;t natural which should be expected.</li>
            <li> My skin is healthier, has less inflammation, and old acne scars are finally healing!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it was as I really wanted to like this one.</li>
            <li> And the mint smell is very faint and nice.</li>
            <li> I will say, it can get messy but a little wipe down with a tissue will clean it up.</li>
            <li> As an engineer, my job requires long hours out in the field, often times in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I tried Green Tidings All Natural Deoderant</li>
            <li> It worked well and the stick itself lasted much longer than other deodorants I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> It is a little sticky and did not seem to last long enough for me.</li>
            <li> I was actually hoping for a stronger peppermint smell to this like other reviewers had mentioned</li>
            <li> try the other scents in the future!</li>
            <li> Get it warm a little before using it as when it is cold</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural products before but wind up being embarrassed by how I smelled half way through my shift.</li>
            <li> I even went up to 48 hours on a single application without showering, and working out twice (sweat), and I still don&#x27;t smell any odor.</li>
            <li> To be fair I have bad B.O. (probably from drinking too much coffee and eating wrong sometimes).</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the last 4 days in extreme heat and this stuff for me works!</li>
            <li> The tea tree regular formula is actually less reactive than the mint for me.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight minty smell to it, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used a deoderant/antiperspirant and I&#x27;ve always had chronic wet underarms.</li>
            <li> Works well, but the messy application (solid application, but \\&quot;moist flakes\\&quot; fall to floor as applying)</li>
            <li> In the winter when it is stored at temperatures below 60 it gets harder</li>
            <li> So dry and pulls my armpit hair!!</li>
            <li> Long lasting with no strong fragrances, harsh chemicals, or irritation.</li>
            <li> It was hard, I could barely use it.  </li>
            <li> an athlete (sometimes an extreme one), and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Others say to use water to apply as the deodorant can be of tougher consistency than other &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I will say watch for skin irritation due to the baking soda IF you have a problem with backing soda.</li>
            <li> It passed  my first series of  tests which up to this point every other deodorant has failed.</li>
            <li> My first impression with Junglemint is that it was extremely difficult to apply to my underarms.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been alternating between this deodorant and the other one I bought, and I have yet to smell any body-odor under my pits.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;ll order in bulk to minimize the pain.</li>
            <li> - they both work extremely well.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not that active.</li>
            <li> They are now all dark from the rash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit rough going on and can stain a few shirts.</li>
            <li> This will get more annoying soon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, no need to get rid of it all, just trim it down so that the product can make contact with your skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying a few different kinds of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and out of all that I&#x27;ve tried, this one worked the least.</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than your commercial grade crap, without all the chemicals!</li>
            <li> I previously used unscented, worked although it&#x27;s a little messy.  </li>
            <li> But I was always left smelling something unsavory by the end of the day, and if I decided to go for a run or play a soccer/football/basketball/volleyball/tennis/ultimate game, etc.</li>
            <li> Waste of time calling it &amp;#34;Mint&amp;#34; though.</li>
            <li> The deoderant works well but its too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy sweater</li>
            <li> I tried It a few times myself and each time got a rash.</li>
            <li> I would have rated it five stars but it burned my underarms so bad that for the first week I could not put my arms down</li>
            <li> while not  becoming offensively odorous.</li>
            <li> It usually ends up ripping out a few errant hairs (I know, eww), and it has started discoloring the pits of some of my shirts.</li>
            <li> Just be careful: the application surface is not very smooth and it goes on dry and rips under arm hair right out (slightly painful and uncomfortable a the very least).</li>
            <li> keeps you somewhat dry but not a great deodorizer.</li>
            <li> it is a little hard to use.</li>
            <li> The seller even put a small ice pack in the package to keep the deodorant from melting during shipment.</li>
            <li> Jungleman totally worked and hasn&#x27;t failed me yet.  </li>
            <li> Usually I heat it up over a candle for about 3 seconds if I remember.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that it would actually work.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it does that,</li>
            <li> I have to say I was skeptical because I have tried several deoderants and they do not work well for me.</li>
            <li> Jungleman&#x27;s Deodorant works all day for me, usually for 10+ hours of strenuous activity before needing to be reapplied.</li>
            <li> was disappointed at the texture - doesn&#x27;t really glide like a deodorant should.  </li>
            <li> It starts hard, but as your body warms it up, will be easier to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to put on.</li>
            <li> some of which actually have dangerous things in them like Triclosan or they still have aluminum in them but</li>
            <li> Just add some cologne after applying and it lasts at least 12 hours.</li>
            <li> Definitely difficult to get onto your skin, as per the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s only worked for me for about 2 hours before it started smelling unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It is very rough and a little painful to apply</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be getting a bad rash if I left it on.</li>
            <li> Not good for travel.</li>
            <li> but this one did not mask or prohibit odor and even made it worse.  </li>
            <li> mint scent is very faint, not worth it, but for some reason this formula gave me a rash.  </li>
            <li> and I am not clogging my lymphatic system with crap from commercial deodorant.</li>
            <li> Sorry,</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also expensive, when you add the price of product plus shipping fees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, all there products do cause a rash under my arms(same thing happened to my wife when she use it.)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found this to product sting.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this did not work.</li>
            <li> Sometimes if it&#x27;s too cold it will irritate your skin when you apply it.  </li>
            <li> Superlative delivery service (it comes cold, with a cold pack and insulation, promptly.  </li>
            <li> Scent is very faint which is what I prefer and doesn&#x27;t stain underarms on shirt.</li>
            <li> This deodorant was painful to put on (it doesn&#x27;t glide) and ended up giving me a rash.</li>
            <li> I am shocked.</li>
            <li> and I hated the scent.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find anything else that works without having that terrible aluminum.</li>
            <li> Horrible product,</li>
            <li> It burned the crap out of my armpits!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Burning sensation after several hours. Had to wash it off as it was clear I&#x27;d be getting a bad rash if I left it on. I&#x27;m not sure what it was as I really wanted to like this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorants and this is by far the best one yet! Other natural deodorants don&#x27;t last all day but this one does. One application in the morning is all I need. I will say, it can get messy but a little wipe down with a tissue will clean it up.</li>
            <li> I am an instant convert! I&#x27;ve always used a deoderant/antiperspirant and I&#x27;ve always had chronic wet underarms. After switching to this my wetness problem is almost entirely gone, and it prevents BO very well. I also like that it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Thank you junglemint!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these deodorants several times and they always melt.  Apparently the heat melts them in the box.  What a hassle.</li>
            <li> I have been trying a few different kinds of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and out of all that I&#x27;ve tried, this one worked the least. I wanted to like it. The seller even put a small ice pack in the package to keep the deodorant from melting during shipment. I like that there are only a handful of ingredients but the &amp;#34;light mint&amp;#34; scent is almost not there. It&#x27;s a bit rough going on and can stain a few shirts. It just wasn&#x27;t the kind for me.</li>
            <li> I have literally tried them all--Crystal, Men&#x27;s Science w/ Silver Microbe Technologies, Tom&#x27;s All Natural, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an athlete (sometimes an extreme one), and I need something that works.  This is the first one to pass the test!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After meeting a guy who suffered from aluminum poisoning and then learning about all the other chemical ingredients people put into deodorant (just look at your label), I concluded that I needed something all-natural.  But I was always left smelling something unsavory by the end of the day, and if I decided to go for a run or play a soccer/football/basketball/volleyball/tennis/ultimate game, etc. then forget about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Jungleman totally worked and hasn&#x27;t failed me yet.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd stick and 3rd year.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. After using this for over a year, I tried the arm and hammer natural deodorant and it burned my skin. I&#x27;m sticking with Jungleman</li>
            <li> I love these deodorants! Only natural one I&#x27;ve found that works. And the mint smell is very faint and nice. Product softens with warmth so they ship it with cooler packs. (Keep it out of warm places. Bathroom is OK, just not in a car during the summer, etc.) It starts hard, but as your body warms it up, will be easier to apply. Best product!</li>
            <li> This a great simple ingredient deodorant but t it does not spread very easily. If you apply it right after getting out of the shower then the moisture allows it to spread reasonably well.</li>
            <li> Not good for travel. Product melt in bag.</li>
            <li> This deodorant claims to be made of natural ingredients, yet I have a rash in ky underarms after months of usage, this should not be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural deodorant, so I need to remember to hit the gym at lunch and reapply.  It&#x27;s a solid white bar, which is apparently the only kind of deodorant I&#x27;m not allergic to.  Sometimes if it&#x27;s too cold it will irritate your skin when you apply it.  Usually I heat it up over a candle for about 3 seconds if I remember. Not necessary at all.  Also, don&#x27;t leave it in your gym bag on a hot day because it will all melt and reform sideways.</li>
            <li> This worked great for a guy who was looking for hypoallergenic deodorant. This was the first one which his skin didn&#x27;t react to.</li>
            <li> keeps you somewhat dry but not a great deodorizer.</li>
            <li> I understand that the deodorant is listed as having an &amp;#34;extremely light mint scent,&amp;#34; but there is no detectable scent in my deodorant.  I ordered this because I wanted a mint scent.  After putting on the deodorant it ruined a new t-shirt and stripped the fabric of any color in the underarms.  I&#x27;ve never had a deodorant do that before.  The consistency of the deodorant is coarse.  I will never use this again and it will go in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that it would actually work. I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice deodorant which is decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Junglemint for about a week and I am amazed at how well it works.</li>
            <li> It is a little sticky and did not seem to last long enough for me. Certain scents of Old Spice are all that work for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading several other positive reviews. I have now tried several all natural deodorants and this one is the best of the bunch for me. I find that I like the thicker deodorants rather than the thinner, more liquid like ones, hence why I prefer this over other brands such as Herban Cowboy. I was actually hoping for a stronger peppermint smell to this like other reviewers had mentioned but I pair with the Burt&#x27;s Bees spray as a body spray and it pairs very nicely. It will be a test this year to see how it holds up to a Memphis summer but so far all signs point to being very good.</li>
            <li> Superlative delivery service (it comes cold, with a cold pack and insulation, promptly.  Lasts me all day in moderate weather, but I need to use a wipe and re-apply in summer months.  It has the safest ingredient list I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Smelled pleasant and I didn&#x27;t get allergies but did not work at all.  I&#x27;m one of those people who don&#x27;t even sweat a lot but this one did not mask or prohibit odor and even made it worse.  Sorry, but this product is one huge miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also expensive, when you add the price of product plus shipping fees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star for the quick shipping and secure packaging.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying this is one of the best companies that I have ever dealt with. To have such a great option that is completely natural (you literally could eat this product without harming you) that has NO dangerous short term or long term hazardous chemicals makes me smile. JungleMINT is a new variety of my tried and true Jungleman  deodorant. Jungleman is absolutely effective protection for a guy like me who sweats obscenely, profusely. I sweat (which IS a healthy good thing- purging toxins, flushing out pores, etc.) while not  becoming offensively odorous. Junglemint has the addition of peppermint which is a natural antibacterial  and smells pretty darn good. Since I am trying this product during winter I can not fully attest to the efficacy of the product during hot weather. I intend on following up on it when summer returns. HOWEVER, what I can attest to is that with a physically demanding job this product provides a full days protection against odor. I always order direct from the manufacturer because the shipments are ALWAYS sent out very fast and well packaged (with freeze packs nonetheless to ensure you will get your order intact!). I am such a fan of Jungleman. This is my deodorant of choice. Quality, safe, and effective, what&#x27;s not to love? This is a definite must try product..</li>
            <li> My son uses it and likes it. He doesn&#x27;t stink so.... haha</li>
            <li> The tea tree regular formula is actually less reactive than the mint for me.  But my husband likes this version.  It&#x27;s really a personal skin reaction thing.  You need to try both unfortunately to figure it out and have someone who can use the one you can&#x27;t :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t over apply - yes, you will still perspire (which is healthy) and be &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; a little.  Just tank top it or wear wicking cotton materials when it&#x27;s super hot or you&#x27;re super nervous/excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It beats getting Alzheimer&#x27;s from aluminum!&lt;br /&gt;There is zero smell.  The deodorant completely works.</li>
            <li> Finally was able to find a natural deodorant that works all day and that I don&#x27;t need to reapply midway even on a 90 degree day.  Scent is very faint which is what I prefer and doesn&#x27;t stain underarms on shirt.</li>
            <li> Works great. Sweat all day at the ball park in a jersey, and no smell at all. Waste of time calling it &amp;#34;Mint&amp;#34; though. Virtually no discernable mint smell at all.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something that would be ingredient friendly, not make me break out, and that would be masculine/feminine neutral in scent - found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No staining on my clothes, and keeps me fresh all day - school, work, exercise - one application in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others say to use water to apply as the deodorant can be of tougher consistency than other &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; deodorants - I dab a tiny bit of cocoa butter lotion on the top of the deodorant and apply - it works well.</li>
            <li> This deodorant was painful to put on (it doesn&#x27;t glide) and ended up giving me a rash.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used hands down. I&#x27;d been wanting to use Jungleman All-Natural Deodorant for so long, based on the really great reviews, but unfortunately, I&#x27;m sensitive to tea tree oil. So when I found out about this version with peppermint oil instead of tea tree, I was so excited.  I finally got to see what all the hype is about. Believe it!!! It really is true. I apply this in the morning and work a 12 hour shift, and after all of that, no odor whatsoever. None. This stuff is amazing. Thank you. You have a customer for life.</li>
            <li> It is indeed lightly scented with mint, but man does it hurt to apply. The stick is extremely solid, and it seems as though I need to use a whole lot of force to get product to apply properly. It usually ends up ripping out a few errant hairs (I know, eww), and it has started discoloring the pits of some of my shirts. It did keep me odor free for the entire day, but due to the difficulties in application and the garment discoloration, I will continue my search for the ultimate in natural armpit odor care.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! As an engineer, my job requires long hours out in the field, often times in the sun.  I apply it once and I’m good for the day.  No odor, no rashes, and no chemicals.  This is my go to product.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They are now using organic corn starch. Just got this email from the company:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great news.  As promised, we have begun using 100% organic corn starch (which is 100% non-GMO by default) in our products.  Our product information pages and FAQ have been updated accordingly to reflect that.  Should you have any questions in the future, please feel free to contact us and we&#x27;ll be more than happy to help you.</li>
            <li> I previously used unscented, worked although it&#x27;s a little messy.  Because of the consistency, I used the trick of cupping it in the armpit to use your body heat to soften it before you glide it, only problem, spreads a little too much and def gets in the clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mint scent is very faint, not worth it, but for some reason this formula gave me a rash.  Had to stop using.</li>
            <li> I am now odor free! This deo is great! I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s all natural. I will say watch for skin irritation due to the baking soda IF you have a problem with backing soda.</li>
            <li> Works good but hurts going on!  So dry and pulls my armpit hair!!</li>
            <li> I have bought severl of the Jungle man products. This one does have a very, very light mint scent. It&#x27;s barely noticeable. Jungleman products have always provided great protection and I love that they are all natural. Unfortunately, all there products do cause a rash under my arms(same thing happened to my wife when she use it.) Not sure why it does that, but it always has. I still use the product though.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a natural deodorant that works and this is it! I have been using it for the last 4 days in extreme heat and this stuff for me works! Finally !! I am ordering more !</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use. Love the texture and protection it gives to fight BO. No scent after application really, but that&#x27;s ok for us.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best natural deodorant I have ever used, and I have used several. Long lasting with no strong fragrances, harsh chemicals, or irritation. I wish I could buy it locally.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I like the scent, which is very light. This is the first natural deodorant that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> Wow really works!! I can&#x27;t find anything else that works without having that terrible aluminum. I&#x27;ve tried many other &amp;#34;natural deodorants&amp;#34; and nothing compares. Toms and some other brand from whole foods and another brand from sprouts. Nothing like this. I sweat, and i can&#x27;t smell myself. I&#x27;m not a huge sweater, so maybe this helps some people, but i did go out walking in the hot weather and i couldn&#x27;t smell anything but peppermint and i also go to the gym run 2 miles and it was great that i didn&#x27;t smell like BO.</li>
            <li> Goes on easier than the original version, goes on clearer. Both deodorants are better than any non-natural brand I&#x27;ve used for smell. Does not stop sweat at all, but sweating is good for you.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using Degree antiperspirant for years but wanted to try out a natural deodorant because I heard that using antiperspirant causes acne.  I&#x27;m a 21-year old male and I&#x27;ve had acne since middle school so I&#x27;ve basically tried everything.  I tried Green Tidings All Natural Deoderant but it just didn&#x27;t work for me and I hated the scent.  Junglemint works TOO GOOD!!  It applies easy and keeps me odor free literally all day.  I&#x27;m a pretty heavy sweater and I can come back from a workout without any odor on my or my clothes; this stuff is amazing.  Oh, and my acne is getting better every day.  Antiperspirant was definitely blocking the release of toxins and causing my skin to break out.  My skin is healthier, has less inflammation, and old acne scars are finally healing!  Also, I&#x27;m finding that I don&#x27;t sweat as much.  Antiperspirant causes your sweat glands to become overactive because they can&#x27;t effectively release toxins from the body.  I feel so much more at ease knowing that I&#x27;m not pumping my body with aluminum every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that you kinda need to trim your armpit hair for natural deodorants to work.  Don&#x27;t worry, no need to get rid of it all, just trim it down so that the product can make contact with your skin.  I promise it will work a lot better, guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really can&#x27;t smell the mint scent when you use this; it&#x27;s effectively odorless.  But i think that&#x27;s a good thing.  Especially for guys that wear cologne or don&#x27;t want to go to work smelling like an 8th grader after he doused himself with Axe in the locker room.  The packaging is really good too.  In the box, the deodorant is wrapped in foil that (I&#x27;m assuming) blocks infrared/heat radiation from getting into the product and melting it as many natural deodorants are susceptible to.  They even throw in an ice pack to keep the product cool!!  This company really knows what they&#x27;re doing and I might just use this for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> It does the trick. Different feel than regular deodorant. I paint basketball courts so I get sweaty. This stuff holds up. It&#x27;s soft, not hard like some reviews I read. Great very light scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll forgive that the &amp;#34;light mint scent&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t last all day as, at the end of the day, there&#x27;s no scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s a bit different to put on than other deodorants (i.e. don&#x27;t dry your pits after the shower), but it&#x27;s worth it to me not to have any stinging/burning that I get with other deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that no place near me carries it, so I have to order online.</li>
            <li> I could not be more excited to find a natural deodorant that actually works for me! I sweat like a man and then some, so I was optimistic about this product. It passed  my first series of  tests which up to this point every other deodorant has failed. Firstly, it didn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin ( for some reason every other natural deodorant has), it lasted all night into the next morning with my pits smelling like peppermint!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it, I usually wake up with stinky pit but not with this amazing where have you been all my life product. I am  going to buy in bulk. Thank you Jungleman!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as advertised - all natural, extremely light scented.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed at the texture - doesn&#x27;t really glide like a deodorant should.  It feels more like trying to rub dry soap on your armpits.</li>
            <li> Hands down, bar none, best product I&#x27;ve ever purchased. No need to over apply, just lightly swipe it across your armpit, works all day. I&#x27;m in construction and a bartender. I sweat all day, no smell. This stuff works better than your commercial grade crap, without all the chemicals! Put your head into your t shirt first, then your arms. This will help you avoid chalky stains on your shirt, as you will get with any deodorant.</li>
            <li> Smell is very mild, but this deodorant really works well! Will definitely keep using this brand.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to switch to all natural deodorants after reading about the long-term health hazards of using commercial deodorants. I decided to give this product, Junglemint a try, as well as another all-natural deodorant called Organic Island Deodorant w/ Probiotics. My first impression with Junglemint is that it was extremely difficult to apply to my underarms. It is very rough and a little painful to apply as sometimes it yanks some of my underarm hairs out. It has a slight minty smell to it, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last. However, I&#x27;ve been alternating between this deodorant and the other one I bought, and I have yet to smell any body-odor under my pits. I even went up to 48 hours on a single application without showering, and working out twice (sweat), and I still don&#x27;t smell any odor. It truly is amazing how well this works with such simple ingredients. If everyone realized that all you need is some corn starch, baking soda, and essential oils to completely eliminate body odor, all the commercial deodorant companies would be out of business. I have found my two favorite deodorants that I will be using indefinitely.</li>
            <li> Recieved this superfast, has a super light mint smell. Works really well for me and no more hippy chick smell like other natural deodorants that have a strong tea tree smell, there is none of that. I love it!</li>
            <li> I already wrote a full review on the Unscented Jungleman Deodorant stick.  Truly a great product, btw!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jungleman Mint is actually pretty much like the Unscented.  The &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; is extremely light in scent, and I don&#x27;t think you would notice it at all.  You could probably tell the difference between unscented and mint if you tried to smell your pits right after putting it on, but after a couple of hours there is no smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will try the other scents in the future!</li>
            <li> I know this is going to sound corny, but this product actually works! I am shocked. I really thought this was going to be snake oil. I have tried a lot of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants some of which actually have dangerous things in them like Triclosan or they still have aluminum in them but in a different form. None of them have held up all day under normal conditions. This deodorant holds up though. Last deodorant I tried was Tom&#x27;s of Maine 24 hour protection unscented. It did not last but 2 hours. To be fair I have bad B.O. (probably from drinking too much coffee and eating wrong sometimes). I have never had a product perform like this. I want to buy stock in this company!</li>
            <li> Horrible product, if I could give 0 stars I would.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is extremely effective. It doesn&#x27;t always go on super smoothly (dampening it slightly does help) but I give it five stars simply for its amazing ability to keep you fresh all day. Even after workouts! Amazing – the first of it&#x27;s kind to work this well.</li>
            <li> It burned the crap out of my armpits! They are now all dark from the rash. The deoderant works well but its too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I buy now, and only in the cooler months (in order to prevent melting issues if shipped during the hot summer months). I recommend it to anyone looking for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have searched a long time to find the best all-natural deodorant that actually works and this one seems to do the job! Been using this product for many months now and it hasn&#x27;t failed me. The only thing I would have to say is that unlike the toxic deodorants, when using this one and you do a lot of exercise or are prone to sweat often, one would have to apply it a few times more than the regular store-bought brands, but that is not an issue for me as I know it is not made with toxic chemicals. Great product!</li>
            <li> Definitely difficult to get onto your skin, as per the other reviews.  beyond that, so far, so good.  I do like the fact that there are three ingredients.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as jungleman which also works well for me</li>
            <li> The deodorants are all with natural ingredients and they work..... I apply a little of coconut oil to armpits before applying deodorant and that&#x27;s all I need to do ..... and keeps me fresh and no BO for the rest of the day even while I&#x27;m working out.</li>
            <li> Junglemint has worked flawlessly for me. It&#x27;s the best deodorant that I&#x27;ve ever used. In my tests, 24-36 hours, using the same application, is a non-issue for holding back any smell. The only gripe I have is the shipping cost. Other than that, I&#x27;ll order in bulk to minimize the pain.</li>
            <li> This is the first &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant I&#x27;ve tried and I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed.  After awhile I started to have underarm odor.  It would be good for a day where I wasn&#x27;t going anywhere except my house.</li>
            <li> Expensive when you add the shipping in, wish it were Prime, and it often arrives melted and reformed into weird shapes, but it works really well, has almost no smell so very good for chemically sensitive people and nice to know you are using a non-toxic product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found this to product sting.</li>
            <li> It was hard, I could barely use it.  And I received it in the middle of summer and it was kept in a bathroom with no air conditioning.  I see no reason for the consistency to have been like that.  It also didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Works well, but the messy application (solid application, but \\&quot;moist flakes\\&quot; fall to floor as applying) so it makes me looking for something else. What stays on does work well, but not enough to keep me using it. That being said, my opinion on thia is because I think I prefer the liquid roll-ons over the stick application.</li>
            <li> This deodrant is great IT WORKS and its natural. Can it get any better than that?</li>
            <li> I have to say I was skeptical because I have tried several deoderants and they do not work well for me. This product works! Other users noted that the product is difficult to apply - once it is kept at room temp it goes on easily and although it goes on white it absorbs well and more or less disappears. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Jungleman&#x27;s Junglemint Deodorant worked great for me! It worked much better than the Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant that I tried before this. Tom&#x27;s only worked for me for about 2 hours before it started smelling unpleasant. Jungleman&#x27;s Deodorant works all day for me, usually for 10+ hours of strenuous activity before needing to be reapplied. However, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as deodorants that aren&#x27;t natural which should be expected. It doesn&#x27;t rely on powerful (and potentially harmful) chemicals to keep you odorless like the usual grocery store deodorants, so it will never stay scent-free as long. Overall, I am very pleased with the product. It worked well and the stick itself lasted much longer than other deodorants I&#x27;ve used in the past. I will be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy sweater and I&#x27;m not that active. However, I&#x27;ve not found a deodorant that could keep up with me (stinky lady), that is until now. I would have rated it five stars but it burned my underarms so bad that for the first week I could not put my arms down, my underarms felt like they were on fire.</li>
            <li> Works well for me. Get it warm a little before using it as when it is cold it is a little hard to use. Other than that I love the scent, it works for me and I am not clogging my lymphatic system with crap from commercial deodorant. It also seems to work better if you have issues with it getting on clothing, if you take it and rub it in with your hands.</li>
            <li> This deodorant definitely works well. I think the biggest tip is to try to keep it in an area that is a good temperature. In the winter when it is stored at temperatures below 60 it gets harder so you have to let it warm up on your skin first before applying.</li>
            <li> The mint scented works better (on me) than the unscented. Just be careful: the application surface is not very smooth and it goes on dry and rips under arm hair right out (slightly painful and uncomfortable a the very least). Otherwise, the odor control is pretty good and has a 10-12 hour limit (for me) depending on my physical activity. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way this went on. It&#x27;s really hard to put on.</li>
            <li> This is totally amazing!!  I have never before found a natural deodorant that actually prevents me from smelling for at least a full day, even after a workout.  I like this one and the unscented one equally - they both work extremely well.  It does have an odd consistency and has to be rubbed in rather than just applied, but it&#x27;s worth it for how well it works!</li>
            <li> Love it!  It works great and I sweat a lot in HOT YOGA!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this did not work. Bought it for my husband. He was happy with it for a week or so, but then the mint scent faded away from the stick entirely, and it could not keep him smelling good. I tried It a few times myself and each time got a rash. Love that there are few ingredients, but it wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> Well.....it works. I&#x27;m a busy hairstylist who works at a fast paced salon and tend to start sweating quick into the work day. I&#x27;ve tried other natural products before but wind up being embarrassed by how I smelled half way through my shift. However, with this, I&#x27;m good all the way through the entire day. And it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s made of only 4 ingredients. Kudos. Thank you and I will be buying again. Only blip is the not-so-ecofriendly packaging.</li>
            <li> The best deodorant on the market, seriously. This works 10x better than Degree Maximum Strength, and has none of the chemicals. Just add some cologne after applying and it lasts at least 12 hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a year now. It&#x27;s awesome! You still sweat (as there are no crazy chemicals that clogg your pores) but you don&#x27;t smell and your shirts don&#x27;t turn yellow colors in the underarm area! For a natural product, exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;m now a regular. Just wish they would get on Amazon Prime. I&#x27;m getting really pissed paying shipping for every single piece even if I buy 4 at a time. This will get more annoying soon.</li>
            <li> Overly solid, doesn&#x27;t spread very well and tends to pull out armpit hair.</li>
