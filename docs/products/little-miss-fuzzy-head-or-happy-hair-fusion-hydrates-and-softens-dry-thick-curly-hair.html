            <li>From reading the directions, I think it is more for locs, twists, braid-outs, etc.</li>

            <li>Little Miss Fuzzy Head - Happy Hair Fusion - 8 oz]]</li>
            <li>Little Miss Fuzzy-Head is the perfect combination of shine (looks) and softness (touch) in a non-greasy natural formula.</li>
            <li>Head\\&quot;;I love the fact that the product is all natural and organic.</li>
            <li>they sometimes also include a smaller free container which i love.</li>
            <li>I confess to being a hair product junkie--not because I love to waste my money, but because I can never seem to find the right product for my very curly hair which exists in its own world of curly freedom and independence.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just been using Happy Hair Fusion on my head for a week, but it has yet to leave my hair feeling dry and out of sorts like so many other products.</li>
            <li>I am trying to see if I mix more oil with it, it won&#x27;t leave the white residue.</li>
            <li>I have used many of the products on the market such as gels, milks, creams, etc.  </li>
            <li>It is all natural and filled with humectants.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with \\&quot;Little Miss Fuzzy</li>
            <li>I only added a wee touch of product just to smooth the ends of my hair and was ready to go about my day.</li>
            <li>I have combination curly and straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Put on when hair is wet and it feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li>This product adds shine and control my frizzzzz and my hair looks thicker and lively!</li>
            <li>I was previously using Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair milk and wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>The product coated my hair well and made my hair feel a little heavier (which was good for me) and my hair clumped into pretty curls with just a little encouragement.</li>
            <li>I find myself frequently patting my hair as this product makes it very soft and really brings out the waves.</li>
            <li>In effort to cut down on acetyl alcohol products and stay as natural as possible, I was thrilled when I found this product that you could practically eat.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair and used it as a hot oil treatment, then thereafter as a moisturizer, the product left my hair soft, shiny and manageable without any greasy residue.</li>
            <li>Little Miss Fuzzy Head has restored my hair back to a healthy soft state.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural and every time I use this product, my hair feels and looks healthier and my roots are stronger.</li>
            <li>My hair also seems to spring alive with rejuvenation, there is no frizz</li>
            <li>The ingredient list is to die for because it has everything a naturally curly girl like myself looks for in a hair product.</li>
            <li>It brings out my natural curls and leaves my hair soft without a build up.</li>
            <li>It softens and tames my hair leaving it moisturized and soft for days.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for all types of natural hair.</li>
            <li>am always looking for a product that can fight my natural frizz without being crunchy or drying.</li>
            <li>This product not only tamed the frizz, but it really helped with the curl formation.</li>
            <li>I will be interested to see the long term benefits of using the product, as it seems like it adds a lot of moisture to hair.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s all natural - always a plus for us.</li>
            <li>The down part is that it left white residue (many little white specks) in my hair after it dried...not cool!  </li>
            <li>After I shampoo, I smooth either argon oil or moroccan oil on my hair...and shortly thereafter I section my hair into four sections with a clip and with a little on my hands</li>
            <li>I then diffused on low until completely dry and followed up with a little shine serum on top.</li>
            <li>This product not only shapes the curls but leaves them soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I have recently went natural.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it if you have dry hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m half Mexican, half white girl with fine, dry and highlighted 3a curls.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m half Mexican, half white girl with fine, dry and highlighted 3a curls.</li>
            <li> I read reviews of Little Miss Fuzzy Head and decided after going over the list of ingredients that it&#x27;s natural enough not to do any damage if I tried it out.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s 80% done until the final touch ups when dry.</li>
            <li> The product dried on my hair and left my curly locks feeling soft and frizz-free with supreme curl definition.</li>
            <li> so well I don&#x27;t need to use other products other than an all natural shampoo I purchased.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve used Little Miss Fizzy Head I can see a major difference.</li>
            <li> I have used several other products.  </li>
            <li> I am Hispanic with curly thick hair, this product brought back to my hair life with all the natural organic ingredients it has.</li>
            <li> I have been using Little Miss Fuzzy Head for the last 6 months and my hair looks healthier than ever.</li>
            <li> I say give it a shot because you have nothing to loose!</li>
            <li> I was using an expensive styling product filled with silicons, which completely dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> and she has a full head of frizzy curls that are difficult to tame.</li>
            <li> is that it slips and glides along my hair when applying only a small amount.</li>
            <li> I believe this might be  due to the agave listed among the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Lo and behold, I may have found THE holy grail for curly heads...or at least this very discerning curly head who&#x27;s tired of wasting money and time and ending up disappointed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Little Miss Fuzzy Head addresses both of my issues.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair, with loose curls</li>
            <li> When I say LIFE, I mean my hair has been dry and brittle with no shine over the winter.</li>
            <li> I have 4c hair that is hard to tame.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Little Miss Fuzzy Head!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a man not afraid to admit that I have tried many hair care products. Little Miss Fuzzy-Head is the perfect combination of shine (looks) and softness (touch) in a non-greasy natural formula. I find myself frequently patting my hair as this product makes it very soft and really brings out the waves. It also has a great smell. No question that it is superior to just about all the products you will find in a beauty supply. I will be using this product for a long-time.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1HFOS2WSAZWNY]]Take a look at my Locs!! Since I&#x27;ve used Little Miss Fizzy Head I can see a major difference. It has a way of training your hair to do what you want it to do.</li>
            <li> I have 4c hair that is hard to tame. Most products leave my hair frizzy. LMFH made my hair soft, defined my curls and it smells good too. The consistency is creamy and not greasy. Although I haven&#x27;t untwisted my twists yet, they look great. My son says it looks like spiral mac n&#x27; cheese (LOL). I fully recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with \\&quot;Little Miss Fuzzy Head\\&quot;;I love the fact that the product is all natural and organic.

            <li> I just ordered this product towards the end of Jan 2011 and I must say I am very impressed! The ingredient list is to die for because it has everything a naturally curly girl like myself looks for in a hair product. I first used it as a leave in for my wash-n-go and the results were okay. From reading the directions, I think it is more for locs, twists, braid-outs, etc. But as a moisturizer and a curl refresher, this product is the bomb. I can&#x27;t say just yet if this will be a staple product in my regimen, but I am happy I ordered this product and gave it a try. O yeah, the smell is AMAZING!!!! I say give it a shot because you have nothing to loose!</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful, and it did moisturize my hair.  The down part is that it left white residue (many little white specks) in my hair after it dried...not cool!  I am trying to see if I mix more oil with it, it won&#x27;t leave the white residue.</li>
            <li> Hydrating  for my 4c hair type. Smell is awesome.</li>
            <li> This product is the absolute best product out there to shape my daughter&#x27;s curls.  She is biracial, caucasian/african-american and she has a full head of frizzy curls that are difficult to tame. This product not only shapes the curls but leaves them soft to the touch.  I was previously using Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair milk and wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied.  I will be using LMFH Happy Hair Fusion from now on.</li>
            <li> This product is so amazing! I am Hispanic with curly thick hair, this product brought back to my hair life with all the natural organic ingredients it has. When I say LIFE, I mean my hair has been dry and brittle with no shine over the winter. I was introduced to LMFH over the spring and being a beach bum till today my hairdresser said continue w/ the product you&#x27;re using in your hair because your hair is healthy you don&#x27;t need a trim today. I haven&#x27;t had a trim since May! lol... This product adds shine and control my frizzzzz and my hair looks thicker and lively! The best part is the reviving smell of LMFH which lifts me up as well! (Actually the smell makes me happy and relaxed) I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this project! The ingredients are amazing and its SUPER moisturizing!  My hair just eats this stuff up and I highly recommend it if you have dry hair! Also the customer service is fantastic and Miya (the owner of LMFH) even takes the time to write to you to see how you liked her product. Its a win all around for LMFH!!!!</li>

After I shampoo, I smooth either argon oil or moroccan oil on my hair...and shortly thereafter I section my hair into four sections with a clip and with a little on my hands I twirl smaller sections of my hair, using the clips I also train it up and back and it&#x27;s 80% done until the final touch ups when dry. I have thick hair, with loose curls and it also helps with any frizzy days. Love this product!!</li>
            <li> I was really happy to find this product online through Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should start the review of this product by mentioning that I used the product differently than recommended, since I do not do the twist thingy. I&#x27;m half Mexican, half white girl with fine, dry and highlighted 3a curls. I applied the product to each section of hair after washing and removing excess moisture from my hair with a paper towel (a trick from my hair stylist). The product coated my hair well and made my hair feel a little heavier (which was good for me) and my hair clumped into pretty curls with just a little encouragement. I then diffused on low until completely dry and followed up with a little shine serum on top. Gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always looking for a product that can fight my natural frizz without being crunchy or drying. This product not only tamed the frizz, but it really helped with the curl formation. I will be interested to see the long term benefits of using the product, as it seems like it adds a lot of moisture to hair.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for my longish multi-ethnic multi-textured thick curly, frizzy, fine hair. I was using an expensive styling product filled with silicons, which completely dried my hair out. Little Miss Fuzzy Head has restored my hair back to a healthy soft state. It is all natural and filled with humectants. It works so well I don&#x27;t need to use other products other than an all natural shampoo I purchased. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> i love this smell. The company is is on time and send you a personal letter with instructions and thanking you. Besided this i will continiue to buy this product. Put on when hair is wet and it feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I have used tons of products on my daughter&#x27;s curls and this one is our favorite so far!!!! It is so moisturizing, and it leaves her hair super soft, smooth, and shiny! Plus, it&#x27;s all natural - always a plus for us. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good moisturizing product.</li>
            <li> love the product have been using this for my extremly frizzy hair and has helped a lot. I have tried many other products and by far it is the BEST!! they sometimes also include a smaller free container which i love.</li>
            <li> Little Miss Fuzzy Head &amp;#34;Happy Hair Fusion&amp;#34; is an incredible and very satisfying product!! I confess to being a hair product junkie--not because I love to waste my money, but because I can never seem to find the right product for my very curly hair which exists in its own world of curly freedom and independence. I read reviews of Little Miss Fuzzy Head and decided after going over the list of ingredients that it&#x27;s natural enough not to do any damage if I tried it out. Lo and behold, I may have found THE holy grail for curly heads...or at least this very discerning curly head who&#x27;s tired of wasting money and time and ending up disappointed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really love about LMFH Happy Hair Fusion is that it slips and glides along my hair when applying only a small amount. I believe this might be  due to the agave listed among the ingredients. The product dried on my hair and left my curly locks feeling soft and frizz-free with supreme curl definition. The next morning, I woke up and spritzed water on my hair to bring it to life all over again. I only added a wee touch of product just to smooth the ends of my hair and was ready to go about my day. I&#x27;ve just been using Happy Hair Fusion on my head for a week, but it has yet to leave my hair feeling dry and out of sorts like so many other products. Every day has been a great hair day, and I think my wishes have finally been answered this time!! Thank you, Little Miss Fuzzy Head!!</li>
            <li> This product was introduced to me through a friend.  I found it to be remarkable on all levels regarding hair care.</li>
