            <li>The ink is so cheap Its not even staying on ur skin</li>
            <li>Cleanly packaged, lightweight, easy to handle and pretty great so far...</li>

            <li>The first time it was plugged in the power box stopped working!  </li>
            <li>Got this kit sooner than I expected it&#x27;s a great starter kit for anyone who wants to get into tattooing</li>
            <li>Its not even useful as a starter kit.</li>
            <li>So....I did the first tat last night and it looks pretty good.</li>
            <li>Everything you need to start a career or make side money is right here in this bundle</li>

            <li>vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>First off the ink that comes with this kit is not for human use.</li>
            <li>i might add the little grip was not properly made the screws were drilled in diagonally and wasnt able to tighter the tube</li>
            <li>Got every thing early..</li>
            <li>Had a problem and they fixed it</li>
            <li>definitely  for the artist trying a new medium!</li>
            <li>it was a waste of money, &amp; the seller doesn&#x27;t want to give me a full refund.</li>
            <li>ok power supply stopped 2nd time using it cheap made crap</li>

            <li> ok power supply stopped 2nd time using it cheap made crap</li>
            <li> The needle is too long..</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t even work that long</li>
            <li> came earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> - you can&#x27;t even get a single line tattooed for double this price, just no way to go wrong with this complete kit!!!  </li>
            <li> Grip is jammed and the to tattoo gun the wire is clip.</li>
            <li> but i rather you spend mor√© money for the other kits than get this one</li>
            <li> Other than that this kit will get the job done.</li>
            <li> not worth it at all, the kit never worked, and they even sent me replacement parts an none of those worked either.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s not cool at all.</li>
            <li> it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> The power supply was broken open arrival</li>
            <li> The power supply box didnt even work its just waste of money</li>
            <li> lots of small parts and allen wrenches that do not fit anything</li>
            <li> *** is small</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this kit I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was not good</li>
            <li> All the parts where not there so not happy at all</li>
            <li> No the gun was broken and had to be rigged in order to work.</li>
            <li> Seriously?!?</li>
            <li> Just be weary cause you might get a kit with something wrong with it that won&#x27;t let you tattoo.</li>
            <li> they have lousy customer service</li>
            <li> kinda disappointing</li>
            <li> Terrible not even all te parts came with it the foot pedal and cords were all missing</li>
            <li> Do not buy this crap does not work and if you try to return it</li>
            <li> The ink was terrible faded out within 3 weeks</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s shocking!</li>

            <li> Very satisfied with the product everything came new still packaged up! Shipping was 5 days but worth the money! I recommend this starter tattoo kit! Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I like it but the needle barrel kept sliding up as I ran the gun. I prefer a replacement thank you</li>
            <li> Only good thing bout it is gun worked ok power supply stopped 2nd time using it cheap made crap</li>
            <li> Its not with your money... More of a kids toy. Its not even useful as a starter kit. I had to keep asking them for different items because I couldn&#x27;t do anything to make it work. Each item they sent was shot. DONT GET THIS PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE</li>
            <li> There are no instructions on how to put this together. lots of small parts and allen wrenches that do not fit anything</li>
            <li> Power supply isnt very good, has to be turned up all the way for the gun to power on at all. Overall good starter kit.</li>
            <li> Ordered it sunday 8/10 recieved Tuesday 8/12 it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions but a quick youtube search on first time gun assembly was easy enough everything came as description says the skin is silicone the ink says its for practice only 5 9rl needles and 5 3rl needles also individually packaged to be short im satisfied and if i need to i will definitely buy from this. Company again and i woild buy this product again im super impressed</li>
            <li> Cleanly packaged, lightweight, easy to handle and pretty great so far...</li>
            <li> This s*** is Bull beca use the fact i was working and the we el after i tryed it the back of the power supply broke quick from putting the electic Cord in and the tattoo gun is good but i rather you spend mor√© money for the other kits than get this one im a tattoo artist i know and plus the s*** is small</li>
            <li> Everything worked very well on this kit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product and the shipping was handle perfectly thank you very much I will shop again with this company</li>
            <li> First off the ink that comes with this kit is not for human use. It&#x27;s only to be used to practice with. Second when I was setting up the tattoo gun one of the holes that you screw into the metal tube was warped. Other than that this kit will get the job done. Just be weary cause you might get a kit with something wrong with it that won&#x27;t let you tattoo. But hey it&#x27;s pretty much worth the price.</li>
            <li> Terrible not even all te parts came with it the foot pedal and cords were all missing</li>
            <li> I need to return this item.  The first time it was plugged in the power box stopped working!  I requested a return on it but haven&#x27;t heared anything as of yet!  Very unsatisfied</li>
            <li> All the parts where not there so not happy at all</li>
            <li> did not work in first use.. DO NOT BUY. it was a waste of money, &amp; the seller doesn&#x27;t want to give me a full refund.</li>
            <li> No the gun was broken and had to be rigged in order to work.</li>
            <li> Not at all wht i wanted wht is this a toy</li>
            <li> Everything you need to start a career or make side money is right here in this bundle&lt;br /&gt;One thing i might add the little grip was not properly made the screws were drilled in diagonally and wasnt able to tighter the tube so i had to buy a separate grip thats bogus but overall affordable and great for starters</li>
            <li> Vice clamp broke up instantly</li>
            <li> Power box shorted out after about a week, buy over all it was great.</li>
            <li> Great for practice for starters in my opinion sure not top quality to tattoo on a person but gets you going on practice skins for a great prize, very happy Thank you.</li>
            <li> No instructions on how to assemble</li>
            <li> Very good product totally recommend it everything works like its supposed too ,just got it today and I finished my tat worked great no problems.</li>
            <li> Amazing deal for the price....works great and came with everything in the picture.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great designs can&#x27;t wait to try the gun outbtobsee how it works.</li>
            <li> excelent, ill recomended :)</li>
            <li> I just got my kit in nd the purple. Grip is jammed and the to tattoo gun the wire is clip. I would like a replacement</li>
            <li> The tattoo gun stop work a week after i got it</li>
            <li> The ink was terrible faded out within 3 weeks the machine was junk too it literally electrocuted me while I was giving a tattoo and the power supply started to stall after about an hour overall it was a waste of money wish I&#x27;d saved up and got something good</li>
            <li> The power supply stopped working b4 i could even started a tattoo i only got it for one time uses but it didn&#x27;t even work that long</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this kit I was a little skeptical. I figured what the heck, it&#x27;s not even $25. This thing came in 4 days! That&#x27;s shocking! So I cracked open the box and was very pleased with what I saw. It had everything in the picture. I know some of you complainers wine about no instructions in the box. Get on YouTube. It&#x27;s simple. So....I did the first tat last night and it looks pretty good. I&#x27;m definitely happy!</li>
            <li> The ink is so cheap Its not even staying on ur skin it strips in a week</li>
            <li> The power supply was broken open arrival</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a OK gun but I suggest you buy replacement parts with it</li>
            <li> came earlier then expected. works great. vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> The tattoo gun didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> The power supply box didnt even work its just waste of money</li>
            <li> Do not buy this crap does not work and if you try to return it they have lousy customer service just save your money it actually deserves 0 stars</li>
            <li> Seriously?!? I received everything in the pictures and then some!!! Just an amazing deal, the machine is decent enough, the inks are good quality, and the assortment of everything you need to tattoo successfully is included in this $15 kit - you can&#x27;t even get a single line tattooed for double this price, just no way to go wrong with this complete kit!!!  Thankyou very much!!</li>
            <li> Had a problem and they fixed it</li>
