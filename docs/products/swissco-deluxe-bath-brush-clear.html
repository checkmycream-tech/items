    <ol>
            <li>Good luck all!</li>
            <li>Nice product, good price!</li>
            <li>Would recommend it to anyone for a good bath.</li>
            <li>so I got a good scrub.</li>
            <li>It feels good to use this brush.</li>
            <li>A good choice.</li>
            <li>Good quality brush.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the appearance and quality of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>he is very pleased with it and ordered two of them.  </li>
            <li>Just perfect to keep you in the shower until the hot water is gone.  </li>
            <li>This is a handy tool to use in the bathtub or shower.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice balanced feel.</li>
            <li>It would make a nice grill brush.  </li>
            <li>I had it delivered to me to inspect it and make sure it would meet her requirements.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m impressed enough with this brush and the value, that I have just ordered one for myself.  </li>
            <li>Many showers are tiled.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot better than what you&#x27;ll find it</li>
            <li>But they do take the soap better than my Earth Therapeutics brush.  </li>
            <li>, just make sure you&#x27;re not looking at it when you do anything that flicks the bristles about..</li>
            <li>So most of this stuff is just subjective hear say.</li>
            <li>the handle is ergonomic and it looks clean and nice in my glass shower.</li>
            <li>This brush works very well, doesn&#x27;t clog up with soap residue is the bristles are plastic not horsehair and provides a good feel.</li>
            <li>Hold soap fairly well and really gives your back a good clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I have gone through so many of these searching for the right one.</li>
            <li>It was not from a very high place though as I shower seated from a shower stool, that drop was not from more than 2 feet.  </li>
            <li>this is a nice weight with soft to medium bristles.</li>
            <li>Someone with more mobility won&#x27;t have as much</li>
            <li>mom has put it to the test numerous times, already, and she couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>The pain of my surgery was mild compared to the pain this brush inflicted on my skin.  </li>
            <li>To the mathematically challenged me, I was describing it as a rectangle someone got a bit more carried away with a disc grinder when rounding off the corners at the top ;-)  </li>
            <li>With a little care, hopefully both of us will enjoy these brushes for a good while.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s well worth the money</li>
            <li>Just like how when people brush their hair and one will be wincing and yelling OWWWWW when I could pull hanks of hair out of my head and laugh about it.</li>
            <li>This back / bath brush was a nice find.  </li>
            <li>This one I bought at Amazon did not have them so stiff but near perfect.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right length, and like the fact that head is attached.</li>
            <li>Just the right stiffness on the brush bristles.</li>
            <li>Oh yeah.  Very nice brush, not stiff, not soft.  </li>
            <li>This brush has a nice long handle</li>
            <li>A good deal of it does eventually  clear up again, only to reappear again when used again.  </li>
            <li>It looks like I purchased my first Swissco brush some years ago at Wal Greens.  </li>
            <li>Well my feet love it, and I wonder why I haven&#x27;t been using it all along for my back.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the Clear plastic and that light streak</li>
            <li>;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It wanted a brush that would really scrub my back because most I had bought were not doing the job.  </li>
            <li>but I had issues with the otherwise clear acrylic turning a kind of milky color in various locations on the head of the brush after I had used it.  .  </li>
            <li>Will probably last a good long time.</li>
            <li>The real test is in the shower or bathroom.  </li>
            <li>i wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a bath brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles had to have the right stiffness to leave my back feeling fresh, and not too roughed up.  </li>
            <li>However, I had looked at the swissco brush with the Brown plastic handle, it&#x27;s taken with the brush laying down that shows the arch in the handle and the brush and head shape better, and I had thought about ordering it also, so when I got this</li>
            <li>and the head is wide enough to cover a good amount of space, the handle curved enough to make good contact both over the shoulder or coming up from below and working upward, although, I do have to admit I have poor mobility in my shoulders</li>
            <li>and then when they are used the moisture seeps into those cracks through capillary action, particularly when there&#x27;s soap involved, it turns the milky color.  </li>
            <li>I think the proper name for the shape of the head is somewhat rounded cornered trapezoidal more or less.  </li>
            <li>running my hand over the moistened bristles, they feel much softer than my BACK feels it is, so don&#x27;t be overly dismayed by how soft it feels.  </li>
            <li>Clear handle and body but plastic</li>
            <li>so I can reach my whole back.</li>
            <li>The bristles could be a bit stiffer, but they are not too soft.  </li>
            <li>The brush is substantial without being bulky and is not too soft</li>
            <li>so I needed a far reaching brush that lathered up well.  </li>
            <li>I should have stayed with the natural boar bristle brush I replaced.  </li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t separate unexpectedly because it&#x27;s one piece.</li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;ve had another that was too soft, so that when I scrubbed it just moved with the motion, but didn&#x27;t feel like it was cleaning.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft enough to feel good on the back but firm enough to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed, through purchasing (and returning) quite a few different brands of acrylic bath/shower brushes and I&#x27;ve had, after one or two uses disintegrate.. they would separate at an angle through the head at nearly the same location in the original as well as the replacement in nearly the same location, it&#x27;s like a strip of dissolvable materials ran through it on purpose, it was bizarre.</li>
            <li>brush has a nice handle and it seems to dry out faster than wooden ones, easy to use on all difficult corners of your body</li>
            <li>The handle is a bit narrower than another brush I got, but it&#x27;s not so narrow that it spins or turns in my hands like my original brush  </li>
            <li>I used to have something in wood (in better taste) with a detachable handle (more versatile) and a hand strap to use with the handle detached (ergonomics) - all crap.</li>
            <li>With some other designs the soap gets absorbed into the material, and never wound up on my back.</li>
            <li>She feels the bristles are just right for the job --- not too stiff and not too soft.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are just stiff enough for a nice wash but not so stiff they will hurt you.  </li>
            <li>Husband wanted a long handle and this has natural bristles -  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush to anybody who is serious about removing dead skin cells and give you that clear clean back.  </li>
            <li>Now the one I bought back then did have them pretty stiff</li>

            <li> This bath brush is This brush great, I have an old back injury that makes reaching and twisting very painful.</li>
            <li> Bristles are long enough to be soft when wet.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really maneuver the brush well when trying to reach upward from my lower back to my upper back, but I can scrub sideways across the back and switch hands as my other shoulder isn&#x27;t quite as stiff.  </li>
            <li> Left me with a mess of bristles &amp; clear plastic.  </li>
            <li> Long enough handle to reach anywhere and everywhere.</li>
            <li> The way this product is photographed, I initially thought it was one of those OVAL twisted wire brushes, it&#x27;s that light spot in the center</li>
            <li> it was 16\\&quot; long.</li>
            <li> &quot; long.  </li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t too stiff so they don&#x27;t take my skin off, but they&#x27;re not so soft that it makes you wonder why you bothered getting one.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely heed the warning, by other reviewers, that it can break if dropped on tile, and I&#x27;ve already alerted my mom to the possibility.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have come across the brand of any other back brush that does the job these ones do.  </li>
            <li> But though bristles feel soft to the touch, when I scrub my back it feels somewhat hard.</li>
            <li> Has a loop on handle to hang in enclosure so will eventually air dry.</li>
            <li> The handle is long enough to reach all the way down my back-over my shoulder.  </li>
            <li> Could just be my luck of the draw (I do tend to suffer not only being subject to Murphy&#x27;s Laws, but from being a proof of those laws also.  </li>
            <li> The acrylic handle gets real slippery and is very hard to control.  </li>
            <li> admit that I did drop the brush, one time (what&#x27;s to be expected in a wet and soapy environment?)  </li>
            <li> so I was a little confused when I first got it.  </li>
            <li> Bed Bath and Beyond and other stores.</li>
            <li> This brush is definitely not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> brush head is: 4 1/4\\&quot; from the top to the base where it attaches to the handle.  </li>
            <li> After dropping this twice, the &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; broke in half.  </li>
            <li> About half way up the handle</li>
            <li> and I had to allow them to moisten up a little bit before applying the soap.  </li>
            <li> Of course, at her age, she has delicate skin, but I visited when she had just soaked in a bath with the brush wet</li>
            <li> I bought this brush and it fell a few inches into the tub and shattered.  </li>
            <li> so I waste a lot of soap.  </li>
            <li> I would figure that anything made to be used in a place like a shower should be designed to withstand quite a few drops before sustaining visible damage.  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult to judge the performance of any back brush by simply running your fingers when you are testing them at the store.  </li>
            <li> Now I have bought a number of them in the past few years, but the Swissco&#x27;s beat them all.</li>
            <li> overall length of the brush, measuring from the back side of the brush head and down the curve to the base of the handle</li>
            <li> Just trying to cover the bases since I was often frustrated when I was reading the reviews to glean some specifics about the brushes I figured I&#x27;d TRY to sprinkle a few facts in among the personal observations that can mean nothing basically since everyone has a different idea of what&#x27;s too sharp/rough/soft/stiff based on how tender their skin is.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been used very little and the bristles are already out of alignment.</li>
            <li> but given that you&#x27;re usually in a shower</li>
            <li> I got this brush about a month ago for washing my feet because my knees have become very stiff.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are too hard and don&#x27;t retain soap.</li>
            <li> Just sorry I bought one for my mom who already threw it away.</li>
            <li> The handle is 1\\&quot; across at the base near the string tie that is threaded through the hole at the very base of the handle to use to hang the brush up</li>
            <li> It is difficult to raise a bubble on that one!  </li>
            <li> So disappointed in this brush.  </li>
            <li> , I wasn&#x27;t HORRIBLY disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The width of the brush tapers upward toward the base of the brush head.  </li>
            <li> the width decreases to 7/8\\&quot; and just beneath the base of the brush head where they attach the handle is a hair under 3/4\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I purchased this bath brush for my elderly mom, at her request.  I had it delivered to me to inspect it and make sure it would meet her requirements.  I was very pleased with the appearance and quality of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom has put it to the test numerous times, already, and she couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. She feels the bristles are just right for the job --- not too stiff and not too soft.  Of course, at her age, she has delicate skin, but I visited when she had just soaked in a bath with the brush wet and I had to agree that the bristles were --- just about right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed enough with this brush and the value, that I have just ordered one for myself.  I will definitely heed the warning, by other reviewers, that it can break if dropped on tile, and I&#x27;ve already alerted my mom to the possibility. With a little care, hopefully both of us will enjoy these brushes for a good while.</li>

            <li> It looks like I purchased my first Swissco brush some years ago at Wal Greens.  It wanted a brush that would really scrub my back because most I had bought were not doing the job.  The bristles had to have the right stiffness to leave my back feeling fresh, and not too roughed up.  Now the one I bought back then did have them pretty stiff and I had to allow them to moisten up a little bit before applying the soap.  This one I bought at Amazon did not have them so stiff but near perfect.  I would highly recommend this brush to anybody who is serious about removing dead skin cells and give you that clear clean back.  I don&#x27;t think I have come across the brand of any other back brush that does the job these ones do.  It is very difficult to judge the performance of any back brush by simply running your fingers when you are testing them at the store.  The real test is in the shower or bathroom.  Now I have bought a number of them in the past few years, but the Swissco&#x27;s beat them all.</li>
            <li> So disappointed in this brush.  It&#x27;s been used very little and the bristles are already out of alignment. This brush is definitely not worth the price.  It lacks the quality I was looking for.  Just sorry I bought one for my mom who already threw it away.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush and it fell a few inches into the tub and shattered.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a handy tool to use in the bathtub or shower.  Would recommend it to anyone for a good bath.</li>
            <li> This brush has a nice long handle so I can reach my whole back. The bristles could be a bit stiffer, but they are not too soft.  It has a nice balanced feel.</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a bath brush. this is a nice weight with soft to medium bristles. the handle is ergonomic and it looks clean and nice in my glass shower.</li>
            <li> The handle is long enough to reach all the way down my back-over my shoulder.  The brush is substantial without being bulky and is not too soft so I got a good scrub.</li>
            <li> I recently had rotator cuff surgery on my shoulder so I needed a far reaching brush that lathered up well.  I use liquid body soap and this brush does not hold the liquid so I waste a lot of soap.  The pain of my surgery was mild compared to the pain this brush inflicted on my skin.  It would make a nice grill brush.  The acrylic handle gets real slippery and is very hard to control.  I should have stayed with the natural boar bristle brush I replaced.  Oh well, summer is coming soon and I&#x27;ll fire up the grill.</li>
            <li> I used to have something in wood (in better taste) with a detachable handle (more versatile) and a hand strap to use with the handle detached (ergonomics) - all crap. This one doesn&#x27;t separate unexpectedly because it&#x27;s one piece. It&#x27;s plastic, so it won&#x27;t rot in the damp environment and the bristles are well anchored. Pride of ownership is now in how well and simply it just works. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> ...or it&#x27;ll break.  It&#x27;s inevitable that a back brush gets dropped.  My shower is tile.  Many showers are tiled.  After dropping this twice, the &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; broke in half.  Left me with a mess of bristles &amp; clear plastic.  Might not break if you have a vinyl shower floor.</li>
            <li> I got this brush about a month ago for washing my feet because my knees have become very stiff.  Well my feet love it, and I wonder why I haven&#x27;t been using it all along for my back.  The bristles are just stiff enough for a nice wash but not so stiff they will hurt you.  It feels good to use this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush works very well, doesn&#x27;t clog up with soap residue is the bristles are plastic not horsehair and provides a good feel. It&#x27;s a lot better than what you&#x27;ll find it Bed Bath and Beyond and other stores. A good choice.</li>
            <li> The way this product is photographed, I initially thought it was one of those OVAL twisted wire brushes, it&#x27;s that light spot in the center I think that did it.  It&#x27;s the Clear plastic and that light streak so I was a little confused when I first got it.  However, I had looked at the swissco brush with the Brown plastic handle, it&#x27;s taken with the brush laying down that shows the arch in the handle and the brush and head shape better, and I had thought about ordering it also, so when I got this and it wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was, I wasn&#x27;t HORRIBLY disappointed.  The bristles aren&#x27;t too stiff so they don&#x27;t take my skin off, but they&#x27;re not so soft that it makes you wonder why you bothered getting one.  The handle is a bit narrower than another brush I got, but it&#x27;s not so narrow that it spins or turns in my hands like my original brush  did.  I think it&#x27;s well worth the money and the head is wide enough to cover a good amount of space, the handle curved enough to make good contact both over the shoulder or coming up from below and working upward, although, I do have to admit I have poor mobility in my shoulders so I can&#x27;t really maneuver the brush well when trying to reach upward from my lower back to my upper back, but I can scrub sideways across the back and switch hands as my other shoulder isn&#x27;t quite as stiff.  Someone with more mobility won&#x27;t have as much difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall length of the brush, measuring from the back side of the brush head and down the curve to the base of the handle it was 16\\&quot; long. The handle is 1\\&quot; across at the base near the string tie that is threaded through the hole at the very base of the handle to use to hang the brush up should you have somewhere to hang it from.  The width of the brush tapers upward toward the base of the brush head.  About half way up the handle the width decreases to 7/8\\&quot; and just beneath the base of the brush head where they attach the handle is a hair under 3/4\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is: 4 1/4\\&quot; from the top to the base where it attaches to the handle.  2 7/8\\&quot; across the widest spot on the back of the brush head.  2 1/4\\&quot; across the back of the brush head at the narrowest spot.  The bristle length is about 7/8\\&quot; long.  I&#x27;m mathematically challenged.. I think the proper name for the shape of the head is somewhat rounded cornered trapezoidal more or less.  To the mathematically challenged me, I was describing it as a rectangle someone got a bit more carried away with a disc grinder when rounding off the corners at the top ;-)  Anyway, I hope that the measurements, keep in mind they&#x27;re not absolute, but I did use an old tape measure to get as close as I could, help you picture what it may be like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When running my hand over the moistened bristles, they feel much softer than my BACK feels it is, so don&#x27;t be overly dismayed by how soft it feels.  But they do take the soap better than my Earth Therapeutics brush.  It is difficult to raise a bubble on that one!  It DOES splatter a lot if that matters to you but given that you&#x27;re usually in a shower and you&#x27;re not going to get any clothes speckled with the soapy water, just make sure you&#x27;re not looking at it when you do anything that flicks the bristles about.. and.. of course.. don&#x27;t push your soap over the bristles away from you or it&#x27;ll definitely splatter towards you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I&#x27;ll shaddup now.  Just trying to cover the bases since I was often frustrated when I was reading the reviews to glean some specifics about the brushes I figured I&#x27;d TRY to sprinkle a few facts in among the personal observations that can mean nothing basically since everyone has a different idea of what&#x27;s too sharp/rough/soft/stiff based on how tender their skin is.  Just like how when people brush their hair and one will be wincing and yelling OWWWWW when I could pull hanks of hair out of my head and laugh about it. Not tender headed here!  So most of this stuff is just subjective hear say. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** 5/02/2013*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to return this.  I cannot say this will happen to all the bath &amp; shower brushes but I had issues with the otherwise clear acrylic turning a kind of milky color in various locations on the head of the brush after I had used it.  .  I think it might be caused by tiny cracks forming around the holes where the bristles are inserted and then when they are used the moisture seeps into those cracks through capillary action, particularly when there&#x27;s soap involved, it turns the milky color.  A good deal of it does eventually  clear up again, only to reappear again when used again.  The thing is, the milky area that remains, grows over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit that I did drop the brush, one time (what&#x27;s to be expected in a wet and soapy environment?)  It was not from a very high place though as I shower seated from a shower stool, that drop was not from more than 2 feet.  I would figure that anything made to be used in a place like a shower should be designed to withstand quite a few drops before sustaining visible damage.  Could just be my luck of the draw (I do tend to suffer not only being subject to Murphy&#x27;s Laws, but from being a proof of those laws also.  Quite annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, as I said, it may just be my luck of the draw.  I have noticed, through purchasing (and returning) quite a few different brands of acrylic bath/shower brushes and I&#x27;ve had, after one or two uses disintegrate.. they would separate at an angle through the head at nearly the same location in the original as well as the replacement in nearly the same location, it&#x27;s like a strip of dissolvable materials ran through it on purpose, it was bizarre. (Avoid Earth Therapeutics at all costs as they&#x27;re the ones with dissolving acrylic strips)!  I bought a wooden brush finally since I&#x27;ve had no luck with acrylics).  Good luck all!</li>
            <li> Good quality brush. Hold soap fairly well and really gives your back a good clean feeling. Will probably last a good long time.</li>
            <li> I have gone through so many of these searching for the right one. It&#x27;s the right length, and like the fact that head is attached. But though bristles feel soft to the touch, when I scrub my back it feels somewhat hard. That being said, I&#x27;ve had another that was too soft, so that when I scrubbed it just moved with the motion, but didn&#x27;t feel like it was cleaning. I also like the fact I can apply liquid soap to this. With some other designs the soap gets absorbed into the material, and never wound up on my back.</li>
            <li> Clear handle and body but plastic so don&#x27;t drop or it could break! Bristles are long enough to be soft when wet. Long enough handle to reach anywhere and everywhere. Has a loop on handle to hang in enclosure so will eventually air dry. Nice product, good price!</li>
            <li> Bristles are too hard and don&#x27;t retain soap.</li>
            <li> Just the right stiffness on the brush bristles.</li>
            <li> but decided that I might as well order one for myself.  Oh yeah.  Very nice brush, not stiff, not soft.  Just perfect to keep you in the shower until the hot water is gone.  A definite recommend.</li>
            <li> This bath brush is This brush great, I have an old back injury that makes reaching and twisting very painful. This brush will allow me to wash my back with no pain. and reaches my legs and feet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> This back / bath brush was a nice find.  Husband wanted a long handle and this has natural bristles -  he is very pleased with it and ordered two of them.  The bristles are soft enough to feel good on the back but firm enough to exfoliate.  The wooden handled brushes cracked open from the water (!)</li>
