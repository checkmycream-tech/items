            <li>Great product.  </li>

            <li>Very light, it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair done and it smells very good.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>I am going to see what else Alterna makes, if they are this good I might switch everything.</li>
            <li>but I truly cannot understand all the good reviews on this.</li>

            <li>I love Bamboo!  </li>
            <li>I love this spray!</li>
            <li>This, plus the conditioner, UV+ Fade Proof Fluide Spray for Unisex, 2.5 Ounce, was so amazing that I bought the shampoo in the volume container.  </li>
            <li>great product and quick delivery</li>
            <li>This product solved EVERYTHING it is by far the best product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It sprays nicely and smells ok, but it does not hold as well as I would like it to.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very light and delightful unlike my old hair spray.</li>
            <li>I liked the scent of this hair spray a lot - and I have to be honest, it held my fine</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day), doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell ( just when you first spray sort of then immediately fades) and most of all does an AMAZING job of fending of humidity!!</li>
            <li>Nice light scent, does not linger with you all day like some.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Has more hold than this one.  </li>
            <li>I use this in Texas more in fall and winter.  </li>
            <li>I have short hair and this hair spray is great!  </li>
            <li>I love this hair</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray.....</li>
            <li>Hairspray worked okay.  </li>
            <li>I love it this hair spray.  </li>
            <li>Stuff at the Dollar Tree has worked more favorably.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love these products.  </li>
            <li>I used to love writing reviews before kids.</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray, and won&#x27;t buy anything else since I have discovered it.  </li>
            <li>A light breeze and not terribly humid out.</li>
            <li>It works great if you need soft hold while minimizing  frizz.  </li>
            <li>Also my hair is easy to brush through it after using.  </li>
            <li>hair is quite fine and found this product did not have the hold power</li>
            <li>For fine hair I would not recommend.</li>
            <li>This light hairspray did not work well on my fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>After hours my hair still looked smooth and performed well.</li>
            <li>I also use the Alterna caviar working harispray  in the cooler months for light hold as well.  </li>
            <li>I also was able to see some freshly shampooed shine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is gluten free, has a non-offensive fragrance, is not sticky in humidity (even at the beach), holds my style while not looking like a plastered mannequin, lets the shine come through.  </li>
            <li>Not a sticky feel, Great Stuff- will definitely buy again</li>
            <li>This spray keeps my locks beautifully smooth on humid/rainy days.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic hair spray.</li>
            <li>and my husband who did not use hair spray tried it based on &amp;#34;anti-humidity&amp;#34; and liked it so much he took it away from me.  </li>
            <li>Nice product with decent holding power.</li>
            <li>Alterna&#x27;s more natural approach to hair care is highly effective and actually works better than the popular mainstream brands.</li>
            <li>The only solution seems to be a perfect climate which so far I haven&#x27;t found!  </li>
            <li>For the first time in my many years and years of searching I can make my hair look like it was done at a blow bar.  </li>
            <li>No more frizz just wonderful hair.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure this spray would hold as well as my superfine hair requires, but it has excellent hold without unnecessary residue.  </li>
            <li>It also has the Chi Enviro Keratin treatment in, so is pretty lovely in texture.</li>
            <li>At first my hair is okay</li>
            <li>It is a good product and if you live in a high humidity area you will love it.  </li>
            <li>When you have very fine porous curly hair as I do, nothing keeps my frizz under control in very humid weather.  </li>
            <li>I clean it every time before I use it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all I ask, and those qualities are definitely superior to most other sprays.</li>
            <li>I love it, it works very well, and you don&#x27;t have to compromise your health.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s very light and does a decent job.</li>
            <li>Very good product but one top was broken in transit and leaked in the carton</li>
            <li>For many years I have tried every product on the market claiming to control frizz in high humidity.  </li>
            <li>It really helps in the humidity!!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but it is not  thin.  </li>
            <li>So far so good, not stiff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll use this for when I absolutely need to have my hair looking fantastic, but for day-to-day use I can&#x27;t trash my hair with this.</li>
            <li>This hairspray is the only kind that works for me.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Love the way it feels natural and without feeling your hair is plastered in place.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that tends to frizz in humidity, so this is perfect for me because it prevents my flat ironed hair from frizzing when I go out in the evenings near the beach.</li>
            <li>This product has great hold without making my hair stiff.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those with fine hair who want to have volume throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The hairspray worked well but the bottle clogged up almost right away</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t really help for women of color!</li>
            <li>If it is real humid and you want extra hold the caviar extra hold will work great too.  </li>
            <li>For my hair and Hot, Hot, climate.</li>
            <li>I actually put a different top on the first container because I just couldn&#x27;t deal with the top.</li>
            <li>It is a must for my hair that drastically goes craz  at the first touch of humidity.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair that I&#x27;m wearing straight right now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early fifties and my hair gets very brittle from cheap hairsprays.  </li>
            <li>The people giving it better reviews either have low standards or don&#x27;t mind looking like they&#x27;re getting ready for a 1989 filming of The Jerry Springer Show...</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>but it is straight.  </li>
            <li>I really have tried everything from oils on.  </li>
            <li>I like my hair, but not that much.</li>
            <li>I will add a picture to show how much this works.  </li>
            <li>pricey but really does work.</li>
            <li>My hair turns very unruly in this weather and without the spray would have started frizzed up.</li>
            <li>It remained straight and held its style.</li>
            <li>I really like this hairspray, but it always seems to get clogged up in the spray nozzle.</li>
            <li>Then the real problem came when I walked home.</li>
            <li>while I like the concept, doesn&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Besides this, the product seems to be very drying.</li>
            <li>and then it looks really dry…</li>
            <li>After washing my hair after using this my hair felt really dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives you a nice hold without being sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li>Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad.</li>
            <li>I have dry hair that frizzes easily.  </li>
            <li>The product could use more \\&quot;hold\\&quot; but goes on light enough so as not to be heavy on my hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My hair type:  Super fine, but really thick.  </li>
            <li>I received this hairspray as a sample once a few years ago and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>Tested this out in the heat of summer with high humidity  in New England.</li>
            <li>I have used just about every hair spray invented,from $1.99 to $28.00 a can, and FINALLY I have found the right one.</li>
            <li>It holds my hair but doesn&#x27;t make it stiff :)</li>
            <li>I have used it four weeks now, and can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>Looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy to straight fine hair that doesn&#x27;t frizz per se, but does have the tendency to be limp in humid climates.  </li>
            <li>Hair not stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li>I have used it several times, including times including near the beach, in very humid climate</li>
            <li>Since this is a product I use daily, I feel great knowing I am not spraying harsh, damaging chemicals on it everyday.  </li>
            <li>Especially when you go through it so fast.  </li>
            <li>They work well naturally</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft, but basically in place.</li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy hair and like to keep it maintained without taking a chemical bath (unfortunately, many drugstore and salon hairsprays give me headache).  </li>
            <li>First of all, the top is so difficult to remove, that you want to leave it off all together.</li>
            <li>Plus, it is light enough so that it doesn&#x27;t cause heavy fumes or odor when I spray it.  </li>
            <li>I have major frizz going on.  </li>
            <li>This spray generally gives me decent hold, but it&#x27;s not enough to stop my curls from falling during extremely humid / rainy days.</li>
            <li>This hairspray has just the right amount of hold, not too heavy but enough hold to last all day.  </li>
            <li>I am product obsessed and it seems most barely deliver on their claims.  </li>
            <li>I felt it dried and dulled my hair more than my usual anti-humidity spray and did not hold as well.</li>
            <li>Usually I go high end salon products, but nothing would keep my fizz down.  </li>
            <li>I like this hairspray, no overpowering scent, does the job it is supposed to do in high humidity without weighing the hair down.</li>

            <li> When you have very fine porous curly hair as I do, nothing keeps my frizz under control in very humid weather.  </li>
            <li> I clean it every time before I use it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all I ask, and those qualities are definitely superior to most other sprays.</li>
            <li> I love it, it works very well, and you don&#x27;t have to compromise your health.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s very light and does a decent job.</li>
            <li> Very good product but one top was broken in transit and leaked in the carton</li>
            <li> For many years I have tried every product on the market claiming to control frizz in high humidity.  </li>
            <li> It really helps in the humidity!!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but it is not  thin.  </li>
            <li> So far so good, not stiff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll use this for when I absolutely need to have my hair looking fantastic, but for day-to-day use I can&#x27;t trash my hair with this.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is the only kind that works for me.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels natural and without feeling your hair is plastered in place.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that tends to frizz in humidity, so this is perfect for me because it prevents my flat ironed hair from frizzing when I go out in the evenings near the beach.</li>
            <li> This product has great hold without making my hair stiff.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those with fine hair who want to have volume throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The hairspray worked well but the bottle clogged up almost right away</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really help for women of color!</li>
            <li> If it is real humid and you want extra hold the caviar extra hold will work great too.  </li>
            <li> For my hair and Hot, Hot, climate.</li>
            <li> I actually put a different top on the first container because I just couldn&#x27;t deal with the top.</li>
            <li> It is a must for my hair that drastically goes craz  at the first touch of humidity.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair that I&#x27;m wearing straight right now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early fifties and my hair gets very brittle from cheap hairsprays.  </li>
            <li> The people giving it better reviews either have low standards or don&#x27;t mind looking like they&#x27;re getting ready for a 1989 filming of The Jerry Springer Show...</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> but it is straight.  </li>
            <li> I really have tried everything from oils on.  </li>
            <li> I like my hair, but not that much.</li>
            <li> I will add a picture to show how much this works.  </li>
            <li> pricey but really does work.</li>
            <li> My hair turns very unruly in this weather and without the spray would have started frizzed up.</li>
            <li> It remained straight and held its style.</li>
            <li> I really like this hairspray, but it always seems to get clogged up in the spray nozzle.</li>
            <li> Then the real problem came when I walked home.</li>
            <li> while I like the concept, doesn&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Besides this, the product seems to be very drying.</li>
            <li> and then it looks really dry…</li>
            <li> After washing my hair after using this my hair felt really dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives you a nice hold without being sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li> Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair that frizzes easily.  </li>
            <li> The product could use more \\&quot;hold\\&quot; but goes on light enough so as not to be heavy on my hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My hair type:  Super fine, but really thick.  </li>
            <li> I received this hairspray as a sample once a few years ago and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> Tested this out in the heat of summer with high humidity  in New England.</li>
            <li> I have used just about every hair spray invented,from $1.99 to $28.00 a can, and FINALLY I have found the right one.</li>
            <li> It holds my hair but doesn&#x27;t make it stiff :)</li>
            <li> I have used it four weeks now, and can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> Looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy to straight fine hair that doesn&#x27;t frizz per se, but does have the tendency to be limp in humid climates.  </li>
            <li> Hair not stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> I have used it several times, including times including near the beach, in very humid climate</li>
            <li> Since this is a product I use daily, I feel great knowing I am not spraying harsh, damaging chemicals on it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Especially when you go through it so fast.  </li>
            <li> They work well naturally</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft, but basically in place.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and like to keep it maintained without taking a chemical bath (unfortunately, many drugstore and salon hairsprays give me headache).  </li>
            <li> First of all, the top is so difficult to remove, that you want to leave it off all together.</li>
            <li> Plus, it is light enough so that it doesn&#x27;t cause heavy fumes or odor when I spray it.  </li>
            <li> I have major frizz going on.  </li>
            <li> This spray generally gives me decent hold, but it&#x27;s not enough to stop my curls from falling during extremely humid / rainy days.</li>
            <li> This hairspray has just the right amount of hold, not too heavy but enough hold to last all day.  </li>
            <li> I am product obsessed and it seems most barely deliver on their claims.  </li>
            <li> I felt it dried and dulled my hair more than my usual anti-humidity spray and did not hold as well.</li>
            <li> Usually I go high end salon products, but nothing would keep my fizz down.  </li>
            <li> I like this hairspray, no overpowering scent, does the job it is supposed to do in high humidity without weighing the hair down.</li>
            <li> It dries the hair, and down not prevent at all frizz, does not really protect against humidity, rather dries the hair too much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and overly sticky and it drys my hair out while giving me little hold and super crunchiness.</li>
            <li> However, didn&#x27;t do any better job than a less expensive brand.  </li>
            <li> I found this hairspray out of desperation for something that would not leave my hair gunky and dry my hair out.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for good hold that will not dry out your hair or leave nasty build up, this is it!</li>
            <li> I recommend this it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out the hair the way other hairsprays do.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it works on other hair types.  </li>
            <li> In the winter my porous hair becomes very dry and limp.  </li>
            <li> I felt that this product was definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it is never sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> Battle humidity without weighing down the hair.</li>
            <li> and this does not weigh it down whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed this over my hair and smoothed it down.</li>
            <li> When less humid.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it serves it&#x27;s purpose and never let&#x27;s me down.</li>
            <li> I use it year round.</li>
            <li> Not in the dead heat of the Texas summer.</li>
            <li> I got home and my hair was INCREDIBLY fluffy and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Beside not controlling my frizz, this product makes my hair stiff.  </li>
            <li> Hair stays without looking stiff.</li>
            <li> The hair spray holds well without the sticky or stiff hair sprayed look.</li>
            <li> Lightweight , no strong smell.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase, so not sure if I got a bad one, or that&#x27;s just how it is.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this overpriced pretentious product.</li>
            <li> I bought it as well as the Alterna Bamboo Shampoo and conditioner after my last appointment but am sorry that I did.  </li>
            <li> Holds well, is not sticky, doesn&#x27;t make hair hard, at the end of the day brushes out</li>
            <li> Not good product, does not deliver what it promises.</li>
            <li> The scent was not too objectionable, but not great.</li>
            <li> This makes me hair stiff and feel brittle and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> When I was looking at the expensive Oribe product I saw this in the Amazon suggestion, and I bought it from the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not wonderful, but not bed!</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> Not to bad!</li>
            <li> I hate sticky hairspray!  </li>
            <li> Just terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice light scent, does not linger with you all day like some.&lt;br /&gt;Hair does not feel sticky.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is quite fine and found this product did not have the hold power I need.&lt;br /&gt;Would probably work great for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Battle humidity without weighing down the hair.</li>
            <li> This hairspray has just the right amount of hold, not too heavy but enough hold to last all day.  Plus, it is light enough so that it doesn&#x27;t cause heavy fumes or odor when I spray it.  With some hairsprays you have to hold your breath and run out of the room after spraying them, but not with this one.  Also my hair is easy to brush through it after using.  I use it year round.</li>
            <li> Nice product with decent holding power.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is the only kind that works for me.</li>
            <li> When you have very fine porous curly hair as I do, nothing keeps my frizz under control in very humid weather.  For many years I have tried every product on the market claiming to control frizz in high humidity.  I have found none that work for me.  In the winter my porous hair becomes very dry and limp.  The only solution seems to be a perfect climate which so far I haven&#x27;t found!  Beside not controlling my frizz, this product makes my hair stiff.  Perhaps it works on other hair types.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really help for women of color!</li>
            <li> Hair not stiff or sticky. Hair stays without looking stiff. Second can I&#x27;ve purchased. Highly recommend this product. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Very good product but one top was broken in transit and leaked in the carton</li>
            <li> This hair spray isn&#x27;t sticky.  It seems to reduce he frizz and hold up in humid conditions.  Smells good. too..</li>
            <li> My hair type:  Super fine, but really thick.  It is a joke with my hairdresser that my hair thinks it is curly but it is straight.  I have major frizz going on.  I also have tried everything under the sun over 20 years, never finding anything that was perfect.  Usually I go high end salon products, but nothing would keep my fizz down.  I really have tried everything from oils on.  My hairdresser told me to try a product that was $60.00.  I like my hair, but not that much. Especially when you go through it so fast.  When I was looking at the expensive Oribe product I saw this in the Amazon suggestion, and I bought it from the reviews.  This product solved EVERYTHING it is by far the best product I have ever used.  If I get to it I will add a picture to show how much this works.  For the first time in my many years and years of searching I can make my hair look like it was done at a blow bar.  It looks great all day, and adds shine, does not feel sticky.  No more frizz just wonderful hair.  I could not even wear a pony tale before even with spray.  Now I can.  I have used it four weeks now, and can&#x27;t live without it.  Trust me, if you have frizz, this will solve your problem buy it!  I am going to see what else Alterna makes, if they are this good I might switch everything.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray I have ever used. Does the job without the stiffness. Will definitely buy again and again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hairstylist for my very curly frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> Works great! Lightweight , no strong smell. Love it!</li>
            <li> I like this hairspray, no overpowering scent, does the job it is supposed to do in high humidity without weighing the hair down.</li>
            <li> This, plus the conditioner, UV+ Fade Proof Fluide Spray for Unisex, 2.5 Ounce, was so amazing that I bought the shampoo in the volume container.  1/2 the price</li>
            <li> I used this hairspray for my wedding day in the Caribbean and it worked great.  My hair stayed in place, no frizz or crunchiness.  I have naturally wavy to straight fine hair that doesn&#x27;t frizz per se, but does have the tendency to be limp in humid climates.  After hours my hair still looked smooth and performed well.</li>
            <li> Sorry but I truly cannot understand all the good reviews on this. I have used it several times, including times including near the beach, in very humid climate and I think it&#x27;s useless. It&#x27;s thick and overly sticky and it drys my hair out while giving me little hold and super crunchiness. For fine hair I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that tends to frizz in humidity, so this is perfect for me because it prevents my flat ironed hair from frizzing when I go out in the evenings near the beach. The fragrance is very light and delightful unlike my old hair spray.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray.  I have fine hair, but it is not  thin.  Works good in the Texas heat.  If it is real humid and you want extra hold the caviar extra hold will work great too.  Has more hold than this one.  I use this in Texas more in fall and winter.  Not in the dead heat of the Texas summer. I also use the Alterna caviar working harispray  in the cooler months for light hold as well.  When less humid.  I have used so many hair spray&#x27;s and these are some of the very best.  For my hair and Hot, Hot, climate.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this hair spray is great!  I hate sticky hairspray!  You can also style your hair as you spray it on with out all the sticky stuff on your hands!</li>
            <li> The product could use more \\&quot;hold\\&quot; but goes on light enough so as not to be heavy on my hair. I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> I love this hair it is great , and it does the job like it say . I order 3 at a time</li>
            <li> This light hairspray did not work well on my fine, curly hair. I felt it dried and dulled my hair more than my usual anti-humidity spray and did not hold as well. The scent was not too objectionable, but not great. I felt that this product was definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I recommend this it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out the hair the way other hairsprays do. And from what I understand that is the nature of Alterna bamboo products. They work well naturally</li>
            <li> pricey but really does work.</li>
            <li> Living in Fla. and having to fight the humidity and heat, this is a winner. I have used just about every hair spray invented,from $1.99 to $28.00 a can, and FINALLY I have found the right one. Thank you Amazon and ALTERNA.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray.....great in humidity .</li>
            <li> Tested this out in the heat of summer with high humidity  in New England. My hair turns very unruly in this weather and without the spray would have started frizzed up. It remained straight and held its style. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> It dries the hair, and down not prevent at all frizz, does not really protect against humidity, rather dries the hair too much.  Not good product, does not deliver what it promises.</li>
            <li> Hairspray worked okay.  However, didn&#x27;t do any better job than a less expensive brand.  So for the money I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love it this hair spray.  It gives you a nice hold without being sticky or stiff.  I like that I can work my hair even after having sprayed it.  It says it&#x27;s anti-humidity and I have to say, it does help.</li>
            <li> It holds my hair but doesn&#x27;t make it stiff :)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this spray would hold as well as my superfine hair requires, but it has excellent hold without unnecessary residue.  I also was able to see some freshly shampooed shine.  That&#x27;s all I ask, and those qualities are definitely superior to most other sprays.</li>
            <li> I really like this hairspray, but it always seems to get clogged up in the spray nozzle. I clean it every time before I use it. This is my first purchase, so not sure if I got a bad one, or that&#x27;s just how it is.</li>
            <li> Just terrible. It smells great, and that&#x27;s about it. This makes me hair stiff and feel brittle and unpleasant. Stuff at the Dollar Tree has worked more favorably. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this overpriced pretentious product. The people giving it better reviews either have low standards or don&#x27;t mind looking like they&#x27;re getting ready for a 1989 filming of The Jerry Springer Show...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I have baby-fine hair and this does not weigh it down whatsoever.  A little goes a long way and lasts all day.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Not to bad! It&#x27;s not wonderful, but not bed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it serves it&#x27;s purpose and never let&#x27;s me down. Looks very natural. Smells good too, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I gave this hair spray 5 stars because for me:&lt;br /&gt;It is gluten free, has a non-offensive fragrance, is not sticky in humidity (even at the beach), holds my style while not looking like a plastered mannequin, lets the shine come through.  So far the best I have found to meet my many needs!!</li>
            <li> I love Bamboo!  My hair dresser got me hooked. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I went to sephora to try this out. I have curly hair that I&#x27;m wearing straight right now. It also has the Chi Enviro Keratin treatment in, so is pretty lovely in texture. However, with all approaching, all that humid wind is making my hair puffy. Boo. I sprayed this over my hair and smoothed it down. So far so good, not stiff. Went around and played with makeup, got some samples, then checked again. The shine was totally gone from my hair, totally zapped out. Sad. Then the real problem came when I walked home. it was about a mile walk, not windy at all. A light breeze and not terribly humid out. I got home and my hair was INCREDIBLY fluffy and frizzy. This product did basically nothing.</li>
            <li> while I like the concept, doesn&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
            <li> Very light, it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair done and it smells very good.</li>
            <li> I found this hairspray out of desperation for something that would not leave my hair gunky and dry my hair out.  I&#x27;m in my early fifties and my hair gets very brittle from cheap hairsprays.  If you are looking for good hold that will not dry out your hair or leave nasty build up, this is it!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My friend introduced me to this product. I love it, it works very well, and you don&#x27;t have to compromise your health. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Wonderful , wonderful!! Keeps my hair soft, but basically in place. Not a sticky feel, Great Stuff- will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I have dry hair that frizzes easily.  This spray keeps my locks beautifully smooth on humid/rainy days.  Alterna Bamboo Smooth products have been the best I&#x27;ve tried for my hair type. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love these products.  The hair spray holds well without the sticky or stiff hair sprayed look. It also smells great.</li>
            <li> For someone who has very fine hair, this hair spray provides amazing body and volume!! Highly recommended for those with fine hair who want to have volume throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I love this spray! It really helps in the humidity!!</li>
            <li> This hairspray is the best I have used.  It works great if you need soft hold while minimizing  frizz.  Also is great for  creating volumn and texture  to hair for stying.</li>
            <li> great product and quick delivery</li>
            <li> Smells great! But it makes your hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this hair spray and I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering again. First of all, the top is so difficult to remove, that you want to leave it off all together. I actually put a different top on the first container because I just couldn&#x27;t deal with the top. Besides this, the product seems to be very drying. At first my hair is okay and then it looks really dry…</li>
            <li> Has just enough hold to manage my hair</li>
            <li> The hairspray worked well but the bottle clogged up almost right away so I couldn&#x27;t get the hairspray out even after using methods to unclog the nozzle .</li>
            <li> This product has great hold without making my hair stiff.  I would recommend it too anyone.  All Alterna products are great.</li>
            <li> My favourite hairspray.</li>
            <li> I liked the scent of this hair spray a lot - and I have to be honest, it held my fine (I&#x27;ll never hold a curl) hair for a good 8 hours. However by the end of the day my hair felt crunchy and sticky. After washing my hair after using this my hair felt really dry.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use this for when I absolutely need to have my hair looking fantastic, but for day-to-day use I can&#x27;t trash my hair with this.</li>
            <li> I used to love writing reviews before kids. These days I never take the time. HOWEVER this product has truly impressed me. I am product obsessed and it seems most barely deliver on their claims.  Not this one. Fantastic hair spray. Holds well, is not sticky, doesn&#x27;t make hair hard, at the end of the day brushes out (I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day), doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell ( just when you first spray sort of then immediately fades) and most of all does an AMAZING job of fending of humidity!!</li>
            <li> Great item and great service!</li>
            <li> love, love, love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I received this hairspray as a sample once a few years ago and fell in love with it.  I have thick, wavy hair and like to keep it maintained without taking a chemical bath (unfortunately, many drugstore and salon hairsprays give me headache).  Alterna&#x27;s more natural approach to hair care is highly effective and actually works better than the popular mainstream brands.</li>
            <li> Item arrived timely. Was purchased as a gift. Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad. I can&#x27;t give an opinion of the lasting or quality feature.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended this to me as she is now using it at her salon.  I bought it as well as the Alterna Bamboo Shampoo and conditioner after my last appointment but am sorry that I did.  It sprays nicely and smells ok, but it does not hold as well as I would like it to.  I know it is flexible hold spray, but just doesn&#x27;t do it for me. I will review the shampoo and conditioner in the proper place.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this to me but at that time I could not find it locally.  I ordered it online and my husband who did not use hair spray tried it based on &amp;#34;anti-humidity&amp;#34; and liked it so much he took it away from me.  It is a good product and if you live in a high humidity area you will love it.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> This spray generally gives me decent hold, but it&#x27;s not enough to stop my curls from falling during extremely humid / rainy days. Otherwise, it&#x27;s very light and does a decent job.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Does not make your hair sticky.  Love the way it feels natural and without feeling your hair is plastered in place.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray, and won&#x27;t buy anything else since I have discovered it.  It is a must for my hair that drastically goes craz  at the first touch of humidity.  Since this is a product I use daily, I feel great knowing I am not spraying harsh, damaging chemicals on it everyday.  Your hair will look as good at the end of the day, as it did in the morning.  A little goes a long way, and it is never sticky or stiff.</li>
