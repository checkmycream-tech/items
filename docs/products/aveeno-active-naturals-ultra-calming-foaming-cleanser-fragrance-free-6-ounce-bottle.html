            <li>Amazon has a good price on this product without having to go to the store.</li>
            <li>This is another good Aveeno product.</li>
            <li>The cleanser does a really good job, unless you have a lot of makeup on.</li>
            <li>The price is good.</li>
            <li>The one downfall is that when I use it to remove my makeup, it&#x27;s not all that good at it.</li>
            <li>which is good.</li>
            <li>Wonderful cleanser and very gentle!</li>
            <li>This is not the best face wash I have ever used, but it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this cleanser!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love the foam these Aveeno cleansers make!</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the directions!</li>
            <li>and my face has reacted amazing to it.</li>
            <li>I use an antioxident cream as a serum and the combination of these two products is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing...</li>
            <li>This product is aptly named.</li>
            <li>This product is a good product...not great, but for the price, it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I told him how much I liked the product</li>
            <li>It does a great job of removing mineral makeup and leaving my skin feeling clean but not stripped.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very mild, so if scents bother you then this would be a good product to choose.</li>
            <li>This is the best face wash I have yet to use on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Best thing for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the best stuff ever for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is light, gentle and non-irritating and yet the best make-up dissolver and remover</li>
            <li>my skin feels really good, clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, I like it, and it makes my face feel clean without making it oily.</li>
            <li>Nice way to be good to your skin right before bed.</li>
            <li>It feels very light on the skin and hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all in the week that I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li>and my skin felt very smooth and calmed after i washed my face with it.</li>
            <li>very good products, and which fit my needs very well.</li>
            <li>I wish the pumping mechanism works better though.</li>
            <li>Amazon definitely has the best pricing although you have to order in a multi-pack to get the savings.  </li>
            <li>This is truly the best facial cleanser I ever used.</li>
            <li>Happens with many bottles.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t break me out and the pump seems much more sanitary than squeeze tube packaging and the like.</li>
            <li>Well I have suffered most my life with acne and have probably tried every face wash known to man.</li>
            <li>so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This one is the best for rosacea (in my opinion) especially when you consider the price.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>It is light and smells nice.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t helping it get better</li>
            <li>Put the salicylic acid products away, I&#x27;m so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I love, love this cream.</li>
            <li>love this product, I recommend it and I will keep purchase it.</li>
            <li>love it  </li>
            <li>I had to put it into another bottle with a pump top</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.</li>
            <li>and it can tolerate more</li>
            <li>I love aveeno, ceraVe, Cetaphil and Olay.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have it shipped to me every couple months with the auto ship plan and have not found a cleanser that I like better.</li>
            <li>I have many allergies, and this foam has caused no itchiness or welts.  </li>
            <li>:]&lt;br /&gt;However, this won&#x27;t get rid of your acne.</li>
            <li>Takes my makeup off and my skin feels so smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over 75 and love this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best facial wash I ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect for washing my face before bed, I have very dry skin and get acne very easy, this is a soft rub, smells great and not over powering, nice and light (relaxing).</li>
            <li>and my face feels very clean.</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free and a great sensitive skin cleanser.  </li>
            <li>As a result I try to use very mild soaps, etc.</li>
            <li>The bottle doesn&#x27;t clog up and it is easy and convenient to use even in the shower.</li>
            <li>I keep it in the shower and can easily use the pump.  </li>
            <li>and I get acne breakouts easy</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>If your skin is easily irritated, try this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Cool, refreshing and calming as described.</li>
            <li>and I thought it might be a good fit for his sensitive skin too.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li>Or perhaps I am misinterpreting the light, foamy nature as lack of cleansing strength.</li>
            <li>Also removes light makeup without greasiness.</li>
            <li>do wish they&#x27;d make it paraben free, though.</li>
            <li>When I realized this cleanser was also SLS free</li>
            <li>Great for morning or mid day face wash.</li>
            <li>I may not buy it again as its not paraben free</li>
            <li>Looking for a light, fragrance-free cleanser I purchased this product expecting just that...</li>
            <li>Just started using, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take more than one pump to wash your face, so the bottle is a good size to last for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone with any kind of skin issues.</li>
            <li>I used to have oily skin but since using this product, the oil production has reduced significantly and I no longer have break-outs or oily skin.  </li>
            <li>and I was pretty pleased with it except for the fact that I have to almost scrub my face to get it off.</li>
            <li>there is no point in a drying cleanser that doesnt clean, so i probably will not ever repurchase this.</li>
            <li>It does all I want from a cleanser- clean without stripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but still can not tell how well it clean the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>or I don&#x27;t believe it can clean my skin throughly.  </li>
            <li>and it looks clean and stable, i would like recommond it to my friends.</li>
            <li>Results after using the product was positive and I sure would recommend the product anytime.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent foaming cleanser, makes my skin tone more even (less blotchy) and soft feeling .  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any kind of negative reaction to the product and I have tried many (too many!)</li>
            <li>I use a lot of Aveeno products and love them, so I really was looking forward to this one.</li>
            <li>I use about 5 pumps if I have a full face of makeup on and it removes it like a champ.  </li>
            <li>Just a heads up for those who planed on using it a a full on makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also makes your face feel nice and soft</li>
            <li>Price is not bad also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also acne free for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous gentle cleanser!</li>
            <li>I call this product Lady Calm because after I used the product, I felt clean, calm, relaxed and felt and slept like a Lady should have  felt and slept.  </li>
            <li>When I finished washing, my cheeks were bright read, and my skin felt taut and dry.  </li>
            <li>Good for dry skin use and doesnt take away moisture from skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin and have had no issues using this for many months now.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several years now and love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and gentle.</li>
            <li>The feverfew helps to calm itchy skin as well as helping with redness.</li>
            <li>My wife uses this product to calm her skin and, hopefully, reduce her rosacea.</li>
            <li>This face wash is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Even after I moved across the globe where it wasn&#x27;t available, I have been paying extra for it to be delivered to me because I&#x27;m just so in love with it.</li>
            <li>Nice, gentle cleanser for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face wash for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Amazon, for your wide selection, competitive pricing, timely shipping, good customer support.</li>
            <li>My face is completely clear and healthy now.</li>
            <li>I love Aveda products overall, but this one is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>Leaves it feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>My face feels fresh and clean after use, not itchy or stinging or irritated like it feels after using your average face wash, and I feel more clean than after using most gentle face washes.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m impressed and would recommend it to other customers.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and always leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>this is just right.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t calm or moisturize my face, it just cleanses mildly and that&#x27;s all it really should do.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is good for babies or to wash sunburned skin, but for everyday use Cetaphil is much better, as are many other washes.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>we use several cleansers and this seems to be effective and gentle without breaking the bank.  </li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin, and to finally find a good face wash that doesnt make my face break out because of dryness is quite the discovery for me.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is that because it is a foam cleanser, I always feel like I have to use more of it to clean my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super gentle but still removes all traces of makeup, eyeliner, and mascara.  </li>
            <li>I naturally have beautiful black skin.</li>
            <li>I believe it is best for average to dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle</li>
            <li>I used it for one time like the foam very much Maybe it can be used in the morning.</li>
            <li>Its very gentle and moisturizing too.</li>
            <li>Very gentle though.</li>
            <li>I will go back to the light, clean smelling fragrance of Aveeno products after this experiment.</li>
            <li>I would have given 5 stars; however, I have used better facial washes (and moisturizers), BUT, none of them eliminated the spots on my face.  </li>
            <li>on it so as not to make it more red than it already is.  </li>
            <li>First it feels like and applies like silk.</li>
            <li>ALSO A FANTASTIC CREAM FOR ITCHY, REACTIVE SENSITIVE SKIN.  </li>
            <li>I have never stayed with the same cleanser for many reasons</li>
            <li>cant love it enough.</li>
            <li>I suddenly had eczema like symptoms on my face and the face wash / cleanser I had been using for years started agitating it even more.</li>
            <li>, so more washing usually means more breakouts.  </li>
            <li>This product felt quite lovely, but within minutes made my skin sting and turn red.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of Aveeno products over the years and this is the first one to cause me any problems.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t for the first night</li>
            <li>With this, not only is my face clean, the wash cloth rinses completely clean, too!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>This product really does foam as they claim and it leaves even sensitive skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>My face feels soft and clean after every washing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s done a great job of regulating my pores oil production since its not stripping your skin of all its natural oils, your skin doesn&#x27;t have to go crazy and overproduce more!</li>
            <li>Mild and Effective face cleanser that works equally well for gently removing my makeup and taking care of a teen boy.</li>
            <li>The bottle lasts a long time, so it is an outstanding value.  </li>
            <li>It appeared to work fine for the first 3 days but on the fourth day I woke up to breakouts on my cheeks, chin, nose, and forehead.</li>
            <li>Normally she&#x27;s okay with salicylic acid, but when we doubled the daily amount her skin had an allergic reaction!  </li>
            <li>my skin is prone to getting red and irritated easily</li>
            <li>It may not be strong enough for you if you have acne which I do.</li>
            <li>Now my skin is back to normal, combination with occasional hormonal acne and it does a good job of absorbing oil.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it since it first came out, and will continue to use it for as long as it&#x27;s available</li>
            <li>it have me so much relief.</li>
            <li>im torn on this cleanser because on the one hand it is very calming and reduces the redness in my skin (</li>
            <li>not just temporarily, it really changes my skin with continued use)</li>
            <li>Gentle but still removes the oils and dirt.</li>
            <li>my whole life.  </li>
            <li>Nothing really compares.</li>
            <li>Highly reccommend!</li>
            <li>I really hope they don&#x27;t ever discontinue this product.</li>
            <li>I was using dove soap on my face and it was really drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it ever since and it has been working very well.</li>
            <li>It washes well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but the smell is just too much for me.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I really notice a calming effect on my skin, but my face does feel refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li>My skin gets oily if I use soap that dries me out too much...</li>
            <li>but this one really works for me and by the way, it was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this face wash.</li>
            <li>The foam is thick, and you really don&#x27;t need much of it to do a good cleansing.  </li>
            <li>and i believe it either breaks me out, or doesnt clean very well at all, and i only use mineral powder makeup.</li>
            <li>No tight feeling, just soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>My skin seems to get dry really easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild enough that I can&#x27;t even tell that my sensitive skin has been cleansed - and that&#x27;s how it should be, right?</li>
            <li>Every time I use it my face feels fresh and clean and I&#x27;ve seen that my face doesn&#x27;t get as red simply because I don&#x27;t have to be overly harsh to remove it since it comes off very easily.</li>
            <li>It removes most of it, but I end up with a little concealer and eye shadow still on my face, which I don&#x27;t mind that much since I do like using a separate makeup remover for the eye area.</li>
            <li>This is a great cleanser for sensitive skin, I am on accutane, for acne, and it is difficult to find a product that doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of oils and dry it out even more.  </li>
            <li>Have to admit I have oily, older skin</li>
            <li>I bought this cleanser a while ago and only recently I started to use it more</li>
            <li>I use it daily, in the evening, and although it is only a week since I started I can confidently say this is everything it claims to be.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is very gentle but leaves my face feeling incredibly clean, but not tight and dry.</li>
            <li>The Aveeno is soothing, calming, doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes when removing the mascara, and I love that it has no fragrance.</li>
            <li>It cleanses my face, but as its not soap free, it makes my face very dry.</li>
            <li>I like to use this before my other acne medication to clean my face and let my other stuff be more effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All you have to do is wet your face before hand and pat it dry afterwards, just make sure you do that!</li>
            <li>I decided to try this because I was trying way too many harsh products, and this was among one of a million face washes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love the foaming dispenser which saves a few seconds not having to work up a lather.  </li>
            <li>I need intense moisture and sometimes use a prescription cream to calm my dry flares.</li>
            <li>I will b right back to self.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and really require something lightweight yet something that takes care of dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My friend suggested that I look around for new products.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry like other cleansers which is nice</li>
            <li>I will start off my review by noting that I have very sensitive, yet oily and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and eczema.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive combination skin and thought I would try it out since I was given a coupon.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, acne and rosacea-prone skin and try to use all sensitive-skin products.</li>
            <li>Found this, it was delivered as expected, packaged well, and calmed her skin right away!  </li>
            <li>At first, this worked fine - seemed gentle enough, no scent, cleaned my face as expected, until it made me break out in tiny bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My sensitive face loves this stuff!</li>
            <li>Bought this item for my wife to try, her face gets dry easily, mine is the opposite.</li>
            <li>I looked at other reviews and its not perfect for all I guess, but its great when you find the product that&#x27;s just right for you...</li>
            <li>Any time I tried something new, I&#x27;d always come straight back to it.</li>
            <li>but when I take it off my skin is more dry and rough to touch.</li>
            <li>A little more daily treatment and moisturizing</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years and while I have not found it to calm my skin as advertised it has not irritated my skin or left it redder than before.  </li>
            <li>Of all the acne products out there, this is the only cleanser ironically just a gentle cleanser, that fights acne</li>
            <li>however i find this can be very drying (especially to my bf</li>
            <li>for sensitive skin, etc.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin then this is your bag.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heaven for people with sensitive, acne-prone, or oily/combo skin, or if you have all 3 like me.</li>
            <li>After going to see the dermatologist she recommended trying one of aveenos natural products that did not have any salycic acid or benzoyl peroxide in it.</li>
            <li>and my acne has done a complete turn around.</li>
            <li>It really works and not make red skin just help to you take off the oil and make up...</li>
            <li>I do not recommend for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product makes the skin soft, not cause break out</li>
            <li>I recently used a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; brand of face wash that caused a horrid rash all over my face/neck, and I absolutely regret it.</li>
            <li>I would recommended this face wash to any person with sensitive skin who does not want to spend a lot.</li>
            <li>its not harmful, and soft to skin.</li>
            <li>Aveeno is one of the brands that have surprised me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month only on my forehead because I don&#x27;t really break out there</li>
            <li>Overall, though, I think this product works very well for my skin.</li>
            <li>Also its sensitive</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and ever since my dermatologist gave me a sample of this Aveeno cleanser, I have never used another.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the cleansing wipe version of this product quite often with no problems, so I was surprised to have a reaction to this cleanser.</li>
            <li>The itching and burning disappeared completely at once and the rash was almost gone by that evening.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a product that works without leaving any residue in your skin.</li>
            <li>Really the only think that keeps the redness from my face.</li>
            <li>I purchased this thinking it would be extra gentle during a rosecea flair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old fashioned in that</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin on my face</li>
            <li>For aging and sensitive skin... you must buy this one.</li>
            <li>After years of using acne washes and finally seeing a dermatologist, I&#x27;ve found that this product is the only wash that keeps my skin fresh and soothed.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin in the first place</li>
            <li>I have used many different types of cleansers and this seems to be less irritating than most.</li>
            <li>When you find a product that makes your face feel really clean without feeling all dried out, you&#x27;ve got a winner.  </li>
            <li>I have suggested it to friends both older and much younger than I, and they have been WOWed by the product, too.  </li>
            <li>so we bought a new facial wash and acne pads, not realizing that they both had salicylic acid in them.  </li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;re worried that since it&#x27;s so gentle it won&#x27;t be able to wash off your makeup, well you&#x27;re SO wrong</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and bought this after a brief bout with eczema on my face and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for faces that are sensitive, acne prone, dry, or even oily.  </li>
            <li>I have seen a major improvements.</li>
            <li>I searched long and hard for a good cleaner that felt like it cleaned, but also helped my red and dry skin, which was also prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li>It was so gentle and my eczema didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>For me at least there is no WOW factor, but some notable difference.</li>
            <li>The burt&#x27;s bee sensitive facial cleanser is sticky.</li>
            <li>As my title implies, there are no bells and whistles to this cleanser, and apparently that&#x27;s all my skin needs.</li>
            <li>This is now the only cleaser I use for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Aveeno just tends to be kind of expensive.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone that has struggled with patches of oily skin with dry and even flaking areas.</li>
            <li>I read the ingredients and found glycerin to be listed second after water, meaning in this product the concentration of glycerin is higher than concentration of any other chemical.  </li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive and dry in the winter and everything makes it feel tight, itchy and gross.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I need a sensitive skin cleanser, but this doesn&#x27;t remove makeup and practically dissolves so much with a little water that it&#x27;s not there at all.  </li>
            <li>I am mid 40s and have roseca and very sensitive skin, other products have alwats dried my skin or either just didnt get it clean.</li>
            <li>so i wondered if it even worked the first few times.</li>
            <li>Using this face wash does make me feel like my face is clean, but it doesn&#x27;t help prevent any problems so far like some other ones have done in the past.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely dry and extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>So after using this facewash for a few days, my skin was much less dry and felt a lot better.</li>
            <li>For years I used Olay Foaming Cleanser for Sensitive Skin, it was starting to dry my face out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product a lot less expensive than what my dermatologist has recommended.  </li>
            <li>It is the only facial cleanser I use, and it seems to minimize breakouts and does not dry the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have tried other soaps</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The cleanser does a really good job, unless you have a lot of makeup on.</li>
            <li> The price is good.</li>
            <li> The one downfall is that when I use it to remove my makeup, it&#x27;s not all that good at it.</li>
            <li> which is good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful cleanser and very gentle!</li>
            <li> This is not the best face wash I have ever used, but it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this cleanser!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and I love the foam these Aveeno cleansers make!</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the directions!</li>
            <li> and my face has reacted amazing to it.</li>
            <li> I use an antioxident cream as a serum and the combination of these two products is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing...</li>
            <li> This product is aptly named.</li>
            <li> This product is a good product...not great, but for the price, it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I told him how much I liked the product</li>
            <li> It does a great job of removing mineral makeup and leaving my skin feeling clean but not stripped.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very mild, so if scents bother you then this would be a good product to choose.</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash I have yet to use on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Best thing for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is light, gentle and non-irritating and yet the best make-up dissolver and remover</li>
            <li> my skin feels really good, clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, I like it, and it makes my face feel clean without making it oily.</li>
            <li> Nice way to be good to your skin right before bed.</li>
            <li> It feels very light on the skin and hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all in the week that I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li> and my skin felt very smooth and calmed after i washed my face with it.</li>
            <li> very good products, and which fit my needs very well.</li>
            <li> I wish the pumping mechanism works better though.</li>
            <li> Amazon definitely has the best pricing although you have to order in a multi-pack to get the savings.  </li>
            <li> This is truly the best facial cleanser I ever used.</li>
            <li> Happens with many bottles.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t break me out and the pump seems much more sanitary than squeeze tube packaging and the like.</li>
            <li> Well I have suffered most my life with acne and have probably tried every face wash known to man.</li>
            <li> so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This one is the best for rosacea (in my opinion) especially when you consider the price.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> It is light and smells nice.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t helping it get better</li>
            <li> Put the salicylic acid products away, I&#x27;m so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I love, love this cream.</li>
            <li> love this product, I recommend it and I will keep purchase it.</li>
            <li> love it  </li>
            <li> I had to put it into another bottle with a pump top</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.</li>
            <li> and it can tolerate more</li>
            <li> I love aveeno, ceraVe, Cetaphil and Olay.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have it shipped to me every couple months with the auto ship plan and have not found a cleanser that I like better.</li>
            <li> I have many allergies, and this foam has caused no itchiness or welts.  </li>
            <li> :]&lt;br /&gt;However, this won&#x27;t get rid of your acne.</li>
            <li> Takes my makeup off and my skin feels so smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 75 and love this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best facial wash I ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is perfect for washing my face before bed, I have very dry skin and get acne very easy, this is a soft rub, smells great and not over powering, nice and light (relaxing).</li>
            <li> and my face feels very clean.</li>
            <li> It is fragrance free and a great sensitive skin cleanser.  </li>
            <li> As a result I try to use very mild soaps, etc.</li>
            <li> The bottle doesn&#x27;t clog up and it is easy and convenient to use even in the shower.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the shower and can easily use the pump.  </li>
            <li> and I get acne breakouts easy</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> If your skin is easily irritated, try this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Cool, refreshing and calming as described.</li>
            <li> and I thought it might be a good fit for his sensitive skin too.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li> Or perhaps I am misinterpreting the light, foamy nature as lack of cleansing strength.</li>
            <li> Also removes light makeup without greasiness.</li>
            <li> do wish they&#x27;d make it paraben free, though.</li>
            <li> When I realized this cleanser was also SLS free</li>
            <li> Great for morning or mid day face wash.</li>
            <li> I may not buy it again as its not paraben free</li>
            <li> Looking for a light, fragrance-free cleanser I purchased this product expecting just that...</li>
            <li> Just started using, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take more than one pump to wash your face, so the bottle is a good size to last for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone with any kind of skin issues.</li>
            <li> I used to have oily skin but since using this product, the oil production has reduced significantly and I no longer have break-outs or oily skin.  </li>
            <li> and I was pretty pleased with it except for the fact that I have to almost scrub my face to get it off.</li>
            <li> there is no point in a drying cleanser that doesnt clean, so i probably will not ever repurchase this.</li>
            <li> It does all I want from a cleanser- clean without stripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but still can not tell how well it clean the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> or I don&#x27;t believe it can clean my skin throughly.  </li>
            <li> and it looks clean and stable, i would like recommond it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Results after using the product was positive and I sure would recommend the product anytime.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent foaming cleanser, makes my skin tone more even (less blotchy) and soft feeling .  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any kind of negative reaction to the product and I have tried many (too many!)</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Aveeno products and love them, so I really was looking forward to this one.</li>
            <li> I use about 5 pumps if I have a full face of makeup on and it removes it like a champ.  </li>
            <li> Just a heads up for those who planed on using it a a full on makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also makes your face feel nice and soft</li>
            <li> Price is not bad also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also acne free for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous gentle cleanser!</li>
            <li> I call this product Lady Calm because after I used the product, I felt clean, calm, relaxed and felt and slept like a Lady should have  felt and slept.  </li>
            <li> When I finished washing, my cheeks were bright read, and my skin felt taut and dry.  </li>
            <li> Good for dry skin use and doesnt take away moisture from skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin and have had no issues using this for many months now.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several years now and love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light and gentle.</li>
            <li> The feverfew helps to calm itchy skin as well as helping with redness.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product to calm her skin and, hopefully, reduce her rosacea.</li>
            <li> This face wash is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Even after I moved across the globe where it wasn&#x27;t available, I have been paying extra for it to be delivered to me because I&#x27;m just so in love with it.</li>
            <li> Nice, gentle cleanser for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Amazon, for your wide selection, competitive pricing, timely shipping, good customer support.</li>
            <li> My face is completely clear and healthy now.</li>
            <li> I love Aveda products overall, but this one is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li> Leaves it feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> My face feels fresh and clean after use, not itchy or stinging or irritated like it feels after using your average face wash, and I feel more clean than after using most gentle face washes.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m impressed and would recommend it to other customers.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and always leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> this is just right.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t calm or moisturize my face, it just cleanses mildly and that&#x27;s all it really should do.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is good for babies or to wash sunburned skin, but for everyday use Cetaphil is much better, as are many other washes.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> we use several cleansers and this seems to be effective and gentle without breaking the bank.  </li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin, and to finally find a good face wash that doesnt make my face break out because of dryness is quite the discovery for me.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is that because it is a foam cleanser, I always feel like I have to use more of it to clean my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super gentle but still removes all traces of makeup, eyeliner, and mascara.  </li>
            <li> I naturally have beautiful black skin.</li>
            <li> I believe it is best for average to dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle</li>
            <li> I used it for one time like the foam very much Maybe it can be used in the morning.</li>
            <li> Its very gentle and moisturizing too.</li>
            <li> Very gentle though.</li>
            <li> I will go back to the light, clean smelling fragrance of Aveeno products after this experiment.</li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars; however, I have used better facial washes (and moisturizers), BUT, none of them eliminated the spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> on it so as not to make it more red than it already is.  </li>
            <li> First it feels like and applies like silk.</li>
            <li> ALSO A FANTASTIC CREAM FOR ITCHY, REACTIVE SENSITIVE SKIN.  </li>
            <li> I have never stayed with the same cleanser for many reasons</li>
            <li> cant love it enough.</li>
            <li> I suddenly had eczema like symptoms on my face and the face wash / cleanser I had been using for years started agitating it even more.</li>
            <li> , so more washing usually means more breakouts.  </li>
            <li> This product felt quite lovely, but within minutes made my skin sting and turn red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of Aveeno products over the years and this is the first one to cause me any problems.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t for the first night</li>
            <li> With this, not only is my face clean, the wash cloth rinses completely clean, too!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> This product really does foam as they claim and it leaves even sensitive skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft and clean after every washing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s done a great job of regulating my pores oil production since its not stripping your skin of all its natural oils, your skin doesn&#x27;t have to go crazy and overproduce more!</li>
            <li> Mild and Effective face cleanser that works equally well for gently removing my makeup and taking care of a teen boy.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time, so it is an outstanding value.  </li>
            <li> It appeared to work fine for the first 3 days but on the fourth day I woke up to breakouts on my cheeks, chin, nose, and forehead.</li>
            <li> Normally she&#x27;s okay with salicylic acid, but when we doubled the daily amount her skin had an allergic reaction!  </li>
            <li> my skin is prone to getting red and irritated easily</li>
            <li> It may not be strong enough for you if you have acne which I do.</li>
            <li> Now my skin is back to normal, combination with occasional hormonal acne and it does a good job of absorbing oil.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since it first came out, and will continue to use it for as long as it&#x27;s available</li>
            <li> it have me so much relief.</li>
            <li> im torn on this cleanser because on the one hand it is very calming and reduces the redness in my skin (</li>
            <li> not just temporarily, it really changes my skin with continued use)</li>
            <li> Gentle but still removes the oils and dirt.</li>
            <li> my whole life.  </li>
            <li> Nothing really compares.</li>
            <li> Highly reccommend!</li>
            <li> I really hope they don&#x27;t ever discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> I was using dove soap on my face and it was really drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it ever since and it has been working very well.</li>
            <li> It washes well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but the smell is just too much for me.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I really notice a calming effect on my skin, but my face does feel refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li> My skin gets oily if I use soap that dries me out too much...</li>
            <li> but this one really works for me and by the way, it was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash.</li>
            <li> The foam is thick, and you really don&#x27;t need much of it to do a good cleansing.  </li>
            <li> and i believe it either breaks me out, or doesnt clean very well at all, and i only use mineral powder makeup.</li>
            <li> No tight feeling, just soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> My skin seems to get dry really easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild enough that I can&#x27;t even tell that my sensitive skin has been cleansed - and that&#x27;s how it should be, right?</li>
            <li> Every time I use it my face feels fresh and clean and I&#x27;ve seen that my face doesn&#x27;t get as red simply because I don&#x27;t have to be overly harsh to remove it since it comes off very easily.</li>
            <li> It removes most of it, but I end up with a little concealer and eye shadow still on my face, which I don&#x27;t mind that much since I do like using a separate makeup remover for the eye area.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser for sensitive skin, I am on accutane, for acne, and it is difficult to find a product that doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of oils and dry it out even more.  </li>
            <li> Have to admit I have oily, older skin</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser a while ago and only recently I started to use it more</li>
            <li> I use it daily, in the evening, and although it is only a week since I started I can confidently say this is everything it claims to be.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is very gentle but leaves my face feeling incredibly clean, but not tight and dry.</li>
            <li> The Aveeno is soothing, calming, doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes when removing the mascara, and I love that it has no fragrance.</li>
            <li> It cleanses my face, but as its not soap free, it makes my face very dry.</li>
            <li> I like to use this before my other acne medication to clean my face and let my other stuff be more effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All you have to do is wet your face before hand and pat it dry afterwards, just make sure you do that!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this because I was trying way too many harsh products, and this was among one of a million face washes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love the foaming dispenser which saves a few seconds not having to work up a lather.  </li>
            <li> I need intense moisture and sometimes use a prescription cream to calm my dry flares.</li>
            <li> I will b right back to self.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and really require something lightweight yet something that takes care of dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My friend suggested that I look around for new products.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry like other cleansers which is nice</li>
            <li> I will start off my review by noting that I have very sensitive, yet oily and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and eczema.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combination skin and thought I would try it out since I was given a coupon.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne and rosacea-prone skin and try to use all sensitive-skin products.</li>
            <li> Found this, it was delivered as expected, packaged well, and calmed her skin right away!  </li>
            <li> At first, this worked fine - seemed gentle enough, no scent, cleaned my face as expected, until it made me break out in tiny bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My sensitive face loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my wife to try, her face gets dry easily, mine is the opposite.</li>
            <li> I looked at other reviews and its not perfect for all I guess, but its great when you find the product that&#x27;s just right for you...</li>
            <li> Any time I tried something new, I&#x27;d always come straight back to it.</li>
            <li> but when I take it off my skin is more dry and rough to touch.</li>
            <li> A little more daily treatment and moisturizing</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and while I have not found it to calm my skin as advertised it has not irritated my skin or left it redder than before.  </li>
            <li> Of all the acne products out there, this is the only cleanser ironically just a gentle cleanser, that fights acne</li>
            <li> however i find this can be very drying (especially to my bf</li>
            <li> for sensitive skin, etc.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin then this is your bag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heaven for people with sensitive, acne-prone, or oily/combo skin, or if you have all 3 like me.</li>
            <li> After going to see the dermatologist she recommended trying one of aveenos natural products that did not have any salycic acid or benzoyl peroxide in it.</li>
            <li> and my acne has done a complete turn around.</li>
            <li> It really works and not make red skin just help to you take off the oil and make up...</li>
            <li> I do not recommend for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product makes the skin soft, not cause break out</li>
            <li> I recently used a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; brand of face wash that caused a horrid rash all over my face/neck, and I absolutely regret it.</li>
            <li> I would recommended this face wash to any person with sensitive skin who does not want to spend a lot.</li>
            <li> its not harmful, and soft to skin.</li>
            <li> Aveeno is one of the brands that have surprised me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month only on my forehead because I don&#x27;t really break out there</li>
            <li> Overall, though, I think this product works very well for my skin.</li>
            <li> Also its sensitive</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and ever since my dermatologist gave me a sample of this Aveeno cleanser, I have never used another.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the cleansing wipe version of this product quite often with no problems, so I was surprised to have a reaction to this cleanser.</li>
            <li> The itching and burning disappeared completely at once and the rash was almost gone by that evening.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a product that works without leaving any residue in your skin.</li>
            <li> Really the only think that keeps the redness from my face.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking it would be extra gentle during a rosecea flair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old fashioned in that</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin on my face</li>
            <li> For aging and sensitive skin... you must buy this one.</li>
            <li> After years of using acne washes and finally seeing a dermatologist, I&#x27;ve found that this product is the only wash that keeps my skin fresh and soothed.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin in the first place</li>
            <li> I have used many different types of cleansers and this seems to be less irritating than most.</li>
            <li> When you find a product that makes your face feel really clean without feeling all dried out, you&#x27;ve got a winner.  </li>
            <li> I have suggested it to friends both older and much younger than I, and they have been WOWed by the product, too.  </li>
            <li> so we bought a new facial wash and acne pads, not realizing that they both had salicylic acid in them.  </li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re worried that since it&#x27;s so gentle it won&#x27;t be able to wash off your makeup, well you&#x27;re SO wrong</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and bought this after a brief bout with eczema on my face and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for faces that are sensitive, acne prone, dry, or even oily.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a major improvements.</li>
            <li> I searched long and hard for a good cleaner that felt like it cleaned, but also helped my red and dry skin, which was also prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It was so gentle and my eczema didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> For me at least there is no WOW factor, but some notable difference.</li>
            <li> The burt&#x27;s bee sensitive facial cleanser is sticky.</li>
            <li> As my title implies, there are no bells and whistles to this cleanser, and apparently that&#x27;s all my skin needs.</li>
            <li> This is now the only cleaser I use for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Aveeno just tends to be kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone that has struggled with patches of oily skin with dry and even flaking areas.</li>
            <li> I read the ingredients and found glycerin to be listed second after water, meaning in this product the concentration of glycerin is higher than concentration of any other chemical.  </li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive and dry in the winter and everything makes it feel tight, itchy and gross.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I need a sensitive skin cleanser, but this doesn&#x27;t remove makeup and practically dissolves so much with a little water that it&#x27;s not there at all.  </li>
            <li> I am mid 40s and have roseca and very sensitive skin, other products have alwats dried my skin or either just didnt get it clean.</li>
            <li> so i wondered if it even worked the first few times.</li>
            <li> Using this face wash does make me feel like my face is clean, but it doesn&#x27;t help prevent any problems so far like some other ones have done in the past.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry and extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> So after using this facewash for a few days, my skin was much less dry and felt a lot better.</li>
            <li> For years I used Olay Foaming Cleanser for Sensitive Skin, it was starting to dry my face out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product a lot less expensive than what my dermatologist has recommended.  </li>
            <li> It is the only facial cleanser I use, and it seems to minimize breakouts and does not dry the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have tried other soaps</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product that my sensitive skin can use, and it really helps sooth and soften my skin when it is irritated from other harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Dry patches barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I tried several other brands meant for sensitive, eczema prone skin, everything would worsen it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products and the gets my skin the cleanest without irritating it.  </li>
            <li> I barely rub it on and my makeup is completely gone in a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Having roseate, sensitive skin and being slightly oily has made if difficult to find an appropriate cleanser.  </li>
            <li> My face constantly gets deep dry patches all over and even becomes flaky,.</li>
            <li> My face is naturally redder than average or \\&quot;ruddy</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time; it only takes one or maybe two pumps to wash my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; but has a strange chemical smell to it that reminds me of the Clearasil wash from my teenage years.</li>
            <li> Over the last five years I have struggled with oily, yet dry patchy skin.  </li>
            <li> We were seeking a Foaming Cleanser to replace a previous product from another source, and we tried this one and we like it so far, with no adverse complaints as yet.</li>
            <li> other products that dried my skin out too much-</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser because it is gentle, cleans well, and does not leave a residue on my eyebrows that makes it hard to apply eyebrow pencil afterwards.</li>
            <li> In the last few months I&#x27;ve had a major eczema flare-up on my face.</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno cleansers, but this one, even though it probably did what it is supposed to do, stinks.</li>
            <li> Loaded with parabens, Not Natural at all.</li>
            <li> Every time I press down on the pump, I have to lift it back up since it does not pop back up by itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a few other reviews, both here and on the Aveeno site, from people who had reactions to this particular product as well.</li>
            <li> The only minor downside is that about half way through, the pump gets stuck, but its not a big deal, I manage.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that left my skin feeling oily b/c</li>
            <li> I never get acne or breakouts, just dry bcuz I suffer from eczema.</li>
            <li> but it makes her face too dry.</li>
            <li> This ultra calming Aveeno doesn&#x27;t dry out her skin.</li>
            <li> had rosacea spots for years that would dry out and itch &amp; nothing worked to get rid of them until I tried these two products.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry, itchy eczema prone skin try Aveeno Ultra Calming moisturizer for daytime with spf.</li>
            <li> It cleans my skin and doesnt dry my face out.</li>
            <li> But this Aveeno doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my face or dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I wasted a lot of money on more expensive products that never worked.  </li>
            <li> The pumps always seem to stop popping back up after I press them down once I am about halfway through the bottle, but it&#x27;s just a minor inconvenience to have to press the pump twice to get product out.</li>
            <li> The film was hard to wash off (i usually do not use a sponge when I wash my face).</li>
            <li> LEAVE MY FACE VERY DRY</li>
            <li> Because of this odd combination, it is difficult for me to find compatable skin care products which do a good job of cleaning without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin, and other cleansers usually leave me oily in my T-zone and flaky on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I think of fragrance-free as not smelling much like anything, however this one smelled like old dirty T-shirts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different types of facial soap and my skin always looks worse after my shower than before.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s &amp;#34;authentic.&amp;#34;  Seems to irritate skin a little, while previous drugstore purchases were gentle.</li>
            <li> so when it comes down to washing my face, its essential to not to irritate the little s***s.</li>
            <li> My skin never feels tight dry or irritated after using it.</li>
            <li> I brought this after I used an expensive medicated cleanser that made it worste, one shot first time</li>
            <li> I will probably be a lifelong user!</li>
            <li> Stoped using the product due to this issue.</li>
            <li> With any other cleanser I&#x27;ve used, after wiping my face with the washcloth the washcloth was stained with the makeup.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying from other sellers from now on.</li>
            <li> So I started looking around for what other people with eczema were using.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps other people that have eczema like I do, but who don&#x27;t know what to do about it</li>
            <li> other cleansers.</li>
            <li> I mean my face was dry while using it, but it did not do the facial freeze that other brands create.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it seems to have balanced out my skin so that I&#x27;m both less oily and less dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a year now and in addition to my skin being less red, less tight, it is also less prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Aveeno products never let you down.</li>
            <li> This cleans well, however about half way through the bottle the pump stops working.  </li>
            <li> Although my acne persist, it is less inflamed...</li>
            <li> doesnt feel tight and stretchy after use</li>
            <li> that was extremely dry, itchy, burning and thick.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is the only thing that I have changed and have discontinued the use of it.mits not rated on high on beautypedia either : (</li>
            <li> At night, I just use a heavy moisturizing cream, and that seems to work okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> It will destroy your makeup, even your mascara.</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m getting breaks outsm ( it&#x27;s just not smooth).</li>
            <li> I unfortunately have oily skin which I have to wash frequently.  </li>
            <li> Not residue is left behind that must be removed by a toner.  </li>
            <li> There was no top on the container.</li>

            <li> My skin is extremely dry and extremely sensitive. My face constantly gets deep dry patches all over and even becomes flaky,. I need intense moisture and sometimes use a prescription cream to calm my dry flares. Wearing makeup covers me up but when I take it off my skin is more dry and rough to touch. I naturally have beautiful black skin. I never get acne or breakouts, just dry bcuz I suffer from eczema. I brought this after I used an expensive medicated cleanser that made it worste, one shot first time it have me so much relief. I was almost amazed. Dry patches barely noticeable. A little more daily treatment and moisturizing I will b right back to self.</li>
            <li> I like Aveeno products and this is no exception.  It&#x27;s a good product a lot less expensive than what my dermatologist has recommended.  The moisturizer is good, too!</li>
            <li> Of all the acne products out there, this is the only cleanser ironically just a gentle cleanser, that fights acne the best.&lt;br /&gt;I used to break out all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when I&#x27;m showering, I apply this cleanser and leave it on while I wash my body for about 5-10 minutes. It&#x27;s very gentle so you can leave it on for quite a while before you wash it off. This prolonged application of the cleanser will allow the Feverfew (a calming botanical) to penetrate your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow these directions and watch that stubborn acne disappear!</li>
            <li> im torn on this cleanser because on the one hand it is very calming and reduces the redness in my skin (not just temporarily, it really changes my skin with continued use) however i find this can be very drying (especially to my bf it made his skin peel terribly with a few uses) and i believe it either breaks me out, or doesnt clean very well at all, and i only use mineral powder makeup. there is no point in a drying cleanser that doesnt clean, so i probably will not ever repurchase this. maybe if i didnt have such an acne issue and only had redness issues.</li>
            <li> Have to admit I have oily, older skin (hey, it&#x27;s in good shape).  Sometimes I need a sensitive skin cleanser, but this doesn&#x27;t remove makeup and practically dissolves so much with a little water that it&#x27;s not there at all.  I use it as a body wash.  Maybe this is good for babies or to wash sunburned skin, but for everyday use Cetaphil is much better, as are many other washes.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my wife to try, her face gets dry easily, mine is the opposite. I use the regular Aveeno cleanser but it makes her face too dry. This ultra calming Aveeno doesn&#x27;t dry out her skin. I can use it too, but I need to wash 2x to get the same feeling as the regular Aveeno foaming wash.</li>
            <li> Good face wash. Gentle but still removes the oils and dirt. I wish the pumping mechanism works better though. Every time I press down on the pump, I have to lift it back up since it does not pop back up by itself.</li>
            <li> I started using this in conjunction with the Aveeno extra calming moisturizer in an effort to battle the rosacea around my nose and mouth, and IT WORKED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d had rosacea spots for years that would dry out and itch &amp; nothing worked to get rid of them until I tried these two products.  I would have given 5 stars; however, I have used better facial washes (and moisturizers), BUT, none of them eliminated the spots on my face.  At night, I just use a heavy moisturizing cream, and that seems to work okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not saying this will work for everyone, but this worked like a charm for me!</li>
            <li> we use several cleansers and this seems to be effective and gentle without breaking the bank.  Amazon definitely has the best pricing although you have to order in a multi-pack to get the savings.  It doesn&#x27;t dry like other cleansers which is nice and it also doesn&#x27;t hvae a stong smell.  Would like to have a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> I searched long and hard for a good cleaner that felt like it cleaned, but also helped my red and dry skin, which was also prone to breakouts.  I wasted a lot of money on more expensive products that never worked.  I have been using this for a year now and in addition to my skin being less red, less tight, it is also less prone to breakouts.  I stopped looking and am now a dedicated user of only this cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best facial cleanser I ever used. I have very sensitive skin and bought this after a brief bout with eczema on my face and around my eyes. It was so gentle and my eczema didn&#x27;t last long. Now my skin is back to normal, combination with occasional hormonal acne and it does a good job of absorbing oil.   It is miraculous when it comes to makeup removal... I barely rub it on and my makeup is completely gone in a few seconds. (And some days I wear a LOT of mascara and eye makeup!) The only minor downside is that about half way through, the pump gets stuck, but its not a big deal, I manage.   I looked at other reviews and its not perfect for all I guess, but its great when you find the product that&#x27;s just right for you... and this one is for me. I will probably be a lifelong user!</li>
            <li> Cool, refreshing and calming as described.</li>
            <li> This product is aptly named. My daughter had a bad flair-up of acne so we bought a new facial wash and acne pads, not realizing that they both had salicylic acid in them.  Normally she&#x27;s okay with salicylic acid, but when we doubled the daily amount her skin had an allergic reaction!  Omg, her poor face (and feelings!).  So I searched for a product with no medications, fragrance, etc. for sensitive skin, etc.  It was no easy task!  Found this, it was delivered as expected, packaged well, and calmed her skin right away!  She was so relieved and happy and so was I!  We both learned a lesson--to read every label every time!</li>
            <li> Great product! After using this I switch to burt&#x27;s bee as my frd said it&#x27;s good. No way, can&#x27;t compare. The burt&#x27;s bee sensitive facial cleanser is sticky. Will definitely go back to this item.</li>
            <li> My face is naturally redder than average or \\&quot;ruddy complexion\\&quot; as I like to say.  As a result I try to use very mild soaps, etc. on it so as not to make it more red than it already is.  This soap is very good.  No sent and good ingredients.  I wash my face twice with it and my skin feels very happy.  If you have sensitive skin then this is your bag.</li>
            <li> Pump keeps breaking.  Happens with many bottles.  Posted video at Aveeno Facebook page and they just deleted it. Tried again, they deleted again.  Video is here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;slvzlDAeB1s</li>
            <li> The only cleanser that I could use with tazorac that did not overdry my face....I mean my face was dry while using it, but it did not do the facial freeze that other brands create. It doesn&#x27;t calm or moisturize my face, it just cleanses mildly and that&#x27;s all it really should do.</li>
            <li> Made my face incredibly oily, don&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea and this does help. I have acne with my Rosacea and this doesn&#x27;t help but it does not cause acne either.</li>
            <li> I will start off my review by noting that I have very sensitive, yet oily and acne-prone skin. Because of this odd combination, it is difficult for me to find compatable skin care products which do a good job of cleaning without irritating my skin. When do I find an item that works with my skin, I stick with it because my skin is hard to shop for!  That said, I have been using this product for years. My face feels fresh and clean after use, not itchy or stinging or irritated like it feels after using your average face wash, and I feel more clean than after using most gentle face washes. It also doesn&#x27;t break me out and the pump seems much more sanitary than squeeze tube packaging and the like. The pumps always seem to stop popping back up after I press them down once I am about halfway through the bottle, but it&#x27;s just a minor inconvenience to have to press the pump twice to get product out. This face wash is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser in the shower every night to remove makeup.  I&#x27;ve been ordering and re-ordering this because it&#x27;s so great.  It&#x27;s mild enough that I can&#x27;t even tell that my sensitive skin has been cleansed - and that&#x27;s how it should be, right? Every now and then I think of deviating from this product, but I keep coming back because I know it works for my skin.</li>
            <li> There was no top on the container.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle. I started using this about 2 years ago, when I began to get severe acne. I decided to try this because I was trying way too many harsh products, and this was among one of a million face washes I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s so light and gentle. It&#x27;s heaven for people with sensitive, acne-prone, or oily/combo skin, or if you have all 3 like me. And if you&#x27;re worried that since it&#x27;s so gentle it won&#x27;t be able to wash off your makeup, well you&#x27;re SO wrong oh my goodness. It will destroy your makeup, even your mascara. Even after I moved across the globe where it wasn&#x27;t available, I have been paying extra for it to be delivered to me because I&#x27;m just so in love with it. Plus, one bottle used once a day can last me 6 months.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to aggravate my rosacea and that is a plus.</li>
            <li> Well I have suffered most my life with acne and have probably tried every face wash known to man.The last product I tried from another well known company made me have a severe reaction where I broke out in a horrible itchy rash all over my face. After going to see the dermatologist she recommended trying one of aveenos natural products that did not have any salycic acid or benzoyl peroxide in it.Well I decided to try this one and im so glad I did. It is the perfect face wash!! Its not over moisterizing and not over drying and my face has reacted amazing to it. I have been using this for over 6 months now  and my acne has done a complete turn around. I still get occasional pimples but nothing like before. I highly recommend to anyone with any kind of skin issues. I hope they never stop making this because I dont know what I would do!!</li>
            <li> Just started using, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Aveeno cleanser my whole life.  Best thing for sensitive skin.  It was unfortunately expensive on Amazon, however.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> For delicated skin it is a good product ..... It really works and not make red skin just help to you take off the oil and make up... I use every day in the mornings and before go to the bed</li>
            <li> If you have rosacea, this is a must use product... I have literally tried it all, including VERY expensive face washes.  This one is the best for rosacea (in my opinion) especially when you consider the price.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice, gentle cleanser for my sensitive skin.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s too expensive for me to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Pump fails on every bottle I have bought.  Don&#x27;t know how they can so consistently provide pumps that will fail!!!  Stoped using the product due to this issue.</li>
            <li> Very good foaming cleanser.  I enjoy using it.  I believe it is best for average to dry skin.  Or perhaps I am misinterpreting the light, foamy nature as lack of cleansing strength.</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser because it is gentle, cleans well, and does not leave a residue on my eyebrows that makes it hard to apply eyebrow pencil afterwards. Aveeno just tends to be kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  I LOVE this cleanser!  It is light, gentle and non-irritating and yet the best make-up dissolver and remover I&#x27;ve every used.  With any other cleanser I&#x27;ve used, after wiping my face with the washcloth the washcloth was stained with the makeup.  With this, not only is my face clean, the wash cloth rinses completely clean, too!&lt;br /&gt;And my skin feels really good, clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Great Seller!</li>
            <li> This is my holy grail of facial cleansers. I have sensitive combination skin, and other cleansers usually leave me oily in my T-zone and flaky on my cheeks. This cleanser is very gentle but leaves my face feeling incredibly clean, but not tight and dry. Additionally, it seems to have balanced out my skin so that I&#x27;m both less oily and less dry. I&#x27;m on my 5th bottle of this cleanser and my skin is very happy. I use it twice daily, 2 pumps per use, and a bottle lasts me about 3 months. Amazon has a good price on this product without having to go to the store.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser. It foams very nicely with just a pump or two and cleans without drying out my face. Also removes light makeup without greasiness.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent foaming cleanser, makes my skin tone more even (less blotchy) and soft feeling .  I have purchased it several times and can recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is a good product...not great, but for the price, it is well worth it.  It does what it says it will do and that is all I can ask.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for washing my face before bed, I have very dry skin and get acne very easy, this is a soft rub, smells great and not over powering, nice and light (relaxing).</li>
            <li> At first, this worked fine - seemed gentle enough, no scent, cleaned my face as expected, until it made me break out in tiny bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a related note, please note that the seller, Pharmapacks, only accepts unopened returns. I did tell them about the allergy but they would not make an exception. I will be buying from other sellers from now on.</li>
            <li> Have you people that gave this 5 stars looked at the ingredients. Loaded with parabens, Not Natural at all. Bad stuff.</li>
            <li> This is another good Aveeno product. It is light and smells nice. The cleanser does a really good job, unless you have a lot of makeup on. If you tend to wear a lot of makeup, you&#x27;ll need to use this cleanser 2-3 times for everything to come off.</li>
            <li> The product has soothing effects on my face after each wash.  It cleanses my face thoroughly too.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and eczema. I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years. In the last few months I&#x27;ve had a major eczema flare-up on my face. I thought that this product was keeping it from being worse. It wasn&#x27;t helping it get better and now I know why! My friend suggested that I look around for new products. So I started looking around for what other people with eczema were using. I found some information which stopped me from using this product immediately. It said that there were skin irritants in the formula and even a carcinogen! That information made me really angry, especially since I&#x27;ve depended on Aveeno to help me with my eczema since I was a kid. I thought I could trust that it would help me, not hurt me. Here&#x27;s the link for what I found: http://www.primephysiquenutrition.com/whats-the-top-harshest-ingredients-you-should-avoid/ I hope this helps other people that have eczema like I do, but who don&#x27;t know what to do about it (like I didn&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser</li>
            <li> A very good product, recommended by my Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Over the last five years I have struggled with oily, yet dry patchy skin.  This combination is awful in the winter and my skin is acne prone.  After years of using acne washes and finally seeing a dermatologist, I&#x27;ve found that this product is the only wash that keeps my skin fresh and soothed. I&#x27;m also acne free for the first time in years. I highly recommend it to anyone that has struggled with patches of oily skin with dry and even flaking areas. Put the salicylic acid products away, I&#x27;m so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I like it. This product really does foam as they claim and it leaves even sensitive skin feeling clean and fresh. The scent is very mild, so if scents bother you then this would be a good product to choose. It doesn&#x27;t take more than one pump to wash your face, so the bottle is a good size to last for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues using this for many months now. The bottle doesn&#x27;t clog up and it is easy and convenient to use even in the shower. Overall, I&#x27;m impressed and would recommend it to other customers.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! If you have dry, itchy eczema prone skin try Aveeno Ultra Calming moisturizer for daytime with spf. I love, love this cream. First it feels like and applies like silk. The feverfew helps to calm itchy skin as well as helping with redness. I use an antioxident cream as a serum and the combination of these two products is amazing. My skin is calmed  95% AND THE REDNESS IS DIMINISHING BY 30%.  I also use the Ultra-Calming cleanser which also helps to reduce redness. At nighT I USE NEUTROGENA nATURALS NIGHT CREAM. ALSO A FANTASTIC CREAM FOR ITCHY, REACTIVE SENSITIVE SKIN.  Try the Aveeno Ultra-Calming daytime moisturizer with spf. You won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
            <li> Works while not stripping your face of needed moisture.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combination skin and thought I would try it out since I was given a coupon. It appeared to work fine for the first 3 days but on the fourth day I woke up to breakouts on my cheeks, chin, nose, and forehead. I quit immediately and went back to Cetaphil. I do not recommend for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product to calm her skin and, hopefully, reduce her rosacea. She has seen some improvement, and will continue to use it. It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> Works great, no drying or skin irritations.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin. This product makes the skin soft, not cause break out and my face feels very clean. I even noticed it evens and tones my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is foam, which I think is great.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product, I recommend it and I will keep purchase it.</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash I have yet to use on my very sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using it since it first came out, and will continue to use it for as long as it&#x27;s available - it&#x27;s that good! It removes my everyday makeup and sunscreen, and I can even wash my face twice w/ this gentle foaming wash, as I have to do sometimes to remove heavier mineral makeup. As my title implies, there are no bells and whistles to this cleanser, and apparently that&#x27;s all my skin needs. I recently used a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; brand of face wash that caused a horrid rash all over my face/neck, and I absolutely regret it. I will never stray from Aveeno again.</li>
            <li> Pump fails on every bottle I have bought. Annoying to use even the cleanser works for my sensitive skin. Won&#x27;t buy again because of the pump fails.</li>
            <li> Aveeno ultra-calming foaming face wash is a wonderful product. It cleans my skin and doesnt dry my face out. I have somewhat sensitive skin, and to finally find a good face wash that doesnt make my face break out because of dryness is quite the discovery for me. I still have to put moisturizer on my skin afterwards. It doesnt make it moist, but it does keep from doing damage. It also lasts a long time; it only takes one or maybe two pumps to wash my face. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products and the gets my skin the cleanest without irritating it.  It is affordable, too.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash for sensitive skin. The price beat Targets by 2$. I would recommended this face wash to any person with sensitive skin who does not want to spend a lot.</li>
            <li> LEAVE MY FACE VERY DRY</li>
            <li> This is as advertised.  It is fragrance free and a great sensitive skin cleanser.  My face feels soft and clean after every washing.  I keep it in the shower and can easily use the pump.  I have never stayed with the same cleanser for many reasons but I will buy this cleanser over and over again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for product for about six years. Any time I tried something new, I&#x27;d always come straight back to it. Nothing really compares. I even used it during my teens when I had acne. It was the only thing that didn&#x27;t make my skin rashy, while calming inflammation. I&#x27;m now using it in my 20&#x27;s. It does all I want from a cleanser- clean without stripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish they&#x27;d make it paraben free, though.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous gentle cleanser! It feels very light on the skin and hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all in the week that I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li> It cleanses my face, but as its not soap free, it makes my face very dry.</li>
            <li> its not harmful, and soft to skin. but still can not tell how well it clean the skin.&lt;br /&gt;i will keep reporting.</li>
            <li> Works great on my rosacea. For me at least there is no WOW factor, but some notable difference. Price is not bad also. Cheaper here on Amazon than anywhere I have found this product.</li>
            <li> Best calming cream out there to date love it  I use it morning and night I had irritated skin for 7 years nothing works but this help alotd</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever for sensitive skin. I am mid 40s and have roseca and very sensitive skin, other products have alwats dried my skin or either just didnt get it clean. This stuff is amazing...cant love it enough.</li>
            <li> We were seeking a Foaming Cleanser to replace a previous product from another source, and we tried this one and we like it so far, with no adverse complaints as yet. Thank you, Amazon, for your wide selection, competitive pricing, timely shipping, good customer support. Blessings.</li>
            <li> This is now the only cleaser I use for my sensitive skin.  My husband has rosacea.  I told him how much I liked the product and I thought it might be a good fit for his sensitive skin too.  He tried it and now this is the only cleanser he uses as well.  He also likes the Ultra Calming Moisturizer for his skin too.  Highly reccommend! I really hope they don&#x27;t ever discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> This cleans well, however about half way through the bottle the pump stops working.  I had to put it into another bottle with a pump top so I could use it up.  I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I proved this really random once i went to Miami, my aunt told me his son used this for acne, and in those days i was having a terrible break out, I tried it and my skin felt very smooth and calmed after i washed my face with it. Aveeno is one of the brands that have surprised me. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. My skin never feels tight dry or irritated after using it. It does just what it says, it is a calming face wash.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to get dry really easily. I&#x27;ve tried several different types of facial soap and my skin always looks worse after my shower than before. But this Aveeno doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin out. I&#x27;m no longer ashamed to take showers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month only on my forehead because I don&#x27;t really break out there and it can tolerate more but now I&#x27;m getting breaks outsm ( it&#x27;s just not smooth). This cleanser is the only thing that I have changed and have discontinued the use of it.mits not rated on high on beautypedia either : (</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive and dry in the winter and everything makes it feel tight, itchy and gross. This takes off makeup but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red and itchy. I use it morning and night. It cleanses without stripping.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Aveeno products and love them, so I really was looking forward to this one. It is calming but it leaves a sticky residue that I find annoying. Since I keep it on my bathroom sink, I use it because I &amp;#34;feel sorry for it&amp;#34;.  lol</li>
            <li> Mild and Effective face cleanser that works equally well for gently removing my makeup and taking care of a teen boy.</li>
            <li> I suddenly had eczema like symptoms on my face and the face wash / cleanser I had been using for years started agitating it even more. I tried several other brands meant for sensitive, eczema prone skin, everything would worsen it. Finally I came to know of Aveeno products. None of their products agitate my skin. Started using the Eczema Therapy cream and Ultra calming foaming cleaner. My face is completely clear and healthy now. I have seen a major improvements. It reduced redness, itchiness and breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I started using this cleanser a couple of years ago after finally figuring out that I should be using a cleanser that is soap-free. I was using dove soap on my face and it was really drying out my skin. I have very dry, sensitive skin in the first place and I didn&#x27;t realize bar soap was probably making it worse. So after using this facewash for a few days, my skin was much less dry and felt a lot better. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since and it has been working very well. The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is that because it is a foam cleanser, I always feel like I have to use more of it to clean my skin. Overall, though, I think this product works very well for my skin. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Great price on a good product.  We use a lot  of the Aveeno products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for years now ( at least 2) and my face loves it.  It&#x27;s super gentle but still removes all traces of makeup, eyeliner, and mascara.  I use about 5 pumps if I have a full face of makeup on and it removes it like a champ.  Highly recommend for faces that are sensitive, acne prone, dry, or even oily.  I used to have oily skin but since using this product, the oil production has reduced significantly and I no longer have break-outs or oily skin.  It&#x27;s done a great job of regulating my pores oil production since its not stripping your skin of all its natural oils, your skin doesn&#x27;t have to go crazy and overproduce more!</li>
            <li> I unfortunately have oily skin which I have to wash frequently.  Also its sensitive and I get acne breakouts easy, so more washing usually means more breakouts.  This cleanser has been wonderful.  I can wash my face every couple of hours without any irritation or over drying.  If you&#x27;re at your wits end definitely give this one a try.</li>
            <li> The price is good. I used it for one time like the foam very much Maybe it can be used in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and ever since my dermatologist gave me a sample of this Aveeno cleanser, I have never used another. It does not irritate my face or dry my skin. I haven&#x27;t had any kind of negative reaction to the product and I have tried many (too many!) other cleansers. None of the others have even come close to this foaming cleanser. It is gentle and always leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh. For people with irritable skin, rosacea, even blemishes, I would recommend this product. I have been using it for several years now and love it!</li>
            <li> For years I used Olay Foaming Cleanser for Sensitive Skin, it was starting to dry my face out. So I decided to try this. The Aveeno is soothing, calming, doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes when removing the mascara, and I love that it has no fragrance.</li>
            <li> This product felt quite lovely, but within minutes made my skin sting and turn red. I&#x27;ve used the cleansing wipe version of this product quite often with no problems, so I was surprised to have a reaction to this cleanser. I&#x27;ve read a few other reviews, both here and on the Aveeno site, from people who had reactions to this particular product as well. I&#x27;ve used a lot of Aveeno products over the years and this is the first one to cause me any problems. I returned it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! I woke up with a rash on my face that was extremely dry, itchy, burning and thick. After washing with this just one time my face started improving. The itching and burning disappeared completely at once and the rash was almost gone by that evening. I followed this up with the ultra calming lotion also by Aveeno.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; but has a strange chemical smell to it that reminds me of the Clearasil wash from my teenage years. It washes well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but the smell is just too much for me. If you don&#x27;t want acne flashbacks, skip this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser a while ago and only recently I started to use it more and now it&#x27;s the only cleanser I use.&lt;br /&gt;I had the Neutrogena naturals cleanser and I was pretty pleased with it except for the fact that I have to almost scrub my face to get it off. With this Aveeno cleanser I don&#x27;t have to do that and it works just as great. Every time I use it my face feels fresh and clean and I&#x27;ve seen that my face doesn&#x27;t get as red simply because I don&#x27;t have to be overly harsh to remove it since it comes off very easily. The one downfall is that when I use it to remove my makeup, it&#x27;s not all that good at it. It removes most of it, but I end up with a little concealer and eye shadow still on my face, which I don&#x27;t mind that much since I do like using a separate makeup remover for the eye area. Just a heads up for those who planed on using it a a full on makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a great product at a very good price. I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a product that works without leaving any residue in your skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne and rosacea-prone skin and try to use all sensitive-skin products. I love aveeno, ceraVe, Cetaphil and Olay.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to get a softer-than-usual soap for my face for wintertime. However, after about 2 weeks of using this product I started  braking out. I did not change anything in my beauty routine, not even the food I ate, so I figured the cause of my breakouts was this cleanser. I also noticed there was always a thin film over my face after i washed it with Aveeno Ultra-calming cleanser. The film was hard to wash off (i usually do not use a sponge when I wash my face). I read the ingredients and found glycerin to be listed second after water, meaning in this product the concentration of glycerin is higher than concentration of any other chemical.  It is glycerin residue that I was feeling on my skin and it definitely blocked my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advise is to not buy this product, and if you do definitely use a sponge or a towelette to wash off ALL the glycerin residue of the cleanser.</li>
            <li> Great shower cleanser!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product that my sensitive skin can use, and it really helps sooth and soften my skin when it is irritated from other harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Really the only think that keeps the redness from my face. Used with the calming lotion and you have a great &amp;#34;Rid the redness&amp;#34; routine.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking it would be extra gentle during a rosecea flair.  When I finished washing, my cheeks were bright read, and my skin felt taut and dry.  The ultra calming moisturizer burned.  Not for me.</li>
            <li> Because it comes out in foam form I felt I needed to use a lot of it to wash my face.  I really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This cleanser seems to leave a slippery film on my skin - using a washcloth to rinse my face gets that film off. I don&#x27;t know that I really notice a calming effect on my skin, but my face does feel refreshed after using it. I like the scent and I love the foam these Aveeno cleansers make!</li>
            <li> Keeps Momma Happy ...!</li>
            <li> this does not lather as soapy as some brands so i wondered if it even worked the first few times. my skin is prone to getting red and irritated easily and i notice a difference after a couple days use and it does not have a bad odor so if you are hypoallergenic than this is for you.</li>
            <li> Having roseate, sensitive skin and being slightly oily has made if difficult to find an appropriate cleanser.  When I realized this cleanser was also SLS free I decided to give it a try.  I love the foaming dispenser which saves a few seconds not having to work up a lather.  I&#x27;m old fashioned in that I want a cleanser to foam or lather or I don&#x27;t believe it can clean my skin throughly.  I have been using this product for several years and while I have not found it to calm my skin as advertised it has not irritated my skin or left it redder than before.  It does a great job of removing mineral makeup and leaving my skin feeling clean but not stripped.  No tight feeling, just soft and clean.  Not residue is left behind that must be removed by a toner.  I have it shipped to me every couple months with the auto ship plan and have not found a cleanser that I like better.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser for sensitive skin, I am on accutane, for acne, and it is difficult to find a product that doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of oils and dry it out even more.  This seemed to be the best value for what I needed.</li>
            <li> I love Aveda products overall, but this one is my absolute favorite.  For aging skin (I am 68), it does an excellent job removing makeup without irritation.  The foam is thick, and you really don&#x27;t need much of it to do a good cleansing.  The bottle lasts a long time, so it is an outstanding value.  It is the only facial cleanser I use, and it seems to minimize breakouts and does not dry the skin.  I have many allergies, and this foam has caused no itchiness or welts.  I have suggested it to friends both older and much younger than I, and they have been WOWed by the product, too.  This Aveeno product delivers on all of its promises.</li>
            <li> My skin gets oily if I use soap that dries me out too much...this product works great though. Great balance of cleaning my skin without drying it out. I&#x27;ve tried other products that left my skin feeling oily b/c it wasn&#x27;t &#x27;soapy&#x27; enough, and other products that dried my skin out too much- this is just right. The foaming texture is great too b/c it&#x27;s easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> This is not the best face wash I have ever used, but it is pretty good.  It didn&#x27;t make me break out.  I have sensitive skin on my face and I tend to have rosacea and break out. I have combination skin.  Using this face wash does make me feel like my face is clean, but it doesn&#x27;t help prevent any problems so far like some other ones have done in the past.</li>
            <li> very good products, and which fit my needs very well. and it looks clean and stable, i would like recommond it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I like it. Doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, I like it, and it makes my face feel clean without making it oily. Nice way to be good to your skin right before bed. Also makes your face feel nice and soft :]&lt;br /&gt;However, this won&#x27;t get rid of your acne. It can help prevent it, but for moderate or severe acne you&#x27;re going to need something stronger. I like to use this before my other acne medication to clean my face and let my other stuff be more effective.&lt;br /&gt;Warning! Make sure you follow the directions! I didn&#x27;t for the first night and my face got all red and irritated. All you have to do is wet your face before hand and pat it dry afterwards, just make sure you do that!</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s &amp;#34;authentic.&amp;#34;  Seems to irritate skin a little, while previous drugstore purchases were gentle.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have tried other soaps but this one really works for me and by the way, it was recommended by my dermatologist. Takes my makeup off and my skin feels so smooth! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Its very gentle and moisturizing too. Great for morning or mid day face wash. I may not buy it again as its not paraben free</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno cleansers, but this one, even though it probably did what it is supposed to do, stinks. I think of fragrance-free as not smelling much like anything, however this one smelled like old dirty T-shirts. I will go back to the light, clean smelling fragrance of Aveeno products after this experiment.</li>
            <li> Looking for a light, fragrance-free cleanser I purchased this product expecting just that... and that is what I got. I have delicate, acne-filled skin so when it comes down to washing my face, its essential to not to irritate the little s***s. Although my acne persist, it is less inflamed... which is good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful cleanser and very gentle!</li>
            <li> When you find a product that makes your face feel really clean without feeling all dried out, you&#x27;ve got a winner.  I&#x27;m over 75 and love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno products never let you down.</li>
            <li> I suffer from rosacea which has increased with age. I have used many different types of cleansers and this seems to be less irritating than most. I use it daily, in the evening, and although it is only a week since I started I can confidently say this is everything it claims to be. Cleans the skin. Leaves it feeling fresh. Doesn&#x27;t exacerbate the rosacea. If your skin is easily irritated, try this cleanser.</li>
            <li> My sensitive face loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash. It may not be strong enough for you if you have acne which I do. Very gentle though.</li>
            <li> I call this product Lady Calm because after I used the product, I felt clean, calm, relaxed and felt and slept like a Lady should have  felt and slept.  Results after using the product was positive and I sure would recommend the product anytime.</li>
            <li> Best facial wash I ever used.  For aging and sensitive skin... you must buy this one.</li>
            <li> El producto me llego en buen estado, estoy satisfecho con la compra lo recomiendo 100% no tengo quejas,&lt;br /&gt;Muchas gracias por el servicio.</li>
            <li> Good for dry skin use and doesnt take away moisture from skin.&lt;br /&gt;skin doesnt feel tight and stretchy after use</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and really require something lightweight yet something that takes care of dry skin.  This is absolutely perfect.  I use it all the time.</li>
