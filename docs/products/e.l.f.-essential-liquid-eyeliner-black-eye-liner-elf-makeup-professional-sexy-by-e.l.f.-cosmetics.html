    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>For a brand I have never heard of, this is an awesome product!</li>
            <li>Excellent pricing and customer service</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Good!</li>
            <li>Great eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Great price for a great eye liner.</li>
            <li>Great applicator tip.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve been a fan of ELF products for some time, I have shied away from trying this one thinking that it couldn&#x27;t possibly be good for just $1 (on the ELF website/Target).</li>
            <li>When it comes to eyeliner, paying a bit more for better quality stuff is best</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not my favorite liquid eyeliner!</li>
            <li>absolutely love it !&lt;</li>
            <li>ll be buying more !</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really nice at the end of the day when I don&#x27;t want to wash my makeup off.</li>
            <li>It is nice, but after a while it dries away.</li>
            <li>Not flattering at all.&lt;br /&gt;However, if you are a beginner or want to practice getting your wings right with eyeliner, this is an excellent one to start with because it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>I have always liked this eyeliner, mostly for the sleek brush...easier for me to apply.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner would be best used as a starter eyeliner for young girls.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, stays on all day with no fading!</li>
            <li>very comfortable</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner...</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s my most favorite eyeliner</li>
            <li>Great, I love the new bottle</li>
            <li>I feel like this peeling quality would be good if it didn&#x27;t do it while you still want to look pretty</li>
            <li>i love this eyeliner its easy to put on and stays on all day if you put on elf eyeshadow &amp;&amp; the elf eyelid primer.</li>
            <li>The packaging is good and the applicator works really well to transfer the liner to the eye.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and comes off when I want it to.  </li>
            <li>Came very quickly.</li>
            <li>and I like how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to apply and it lasts.  </li>
            <li>The first time i bought this, it was flat out great!</li>
            <li>Spend more on a better quality unless you are capable of layering on without messing up.</li>
            <li>Lasts long and looks great.</li>
            <li>A good starting product, if not a practice item for ladies that need help applying on liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>This was VERY easy to use, nice and dark.</li>
            <li>Throughout the day it quickly deteriorates and by the end of the night it eventually peels off like rubber.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a steady hand as it is water proof.</li>
            <li>I use it only for special occasions - but love how easily it goes on.</li>
            <li>(MAYBE) i should get a new one and try it one more time?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay because it wasn&#x27;t really that noticeable unless you&#x27;re really talking to me face to face.</li>
            <li>Good for a teenager or for practice but not really for an adult who can afford to buy a better product.</li>
            <li>But it looks fresh even after its been on for hours.</li>
            <li>It arrived on the right time.i like it</li>
            <li>For me I feel like it fades very quickly, so i have to apply it frequently</li>
            <li>Not satisfied, doesn&#x27;t have good contact on skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this liquid eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Made my eyes really stand out.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used liquid eyeliner in 12 years</li>
            <li>really like it,</li>
            <li>only thing that maybe isn&#x27;t up to par would be the amount in the bottle, but it&#x27;s cheap, so who cares!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>You guys were right, this is very viscous and takes multiple coats to not appear so opaque.</li>
            <li>But other than that, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>so this has been my first time back at it</li>
            <li>It takes too long to apply because it goes on in light streaks that you have to build up, not to make the look bolder but to just get the proper line and color.</li>
            <li>Also i am posting from my phone so can&#x27;t upload pic directly to Amazon.</li>
            <li>(lol.)&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I thought that I&#x27;d try this ELF brand, because I&#x27;m kind of poor at the moment.</li>
            <li>which made the consistency different as prior to the first time i used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only liked the brush but the liner itself is not good quality.</li>
            <li>but the brush or the applicator is too soft and broad.</li>
            <li>, it was pretty easy to wash off, I&#x27;ve never tried liquid eyeliner before but the brush seemed a little awkward, but i probably just need more practice.</li>
            <li>crisp brush and sharp lines.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eyeliner of all times, I use it everyday in either black or midnight.</li>
            <li>A few minutes after the liner dries it separates into two distinct lines with a big fleshy patch in the middle.</li>

            <li> A few minutes after the liner dries it separates into two distinct lines with a big fleshy patch in the middle.</li>
            <li> I was shocked: it is very pigmented, easy to apply, does not smudge or budge, although it does not claim to be waterproof.</li>
            <li> put.&lt;br /&gt;Little amount lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to wait long for it</li>
            <li> Liquid was on the dry side.</li>
            <li> and it has like a dry out piece inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> When i get the stick out the dry piece came out with the stick.</li>
            <li> Cannot beat the price, especially since I would have to drive 80 miles round trip to get this!</li>
            <li> The reason i gave this product 3 stars was because when i opened it, the tip that i got was definitely like a small marker.</li>
            <li> Of course then I&#x27;m making a mess and have to wipe it off and start all over.</li>
            <li> Took a little while to get used to so that I didn&#x27;t smear it all over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested this eyeliner out for a few weeks now, and I have to say,</li>
            <li> This stuff was not as thick and dark</li>
            <li> I never used a liquid eyeliner before but wanted to try it because I find the pencil liners hard to use and usually end up going without eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Lasted all day long, and held well with fake eyelashes too.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I like it, but when I do a wingtip, I must go over my lid about 20 (extracting) times to make it look thick.</li>
            <li> It was very thick so whenever I would try to wear them it would be all over my lashes.</li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t feel bad about wiping it off after 2 minutes!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Yesss I have bought like 10 of these I love it</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner. Love it!</li>
            <li> It was alright. When it comes to eyeliner, paying a bit more for better quality stuff is best</li>
            <li> For a brand I have never heard of, this is an awesome product! It actually stays on all day! Love it!</li>
            <li> I really like this liquid eyeliner.  Goes on easy and comes off when I want it to.  Great price for a great eye liner.</li>
            <li> Liquid was on the dry side. Was dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this eyeliner, mostly for the sleek brush...easier for me to apply. Cannot beat the price, especially since I would have to drive 80 miles round trip to get this!</li>
            <li> This stuff was not as thick and dark and I wanted, having to apply multiple &amp;#34;coats&amp;#34; to my eyes is not the idea. Of course then I&#x27;m making a mess and have to wipe it off and start all over. By the time I had finally gotten it to an acceptable point my eyes were puffy and red from cleaning all the excess away. Spend more on a better quality unless you are capable of layering on without messing up.</li>
            <li> I use it only for special occasions - but love how easily it goes on.</li>
            <li> I never used a liquid eyeliner before but wanted to try it because I find the pencil liners hard to use and usually end up going without eyeliner. This was VERY easy to use, nice and dark. Took a little while to get used to so that I didn&#x27;t smear it all over. Made my eyes really stand out. Came very quickly.</li>
            <li> Get at Walmart for a dollar.&lt;br /&gt;Applies smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t waterproof but stays put.&lt;br /&gt;Little amount lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I like the felt tip applicator vs. the brush bristles-unstable</li>
            <li> The first time i bought this, it was flat out great! I used it on my graduation and my sister tells me 10 minutes later after leaving the house, it was starting to crack. It&#x27;s okay because it wasn&#x27;t really that noticeable unless you&#x27;re really talking to me face to face. I thought to myself that i probably didn&#x27;t shake it ? which made the consistency different as prior to the first time i used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i was trying it out again a few days ago, the consistency was really transparent? And i thought to myself (MAYBE) i should get a new one and try it one more time? The reason i gave this product 3 stars was because when i opened it, the tip that i got was definitely like a small marker. It was fatter than the one shown in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If i were to choose, between this and the liquid eye liner pen, i would choose the pen. But I would definitely choose a gel liner next time.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner...very comfortable n ur hand and u&#x27;ll fell like u have control over that u do...</li>
            <li> You guys were right, this is very viscous and takes multiple coats to not appear so opaque. Good for a teenager or for practice but not really for an adult who can afford to buy a better product. I haven&#x27;t really used liquid eyeliner in 12 years so this has been my first time back at it coming off of gel liner. [...] this is s comparison of the e.l.f. brand liner compared to Maybelline brand. Please keep in mind i haven&#x27;t used liquid liner in 12 years. Also i am posting from my phone so can&#x27;t upload pic directly to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t wear make-up often and I like how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested this eyeliner out for a few weeks now, and I have to say, it&#x27;s not my favorite liquid eyeliner! The packaging is good and the applicator works really well to transfer the liner to the eye. My problem is with the formula-it&#x27;s simply too low quality to work well. A few minutes after the liner dries it separates into two distinct lines with a big fleshy patch in the middle. Not flattering at all.&lt;br /&gt;However, if you are a beginner or want to practice getting your wings right with eyeliner, this is an excellent one to start with because it&#x27;s cheap so you won&#x27;t feel bad about wiping it off after 2 minutes!</li>
            <li> Excellent pricing and customer service</li>
            <li> It was very thick so whenever I would try to wear them it would be all over my lashes. But u get what u pay for.</li>
            <li> For me I feel like it fades very quickly, so i have to apply it frequently and it has like a dry out piece inside the bottle. When i get the stick out the dry piece came out with the stick.</li>

This eyeliner would be best used as a starter eyeliner for young girls.</li>
            <li> Great applicator tip. Easy to apply, stays on all day with no fading!</li>
            <li> Lasts long and looks great. Make sure you have a steady hand as it is water proof. But it looks fresh even after its been on for hours.</li>

            <li> Great, I love the new bottle</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is awesome.  It is so easy to apply and it lasts.  I was was worried about irriation, but there was none.</li>
