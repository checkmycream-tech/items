            <li>Will def buy more from this line. :)</li>
            <li>Quality is exactly like the sigma brushes!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for blending but don&#x27;t expect too much out of it.</li>
            <li>Great purchase, would definitely recommend to a friend. :)</li>
            <li>but I have tried the flat top kabuki and the pointy top kabuki and both are amazing!</li>
            <li>Months and months later this is still my favorite brush that I own!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>Free shipping??</li>
            <li>The angle on it will be great for under eye and smaller area application or blending.</li>
            <li>It comes out a smooth, streak free finish</li>
            <li>I was really surprised by how good this brush is.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine a better brush for this price - or much higher.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try these brushes and they had to ship from overseas.</li>
            <li>They wash clean, mine havent stained yet.</li>
            <li>The price was very good for such a  high quality brush.  </li>
            <li>does shed minimally, but is great for the price paid.</li>
            <li>i love it and would definitely recommend....planning to purchase more</li>
            <li>The package seems really sturdy, when i washed it, only one brush hair fell off lol</li>
            <li>Just a warning though the very first time I used this brush it did shed a lot but</li>
            <li>The brush is extremely soft, and I love it so much!!</li>
            <li>It blends super well and it&#x27;s better for blending than most other brushes.</li>
            <li>Their brushes are so soft on the skin, yet they are stable enough to do great work.</li>
            <li>I have washed them several times in luke warm water with my Dial anti-bacterial hand soap and my Neutrogena grapefruit acne wash.</li>
            <li>Worth the price and</li>
            <li>Step up your makeup game with this awesome brush!</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 different brushes (Kabuki Flat Top, Pointy Top Kabuki Angled Top Kabuki)</li>
            <li>A great option for normal, oily, and slightly dry skin with no flakiness.  </li>
            <li>It arrived pretty quickly and didn&#x27;t have any chemical smell.</li>
            <li>I am on here again to get a few more for my mom and step daughter!!</li>
            <li>but then again why would you want to pay for a product if it isnt made right.</li>
            <li>For a ~$3 brush with free shipping, it came pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It is better than most of my other pricier ones!!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, received way before ETA.</li>
            <li>Also it shipped to me very fast (about a week).  </li>
            <li>It dud have a slight smell, but after washing the smell out and letting it dry, I then used my foundation and it worked perfectly with blending.</li>
            <li>I was actually going to purchase some, but now I don&#x27;t need to:)</li>
            <li>I just starting experimenting with makeup brushes and love this brush.</li>
            <li>it really is a steal!</li>
            <li>Mine did shed a lot on the first use.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get better quality brushes and this is definitely it.</li>
            <li>It went away after the first wash.</li>
            <li>Most likely will buy another.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First time ever using a foundation brush and lm</li>
            <li>Shipping was SO fast!</li>
            <li>Wow these brushes are sigma quality!!!!</li>
            <li>This and their flat top one are my faves and need to order a couple more since i use them for multiple tasks.  </li>
            <li>I imagine I will use this brush for foundation and since it is the same bristles as the flat top and pointy top</li>
            <li>This is a good heavy duty makeup brush!</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft, and overall, It&#x27;s amazing quality for only $3!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a  horizontally straight brush.</li>
            <li>I have never had one of these before and really like it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this brush for a person with very dry/ flaky skin because the buffing motions will start to exfoliate your face.  </li>
            <li>and really spreads things evenly..</li>
            <li>Very dense and sturdy.</li>
            <li>this brush is better than i expected.</li>
            <li>I still would recommend to buy it, since it&#x27;s really affordable.</li>
            <li>Came fast within a week or two.</li>
            <li>Very dense and</li>
            <li>It feels soft!!!</li>
            <li>It is definitely well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Nice brush but who knows how long it will last with the rate it sheds at!</li>
            <li>Kind of has a weird smell, fine otherwise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read so many reviews, but couldn&#x27;t believe I would be getting such a high quality product at such an affordable price!</li>
            <li>great quality, very low price :) came in a little late, but wasn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li>It feels like a high quality brush.</li>
            <li>I also have the flat top of this same brand and</li>
            <li>It is incredibly soft and very dense.</li>
            <li>The brush is smaller than I expected (The bristles, not the handle), but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Its very soft and dense.</li>
            <li>I like them more than designer lines, which cost a small fortune by the time you get them all.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This brush doesn&#x27;t shed or streak foundation like other cheap brushes i&#x27;ve purchased so far.</li>
            <li>Holy wow!</li>
            <li>Soft and excelent for my bronzer!</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the paint smell when I first received it.</li>
            <li>It took a long time to arrive but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>The bristles are sooooooo soft!</li>
            <li>So since they are all pretty clean I keep them in the same bag once they&#x27;ve dried.</li>
            <li>You will probably need to super glue the brush to the handle; but other than that, the brush works so well</li>
            <li>So far, it is holding up well.</li>
            <li>The brush is dense and soft.  </li>
            <li>its dense and soft.</li>
            <li>its an amazingly soft brush....</li>
            <li>I use it for blush, and it&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li>It feels really soft and the brush is quite dense.</li>
            <li>soft and dense.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li>really soft and flexible.</li>
            <li>It is soft and dense</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and dense and did not really shed even after washing it so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and I use it everyday!</li>
            <li>the handle is thick for precise application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly angled, not as much as I thought it would be.</li>

            <li> I was excited to try these brushes and they had to ship from overseas.</li>
            <li> They wash clean, mine havent stained yet.</li>
            <li> The price was very good for such a  high quality brush.  </li>
            <li> does shed minimally, but is great for the price paid.</li>
            <li> i love it and would definitely recommend....planning to purchase more</li>
            <li> The package seems really sturdy, when i washed it, only one brush hair fell off lol</li>
            <li> Just a warning though the very first time I used this brush it did shed a lot but</li>
            <li> The brush is extremely soft, and I love it so much!!</li>
            <li> It blends super well and it&#x27;s better for blending than most other brushes.</li>
            <li> Their brushes are so soft on the skin, yet they are stable enough to do great work.</li>
            <li> I have washed them several times in luke warm water with my Dial anti-bacterial hand soap and my Neutrogena grapefruit acne wash.</li>
            <li> Worth the price and</li>
            <li> Step up your makeup game with this awesome brush!</li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 different brushes (Kabuki Flat Top, Pointy Top Kabuki Angled Top Kabuki)</li>
            <li> A great option for normal, oily, and slightly dry skin with no flakiness.  </li>
            <li> It arrived pretty quickly and didn&#x27;t have any chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I am on here again to get a few more for my mom and step daughter!!</li>
            <li> but then again why would you want to pay for a product if it isnt made right.</li>
            <li> For a ~$3 brush with free shipping, it came pretty fast.</li>
            <li> It is better than most of my other pricier ones!!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, received way before ETA.</li>
            <li> Also it shipped to me very fast (about a week).  </li>
            <li> It dud have a slight smell, but after washing the smell out and letting it dry, I then used my foundation and it worked perfectly with blending.</li>
            <li> I was actually going to purchase some, but now I don&#x27;t need to:)</li>
            <li> I just starting experimenting with makeup brushes and love this brush.</li>
            <li> it really is a steal!</li>
            <li> Mine did shed a lot on the first use.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get better quality brushes and this is definitely it.</li>
            <li> It went away after the first wash.</li>
            <li> Most likely will buy another.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First time ever using a foundation brush and lm</li>
            <li> Shipping was SO fast!</li>
            <li> Wow these brushes are sigma quality!!!!</li>
            <li> This and their flat top one are my faves and need to order a couple more since i use them for multiple tasks.  </li>
            <li> I imagine I will use this brush for foundation and since it is the same bristles as the flat top and pointy top</li>
            <li> This is a good heavy duty makeup brush!</li>
            <li> The bristles are super soft, and overall, It&#x27;s amazing quality for only $3!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a  horizontally straight brush.</li>
            <li> I have never had one of these before and really like it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this brush for a person with very dry/ flaky skin because the buffing motions will start to exfoliate your face.  </li>
            <li> and really spreads things evenly..</li>
            <li> Very dense and sturdy.</li>
            <li> this brush is better than i expected.</li>
            <li> I still would recommend to buy it, since it&#x27;s really affordable.</li>
            <li> Came fast within a week or two.</li>
            <li> Very dense and</li>
            <li> It feels soft!!!</li>
            <li> It is definitely well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Nice brush but who knows how long it will last with the rate it sheds at!</li>
            <li> Kind of has a weird smell, fine otherwise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read so many reviews, but couldn&#x27;t believe I would be getting such a high quality product at such an affordable price!</li>
            <li> great quality, very low price :) came in a little late, but wasn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> It feels like a high quality brush.</li>
            <li> I also have the flat top of this same brand and</li>
            <li> It is incredibly soft and very dense.</li>
            <li> The brush is smaller than I expected (The bristles, not the handle), but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Its very soft and dense.</li>
            <li> I like them more than designer lines, which cost a small fortune by the time you get them all.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t shed or streak foundation like other cheap brushes i&#x27;ve purchased so far.</li>
            <li> Holy wow!</li>
            <li> Soft and excelent for my bronzer!</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the paint smell when I first received it.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to arrive but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> The bristles are sooooooo soft!</li>
            <li> So since they are all pretty clean I keep them in the same bag once they&#x27;ve dried.</li>
            <li> You will probably need to super glue the brush to the handle; but other than that, the brush works so well</li>
            <li> So far, it is holding up well.</li>
            <li> The brush is dense and soft.  </li>
            <li> its dense and soft.</li>
            <li> its an amazingly soft brush....</li>
            <li> I use it for blush, and it&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li> It feels really soft and the brush is quite dense.</li>
            <li> soft and dense.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li> really soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> It is soft and dense</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and dense and did not really shed even after washing it so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> the handle is thick for precise application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly angled, not as much as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I recently bought the flat kabuki brush from this seller, and I wanted the angled one for my blush!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with their Tapered Kabuki, Angled Kabuki and Flat Kabuki along with the 4 piece eye shadow blending brushes.</li>
            <li> Now that i started using these brushes i use far less foundation on my face, i used to use my fingers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, if you can move past the smell, it&#x27;s a decent brush.</li>
            <li> Expected date was Nov 10th, and I received in two weeks after I ordered it (Oct 3rd).</li>
            <li> I wash the brushes I use for wet makeup daily, and the dry makeup brushes I wash weekly.</li>
            <li> the brush is BARELY angled (even less than the picture).</li>
            <li> so i will probably just copy and paste this for the other ones as well instead of writing a review for each individual brush.</li>
            <li> The brush metal part glued to the black wooden part was not efficient</li>
            <li> I wash it every other day and absolutely no shedding what so ever!</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing other brushes from this company to try as well.</li>
            <li> I have now used this brush and all the other i bought from this company.</li>
            <li> I had read other reviews about the smell and shedding but decided to buy it anyways.</li>
            <li> This brush has started to make all my other brushes stink.</li>
            <li> No lie hands down...</li>
            <li> The brush came way before the expected delivery date!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are def a DUPE and just HALF to 1/3 of the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering an extra 2 sets of these brushes for when my other brushes are dirty or being washed.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I will reorder few of them for gifting and backup!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if all of them are made that way, or if mine is defective; But buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about how it would be for the price and other reviews</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!!</li>
            <li> AS IF IT WAS A REALLY EXPENSIVE BRUSH...</li>
            <li> I had to wash it 3 times before using it and there is still this weird scent to it.</li>
            <li> Also, it smelled weird, like gasoline (???)</li>
            <li> I said WTF!</li>
            <li> Too bad it is out of stock.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> I tried to use the brush and it sheds awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like to use it for contouring my face works well nice brush for price no shedding and nice and dense I recommend</li>
            <li> The brush came way before the expected delivery date!! Very nice sturdy brush</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush!!!! I was so skeptical about how it would be for the price and other reviews but it&#x27;s great and made with great quality! I&#x27;ve  had it about 3 weeks and only 1 bristle has fallen out. Definitely can stand up to more expensive brushes</li>
            <li> Not angled. It&#x27;s a  horizontally straight brush. still could be used for bronze, blush..... But didn&#x27;t come as described</li>
            <li> I have never had one of these before and really like it.  Easy to use and clean.  So far, it is holding up well.</li>
            <li> This brush is really great! I use MAC&#x27;s Studio Fix Fluid foundation (I have a review of that as well on the MAC website) which has a thicker consistency so I was kind of worried about how this brush would work with my foundation but it works perfectly and it helps make my foundation routine go a lot quicker and easier. Just a warning though the very first time I used this brush it did shed a lot but after that I haven&#x27;t experienced any stray hairs at all. It&#x27;s also very easy to clean and just a good brush all around :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and needed a brush with this angle. (And the one below.) I thought I would take a chance with this company and I a thrilled that I did. Their brushes are so soft on the skin, yet they are stable enough to do great work. They are perfect. I can&#x27;t imagine a better brush for this price - or much higher. I like them more than designer lines, which cost a small fortune by the time you get them all. Wow!</li>
            <li> this brush works great and the hairs do not shed!</li>
            <li> Great brush would difinately order again.</li>
            <li> I love it!! It works very good and nice price and definitely i will buy more!!!!! It feels soft!!! Thanks</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! I use it for my bronzer and it blends it out perfectly!</li>
            <li> this brush is sooo good! great quality, very low price :) came in a little late, but wasn&#x27;t a problem. They also gift you nail strips, which I thought was nice..I was actually going to purchase some, but now I don&#x27;t need to:) Do Recommend!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> BEST BRUSH EVER! It&#x27;s soooo soft and blends in my foundation perfectly</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome!! It is better than most of my other pricier ones!! I keep reaching for it whenever I do my makeup.  I wash it every other day and absolutely no shedding what so ever! I am on here again to get a few more for my mom and step daughter!! I will be purchasing other brushes from this company to try as well. Great quality for the price! Unbelievable!!</li>
            <li> It is definitely well worth the money! It is one of my favorite brushes I have ever purchased! No doubt!</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by how good this brush is.  The brush is dense and soft.  I would not recommend this brush for a person with very dry/ flaky skin because the buffing motions will start to exfoliate your face.  A great option for normal, oily, and slightly dry skin with no flakiness.  Good option for most skin types.</li>
            <li> to start! delivery was estimated January 10th - Jan 28th. I said WTF! OMG! I ordered them on Dec 14th. I got them today Christmas Eve all the way from freaking China! So that is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I wish i could post a vid on these brushes. its dense and soft. I have now used this brush and all the other i bought from this company. They feel great on my skin they bush blush and liquid foundation really good. I have washed them several times in luke warm water with my Dial anti-bacterial hand soap and my Neutrogena grapefruit acne wash. They wash clean, mine havent stained yet. I guess it depends on how you use your brushed but for me they dont soak up my foundation. Now that i started using these brushes i use far less foundation on my face, i used to use my fingers. There are great quality. I used this angled brush to contour, highlight and blush. This and their flat top one are my faves and need to order a couple more since i use them for multiple tasks.  I ordered this along with their Tapered Kabuki, Angled Kabuki and Flat Kabuki along with the 4 piece eye shadow blending brushes. and the same goes for all of them. they are all uniform in quality and texture. so i will probably just copy and paste this for the other ones as well instead of writing a review for each individual brush. they are all great and would recommend them.</li>
            <li> its an amazingly soft brush....so .soft and really spreads things evenly..i love it and would definitely recommend....planning to purchase more</li>
            <li> Wow these brushes are sigma quality!!!! No lie hands down... Worth the price and the wait from it coming from  china,  8 days of wait.... Free shipping?? Okayyyy its a deal.... I love the brushes i do do youtube videos and i will review these.... At latinabeautyCulture on youtube</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, received way before ETA. Brushes beautifully packaged and great quality,  I would recommend this to everybody.  Absolutely beautiful!  My new favorite!</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t shed or streak foundation like other cheap brushes i&#x27;ve purchased so far. It feels like a high quality brush.</li>
            <li> The brush metal part glued to the black wooden part was not efficient so it broke apart when I used it. You can glue it together but then again why would you want to pay for a product if it isnt made right.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 different brushes (Kabuki Flat Top, Pointy Top Kabuki Angled Top Kabuki) I have not tried this brush yet but I have tried the flat top kabuki and the pointy top kabuki and both are amazing! use this brush for foundation. I imagine I will use this brush for foundation and since it is the same bristles as the flat top and pointy top i&#x27;m sure it will be an amazing finish. The angle on it will be great for under eye and smaller area application or blending. I&#x27;m ordering an extra 2 sets of these brushes for when my other brushes are dirty or being washed.&lt;br /&gt;  Bye Bye Mac,Sigma and Sedona Lace! These brushes are def a DUPE and just HALF to 1/3 of the price! I was excited to try these brushes and they had to ship from overseas. However, It arrived way before the scheduled date!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It is comparable to the Sigma brush. Very dense and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Holy wow! This brush with a big brand name can cost $50! I&#x27;m so impressed it&#x27;s so soft perfect for stippling liquid foundation or even mousse foundation! Very impressed. I had to wait at least 3 weeks but worth it.</li>
            <li> Perfect. I use it for blush, and it&#x27;s so soft. These are literally Sigma brushes without the word Sigma on it.</li>
            <li> I just starting experimenting with makeup brushes and love this brush.</li>
            <li> It is really smooth and nice but it sheds....</li>
            <li> Brush does&#x27;nt do the job...waste of money!</li>
            <li> I use this brush for powdered blush. It&#x27;s nice and soft and does the job GREAT! I should have had one like this years ago! It blends super well and it&#x27;s better for blending than most other brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read so many reviews, but couldn&#x27;t believe I would be getting such a high quality product at such an affordable price! Step up your makeup game with this awesome brush! I like it for bronzers and/or contouring! Just do it! No complaints here!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!! It dud have a slight smell, but after washing the smell out and letting it dry, I then used my foundation and it worked perfectly with blending. No streaking lines. Perfect item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy about this purchase. For a ~$3 brush with free shipping, it came pretty fast. Expected date was Nov 10th, and I received in two weeks after I ordered it (Oct 3rd). It feels really soft and the brush is quite dense. Great for beginners who don&#x27;t want to splurge :)</li>
            <li> this brush is better than i expected. soft and dense. does shed minimally, but is great for the price paid.</li>
            <li> Brushes are great and for the price u cant beat that</li>
            <li> Months and months later this is still my favorite brush that I own! Great quality, fabulous price. Buy it!</li>
            <li> You will probably need to super glue the brush to the handle; but other than that, the brush works so well and it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li> It arrived pretty quickly and didn&#x27;t have any chemical smell. It is incredibly soft and very dense. I&#x27;m very pleased with this brush- for that price it really is a steal! It hasn&#x27;t shed after 3 washes either.</li>
            <li> Kind of has a weird smell, fine otherwise.</li>
            <li> great price. awesome quality. doesn&#x27;t shed. I&#x27;ve already washed it and it  held up great!</li>
            <li> I had read other reviews about the smell and shedding but decided to buy it anyways. It did have the smell but I didn&#x27;t care for that. Mine did shed a lot on the first use. It&#x27;s good for blending but don&#x27;t expect too much out of it. Maybe it depends on the brush. I still would recommend to buy it, since it&#x27;s really affordable.</li>
            <li> I like this brush for foundation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Got them sooner that I expect love them there some I would purchase again</li>
            <li> Ordered for granddaughter.  She loved it.</li>
            <li> worth the price. works well.</li>
            <li> I recently bought the flat kabuki brush from this seller, and I wanted the angled one for my blush!! Received it yesterday and amaze balls!! My blush looks even better with this amazing brush!! Quality is exactly like the sigma brushes!!! Loovee dont think about it just buy it you will love it!!</li>
            <li> Love the brush but the handle came off In a week or so, I have to keep putting it back together</li>
            <li> really soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> This Brush Is Incredible. Especially for its Low Ass Price!!</li>
            <li> Soft and excelent for my bronzer!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this brush!!!  So soft and is angled perfectly for contouring!  I have been using it for a week and none of the bristles have fallen out!</li>
            <li> You can actually compare this brush to Sigma or Sedona Lace. It is soft and dense gives you a freat foundation coverage. I also have the flat top of this same brand and although I love that one. This is my favorite to apply foundation with because of its density! Too bad it is out of stock. I will reorder few of them for gifting and backup! WOW!!!!&lt;br /&gt;PS. came within 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> Good brush for the price, but I wish it was at a sharper angle. It&#x27;s slightly angled, not as much as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I saw this brush and decided to purchase. Came in 10 days. I wanted to get better quality brushes and this is definitely it. Its very soft and dense. No shedding thus after 2 or 3 washes. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the paint smell when I first received it. It went away after the first wash. Will definitely purchase from this seller again</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I love this brush. I wish I had ordered two instead. Most likely will buy another. Just wish shipping did not take so long&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given this brush 4 stars but the second time I washed it the shedding commenced. Nice brush but who knows how long it will last with the rate it sheds at!</li>
            <li> STILL GOING STRONG! AS IF IT WAS A REALLY EXPENSIVE BRUSH...I&#x27;M GETTING MORE .AND SEVERAL FOR XMAS GIFTS LOVE IT,JUST KEEP IT CLEAN!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even describe the smell. I had to wash it 3 times before using it and there is still this weird scent to it. I wash the brushes I use for wet makeup daily, and the dry makeup brushes I wash weekly. So since they are all pretty clean I keep them in the same bag once they&#x27;ve dried. This brush has started to make all my other brushes stink. :( That&#x27;s pretty irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you can move past the smell, it&#x27;s a decent brush. It&#x27;s very soft and dense and did not really shed even after washing it so much. I bought this one to use for bronzer and blush because it&#x27;s angled. Not as effective as I thought it would be...the brush is BARELY angled (even less than the picture). I&#x27;m not sure if all of them are made that way, or if mine is defective; But buyer beware.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for applying foundation. It is the perfect density and it does not shed at all. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> First time ever using a foundation brush and lm glad I did.I purchased two for my daughter and my self.It took a long time to arrive but well worth the wait.Totally in love.</li>
            <li> Estimated date was September 28, I got it September 10th! The brush is extremely soft, and I love it so much!! I use it to controur best brush I&#x27;ve used to contour. I&#x27;ll be buying from this buyer again!</li>
            <li> Upon arrival the handle had separated from the brush. I tried to use the brush and it sheds awful. Save your money.</li>
            <li> This is a good heavy duty makeup brush! I use it to apply my blush and it does it perfect because of the angled bristles.  The price was very good for such a  high quality brush.  Also it shipped to me very fast (about a week).  I will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Came fast within a week or two. Very dense and the handle is thick for precise application. I use it for my MAC blushes and my Urban Decay Flushed pallette. Great purchase, would definitely recommend to a friend. :)</li>
            <li> this is an awesome product that comes with a great price!i am totally impress!</li>
            <li> Shipping was SO fast! It was supposed to take a month to get here, but came in only a week! The brush is smaller than I expected (The bristles, not the handle), but that&#x27;s okay. The bristles are super soft, and overall, It&#x27;s amazing quality for only $3! I will be using this with blush.</li>
            <li> OMG I LOVE THIS BRUSH!!!!  I have no idea why there is low ratings because this brush feels like a $20 brush!  The bristles are sooooooo soft! For someone with a sensitive face this brush is perfect. I use this for foundation (liquid and creme) and it doesn&#x27;t soak up any of the foundation. It comes out a smooth, streak free finish and i looove it!    The package seems really sturdy, when i washed it, only one brush hair fell off lol but that&#x27;s nothing.  Also, it smelled weird, like gasoline (???) Idk but it doesn&#x27;t bother me, just dish washer soap and baby shampoo and I&#x27;m good.    This is also a great brush if you&#x27;re just getting into make-up and just trying out application  options, it&#x27;s cheap too!    Will def buy more from this line. :)</li>
            <li> Great price and good quality</li>
