            <li>Overall this is great soap.  </li>
            <li>I originally wrote this about the 4 oz bars and the review</li>
            <li>bar fits in a standard size soap case and is the most cost effective.</li>
            <li>Just looks like a simple soap, but smells so good and feels very fresh.</li>
            <li>larger bars - good price</li>
            <li>The size of this bar, unlike the 4 ounce pansy size, allows use for more than one shower (exaggerating, but not by too much).  </li>
            <li>Zest is a super bath soap, which we&#x27;ve used for years.  </li>
            <li>Zest is a terrific soap that rinses off cleanly and smells nice.</li>
            <li>dial used to be a good soap: large bar and lasted long.</li>
            <li>and it get the grime off very well with leaving the shower stall clean.</li>
            <li>Really you count words!</li>
            <li>It has a good scent but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I made the mistake of getting Coast Soap in my eyes once and almost had to see a doctor; this is much milder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPER.</li>
            <li>And the price was exceptionally reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Buying it in bulk like this really saves money too.  </li>
            <li>(More than half a century).  </li>
            <li>This is a decent soap brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Just buy enough products to make the shipping worth purchase and order ahead of time</li>
            <li>I love Zest soap because it rinses so easily and feels as if there is no soapy residue left behind.  </li>
            <li>I brought a few bars with me, but they got used up pretty quick.</li>
            <li>so I guess I&#x27;ll continue to pay a &#x27;higher&#x27; price for a lesser amount of soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I found the bigger bars on Amazon, they were in the stores for such a short period of time.</li>
            <li>Please allow me to make this clear:  </li>
            <li>its very DRYING&lt;br /&gt;I used it a long time ago and now its dries my skin</li>
            <li>comes in a 4 oz bar, common in most \\&quot;bath sized\\&quot; bars but smaller than I remember bars of soap when I was a younger man.  </li>
            <li>to hold I keep droping it, back to Dove sensitive</li>
            <li>My only complaint with Zest isn&#x27;t unique to that product:  it has to do with the downsizing of consumer products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why they can not widely distribute it, but, I certainly hope this size doesn&#x27;t get &amp;</li>

            <li> I will be buying from this company thru amazon as long as things remain status quo.  </li>
            <li> The most disturbing thing the manufacturer has done over the years is make the bar smaller and smaller, so you have less and less to use.  </li>
            <li> The size is a bit larger than what is typically found in stores.  </li>
            <li> So different from ordinary soap...</li>
            <li> It is sometimes hard to find this soap in the larger bar size and in quantity</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy Zest and will keep whining about small bath bars.  </li>
            <li> Also, it appears to be less caustic when you wash your face around your eyes.  </li>

            <li> I have been through about 6 of these bars, and about halfway though the bar splits, almost in half revealing a dark, unpleasant looking crevice.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, it has decreased in ounces over the years.  </li>
            <li> go for it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unilever now owns it and it is dreadful</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying 20 bars of this soap, fondly remembering the brand from when Proctor and Gamble sold it. Unilever now owns it and it is dreadful Did anyone ever hear of &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34; in soap? Well, I got some. I have been through about 6 of these bars, and about halfway though the bar splits, almost in half revealing a dark, unpleasant looking crevice. I have written the people that sold it 3 times, bit no answer. DO NOT buy this product</li>
            <li> larger bars - good price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using zest soap for many years now so I am very satisfied with the product.  Everything is ok.</li>
            <li> Good Deal ...stocked up!</li>
            <li> My only complaint with Zest isn&#x27;t unique to that product:  it has to do with the downsizing of consumer products so companies don&#x27;t have to raise their prices; they just give us less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zest comes in a 4 oz bar, common in most \\&quot;bath sized\\&quot; bars but smaller than I remember bars of soap when I was a younger man.  The smaller the bar, the easier it is to drop it when it&#x27;s wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get beyond that, Zest has two strong positives:  the scent is pleasant without being overpowering.  It is appropriate for men but I don&#x27;t think women would object to using it as well.  Also, it appears to be less caustic when you wash your face around your eyes.  I made the mistake of getting Coast Soap in my eyes once and almost had to see a doctor; this is much milder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line:  I will continue to buy Zest and will keep whining about small bath bars.  This is a decent soap brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I originally wrote this about the 4 oz bars and the review somehow got applied to the larger 5 oz bars as well.  Please allow me to make this clear:  the 5 oz bars answers all the negatives I had about the smaller bars.  This is finally what I&#x27;ve been looking for and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the larger size.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Rub a dub dub. Received order promptly. In good shape. What can you say about soap. I guess we can take a bath again!!LOL ! Really you count words!</li>
            <li> Zest is and has been a favorite of mine for all my life. (More than half a century).  The most disturbing thing the manufacturer has done over the years is make the bar smaller and smaller, so you have less and less to use.  The size of this bar, unlike the 4 ounce pansy size, allows use for more than one shower (exaggerating, but not by too much).  This 5 ounce bar has a good feel in size and is something I would love to see available everywhere.  I&#x27;m not sure why they can not widely distribute it, but, I certainly hope this size doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; again.</li>
            <li> Cant beat Zest,im a mechanic and it get the grime off very well with leaving the shower stall clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Zest soap since 1961. It cleans the best of any bar soap I&#x27;ve used and has no perfume smell.  The 5 oz. bar fits in a standard size soap case and is the most cost effective.</li>
            <li> Just looks like a simple soap, but smells so good and feels very fresh. So different from ordinary soap... Even after several days of use, fragrance and strength of the soap was almost as good as the day it was unpacked!</li>
            <li> GOOD QUALITY. FAST SHIPPER.</li>
            <li> Zest is a super bath soap, which we&#x27;ve used for years.  And the price was exceptionally reasonable.  Recommended for anyone who loves to be ZEST CLEAN!</li>
            <li> Our family has used Zest soap for the last (about) 25 years.  We used it when the bars were 7 oz..........unfortunately, it has decreased in ounces over the years.  While on vacation a couple of years ago, we ran into the 7oz size again.......and then I found the 5oz  size on amazon, instead of having to purchase the 3oz size,  which the bars are now in the U.S.  I like the smell and the feeling of cleanliness......so I guess I&#x27;ll continue to pay a &#x27;higher&#x27; price for a lesser amount of soap. This would be a 5-star product if only the manufacturers would think about what they are doing to the consumer.</li>
            <li> Yup, in my 35 years on this planet, I can&#x27;t remember a time when I didn&#x27;t use Zest. I&#x27;m in Afghanistan now, and couldn&#x27;t find Zest ANYWHERE. I brought a few bars with me, but they got used up pretty quick. I had my wife send a care package my way, and she stuffed some Zest in the corners. It got all wrapped up, went 12,000 miles, and when I opened the box, the smell was AMAZING. I try to do this when I send stuff home, too. It&#x27;s a tradition that makes everything smell good, and makes the stuff that arrives smell like me, which my wife really appreciates. I&#x27;m glad that I found the bigger bars on Amazon, they were in the stores for such a short period of time. I LOVE ZEST!!</li>
            <li> I love Zest soap.  It&#x27;s as good as advertised.  Buying it in bulk like this really saves money too.  Just buy enough products to make the shipping worth purchase and order ahead of time so you don&#x27;t have to pay shipping</li>
            <li> Great product at reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love Zest soap because it rinses so easily and feels as if there is no soapy residue left behind.  Our store stopped selling Zest, so now I buy it here!  Happy showers!</li>
            <li> they must have change this soap. its very DRYING&lt;br /&gt;I used it a long time ago and now its dries my skin&lt;br /&gt;a leaves it feeling tacky, also the shape is hard for&lt;br /&gt;me to hold I keep droping it, back to Dove sensitive&lt;br /&gt;bar for me.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a soap that is larger than 4 oz. and also doesn&#x27;t disappear before your eyes.  the last product I used was dial. dial used to be a good soap: large bar and lasted long. that is no longer the case.  I was scanning amazon and found zest.  my prayers have been answered, lol.  this is a 5 oz. bar and it lasts and lasts. the price is great, the delivery was prompt.  I hope this deal last forever. I will be buying from this company thru amazon as long as things remain status quo.  go for it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is sometimes hard to find this soap in the larger bar size and in quantity so Amazon is the place to go. Zest is a terrific soap that rinses off cleanly and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Larger bars, great deal AAA+++</li>
            <li> Overall this is great soap.  It has a good scent but not overwhelming.  The size is a bit larger than what is typically found in stores.  A good buy.</li>
            <li> Zest bars are the size that a bath bar should be. They bring back memories of the Zest bath bars in the 70s and 80s before the companies all started downsizing their products in order to hide the price inflation. Great soap bars.</li>
