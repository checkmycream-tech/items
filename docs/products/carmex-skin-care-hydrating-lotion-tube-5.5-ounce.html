            <li>travel sizes as well- perfect for keeping in your pocketbook, and they sell for about 99 cents!  </li>
            <li>It is the best hydrating lotion for the price I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My skin feels awesome.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin hydrated and feeling great!</li>
            <li>Now I learned the best way to use it is after washing hands.</li>
            <li>Still a great moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Very impressed!</li>
            <li>Great hand cream!  </li>
            <li>Excellent lotion and cream.</li>
            <li>I loved the product and now my husband and I both are using it!</li>
            <li>We both swear by the lip balm and were delighted to find that Carmex had lotion products as well!</li>
            <li>Another great carmex product.</li>
            <li>These great lotions come in 1 oz.</li>
            <li>This is a great product:  not greasy or slimy..  </li>
            <li>I bought this lotion thinking it would be great because the Carmex lip balm works great on my chapped lips in winter, but the lotion is making me rethink Carmex products.</li>
            <li>great product.  </li>
            <li>great price too.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and was so glad to find that I could purchase it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>The scents are quite pleasant and the scent lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>The after odor is pleasant.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know Carmex made lotion, I saw this and needed a really good hand lotion</li>
            <li>And when I wash it off, my skin still feels good.</li>
            <li>&quot; If you are someone who dislikes to feel \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; or \\&quot;oily\\&quot; after using a hand or body lotion, this product would be a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good product to use in the office.</li>
            <li>Both are good.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>It has a light and very pleasant scent, but it&#x27;s not perfumey.  </li>
            <li>Best right ever had.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff...smells like donuts!! :)</li>
            <li>can cream is absolutely awesome thank you very much</li>
            <li>I happen to love it!   </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Nice lotion.</li>
            <li>Nice smell too.</li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t greasy and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is by far, one of the best skin lotions that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy it despite all the parabens in the ingredients because my friend said it&#x27;s the best cream to take care of cracked skin on hands compared to all the natural and organic creams.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>This is top of the line.</li>
            <li>Neither the lotion nor the cream is greasy, and they both absorb nicely into the skin leaving it feeling soft and smelling great.</li>
            <li>I was sent these lotions to review on my blog Because Cheaper is Better.</li>
            <li>I love putting it all over after I shower before bed.</li>
            <li>This is an interesting and worthwhile</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Carmex&#x27;s lip products, so when I saw that they make lotion as well, I immediately purchased a tube.</li>
            <li>Many customers claimed it took weeks for their rashes to go away...</li>
            <li>Now I think it is OK.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I got this lotion on clearance at Target yesterday because I love Carmex lip stuff.</li>
            <li>There are so many lotions out there that claim they are &amp;#34;Non Greasy&amp;#34; but I still have to rub excess lotion onto my arms every time I use them.</li>
            <li>one of my favorite hand cream</li>
            <li>Have bought some for my friends at work since they used mine :)</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Just as I get it rubbed on, it feels like it disappears, but not like I need to use more to get a moisturized effect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it to be very effective, and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>The great thing about it is that it smells like Carmex lip balm, that really recognizable sweet and powdery scent.</li>
            <li>This is ok but the original ointment in 4oz jar found at walgreens is the better buy..</li>
            <li>My skin was hydrated and smooth, but then after about a week, I broke out with hives over both of my arms and the top of my hands.</li>
            <li>I have been a great fan of Carmex Lip Balm for several years and am so glad to find that Carmex also has body lotion.</li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>This Carmex lotion just absorbed into my skin immediately!</li>
            <li>Product is great for winter dry hands.  </li>
            <li>Carmex is a quality company who never lost their standard of making good products over the years.</li>
            <li>(Plus the bright yellow Carmex packageing makes me happy and can always be found among other items)</li>
            <li>Better than gold bond triple action because it dries smooth and with no sticky feel.</li>
            <li>Item came quickly and the product helps with dryness without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>have to use a lot of product to get adequate coverage and to feel moisturized.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly into hands and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on like a normal moisturizing lotion, perhaps a bit thicker or creamier than most.</li>
            <li>I love them both as they are soothing,feel refreshing and non greasy on surface skin,and help my very dry and often washed hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not greasy, which is nice if you&#x27;re going to be typing or using a touchscreen phone.</li>
            <li>It is thick, goes on smoothly, and moisturizes very well with a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like scents this may not be the right choice for you.  </li>
            <li>This knocks my Aveda right off the counter and into a drawer.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and healthy as soon as I apply it, even in the dry winter conditions that we have in Ohio.</li>
            <li>This lotion is a great everyday lotion!</li>
            <li>Has a mild and sweet fragrance that is like a new car or a leather smell.  </li>
            <li>I love how this product goes on and in seconds is absorbed, leaving only a velvet finish and no greasy aftermath.  </li>
            <li>It made my hands feel so soft and smooth, with no greasy feel to it at all.</li>
            <li>Too much fragrance!</li>
            <li>- Once absorbed my skin is super soft and so well moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I bought this on the recommendation of a friend for a whole body eczema outbreak, but it doesn&#x27;t seem any better for controlling the incessant itch any more than any other generic lotion you can purchase at the store.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mean to say that the lotion has an objectionable odor, in fact I find it pleasant and recessive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very</li>
            <li>ABSORBING -</li>
            <li>To me this lotion has the soft vinyl smell of a fresh Barbie Doll just removed from her box.</li>
            <li>This lotion contains aloe and vitamin E, and works very well.  </li>
            <li>This absorbs quickly--almost too much so.</li>
            <li>I have really dry skin, and for the first week I used this on my arms, it worked fantastic.</li>
            <li>Has vitamin E and many other ingredients which seems to make it all come together and work.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave the greasy slime on my hands that other lotions do, it has a light fresh scent with just a hint of the original Carmex, and keeps my dry hands and knuckles moisturized.</li>
            <li>If you want a product to rescue your dry skin without greasiness or strong flowery smells, I highly recommend trying this lotion from Carmex.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Three prescriptions later (2 ointments and something to calm my nerves)</li>
            <li>This one feels more watery,and stays wet longer on skin,but I still really like them both and use them together on different parts of my body.</li>
            <li>I keep it in my truck (concrete mixer) and use it all day.</li>
            <li>Just when you think you need to wipe your fingers on a towel to remove the greasy residue you realize that the lotion has been completely absorbed into the skin and all that is left is a velvety feel.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the scent.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, just like the lip balm but not quite so heavy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only available online from those two stores in my big city.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to scents and have no problems with this.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are identical, so it appears that it&#x27;s just a new name for the old product.</li>
            <li>The lotion is quick absorbing, I mean fast.  </li>
            <li>I end up with dry cracked hands all the time, this lotion has saved my hands, it&#x27;s very strong, just like the lip balm, I wouldn&#x27;t say to use it a lot, or use a lot at once, a little bit will do the trick.</li>
            <li>I have been a Carmex lip treatment user for several years, recently saw this, and decided to give it a try with winter right around the corner.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, especially my feet, and this has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>My skin stays moisturized all day and my hands don&#x27;t dry out as fast even after a hand washing.</li>
            <li>The only big downside is that the smell is too intense.</li>
            <li>I keep a tight budget and don&#x27;t buy common items online, and this product isn&#x27;t worth the hassle to purchase it only online when there are better options on the local shelves.</li>
            <li>Goes on a bit hard and drys quick while rubbing on.</li>
            <li>It started as a small rash on my right leg, then left leg, my arms, spreading up my thighs, and up my elbows.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had tried this Carmex lotion as a trial size with another product.  I love it unfortunately at the drugstores here they do not carry it.</li>
            <li> I end up with dry cracked hands all the time, this lotion has saved my hands, it&#x27;s very strong, just like the lip balm, I wouldn&#x27;t say to use it a lot, or use a lot at once, a little bit will do the trick.</li>
            <li> This is top of the line. Better than gold bond triple action because it dries smooth and with no sticky feel. Has a mild and sweet fragrance that is like a new car or a leather smell.  Has vitamin E and many other ingredients which seems to make it all come together and work.  DG has it and that is where I bought it.[[ASIN:B0041YMUMM Carmex Healing Cream - For Your Driest, Rough Skin, 4.0 Oz]] Another great carmex product.</li>
            <li> I was sent [[ASIN:B0041YMUMM CARMEX HEALING CREAM - for your driest, rough skin, 4.0 oz]] and [[ASIN:B0043CKN3U Carmex Healing Lotion, Aloe+ Vitamin E. 5.5 Oz]] to try out and I&#x27;m hooked! I use the healing lotion every day as part of my morning routine. On really cold days or in very dry areas, I apply some healing cream (which is a bit thicker) before bed. Neither the lotion nor the cream is greasy, and they both absorb nicely into the skin leaving it feeling soft and smelling great. The scents are quite pleasant and the scent lasts for hours.If you don&#x27;t like scents this may not be the right choice for you.  I happen to love it!   These great lotions come in 1 oz. travel sizes as well- perfect for keeping in your pocketbook, and they sell for about 99 cents!  My husband loves them too and I&#x27;ve caught him using it quite a few times.  I was sent these lotions to review on my blog Because Cheaper is Better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know Carmex made lotion, I saw this and needed a really good hand lotion so I decided to give this a try.  It&#x27;s very good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THICK - The lotion is very thick, if you put a a squirt in your hand and turn your hand upside down, the lotion doesn&#x27;t move!&lt;br /&gt;FAST ABSORBING - The lotion is quick absorbing, I mean fast.  Like one of the other reviewers said, when you are rubbing this lotion in, you think you&#x27;re going to have to wipe some off - but all of a sudden it&#x27;s all absorbed!&lt;br /&gt;HYDRATING - Once absorbed my skin is super soft and so well moisturized.  My skin actually glows.&lt;br /&gt;NOT GREASY - For such a thick lotion, it&#x27;s not greasy at all!&lt;br /&gt;LONG LASTING - My skin stays moisturized all day and my hands don&#x27;t dry out as fast even after a hand washing.</li>
            <li> Goes on a bit hard and drys quick while rubbing on. You need to use quite a bit to cover arms and hands.  It Can be pricey at $8.99 a tube.</li>
            <li> Ahhh, the smell! This is my go to lotion during the winter. This knocks my Aveda right off the counter and into a drawer.</li>
            <li> This was on sale at my local drugstore or I probably never would have given it a try. It is the best hydrating lotion for the price I have ever used. I love putting it all over after I shower before bed. You can tell it stays with you, but not in a bad way. My skin feels awesome. I have very dry skin, especially my feet, and this has helped tremendously. I can&#x27;t get over how my skin feels after using this hydrating lotion. I can feel and see the difference. And when I wash it off, my skin still feels good.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both suffer from dry hands this time of year. A friend had some of the Carmex Lotion at work and I tried some. It made my hands feel so soft and smooth, with no greasy feel to it at all. I loved the product and now my husband and I both are using it! We both swear by the lip balm and were delighted to find that Carmex had lotion products as well!</li>
            <li> This is an interesting and worthwhile product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on like a normal moisturizing lotion, perhaps a bit thicker or creamier than most. Just when you think you need to wipe your fingers on a towel to remove the greasy residue you realize that the lotion has been completely absorbed into the skin and all that is left is a velvety feel. Carmex describes this as a \\&quot;...patent pending process that delivers healing and moisturization without a greasy feel.\\&quot; If you are someone who dislikes to feel \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; or \\&quot;oily\\&quot; after using a hand or body lotion, this product would be a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like a strongly scented product redolent of tropical flowers or fruits, you will be disappointed. To me this lotion has the soft vinyl smell of a fresh Barbie Doll just removed from her box. (Involuntary memories: Proust had madeleines, I have Barbie). I don&#x27;t mean to say that the lotion has an objectionable odor, in fact I find it pleasant and recessive. Just like the lotion itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product to use in the office. You will not get grease marks on your computer keyboard or monitor and no eye stinging gardenia passion aroma will waft over a cubicle wall to make an office mate sneeze.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion. Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. Nice smell too. Not too strong. Relieves dry skin for hours. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, and for the first week I used this on my arms, it worked fantastic. My skin was hydrated and smooth, but then after about a week, I broke out with hives over both of my arms and the top of my hands. It made me very sad because I really liked it up until then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I suggest to try a little before using it completely.</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition called psoriasis. This lotion has been so helpful, my skin is clearing up.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this lotion to anyone. When you apply it there is no sticking in there is no residue after you put it on. undies now or feeling after you put it on. Best right ever had.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a great everyday lotion! It is thick, goes on smoothly, and moisturizes very well with a light, pleasant scent. The price is also fantastic (approximately $4 at CVS). It keeps my skin hydrated and feeling great!</li>
            <li> I use this on clogged pores and skin tags - don&#x27;t know why but it clears them up. It&#x27;s also  impossible to find in the store.</li>
            <li> I love how this product goes on and in seconds is absorbed, leaving only a velvet finish and no greasy aftermath.  I am very sensitive to scents and have no problems with this.  I wish it came in a much larger container so I could have it stay on my vanity!</li>
            <li> Item came quickly and the product helps with dryness without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Around the 10th of June, I purchased this lotion at my local Walgreens.  Today, June 26, 2014, I spent 2 1/2  hours in the doctor&#x27;s office, to find out WHY my legs and my arms breaking out.  I have racked my brain trying to figure out &amp;#34;where I had been&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;what could have bit me&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;did I eat or drink anything different.  It started as a small rash on my right leg, then left leg, my arms, spreading up my thighs, and up my elbows.  The doctor is as confused as I, but sent me to the lab for blood work. Three prescriptions later (2 ointments and something to calm my nerves) I came home and went through everything in my house.  Guess what?  I READ THE CARMAX LABEL.  My husband and I both use the lip balm, but now---- I had chicken pox at age 7 and now I&#x27;m 67.  I IMAGINE HOW I FEEL!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Carmex&#x27;s lip products, so when I saw that they make lotion as well, I immediately purchased a tube. Sometimes I wear shorts to work, so I was only putting the Carmex lotion on my legs from the knee caps down to my feet. I also wear scented lotion, but to be considerate to my co-workers, I only wear the scented lotion on my arms. A day or two later, and about an hour after I put the lotion on, my skin started to itch badly. Dozens of small flesh-colored bumps started appearing on my legs. I brushed it off thinking that I might have been bitten by the mosquitoes that had been floating around. I misplaced my scented lotion and so I started using the Carmex lotion on my arms. Imagine my horror to see that the same flesh colored bumps on my legs were now on my arms. It took me almost two weeks to realize that there is something in this lotion that doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin. I tossed the lotion out, which pained me to do, and now I have to wait until my skin clears up. I&#x27;m highly disappointed with this lotion. I plan to continue buying their lip products though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s winter and my skin knows it.  Having Carmex at every work place/sitting space in my home and at work has ameliorated my dry skin.  This is a great product:  not greasy or slimy..  The after odor is pleasant.</li>
            <li> This is by far, one of the best skin lotions that I have ever used. My skin feels smooth and healthy as soon as I apply it, even in the dry winter conditions that we have in Ohio.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I NEVER have allergic reactions to ANYTHING. For the first time in my life I have broken out in a terrible, itchy, painful rash all over my arms and legs, and after doing a search online I have discovered the culprit: Carmex Healing Lotion! I bought this lotion thinking it would be great because the Carmex lip balm works great on my chapped lips in winter, but the lotion is making me rethink Carmex products. My search online found multiple reviews and comments from other customers who, like me, broke out in a rash after using this lotion. Many customers claimed it took weeks for their rashes to go away... I am praying mine goes away sooner than that! Just be warned and use with caution!</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product two years ago I hated it. Now I think it is OK. The products&#x27; selling point is the microemulsification of the lotion, and that&#x27;s what I hated about it at first. Now I learned the best way to use it is after washing hands. Rub it in well and then skin feels &amp;#34;velvety&amp;#34; and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to use a lot of product to get adequate coverage and to feel moisturized. The barrier of the lotion lasts for a long time. It really isn&#x27;t greasy and it smells wonderful. It in no way smells like Carmex lip balm to me, and if it did I&#x27;d gag. I&#x27;ve been using Carmex lip products for over a decade now and never cared for the scent lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all honesty, it is overpriced and difficult to find. I decided to use this as my winter lotion but it&#x27;s no where to be found. I have coupons for it and tried to buy it from Walmart and Target here. It&#x27;s only available online from those two stores in my big city. I keep a tight budget and don&#x27;t buy common items online, and this product isn&#x27;t worth the hassle to purchase it only online when there are better options on the local shelves. If you don&#x27;t care about all that, you might like to try it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as well as Carmex healing Cream,which is thicker. I love them both as they are soothing,feel refreshing and non greasy on surface skin,and help my very dry and often washed hands. (Plus the bright yellow Carmex packageing makes me happy and can always be found among other items) I give this lotion four stars,and the thicker Healing Cream style one five stars. Both are good.This one feels more watery,and stays wet longer on skin,but I still really like them both and use them together on different parts of my body.I judgewhich to put where based on level  of dryness,for example-hands always get Cream.Legs and upper arms get this Lotion.I love the smell.It reminds me of a lighter version of the lip balm,but barely there and nostalgic for me.I used carmex lip pot balm as a child and teenaged girl. (I am Kevins girlfriend,we share this acct.) Four stars well deserved. For drier skin,go buy Carmex cream instead.Carmex is a quality company who never lost their standard of making good products over the years.</li>
            <li> This cream helps with my cracked hands and feet a lot. It&#x27;s very light and non-greasy. I decided to buy it despite all the parabens in the ingredients because my friend said it&#x27;s the best cream to take care of cracked skin on hands compared to all the natural and organic creams. Well it does the job. The only big downside is that the smell is too intense. Too much fragrance!</li>
            <li> can cream is absolutely awesome thank you very much</li>
            <li> I got this lotion on clearance at Target yesterday because I love Carmex lip stuff. There are so many lotions out there that claim they are &amp;#34;Non Greasy&amp;#34; but I still have to rub excess lotion onto my arms every time I use them. This Carmex lotion just absorbed into my skin immediately! Even in the rough Minnesota winter, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel itchy or dry. The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the scent. It seems to smell differently on my skin than it did in the bottle. Still a great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> one of my favorite hand cream</li>
            <li> This lotion contains aloe and vitamin E, and works very well.  It has a light and very pleasant scent, but it&#x27;s not perfumey.  It doesn&#x27;t say \\&quot;hypo-allergenic\\&quot; but I have problem skin and I can use this lotion with no problems.  I&#x27;ve found it to be very effective, and highly recommend it.  My previous tube, which I purchased locally, was labeled as \\&quot;Carmex Healing Lotion\\&quot; (2010 copyright date), while this one is labeled \\&quot;Carmex Everyday Hydrating Lotion\\&quot; (2012 copyright date).  The ingredients are identical, so it appears that it&#x27;s just a new name for the old product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...smells like donuts!! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a friend for a whole body eczema outbreak, but it doesn&#x27;t seem any better for controlling the incessant itch any more than any other generic lotion you can purchase at the store.</li>
            <li> Product is great for winter dry hands.  I recommend it! Have bought some for my friends at work since they used mine :)</li>
            <li> great product.  does what it says it will.  not greasy at all.  great price too.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Love the smell, just like the lip balm but not quite so heavy.  The cream is thick and soaks in without being oily.</li>
            <li> I have been a Carmex lip treatment user for several years, recently saw this, and decided to give it a try with winter right around the corner. Very impressed! It does not leave the greasy slime on my hands that other lotions do, it has a light fresh scent with just a hint of the original Carmex, and keeps my dry hands and knuckles moisturized. If you want a product to rescue your dry skin without greasiness or strong flowery smells, I highly recommend trying this lotion from Carmex.</li>
            <li> This absorbs quickly--almost too much so. Just as I get it rubbed on, it feels like it disappears, but not like I need to use more to get a moisturized effect. It&#x27;s definitely not greasy, which is nice if you&#x27;re going to be typing or using a touchscreen phone. The great thing about it is that it smells like Carmex lip balm, that really recognizable sweet and powdery scent.</li>
            <li> Great hand cream!  Absorbs quickly into hands and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but I use it every day.  I keep it in my truck (concrete mixer) and use it all day.</li>
            <li> This is ok but the original ointment in 4oz jar found at walgreens is the better buy..The carmex line is hard to beat</li>
            <li> I have been a great fan of Carmex Lip Balm for several years and am so glad to find that Carmex also has body lotion. This is an excellent product and was so glad to find that I could purchase it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion and cream. It helps skin healing skin allergies and hydration. I used it on hands, arms , feet, etc. I loved it.</li>
