            <li>Smells nice but strong.</li>
            <li>What more do you need in a conditioner.</li>
            <li>I like it ok.</li>
            <li>and I used it for co-washes mostly</li>
            <li>Glad that I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>The scent is too strong unlike the garlic shampoo this smelled better, but the smell was too strong</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is not too strong and goes away quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>I wish I had more success with this product like others did.  </li>
            <li>and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Really fast delivery and just what I wanted!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about this product.</li>
            <li>But this stuff is quite the opposite and very strongly scented.</li>
            <li>This product does great if you are combating excessive shedding and breakage.</li>
            <li>After my first use the breakage and shedding was reduced about 90%.</li>
            <li>But it did an ok job as a basic conditioner</li>
            <li>It really does the job.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, is affordable and duh, it goes with Garlic Shampoo.  </li>

            <li>I love this product and am a regular user not only for myself but my five Shih Tzu animals.  </li>
            <li>I have only seen 4 hair  strands and been finger combing for the whole day and have not seen a single strand and before it was more than 20 strands.</li>
            <li>Natural gals, buy it you wont be dissapointed, Permed gals, buy it you wont regret it!!</li>
            <li>So, I just crushed REAL garlic and mixed it in with my own conditioner/oil for deep conditioning.  </li>
            <li>It also makes it very soft</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been about a month of me using it consistently</li>
            <li>even though the shampoo sucked this conditioner made my hair feel soooo soft as soon as you put it on</li>
            <li>u feel how soft it&#x27;s making your hair</li>
            <li>I have natural coily/kinky 4a hair that tangles and sheds</li>
            <li>I do notice a slight improvement in my hair thickness, so it was worth the money.</li>

            <li> Not a garlic smell but definitely scented, which is unpleasant to me but, not nearly as strong as garlic.</li>
            <li> Has decreased the shedding and provided me with bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and my level of breakage and shedding had drastically decreased</li>
            <li> Made my hair extremely bad, no good will never buy again.</li>

            <li> Very good.  Smells good, is affordable and duh, it goes with Garlic Shampoo.  What more do you need in a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am an African American women who is a hair product junkie and never do reviews, but always read them before I buy a product. My shampoo and conditioner came in two days ago from Cosmetic Solutions. I am overseas, the product arrived in about a week, AWESOME! My hair has been shedding and breaking for about three years due to chemical treatments and God only knows what elese. After my first use the breakage and shedding was reduced about 90%. The second day, I cowashed with it, breakage was totally gone, NO HAIRS IN THE WIDE TOOTH COMB OR THE FLOOR. I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING Apohgee protein, nexus emergencee, you name it, this is the only stuff that has worked for me. It is inexpensive, smells great, has WONDERFUL slip and has become my new staple conditioner. The shampoo is okay, but the conditioner is SUPERB. Natural gals, buy it you wont be dissapointed, Permed gals, buy it you wont regret it!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for Unscented Shampoo and Conditioner because of asthma and COPD But this stuff is quite the opposite and very strongly scented. Smells nice but strong. I understand its unscented garlic but the discription lead me to believe the products were totally unscented.    Nutrine Garlic Conditioner Unscented 16 oz.   Nutrine Garlic Shampoo Unscented 16 oz.</li>
            <li> even though the shampoo sucked this conditioner made my hair feel soooo soft as soon as you put it on u feel how soft it&#x27;s making your hair</li>
            <li> I like it ok. But I&#x27;m still searching. I have natural coily/kinky 4a hair that tangles and sheds and I was hoping this conditioner would solve those problems. It didn&#x27;t lol. But it did an ok job as a basic conditioner and I used it for co-washes mostly but it compares to $1 conditioners like suave and V05 which I also like but wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to order.</li>
            <li> Made my hair extremely bad, no good will never buy again.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> Even using this conditioner, when used with the shampoo, it dries out my hair and leaves a feeling comparable to washing your hands with dish detergent. It is not unscented, but smells like..baby powder? I do notice a slight improvement in my hair thickness, so it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Helps stop my hair from shedding</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about this product. I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month now and I still don&#x27;t see any change in my shedding. So I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing this one again. The smell isn&#x27;t horrific, but it isn&#x27;t very pleasant either.</li>
            <li> Used with Eqyss Rebuilder and Groganics Deep Freeze Shampoo and the heavy shedding stopped. I have only seen 4 hair  strands and been finger combing for the whole day and have not seen a single strand and before it was more than 20 strands.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel extra soft. Has decreased the shedding and provided me with bouncy curls. Happy girl!!!!</li>
            <li> Really fast delivery and just what I wanted!! Thank you for making great products like this  this affordable and for such superior service!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried several products and the Nutrine brand really makes my hair and head feel clean. I really believe the Nutrine products have helped slow my hair loss.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get over the pink neon color of the conditioner.  So, I just crushed REAL garlic and mixed it in with my own conditioner/oil for deep conditioning.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff it has stopped my shedding 90%. Before useing I would sheed alot after useing I only see about 2-3 hairs daily.</li>
            <li> The scent is too strong unlike the garlic shampoo this smelled better, but the smell was too strong I would not purchase this ever again</li>
            <li> Seems to work great but, there is a scent.  Not a garlic smell but definitely scented, which is unpleasant to me but, not nearly as strong as garlic.</li>
            <li> I wish I had more success with this product like others did.  this product left my hair dry and brittle after using it. Also it did not stop the shedding of my hair.</li>
            <li> This product does great if you are combating excessive shedding and breakage. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and my level of breakage and shedding had drastically decreased</li>
            <li> I love this product,  I is a good price and I would recommend it to other people to use.  I have noticed that the shedding of my hair has lessened and there is a fullness in my hair.  It also makes it very soft</li>
            <li> I love this product and am a regular user not only for myself but my five Shih Tzu animals.  I smells great and there is no smell of garlic ever in his product or it&#x27;s shampoo.  I recommend this to anyone.  It really does the job.  It WORKS.  I keep coming BACK!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> used this when my hair was shedding bad.&lt;br /&gt;it worked, it took time though.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not too strong and goes away quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fast ship.&lt;br /&gt;arrived in great condition</li>
            <li> doesnt do nothing to help your hair, in fact it has ingredients that will damage your hair.  Stay away from this product. its a ripoff</li>
            <li> My order shipped to me very quickly! I was impressed with the timing. I am using this product to stop my hair from shedding. It&#x27;s only been about a month of me using it consistently and so far so good.</li>
            <li> This stuff does not stink . . . and it feels so good on the hair. Glad that I made this purchase.</li>
