            <li>I would rather pay more and get better results.  </li>

            <li>No residue and easy on and off application.</li>
            <li>this remover does the trick easily and well.</li>
            <li>So good for sensitive skin..</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>It washed off cleanly but did not remove my mascara or eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It is probably more natural than most</li>
            <li>It gets the job done but more importantly, is gentle on my eyes.</li>
            <li>This is the most gentle and thorough product I have tried.</li>
            <li>This is the best eye make-up remover I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 7-8 years!</li>
            <li>I like it because it removes my eye makeup very easily and complete.  </li>
            <li>It may be a bit pricey, but its worth it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super, super sensitive.</li>
            <li>This is a great eye makeup remove for preserving the delicate skin under your eyes.  </li>
            <li>The only downside to it is that with waterproof makeup - it take a bit more effort to get the makeup off with this product.</li>
            <li>actually found your price cheaper! :)</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s gentle!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, doesn&#x27;t bother your eyes and really does take off all kinds of mascara, eyeliner and shadow.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to rub my eyes too much.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I was surprised because the Dermalogica products I&#x27;ve used have been much higher quality than this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, I really do love several other Dermalogica products.</li>
            <li>last a very log time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning to my old brand (Clinique) or will try something else.  </li>
            <li>My eyes are extremely sensitive and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that does not irritate them.  </li>
            <li>The product is a thick gel-like consistency, messy to use, and it didn&#x27;t get my mascara off effectively - it ended up all over my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from dry eye syndrome and extremely sensitive.  </li>

            <li> Eventhough it is more expensive, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other removers but have always come back to this one.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin either.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other cheaper eye makeup removers but found that they leave me with racoon eyes and find myself really having to rub hard without the results I get with Dermalogica.  </li>
            <li> took a little bit to get used to the gel texture but overall</li>
            <li> Wish that it was liquid instead of gel that kind of hard to use and inconvenient, I wouldn&#x27;t recomend this product to esthitician.</li>
            <li> One thing I dislike about other eye makeup removers is that they are oily!  </li>
            <li> It has not promoted thicker/longer/more lashes; if anything, I&#x27;ve lost some due to excessive rubbing to get off my eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for approximately 4 years.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried every brand expensive abd inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed  </li>

            <li> A tad greasy feeling..but totally works</li>
            <li> The product is a thick gel-like consistency, messy to use, and it didn&#x27;t get my mascara off effectively - it ended up all over my cheeks.  I was surprised because the Dermalogica products I&#x27;ve used have been much higher quality than this one. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> its ok doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes but wont buy again. I need something to get my waterproof eye makeup off with</li>
            <li> Love this product. Removes eye make up wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes or skin at all and I&#x27;m super, super sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have been using dermalogica products now for about a year and I will say that the soothing eye makeup remover is the best Ive ever used.  It may be a bit pricey, but its worth it.  I tried a different brand and it stung my eyes and left my eyes and area around my eyes greasy. Yuk!  Dermalogica&#x27;s brand doesn&#x27;t sting, burn or irritate your eyes at all and it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin either.  To me its the perfect eye makeup remover. I would recommend it to everybody.</li>
            <li> The only eye make-up remover I will use.  No residue and easy on and off application.</li>
            <li> Disappointed  it didn&#x27;t remove waterproof mascara as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get off all mascara and eye shadow, and it&#x27;s not waterproof makeup that I&#x27;m trying to remove.  It simply smudges my eye makeup around.  In addition to removing eye makeup, I initially got it because I heard that it can help make my eyelashes thicker/longer/encourage growth.  It has not promoted thicker/longer/more lashes; if anything, I&#x27;ve lost some due to excessive rubbing to get off my eye makeup.  I&#x27;m returning to my old brand (Clinique) or will try something else.  It&#x27;s a shame, I really do love several other Dermalogica products.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye make-up remover I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 7-8 years! It&#x27;s gentle, doesn&#x27;t bother your eyes and really does take off all kinds of mascara, eyeliner and shadow.</li>
            <li> So good for sensitive skin..my hubby will not use anything else</li>
            <li> This is a great eye makeup remove for preserving the delicate skin under your eyes.  I use it every time I wear eye makeup.  The only downside to it is that with waterproof makeup - it take a bit more effort to get the makeup off with this product.</li>
            <li> It did not remove my eye make up. It washed off cleanly but did not remove my mascara or eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Gets eye makeup off better than anything I have ever tried before.  I have tried them all!  This is not greasy and is very effective at getting eye makeup off.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for approximately 4 years.  My eyes are extremely sensitive and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that does not irritate them.  I cannot use waterproof mascara so I can only comment on what I do use and this remover does the trick easily and well.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Ive tried every brand expensive abd inexpensive.  I suffer from dry eye syndrome and extremely sensitive.  I hope this amazing product will never go off market</li>

            <li> My wife loves this product it works great</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for sometime now.  I like it because it removes my eye makeup very easily and complete.  It does not leave my eyes with smudges so I don&#x27;t have to rub my eyes too much.  It works great!  I have tried other cheaper eye makeup removers but found that they leave me with racoon eyes and find myself really having to rub hard without the results I get with Dermalogica.  I would rather pay more and get better results.  Eventhough it is more expensive, a little goes a long way.  Worth it!</li>
            <li> Removes all my eyeliner, eyeshadow and mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it for the makeup that falls under my eye when I am applying.</li>
            <li> Product very nice for my allergic eyes.</li>
            <li> last a very log time!</li>
            <li> This is the most gentle and thorough product I have tried. It seems to make my lashes healthier too.  I have been using this for years and bummed that 2 local beauty supply stores are out of business.&lt;br /&gt;But actually found your price cheaper! :)</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s gentle!  One thing I dislike about other eye makeup removers is that they are oily!  This one is NOT.  You don&#x27;t need a lot and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Great product. Used it for years.</li>
            <li> I love Dermalogica products but I am not that impressed with this eye make-up remover. It is probably more natural than most but it doesn&#x27;t really take off the heavy mascara.</li>
