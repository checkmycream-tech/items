            <li>First review of this product even though I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>but it is the only product that keeps my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>The first I purchased at my hairdressers for twice the price.</li>

            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I put this product on my shoulder length straight hair before blow drying and straight ironing.  </li>
            <li>and I get such a smooth and shiny finish.  </li>
            <li>is that it helps to really hold the style.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>This is my second container of Shine and Smooth.  </li>
            <li>I especially like to put it on the ends of my ponytail to make it smooth without having to use a straightening iron.</li>
            <li>This blocked put humidity better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Only need to use a very little bit for great effect.</li>
            <li>and wow it really works!</li>
            <li>This particular product makes combing my hair out after a shower a breeze.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of different shine and smooth products in the past and this one is one of my top favorites.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super shiny, soft, and completely frizz free without killing my natural loose curls.</li>
            <li>A very small amount of Enjoy Shine and Smooth rubbed between my palms and applied throughout the hair</li>
            <li>I have medium length, normal dyed hair.)  </li>
            <li>Good, not great product.</li>
            <li>I live near the beach in NJ and it gets very humid in the summer.</li>
            <li>If you have fairly thick Japanese hair and live in a hot dry climate, this works great.  </li>
            <li>and I live in Texas</li>
            <li>I like mixing it with the enjoy texture cream because it makes it less sticky.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair with lots of little fly-aways.  </li>
            <li>My hair has natural wave and tends to frizz.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiney and soft.</li>
            <li>It makes the curls soft.  </li>
            <li>and I use this prior to using my straight iron.</li>
            <li>but my hair definitely does not tangle as much now that I put this product in it.</li>
            <li>I recomend this if you want a natural look but want to protect your hair before applying heat.</li>
            <li>This product helps my hair to smooth out my hair and gives it lots of shine for a few days.</li>
            <li>Not heavy.</li>
            <li>If it tips over at all, it will pour completely out and there will be oily product everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I like the product and the professional way the company delivered it on tome</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super silky and shiny and yet not weighed down.</li>
            <li>Of all the smoothing, anti-frizz serums this one wins, hands down.</li>
            <li>Enjoy is hard to find anymore</li>
            <li>Okay, not great.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair</li>

            <li> It leaves my hair super shiny, soft, and completely frizz free without killing my natural loose curls.</li>
            <li> A very small amount of Enjoy Shine and Smooth rubbed between my palms and applied throughout the hair</li>
            <li> I have medium length, normal dyed hair.)  </li>
            <li> Good, not great product.</li>
            <li> I live near the beach in NJ and it gets very humid in the summer.</li>
            <li> If you have fairly thick Japanese hair and live in a hot dry climate, this works great.  </li>
            <li> and I live in Texas</li>
            <li> I like mixing it with the enjoy texture cream because it makes it less sticky.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair with lots of little fly-aways.  </li>
            <li> My hair has natural wave and tends to frizz.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiney and soft.</li>
            <li> It makes the curls soft.  </li>
            <li> and I use this prior to using my straight iron.</li>
            <li> but my hair definitely does not tangle as much now that I put this product in it.</li>
            <li> I recomend this if you want a natural look but want to protect your hair before applying heat.</li>
            <li> This product helps my hair to smooth out my hair and gives it lots of shine for a few days.</li>
            <li> Not heavy.</li>
            <li> If it tips over at all, it will pour completely out and there will be oily product everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I like the product and the professional way the company delivered it on tome</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super silky and shiny and yet not weighed down.</li>
            <li> Of all the smoothing, anti-frizz serums this one wins, hands down.</li>
            <li> Enjoy is hard to find anymore</li>
            <li> Okay, not great.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair</li>
            <li> so the humidity is ferocious and this really helps tame it.  </li>
            <li> I have really short hair with longer bangs that I flat iron every day.</li>
            <li> Last a long time too.  </li>
            <li> As long as this product is being sold I will buy it.  </li>
            <li> It puts a thin coat over your hair to help prevent damage from your hot blow-dryer.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to over do it.  </li>
            <li> Put this on while your hair is still wet.  </li>
            <li> While it does give some shine, the shine is minimal without getting greasy looking.</li>
            <li> I put it in when my hair&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> One major negative is the skinny bottle style.</li>
            <li> Works as expected wife just loves it!</li>
            <li> I can put it on wet hair before styling or apply it to dry hair to tame frizzies.</li>
            <li> I have highlighted blonde hair and have had a hard time finding something that worked.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, kinky/curly hair.</li>
            <li> smooths me down and reduces the frizz without eliminating all the wave or making me look greasy.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down;</li>
            <li> Works well at eliminating frizz with out weighing down your hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick damaged hair.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down or make it sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li> I use the creamy pomade and a little shine/smooth to create a shine that want stop.  </li>

            <li> My hair is very thick and about waist length and this bottle will last a few months for me.</li>
            <li> So thick its hard to double wind a pony tail holder.</li>
            <li> You might have to brush your hair again a few min.</li>
            <li> I blow-dry and curl my hair everyday and this product keep the damage to a minimum.  </li>
            <li> A nickel size works and stays around in my hair for a few days.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I&#x27;ll reapply it at night before bed to keep my hair from getting too messy overnight</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product, I Will Buy Again</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Sealed good.</li>
            <li> My hair has natural wave and tends to frizz. A very small amount of Enjoy Shine and Smooth rubbed between my palms and applied throughout the hair smooths me down and reduces the frizz without eliminating all the wave or making me look greasy. Love the scent. Great product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  As long as this product is being sold I will buy it.  It leaves my hair shiney and soft.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this hair product.  I use it to tame my seriously curly hair.  It makes the curls soft.  I recently moved to Washington State from California.  I have not been able to find this product near me.  I&#x27;m glad amazon carries it.  The product is great, lasts a long time and the packaging protects it well.</li>
            <li> (I am a product junky. I have medium length, normal dyed hair.)  I have used a lot of different shine and smooth products in the past and this one is one of my top favorites.  Be careful not to over do it.  I use about a penny/nickel size amount working from the bottom of my hair up. Followed by with a brush.  You might have to brush your hair again a few min. later, but the results will be amazing.  Soft and silky hair with the best shine ever.  And not a greasy shine.  I got so many complements on my hair when I use this product.  Plus it smells great... a fruity smell.  The smell does linger, but I kinda like that.  When you get a chance to splurge on hair care products, Enjoy is a must try.     Follow the links to other great Enjoy products:   [[ASIN:B0019LRD9A Enjoy Sulfate-Free Hydrating Duo (Shampoo and Conditioner) 33.8 oz]]  [[ASIN:B000II9BK4 Enjoy Straightener]]</li>
            <li> Love the ENJOY products. I live near the beach in NJ and it gets very humid in the summer. This blocked put humidity better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel and smell great.  I like mixing it with the enjoy texture cream because it makes it less sticky.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I have very frizzy hair and I use this prior to using my straight iron. Works well</li>
            <li> Good, not great product.</li>
            <li> Wife uses this for her hair.  If you have fairly thick Japanese hair and live in a hot dry climate, this works great.  Last a long time too.  Cheaper on amazon than the salon too.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I blow-dry and curl my hair everyday and this product keep the damage to a minimum.  Put this on while your hair is still wet.  It puts a thin coat over your hair to help prevent damage from your hot blow-dryer.  You wont be dissapointed.  It smells good too.</li>
            <li> Best product EVER !!! Also Amazon has it for the cheapest !!!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this stuff from a friend or from a subscription box and was in love. I have very long thick damaged hair. I lighten my hair often and stay in pools and outside. My hair has never looked better. My hair is to my lower back. So thick its hard to double wind a pony tail holder. A nickel size works and stays around in my hair for a few days. I dont use it it daily as it would get oily. It feels good on my skin as well. The instructions say to start at the ends. I start about 3 inches from the ends and finger it through. When you brush your hair it spreads evenly and if you start at the total end you cant brush up.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff so much, it&#x27;s basically like a serum but it smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy. I wouldn&#x27;t say it makes a difference in how my hair curls or if it helps hold the curl but my hair definitely does not tangle as much now that I put this product in it.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  It smells good and is great for your skin.  It is good for all hair types.  The whole line is great.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Great for smooth shiny hair and got to my front door in no time! This item is good for people with short blunt hair cuts!</li>
            <li> I put this product on my shoulder length straight hair before blow drying and straight ironing.  IN makes my hair shine and reduces frizzies.  It does not weigh my hair down or make it sticky or stiff.  I recomend this if you want a natural look but want to protect your hair before applying heat.</li>
            <li> I bought this from a reputable salon.  Was looking for something to smooth and prevent frizz.  I was told this product is silicone based and was not for moisturizing or improving the quality of hair.  I didn&#x27;t care and bought it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I am so HAPPY I did!&lt;br /&gt;I use a small amount on towel dried hair before blow drying and I get such a smooth and shiny finish.  Then, I&#x27;ll apply a tiny bit more prior to flat ironing and the results are even better!  I have long hair and don&#x27;t use more than the size of a dime.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this product is that it helps to really hold the style.  Eliminates frizz all day and NO oily residue!  Sometimes, I&#x27;ll reapply it at night before bed to keep my hair from getting too messy overnight and wow it really works!</li>
            <li> Okay, not great. A little thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> This is the best product of its kind and I have tried a bunch! I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> people that have curly hair this product is a miracle, it leaves you hair soft, smooth, and gives lots of shine.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on reviews from others, and I was very disappointed.  While it does give some shine, the shine is minimal without getting greasy looking. Also, many people commented on the great scent.  I am admittedly very particular about scent, and I like products that have a natural, clean, fresh scent.  For me, the scent of this is wayyyyy too sweet.  Also, I have noticed that the amount of shine in hair is different depending on hair color and texture.  Brunettes seem to be able to achieve the highest amount of shine, particularly if hair is straight.  The curlier the hair, the more difficult it seems to be to attain shine.  I have highlighted blonde hair and have had a hard time finding something that worked.  After being so disappointed with this product, I tried the John Frieda 100 percent shine mist which far exceeded my expectations.  It adds great shine without looking greasy, adds definition when I air dry my naturally wavy/curly hair and smell great.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair smooth, shiny and healthy looking and feeling.  Only need to use a very little bit for great effect.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, kinky/curly hair. This product helps my hair to smooth out my hair and gives it lots of shine for a few days.</li>
            <li> Makes hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have fine thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down; perfect for hot humid summer days!</li>
            <li> My frizzy hair takes on a much more attractive, smooth and shiny appearance.  I found I cannot live without this product and am thankful to Enjoy for making it available.</li>
            <li> This is an great product to use for blowing out your hair. Works well at eliminating frizz with out weighing down your hair.</li>
            <li> Not heavy. Leaves my hair silky and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have really short hair with longer bangs that I flat iron every day. This stuff is great to keep my hair shiny and protect it from looking dried out and frizzy, but without making it look greasy. I put it in when my hair&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have very curly hair and this does smooth it out and it smells great as well. It&#x27;s not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> Goes a long way and smells great!</li>
            <li> First review of this product even though I have been using it for years. Enjoy is hard to find anymore but it is the only product that keeps my hair healthy. This particular product makes combing my hair out after a shower a breeze. I also use a dab after straightening my hair for extra shine. You don&#x27;t need a lot of it. My hair is very thick and about waist length and this bottle will last a few months for me.</li>
            <li> My stylist used this on my hair and I loved the smell so much that I had to look into buying it...and so glad I did.  Makes my hair super silky and shiny and yet not weighed down.</li>
            <li> It smooths the frizzies; i have used this product for over a year and have recommended it to my daughter</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and works very well.</li>
            <li> Hair looks smooth, shiney and tames frizz. AND SMELLS FRUITY AND DELICIOUS. Love it. Will buy again. Great price as well.</li>
            <li> Shine without greasy feeling!</li>
            <li> Excellent !!!!!! Will order again</li>
            <li> This is my second container of Shine and Smooth.  The first I purchased at my hairdressers for twice the price. Before I could finish the bottle, it tipped over and spilled on my shelf.  Make sure that you close the top each time you put it away!  Shine and Smooth works well in a humid climate and I would recommend it for the frizzies and for controlling thick hair.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> love this product, leaves hair silky and shiny, smells great!</li>
            <li> Love Enjoy products and this was very reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Works as expected wife just loves it!</li>
            <li> This product was highly recommended by my hairdresser a couple of years ago and it is also amazing for my hands.</li>
            <li> Of all the smoothing, anti-frizz serums this one wins, hands down. It even beats my old favorite Kerastase and it&#x27;s a quarter of the price. It leaves my hair super shiny, soft, and completely frizz free without killing my natural loose curls. I know I bought this based on the reviews. If you are in the fence, give it a try. You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, but I prefer my Chi Silk Infusion.  One major negative is the skinny bottle style. If it tips over at all, it will pour completely out and there will be oily product everywhere.  So make sure to close the top properly every time.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it leaves my hair smooth and shiny without making it feel greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> It did not work as described....</li>
            <li> My hair is so shiny when I use this product solo, or with my creamy pomade.  I use the creamy pomade and a little shine/smooth to create a shine that want stop.  It does more than what I expect...no flakes...just downright GREAT products come out of this healthy hair care line!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i LOVE THIS LINE, and all the hair perks it supplies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole Enjoy line of product I use/have keeps me saying I do!!!  Yes I do enjoy my hair after I&#x27;ve used these quality products at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the creamy pomade and a little shine/smooth to create a shine that want stop.  I does more than what I expect...not flakes...just downright GREAT products come out of this healthy hair care line!!!</li>
            <li> Works great. I have oily skin and hair but it only seems to hydrate the ends, doesn&#x27;t make hair greasy. Smells nice too!</li>
            <li> Use it on hair and shine, imparts softness and shine!  Keeps frizzies away.  Less is more!</li>
            <li> My two daughters and I are in love with enjoy hair products.  My oldest uses this one in particular and her hair looks great all the time.  I also attribute the nice look to the other enjoy products we use but, this one is her favorite.  We all love the instant reconstruct conditioner and luxury shampoo. I love the regular hair spray and the super hold.</li>
            <li> Really like this product...works great and not too oily or heavy</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  My hair isn&#x27;t real frizzy, it&#x27;s just kind of wavy and I live in Texas so the humidity is ferocious and this really helps tame it.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without,  have it on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I like the product and the professional way the company delivered it on tome</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses Enjoy products.  So glad I can get these on Amazon.  I have baby fine hair with lots of little fly-aways.  This stuff helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of this stuff - it smells great and makes hair soft and shiny. I can put it on wet hair before styling or apply it to dry hair to tame frizzies. I especially like to put it on the ends of my ponytail to make it smooth without having to use a straightening iron.</li>
