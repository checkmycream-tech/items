            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice same results as in Clarins High Definition Body Lift, which is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I like the smell and the way it keeps my thighs cool in the hot weather.  </li>

            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>Check my reviews, I&#x27;m a real person.  </li>
            <li>Not TOO much change on my skin</li>
            <li>absolutely skin is smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now, and I can&#x27;t get over how much it has reduced the appearance of my cellulite.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>They are starting to look more tone and the dimpling cellulite is starting to get smaller</li>
            <li>Feels good, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much do far.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t  say definitively that it does much for cellulite, as I don&#x27;t have a ton to begin with, by it definitely smooths my skin in the thigh and butt area.</li>
            <li>I was really hesitate to buy this product because of it&#x27;s mixed reviews and for the cost of it as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been working out 4-5 days out of the week and slowly have been able to lose weight.  </li>
            <li>Would get the Clarins High Definition Body Lift next time, though, as I see results with that product.</li>

            <li> Toned and firm looking after the first bottle</li>
            <li> I keep trying other, less expensive cellulite control creams, but nothing works as good as this Clarins product.</li>
            <li> Those areas can tend to have small bumps and be a little dry, but this product makes them incredibly smooth after about a week or two of use.</li>
            <li> Just starting using it for a little over a week</li>
            <li> twice a day after I come out of the shower I pair this up with using the Rive seaweed soap because it has a rough feeling</li>
            <li> It appears to make the skin stretched out so you can see less dimples</li>
            <li> I noticed no difference and it was not worth the money!</li>
            <li> Been using it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday , twice a day, it helps me control the celulite but after a month Of using I was expecting like to see the celulite being reduced</li>
            <li> My legs also feel firm every time I apply this product.  </li>
            <li> This has a temp effect and it&#x27;s not magic so there will still be an appearance of some dimples-</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the efficacy of the product because it smells so awful that I couldn&#x27;t use it for more than 2 days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have a few &#x27;dimples on my cheeks&#x27; than smell like this stuff!</li>
            <li> Not sure yet re:</li>
            <li> I kept thinking what if this doesn&#x27;t work as the rest of the creams I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sorry to say.</li>
            <li> I had terrible cellulite on my thighs that I would hardly wear shorts/skirts because I was so self-conscious about my visible cellulite.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not the results promised in one bottle of continuous use but I&#x27;m willing to give it another bottles worth try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Didn&#x27;t notice same results as in Clarins High Definition Body Lift, which is a great product.  This one doesn&#x27;t have that cool tingling the body lift one has, which is good because I didn&#x27;t like that part. Goes on easily.  Would get the Clarins High Definition Body Lift next time, though, as I see results with that product.</li>
            <li> Just begun to use it...</li>
            <li> The product came with instructions on how to use it properly by a massaging technique.  I follow those every morning, and I also use a massage roller to help stimulate my circulation.  This product feels very cool and tingly and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing results soon!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much do far. Been using it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I noticed no difference and it was not worth the money!</li>
            <li> Yes, I get that tingly feeling but I&#x27;m not seeing any results... still plagued by persistent cellulite, I&#x27;m sorry to say.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday , twice a day, it helps me control the celulite but after a month Of using I was expecting like to see the celulite being reduced</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have an amazon account then, but I tried this stuff a while back from TJ Maxx..It does work. I don&#x27;t know if this is the same formula tho..it&#x27;s been like 5 years or so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products.  This is the ONLY product that has made a difference. Check my reviews, I&#x27;m a real person.  This has a temp effect and it&#x27;s not magic so there will still be an appearance of some dimples- it just helps.  I like the smell and the way it keeps my thighs cool in the hot weather.  Caffeine, seaweed, these are things that &#x27;help diminish the appearance of cellulite&#x27;.  : )</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the efficacy of the product because it smells so awful that I couldn&#x27;t use it for more than 2 days.  I&#x27;d rather have a few &#x27;dimples on my cheeks&#x27; than smell like this stuff!</li>
            <li> Not TOO much change on my skin</li>
            <li> With it being Clarins, I expected it to be wonderful. However, I didn&#x27;t see any improvements in my skin. Wish I could say it was even a great moisturizer, but it&#x27;s not. Can&#x27;t justify the cost.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for months... i see the different in my legs. love it. recommend using this with Clarins body treatment oil, firming, and toning product.</li>
            <li> The best !!!! You see actuall proof, but got to be dicipline and use daily.</li>
            <li> It arrived so nicely (: and my skin feels tight and smooth</li>
            <li> Product met my expectations. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I cant believe how amazing this stuff is!  It works!  It really works!  I will use this forever.  I noticed the improvement in 3 days! Will buy this forever!</li>
            <li> Been using the product for more than three years,love the texture n smell.The must have body lotion.</li>
            <li> You can feel it working after you apply it.</li>
            <li> I love it!! If you want to make a good body shape, you should get it! I&#x27;m here to buy one more.</li>
            <li> I keep trying other, less expensive cellulite control creams, but nothing works as good as this Clarins product. I can&#x27;t  say definitively that it does much for cellulite, as I don&#x27;t have a ton to begin with, by it definitely smooths my skin in the thigh and butt area. (I also use it on the backs of my arms sometimes.) Those areas can tend to have small bumps and be a little dry, but this product makes them incredibly smooth after about a week or two of use.</li>
            <li> Just starting using it for a little over a week and I can see the difference in my legs and thighs. They are starting to look more tone and the dimpling cellulite is starting to get smaller</li>
            <li> Not sure yet re: cellulite treatment but already appears to be tightening the skin and absolutely skin is smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> Definitely noticed a difference! Toned and firm looking after the first bottle</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, geniuine product</li>
            <li> I ordered my second bottle. I have used so many products on my legs (I have orthostatic edema) and none have worked this good for the price. Feels good, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, absorbs quickly and it seems to help with the leg swelling. It is worth trying!</li>
            <li> It appears to make the skin stretched out so you can see less dimples</li>
            <li> I was really hesitate to buy this product because of it&#x27;s mixed reviews and for the cost of it as well.  I kept thinking what if this doesn&#x27;t work as the rest of the creams I have bought in the past. I am glad I purchased this because I have noticed a dramatic change on my cellulite.  I had terrible cellulite on my thighs that I would hardly wear shorts/skirts because I was so self-conscious about my visible cellulite.  I&#x27;ve been working out 4-5 days out of the week and slowly have been able to lose weight.  For some reason I figured by working out it would make my cellulite go away, but it didn&#x27;t.  I was on the market on purchasing an item to help get rid of cellulite.  So I found this product online and order it.  I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now, and I can&#x27;t get over how much it has reduced the appearance of my cellulite. My legs also feel firm every time I apply this product.  The smell is nice and fresh and gives a cooling sensation when you apply it.  Now I can&#x27;t say this got all my cellulite away, but it sure has reduced the appearance of it.  I hope this review helps anyone looking for a product that actually helps reduce the appearance of cellulite.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Thank you! It is great!</li>
            <li> This really work great ..I admit that I did think it would be that great ..Even though the review were favorable.. I apply the cream twice a day after I come out of the shower I pair this up with using the Rive seaweed soap because it has a rough feeling so it stimulates the circulation in my thighs and buttock to wake up any cellulite ..Then I apply the cream and I notice my legs look great ..Results were very fast I must say..</li>
