            <li>Really nice!</li>

            <li>also bought the light and medium and mix the two together to get the perfect shade.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>Good coverage though.</li>
            <li>I have combination acne-prone skin that needs coverage and some moisture without making oily spots even oilier, and make-up always breaks me out and never seems to look good.</li>
            <li>It looks great and feels really nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and for good</li>
            <li>It blends in smoothly (I have very fair skin</li>
            <li>I am very fair and use the light to medium.</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I also love the SPF 30!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to purchase from Amazon, especially when you have Prime membership which just makes it even more awesome.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>:) heck, I don&#x27;t know!</li>
            <li>pretty color and coverage is excellent.</li>
            <li>Really great light tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>Just make your own tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>it does not blend nicely into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Product is not greasy and has a nice tint to it.</li>
            <li>Good color and moisture, wish it had more sunscreen.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like the amount of a good serum you would use.</li>
            <li>Very nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the kind of product I normally review, but I am so impressed with it that I decided to do it anyway.</li>
            <li>Aveeno is the only tinted moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my face shiny and blends in perfectly with my fair skin tone.</li>
            <li>At first I LOVED this product!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all you need keeps its soft naturalnot cakey perfect balance</li>
            <li>Put this on, get excellent even tone with some moisture that isn&#x27;t greasy and that looks natural.</li>
            <li>And the coverage is excellent, it really surprised me.</li>
            <li>This is the best, most natural looking tinted moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried yet!</li>
            <li>I think the description of fair to light is very accurate.</li>
            <li>The Fair to Light is perfect for my skin and it evens it out nicely before I apply my daily makeup.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin (natural redhead) and ordered this in the lightest shade available, &amp;#34;fair to light,&amp;#34; after reading some product reviews from others with fair skin claiming the product went well with their skin tone.</li>
            <li>general, this is a good quality product with adequate coverage &amp; excellent SPF protection &amp;  while transparent it also evens out the complexion.</li>
            <li>It is a cover up, but very light in coloring.</li>
            <li>The fair to light works fine for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of this tinted moisturizer!</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It lasts all day and looks much better than not wearing make up at all</li>
            <li>I, however, have some blotchy-ness and acne scars that require more cover.  </li>
            <li>This product provides the perfect level of cover and sheer in one bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of tinted moisturizers and as a rule I LOVE Aveno prouducts.</li>
            <li>love Aveno products &amp; my skin lady uses them after treatment.</li>
            <li>, this might be ok, but I was unimpressed.</li>
            <li>It is more of a CC cream than a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I think most foundations and powders make me look washed out and cakey.</li>
            <li>The only con could be the color -- this shade is perfect for me</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s coming:-)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Unscented, smooth, nice.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Really light, goes on evenly and blends nicely.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m really enjoying this tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Much better price than CVS.</li>
            <li>My skin looks much more radiant</li>
            <li>and I love that it has a tint to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying this product for a one step foundation, moisturizer and sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It smoothes out your face, and I love it for when I am rushing around in the morning.</li>
            <li>All that did was solidify that I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, and this is the only product that works best for me.</li>
            <li>and then this on top.</li>
            <li>Love it though.</li>
            <li>Not awful</li>
            <li>So, I bought this product thinking it was more like a gradual tanner.</li>
            <li>Takes a bit to blend, stick with it, give it a minute to \\&quot;settle\\&quot; and you will be pleased.</li>
            <li>and I use my Tarte tube when I want more coverage.</li>
            <li>no joke makes you look more radiant.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>and there where it requires more coverage.</li>
            <li>It is what I bought to replace Ti-SILC when they messed with the formula, and I notice it is thicker than TiS and also covers better.</li>
            <li>so I was looking for a product that I could throw on in a hurry that was able to stand in place of make up.</li>
            <li>The more I used it the more I broke out.</li>
            <li>If anything, this moisturizer is too moisturizing and rich!</li>
            <li>I have light very light skin with lots of freckles.</li>
            <li>She started mixing her makeup with her favorite spf 30 lotion, which works just fine.</li>
            <li>If you have more of a light to medium skin tone I would try the medium color (or blend the two).</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t quite sure if I liked it, but then I realized 1.</li>
            <li>I love this product, for its SPF quality as well as the light coverage it provides.  </li>
            <li>It also looks far too light when I first pump it out, but once I apply the product it blends *perfectly* with my skin.</li>
            <li>Which is surprising because usually Aveeno has really great products, I love their oatmeal baths.  </li>
            <li>It covers freckles, some age spots, some blotches, with one dab, which is very good for such a light product.</li>
            <li>It will come off easily by sweating or if you get any water on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a lot of sparkles in it, and I find that they rub off easily.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s easy to remove the clumpy bit.</li>
            <li>Does it have too strong of an odor?</li>
            <li>w orher moisturizer bc color is strong.</li>
            <li>Best part is it controls my oiliness and doesn&#x27;t break down the way some foundations do.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a nice smooth even tone some would even say it glows ;)</li>
            <li>I put this on w a little powder &amp; it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>I now need something light to even my skin tone (mid-40s), so I decided to use it again.</li>
            <li>Did nothing for my skin (moisturize, smooth, etc) and went on like a liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>my skin is smooth &amp; soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light that it doesn&#x27;t wash me out and force me to apply eyebrows and rouge.</li>
            <li>Its creamy and silky, applies smoothly</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>This was recommended by a friend and it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Do not feel comfortable wearing this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now, for the important reasons why I chose this brand over all the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Others are too light, fading away into oblivion before I walk out the door in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t waste the product using a sponge or cloth or pad to apply it-- your fingers are best, I think so anyway.</li>
            <li>anyone have any suggestions for fair, sensitive skin??</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Coverage; Not quite as good as make up but able to stand in&lt;br /&gt;Smell; VERY light smell of sun tan lotion, other than that</li>
            <li>Love this product, just the right amount of coverage.</li>
            <li>It spread more easily but didn&#x27;t fill in anything, or cover much.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a natural look and fair means fair, not chalky white</li>
            <li>I love that the SPF is also much higher than the Aveda SPF.</li>
            <li>Perfect for pale winter skin!</li>
            <li>I suppose it would be great if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and is not a heavy coverage light foundation.  </li>
            <li>I think it is the best I ever bought, next to Dermablend, which is professional grade tattoo hiding strength.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I love the Aveeno Positively Radiant (non-tinted) moisturizer that is SPF 15 and</li>
            <li>The coverage is awesome - hides imperfections evens redness, and it last pretty much all day without caking or getting shiny.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m special in that it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>One trick though, is to use a light finish/setting powder on top of it, like you would over normal makeup.</li>
            <li>Aveeno products are consistently known for being gentle yet effective products.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need anything full coverage.</li>
            <li>I have lighter skin with golden undertones and the Fair/Light was not too light at all.  </li>
            <li>The store where I bought it said they would give me a full refund, so I took them up on it.</li>
            <li>I guess if you are looking for a full replacement to your makeup</li>
            <li>This is all i wear for a nice even and natural look.</li>
            <li>Evens out my skin tone and really does have those reflective minerals mentioned :)</li>
            <li>It looks really natural and nice.  </li>
            <li>; that make you look more awake that you really are.  </li>
            <li>My skin is quite fair and this provides just enough color.</li>
            <li>I work full time and go to school at night</li>
            <li>Product shipped really quick and as described.</li>
            <li>My take, it is very much like a light foundation.</li>
            <li>Might to great for less humid environment</li>
            <li>I just purchased this product last week from Walmart &amp; love it!</li>
            <li>*Update from my last review: I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This product provides a fair amount of tint, so if you have very clear skin naturally, this may not be the product for you.  </li>
            <li>I also have some mild sun damage/pigmentation, which is why I can&#x27;t go without makeup, and this product covers it right up.  </li>
            <li>I have eczema and sensitive/dry skin in general and I was excited to try this product from Aveeno because I love their lotions.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a product you dab lightly in spots (like some moisturizers) and then expect it to blend, cover and moisturize your whole face.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I do not have good experience with different make up products, most of them make my face get red and itchy.  </li>
            <li>Goes on clear, smooth, even and light?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of gross.</li>
            <li>I like the coverage, and the color is nice and natural, but you absolutely shouldn&#x27;t use this if you have an aspirin allergy.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t quite get the right color.</li>
            <li>Positively Radiant, is just that!</li>
            <li>You need to use a decent amount and smooth it all over your face.</li>
            <li>Gives me good sun protection and just enough tint to smooth out my complexion just enough.  </li>
            <li>It does look thick when I first pump it out, but it melts and blends beautifully into my skin.</li>
            <li>I had tried several foundations that promised to be light diffusing, light reflecting.</li>
            <li>Within seconds my eyes were stinging, watering, and were very, very bloodshot.</li>
            <li>I tried this and for the first 2 days I used it it seemed to blend well</li>
            <li>TO avoid this, I put 3 drops of a higher SPF &amp;  mix it into the Aveno and then apply.</li>
            <li>I added a bit of my regular moisturizer over the top and tried to blend it in.  </li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd tinted moisturizer that I&#x27;ve tried and the first one that I&#x27;ve been pleased with.</li>
            <li>so I apply moisturizer first and then use this to even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>The overall look is light, natural, and lovely.</li>
            <li>But mixed with Eucerin Redness Relief moisturizer, it&#x27;s the perfect moisturizer to cover up small imperfections, reduce redness, and provide a natural-looking tone.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is actually cheaper to buy it on Amazon then elsewhere.</li>
            <li>This is my absolutely favorite tinted moisturizer for daily use.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am extremely pleased with this tinted sunblock moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy, good for summer</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of tint and really take care of my skin.</li>
            <li>I really didnt need a sunscreen, just a tinted moisturizer as I dont like to wear foundation in Fla. in the hot humid season.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and will use it for as long as they make it.</li>
            <li>Not being much of a \\&quot;girly-girl\\&quot;, this was the first time I&#x27;d heard of tinted moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I washed it all off and tried another approach, putting on my regular moisturizer first and then a light dab of the Aveeno tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The product came quickly enough so everything was fine in that respect</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get acne very often</li>
            <li>No matter how much I tried to blend it around my skin.</li>
            <li>It is fast to use because you don&#x27;t need to put on lotion.  </li>
            <li>I also really enjoy only having one step: moisturizer, sunscreen and tint in 15 seconds.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I look very shiny immediately after apply this and feel greasy all day.</li>
            <li>I really like the coverage of this product.</li>
            <li>I ended up discontinuing use of this product before I ran out, because of how much glitter it contains.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you give it a try!</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>the texture is really think and does not blend really well.</li>
            <li>Nothing really moisturizing about it.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and sheer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dermatologist recommended, so I can trust that it&#x27;s safe for my sensitive skin because  it&#x27;s free from harsh irritants (everything says &#x27;dermatologist recommended&#x27;, so I did research to confirm it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really color correct like it</li>
            <li>Does not do much to conceal wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Also, there&#x27;s just too much color in it, so it &amp;#34;gets stuck&amp;#34</li>
            <li>but I just feel it doesn&#x27;t blend very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It is tinted, but not so much that you look like you have makeup on.  </li>
            <li>and I really like this one.</li>
            <li>The tint is just enough to give me a smooth glow.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, goes on easily, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I especially love how my skin has the very subtle, polished look usually only accomplished with makeup.</li>
            <li>Try letting it dry completely before using more, then you can do a dab just here</li>
            <li>I also love how it isn&#x27;t a typical, greasy tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The main things I look for in anything I put on my face are: Is it weightless?</li>
            <li>needed a quick morning makeup routine that would even out my skin tone, provide sunscreen, Moisturize and of course simple to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the much more expensive Aveda, and I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try Aveeno.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend replacing foundation with this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this over a BB cream.</li>
            <li>Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moist is a little too orange and shiny on its own.</li>
            <li>Yes, the price has gone up a little, but most things have.</li>
            <li>(I like a somewhat natural look &amp; dislike fussing too much with my appearance).  </li>
            <li>It could be too dark for really light-skinned ladies, and I think this is the lightest shade available.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s my make up routine on a normal day.  </li>
            <li>That went a lot better, but it still spread unevenly.</li>
            <li>Feels like a  normal foundation.</li>
            <li>Heavier than my normal face lotion, though&lt;br /&gt;SPF</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is fine.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy and use this product for the many days I need to look less \\&quot;done up\\&quot; without looking like I just got out of bed!</li>
            <li>Once the product is dry, like 30 seconds or so, it doesn&#x27;t rub off on yr clothes or anything else, and I notice when I remove it at night, there is still a lot of color on the cloth, so it is fer sure lasting all day.</li>
            <li>When I looked at my hand my finger prints from the tip of my fingers down to where it touched when I was spreading it were in positive relief - concealer on top, regular skin tone underneath.</li>
            <li>I like to keep life simple and this just fits right in.</li>
            <li>a side note not related to the product itself but more for the seller: I ordered the product New and received an already opened obviously not new product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker than other moisturizers but it also has the light makeup in it.  </li>
            <li>I put on their POSITIVELY RADIANT®  Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 15 first</li>
            <li>I have tried tons of different products and everything I use, no matter how light, turn orange on my skin after a very short time.</li>
            <li>My eyes are very sensitive</li>
            <li>my skin is so soft &amp; moisturized!</li>
            <li>After those two discoveries, WOW!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly light skinned with dark hair</li>
            <li>I spent an hour getting ready to work in the hot Texas sun.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is very thick and somewhat hard to apply, but it provides excellent coverage to hide blemishes and scars.  </li>
            <li>I use just a little bit, and while it&#x27;s not thick or full coverage like foundation, I get to even my skin tone and minimize my acne without getting break outs.</li>
            <li>The texture is due to the spf30 and quickly absorbs into the skin.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more than enough to cover my entire face evenly, not too much and not too little.</li>
            <li>Will wait to clear up and then try again.</li>
            <li>It irritated her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But I wanted to try an actual night moisturizer (preferably Aveeno since my skin seems to really like it).&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>The only con is that the pump doesn&#x27;t work very well, but that may just be my bottle.</li>
            <li>&amp; it looks so natural.</li>
            <li>Also, they offer far fewer shades</li>
            <li>Keeps the skin  soft with just a hint of color.  </li>
            <li>my teens into my early thirties now, I still have combination/oily skin that is incredibly sensitive to the point where it becomes bothersome.</li>
            <li>This ties in with reason #3, but this is a completely separate issue for me.</li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin requires a product that&#x27;s hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>but I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It covered quiet well and was very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I put on moisturizer around my eyes first, let it dry, then use this product.  </li>
            <li>It IS a bit shiny, so to counteract shine, I put a little layer of either loose translucent powder on top, or translucent compact powder.</li>
            <li>I was very dismayed the first time I used it, especially because it is SO dark &amp; makeup</li>
            <li>Alittle goes a long way, so the cost really isn&#x27;t an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much about the quality of the product as I didn&#x27;t keep it on for very long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;QUESTION: Since it&#x27;s winter &amp; so dry I&#x27;ve even started using the moisturizers at night which my skin seems to really like.</li>
            <li>I touched the tip of my two pinkie fingers into my regular moisturizer and tried to smooth the uneven smudges around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>But since I hate makeup this is much better &amp; actually healthy for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin but using only these two products (plus Aveeno Ultra-Calming Moisturizing Cream Cleanser every morning &amp; night)</li>
            <li>so i go from very pale in the winter to a light tan as the weather</li>
            <li>I store it mixed in a clean glass baby food jar &amp; capped tight.</li>
            <li>And the colors are light enough (or probably dark enough) for some people.</li>
            <li>It is Easy to overuse it, a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>but I use this tint right up to the lash line and it has Never bothered me, even with the slight smell, so I guess that means it is some hypoallergenic smell</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin &amp; hate to wear a lot of foundation</li>
            <li>I work out doors, generally</li>
            <li>I am a natural platinum blonde</li>
            <li>Even though this isn&#x27;t a foundation, it looks like one if you&#x27;re not careful on the amount you apply.</li>
            <li>The color is sheer and natural, which is why I like it.</li>
            <li>I also use the Jergens Natural Glow facial moisturizer, but it just doesn&#x27;t keep my makeup in place throughout the day like Aveeno does.</li>
            <li>In short I was looking for something that would look natural.</li>
            <li>I am 61 years old and find that regular foundation likes to accentuate my wrinkles, so I&#x27;ve gone to using tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li>This is perfect for me as I hate wearing makeup and sorta have dry skin.</li>
            <li>I find that I can do away with face powder, as this product leaves only a subtle, healthy glow to the skin, with the same feel as the pricey \\&quot;mineral\\&quot; makeups.</li>
            <li>I expect new when I order new and was let down.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;d say my bare skin looks healthier overall.  </li>
            <li>But mixed with the Eucerin Redness Relief (which is green in color), it looks very neutral and natural.</li>
            <li>It settled into fine lines and was hard to spread around (because my skin was dry underneath this).  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> , just NICE!     </li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought this, and she has a sexy latina brown skin color in which this product worked out great!!</li>
            <li> Really nice!</li>
            <li> This gives great moisture, fairly good coverage, and spf all in 1.</li>
            <li> also bought the light and medium and mix the two together to get the perfect shade.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> Good coverage though.</li>
            <li> I have combination acne-prone skin that needs coverage and some moisture without making oily spots even oilier, and make-up always breaks me out and never seems to look good.</li>
            <li> It looks great and feels really nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and for good</li>
            <li> It blends in smoothly (I have very fair skin</li>
            <li> I am very fair and use the light to medium.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I also love the SPF 30!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to purchase from Amazon, especially when you have Prime membership which just makes it even more awesome.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> :) heck, I don&#x27;t know!</li>
            <li> pretty color and coverage is excellent.</li>
            <li> Really great light tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells nice.</li>
            <li> Just make your own tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> it does not blend nicely into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Product is not greasy and has a nice tint to it.</li>
            <li> Good color and moisture, wish it had more sunscreen.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more like the amount of a good serum you would use.</li>
            <li> Very nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the kind of product I normally review, but I am so impressed with it that I decided to do it anyway.</li>
            <li> Aveeno is the only tinted moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my face shiny and blends in perfectly with my fair skin tone.</li>
            <li> At first I LOVED this product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all you need keeps its soft naturalnot cakey perfect balance</li>
            <li> Put this on, get excellent even tone with some moisture that isn&#x27;t greasy and that looks natural.</li>
            <li> And the coverage is excellent, it really surprised me.</li>
            <li> This is the best, most natural looking tinted moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried yet!</li>
            <li> I think the description of fair to light is very accurate.</li>
            <li> The Fair to Light is perfect for my skin and it evens it out nicely before I apply my daily makeup.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin (natural redhead) and ordered this in the lightest shade available, &amp;#34;fair to light,&amp;#34; after reading some product reviews from others with fair skin claiming the product went well with their skin tone.</li>
            <li> general, this is a good quality product with adequate coverage &amp; excellent SPF protection &amp;  while transparent it also evens out the complexion.</li>
            <li> It is a cover up, but very light in coloring.</li>
            <li> The fair to light works fine for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this tinted moisturizer!</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It lasts all day and looks much better than not wearing make up at all</li>
            <li> I, however, have some blotchy-ness and acne scars that require more cover.  </li>
            <li> This product provides the perfect level of cover and sheer in one bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of tinted moisturizers and as a rule I LOVE Aveno prouducts.</li>
            <li> love Aveno products &amp; my skin lady uses them after treatment.</li>
            <li> , this might be ok, but I was unimpressed.</li>
            <li> It is more of a CC cream than a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I think most foundations and powders make me look washed out and cakey.</li>
            <li> The only con could be the color -- this shade is perfect for me</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s coming:-)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unscented, smooth, nice.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Really light, goes on evenly and blends nicely.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m really enjoying this tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Much better price than CVS.</li>
            <li> My skin looks much more radiant</li>
            <li> and I love that it has a tint to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this product for a one step foundation, moisturizer and sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It smoothes out your face, and I love it for when I am rushing around in the morning.</li>
            <li> All that did was solidify that I love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, and this is the only product that works best for me.</li>
            <li> and then this on top.</li>
            <li> Love it though.</li>
            <li> Not awful</li>
            <li> So, I bought this product thinking it was more like a gradual tanner.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit to blend, stick with it, give it a minute to \\&quot;settle\\&quot; and you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> and I use my Tarte tube when I want more coverage.</li>
            <li> no joke makes you look more radiant.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> and there where it requires more coverage.</li>
            <li> It is what I bought to replace Ti-SILC when they messed with the formula, and I notice it is thicker than TiS and also covers better.</li>
            <li> so I was looking for a product that I could throw on in a hurry that was able to stand in place of make up.</li>
            <li> The more I used it the more I broke out.</li>
            <li> If anything, this moisturizer is too moisturizing and rich!</li>
            <li> I have light very light skin with lots of freckles.</li>
            <li> She started mixing her makeup with her favorite spf 30 lotion, which works just fine.</li>
            <li> If you have more of a light to medium skin tone I would try the medium color (or blend the two).</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t quite sure if I liked it, but then I realized 1.</li>
            <li> I love this product, for its SPF quality as well as the light coverage it provides.  </li>
            <li> It also looks far too light when I first pump it out, but once I apply the product it blends *perfectly* with my skin.</li>
            <li> Which is surprising because usually Aveeno has really great products, I love their oatmeal baths.  </li>
            <li> It covers freckles, some age spots, some blotches, with one dab, which is very good for such a light product.</li>
            <li> It will come off easily by sweating or if you get any water on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a lot of sparkles in it, and I find that they rub off easily.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s easy to remove the clumpy bit.</li>
            <li> Does it have too strong of an odor?</li>
            <li> w orher moisturizer bc color is strong.</li>
            <li> Best part is it controls my oiliness and doesn&#x27;t break down the way some foundations do.</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a nice smooth even tone some would even say it glows ;)</li>
            <li> I put this on w a little powder &amp; it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I now need something light to even my skin tone (mid-40s), so I decided to use it again.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my skin (moisturize, smooth, etc) and went on like a liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> my skin is smooth &amp; soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light that it doesn&#x27;t wash me out and force me to apply eyebrows and rouge.</li>
            <li> Its creamy and silky, applies smoothly</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend and it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Do not feel comfortable wearing this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, for the important reasons why I chose this brand over all the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Others are too light, fading away into oblivion before I walk out the door in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste the product using a sponge or cloth or pad to apply it-- your fingers are best, I think so anyway.</li>
            <li> anyone have any suggestions for fair, sensitive skin??</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Coverage; Not quite as good as make up but able to stand in&lt;br /&gt;Smell; VERY light smell of sun tan lotion, other than that</li>
            <li> Love this product, just the right amount of coverage.</li>
            <li> It spread more easily but didn&#x27;t fill in anything, or cover much.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a natural look and fair means fair, not chalky white</li>
            <li> I love that the SPF is also much higher than the Aveda SPF.</li>
            <li> Perfect for pale winter skin!</li>
            <li> I suppose it would be great if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and is not a heavy coverage light foundation.  </li>
            <li> I think it is the best I ever bought, next to Dermablend, which is professional grade tattoo hiding strength.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love the Aveeno Positively Radiant (non-tinted) moisturizer that is SPF 15 and</li>
            <li> The coverage is awesome - hides imperfections evens redness, and it last pretty much all day without caking or getting shiny.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m special in that it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> One trick though, is to use a light finish/setting powder on top of it, like you would over normal makeup.</li>
            <li> Aveeno products are consistently known for being gentle yet effective products.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need anything full coverage.</li>
            <li> I have lighter skin with golden undertones and the Fair/Light was not too light at all.  </li>
            <li> The store where I bought it said they would give me a full refund, so I took them up on it.</li>
            <li> I guess if you are looking for a full replacement to your makeup</li>
            <li> This is all i wear for a nice even and natural look.</li>
            <li> Evens out my skin tone and really does have those reflective minerals mentioned :)</li>
            <li> It looks really natural and nice.  </li>
            <li> ; that make you look more awake that you really are.  </li>
            <li> My skin is quite fair and this provides just enough color.</li>
            <li> I work full time and go to school at night</li>
            <li> Product shipped really quick and as described.</li>
            <li> My take, it is very much like a light foundation.</li>
            <li> Might to great for less humid environment</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product last week from Walmart &amp; love it!</li>
            <li> *Update from my last review: I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product provides a fair amount of tint, so if you have very clear skin naturally, this may not be the product for you.  </li>
            <li> I also have some mild sun damage/pigmentation, which is why I can&#x27;t go without makeup, and this product covers it right up.  </li>
            <li> I have eczema and sensitive/dry skin in general and I was excited to try this product from Aveeno because I love their lotions.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a product you dab lightly in spots (like some moisturizers) and then expect it to blend, cover and moisturize your whole face.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I do not have good experience with different make up products, most of them make my face get red and itchy.  </li>
            <li> Goes on clear, smooth, even and light?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of gross.</li>
            <li> I like the coverage, and the color is nice and natural, but you absolutely shouldn&#x27;t use this if you have an aspirin allergy.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t quite get the right color.</li>
            <li> Positively Radiant, is just that!</li>
            <li> You need to use a decent amount and smooth it all over your face.</li>
            <li> Gives me good sun protection and just enough tint to smooth out my complexion just enough.  </li>
            <li> It does look thick when I first pump it out, but it melts and blends beautifully into my skin.</li>
            <li> I had tried several foundations that promised to be light diffusing, light reflecting.</li>
            <li> Within seconds my eyes were stinging, watering, and were very, very bloodshot.</li>
            <li> I tried this and for the first 2 days I used it it seemed to blend well</li>
            <li> TO avoid this, I put 3 drops of a higher SPF &amp;  mix it into the Aveno and then apply.</li>
            <li> I added a bit of my regular moisturizer over the top and tried to blend it in.  </li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd tinted moisturizer that I&#x27;ve tried and the first one that I&#x27;ve been pleased with.</li>
            <li> so I apply moisturizer first and then use this to even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> The overall look is light, natural, and lovely.</li>
            <li> But mixed with Eucerin Redness Relief moisturizer, it&#x27;s the perfect moisturizer to cover up small imperfections, reduce redness, and provide a natural-looking tone.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is actually cheaper to buy it on Amazon then elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This is my absolutely favorite tinted moisturizer for daily use.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am extremely pleased with this tinted sunblock moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, good for summer</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of tint and really take care of my skin.</li>
            <li> I really didnt need a sunscreen, just a tinted moisturizer as I dont like to wear foundation in Fla. in the hot humid season.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and will use it for as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> Not being much of a \\&quot;girly-girl\\&quot;, this was the first time I&#x27;d heard of tinted moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I washed it all off and tried another approach, putting on my regular moisturizer first and then a light dab of the Aveeno tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly enough so everything was fine in that respect</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get acne very often</li>
            <li> No matter how much I tried to blend it around my skin.</li>
            <li> It is fast to use because you don&#x27;t need to put on lotion.  </li>
            <li> I also really enjoy only having one step: moisturizer, sunscreen and tint in 15 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I look very shiny immediately after apply this and feel greasy all day.</li>
            <li> I really like the coverage of this product.</li>
            <li> I ended up discontinuing use of this product before I ran out, because of how much glitter it contains.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that you give it a try!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> the texture is really think and does not blend really well.</li>
            <li> Nothing really moisturizing about it.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and sheer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dermatologist recommended, so I can trust that it&#x27;s safe for my sensitive skin because  it&#x27;s free from harsh irritants (everything says &#x27;dermatologist recommended&#x27;, so I did research to confirm it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really color correct like it</li>
            <li> Does not do much to conceal wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Also, there&#x27;s just too much color in it, so it &amp;#34;gets stuck&amp;#34</li>
            <li> but I just feel it doesn&#x27;t blend very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It is tinted, but not so much that you look like you have makeup on.  </li>
            <li> and I really like this one.</li>
            <li> The tint is just enough to give me a smooth glow.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice, goes on easily, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I especially love how my skin has the very subtle, polished look usually only accomplished with makeup.</li>
            <li> Try letting it dry completely before using more, then you can do a dab just here</li>
            <li> I also love how it isn&#x27;t a typical, greasy tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The main things I look for in anything I put on my face are: Is it weightless?</li>
            <li> needed a quick morning makeup routine that would even out my skin tone, provide sunscreen, Moisturize and of course simple to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the much more expensive Aveda, and I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try Aveeno.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend replacing foundation with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this over a BB cream.</li>
            <li> Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moist is a little too orange and shiny on its own.</li>
            <li> Yes, the price has gone up a little, but most things have.</li>
            <li> (I like a somewhat natural look &amp; dislike fussing too much with my appearance).  </li>
            <li> It could be too dark for really light-skinned ladies, and I think this is the lightest shade available.  </li>
            <li> I have normal skin</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s my make up routine on a normal day.  </li>
            <li> That went a lot better, but it still spread unevenly.</li>
            <li> Feels like a  normal foundation.</li>
            <li> Heavier than my normal face lotion, though&lt;br /&gt;SPF</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is fine.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy and use this product for the many days I need to look less \\&quot;done up\\&quot; without looking like I just got out of bed!</li>
            <li> Once the product is dry, like 30 seconds or so, it doesn&#x27;t rub off on yr clothes or anything else, and I notice when I remove it at night, there is still a lot of color on the cloth, so it is fer sure lasting all day.</li>
            <li> When I looked at my hand my finger prints from the tip of my fingers down to where it touched when I was spreading it were in positive relief - concealer on top, regular skin tone underneath.</li>
            <li> I like to keep life simple and this just fits right in.</li>
            <li> a side note not related to the product itself but more for the seller: I ordered the product New and received an already opened obviously not new product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker than other moisturizers but it also has the light makeup in it.  </li>
            <li> I put on their POSITIVELY RADIANT®  Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 15 first</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of different products and everything I use, no matter how light, turn orange on my skin after a very short time.</li>
            <li> My eyes are very sensitive</li>
            <li> my skin is so soft &amp; moisturized!</li>
            <li> After those two discoveries, WOW!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly light skinned with dark hair</li>
            <li> I spent an hour getting ready to work in the hot Texas sun.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very thick and somewhat hard to apply, but it provides excellent coverage to hide blemishes and scars.  </li>
            <li> I use just a little bit, and while it&#x27;s not thick or full coverage like foundation, I get to even my skin tone and minimize my acne without getting break outs.</li>
            <li> The texture is due to the spf30 and quickly absorbs into the skin.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more than enough to cover my entire face evenly, not too much and not too little.</li>
            <li> Will wait to clear up and then try again.</li>
            <li> It irritated her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But I wanted to try an actual night moisturizer (preferably Aveeno since my skin seems to really like it).&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> The only con is that the pump doesn&#x27;t work very well, but that may just be my bottle.</li>
            <li> &amp; it looks so natural.</li>
            <li> Also, they offer far fewer shades</li>
            <li> Keeps the skin  soft with just a hint of color.  </li>
            <li> my teens into my early thirties now, I still have combination/oily skin that is incredibly sensitive to the point where it becomes bothersome.</li>
            <li> This ties in with reason #3, but this is a completely separate issue for me.</li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin requires a product that&#x27;s hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> but I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It covered quiet well and was very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I put on moisturizer around my eyes first, let it dry, then use this product.  </li>
            <li> It IS a bit shiny, so to counteract shine, I put a little layer of either loose translucent powder on top, or translucent compact powder.</li>
            <li> I was very dismayed the first time I used it, especially because it is SO dark &amp; makeup</li>
            <li> Alittle goes a long way, so the cost really isn&#x27;t an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about the quality of the product as I didn&#x27;t keep it on for very long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;QUESTION: Since it&#x27;s winter &amp; so dry I&#x27;ve even started using the moisturizers at night which my skin seems to really like.</li>
            <li> I touched the tip of my two pinkie fingers into my regular moisturizer and tried to smooth the uneven smudges around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> But since I hate makeup this is much better &amp; actually healthy for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin but using only these two products (plus Aveeno Ultra-Calming Moisturizing Cream Cleanser every morning &amp; night)</li>
            <li> so i go from very pale in the winter to a light tan as the weather</li>
            <li> I store it mixed in a clean glass baby food jar &amp; capped tight.</li>
            <li> And the colors are light enough (or probably dark enough) for some people.</li>
            <li> It is Easy to overuse it, a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> but I use this tint right up to the lash line and it has Never bothered me, even with the slight smell, so I guess that means it is some hypoallergenic smell</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin &amp; hate to wear a lot of foundation</li>
            <li> I work out doors, generally</li>
            <li> I am a natural platinum blonde</li>
            <li> Even though this isn&#x27;t a foundation, it looks like one if you&#x27;re not careful on the amount you apply.</li>
            <li> The color is sheer and natural, which is why I like it.</li>
            <li> I also use the Jergens Natural Glow facial moisturizer, but it just doesn&#x27;t keep my makeup in place throughout the day like Aveeno does.</li>
            <li> In short I was looking for something that would look natural.</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old and find that regular foundation likes to accentuate my wrinkles, so I&#x27;ve gone to using tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me as I hate wearing makeup and sorta have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I find that I can do away with face powder, as this product leaves only a subtle, healthy glow to the skin, with the same feel as the pricey \\&quot;mineral\\&quot; makeups.</li>
            <li> I expect new when I order new and was let down.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;d say my bare skin looks healthier overall.  </li>
            <li> But mixed with the Eucerin Redness Relief (which is green in color), it looks very neutral and natural.</li>
            <li> It settled into fine lines and was hard to spread around (because my skin was dry underneath this).  </li>
            <li> It blends seamlessly with my skin color and provides a good base for my makeup.</li>
            <li> I tried putting on my other moisturizer (Aveeno Active Naturals Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer spf 15) before, &amp; only dabbed the Tinted Moisturizer on after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that when compared with drugstore bb creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past, this tends to apply a bit more thickly.</li>
            <li> If you put a single small drop on your first and middle finger and pat that on here and there then blend it, you won&#x27;t overuse the product.</li>
            <li> I later tried it on a weekend and noticed I had some minor break outs.</li>
            <li> At first I was taken aback when I saw how thick the lotion is</li>
            <li> ; It goes on pretty thick but absorbs into the skin</li>
            <li> This manages to tone that down without upsetting my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> While I like the actual product I don&#x27;t like that every time that I go to use it a portion of what I squeeze out is dry.  </li>
            <li> Completely hypoallergenic, BUT it has some slight smell to it, which the Aveeno lotions do not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to apply to my face.</li>
            <li> I use it for when I go on long runs or hiking for sunscreen and cover up.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m dressing up, I sweep a little blush over my cheeks &amp; eyelids and I look totally finished without being overly \\&quot;made-up\\&quot;, in only a couple of steps.</li>
            <li> Especially if it mixes with any other product.</li>
            <li> Maybe it would work for someone that doesn&#x27;t have dry skin.</li>
            <li> like I said I still use another moisturizer underneath it, but I have fairly dry skin.</li>
            <li> It also feels really dry.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t oily and doesn&#x27;t dry my face out.</li>
            <li> I have to separate the dry portion from the rest before applying to my face.</li>
            <li> If you use it without moisturizer it will go on dry and cake-like.</li>
            <li> and I now use it every single day.</li>
            <li> The only thing I add is a touch of concealer on any pimples or really dark spots, and lipstick.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t notice the sparkles, and thought I was secretly a stripper at night(Sleep stripping?).</li>
            <li> It does not feel thick or heavy on the skin, and gives a perfect base for applying eyebrow pencil, blush, etc.</li>
            <li> Pretend it is Very expensive and start with that amount :)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn foundation in five years because 1) I break out super easy, which creates a nasty cycle.</li>
            <li> It provides just enough cover up to even my skin tone without leaving residue, buildup, or causing my skin to feel weighed down.</li>
            <li> The more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried end up making my face look like a grease slick.</li>
            <li> I have to use less than I would if it was regular foundation, and 2.</li>
            <li> (2) Dont buy this if you have very dry skin as it is a lighweight moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that each time you use it, a bit of product dries up in the narrow dispenser overnight and comes out with the new pump.</li>
            <li> It has tiny little &amp;#34;light reflectors&amp;#34</li>
            <li> You still get the same coverage whether using a lot or a little.</li>
            <li> (I have no idea what happened to the bottles the other reviewers used, because this has never felt cakey or dry to me).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very moisturizing</li>
            <li> The formula is a tiny bit thick compared to a traditional moisturizer</li>
            <li> It was so thick I had to open the bottle up and stir it for quite a while to get it flowing enough to work.</li>
            <li> To be honest though I still use a base moisturizer underneath this product.</li>
            <li> This is too dark for my skin and as I have dry skin, it makes my skin look flakey.  </li>
            <li> and I thought it was decent, but not great.</li>
            <li> I have to make a concious effort to use a little bit after having used other moisturisers because this stuff goes a long way.</li>
            <li> To due skin cancer and using Renova, I have got to SPF my skin</li>
            <li> I am extremely picky about my moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and (1)</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s related to the product or something else.  </li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this product, and I have substituted with other products on impulse in order to save money</li>
            <li> The CC Cream contains two active ingredients - homosalate and octisalate -</li>
            <li> and I get such a natural but evened out look its difficult to put into words.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of this BB cream, because I have very pale skin, and this color is too orange for me.</li>
            <li> It was actually a little darker than expected.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the jury is out as I had some breaking out after first few uses.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my skin is about a shade too light for this product, which ended up being very obviously the wrong tone when I tried it on my face.</li>
            <li> It is too thick and NOT moisturizing enough.  </li>
            <li> I do put Almay compressed powder over it to cut down on shine and that&#x27;s it</li>
            <li> What a let down.</li>
            <li> Powder could not tone that shine down.</li>
            <li> It provides very sheer coverage and provides a subtle brightening effect.</li>
            <li> Lighter and less coverage.</li>
            <li> It sweats off some, but the coverage is so subtle that you don&#x27;t notice big soupy streaks.</li>
            <li> ; in my eyebrows, turning them all orange!&lt;br /&gt;I prefer something with less color, like the ones from Covergirl or Maybeline.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little dark for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makeup  tends to be too heavy, which causes my already oily prone skin to feel weighed down.  </li>
            <li> The cream would roll up in little pills.</li>
            <li> A little concealer under my eyes, some blush, a coat of mascara and lip-gloss</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t moisturize, didn&#x27;t even out my skin tone, and kinda burned a little.</li>
            <li> I believe it has a powder base as this seems to sink into large pores and deep lines.</li>
            <li> This product feels too heavy when applied and in the heat make my skin feel smothered.</li>
            <li> I started using this a few days ago</li>
            <li> I used to use Neutrogena tinted moisturizer, but got away from using it a few years ago.</li>
            <li> * a heavy foundation.</li>
            <li> It wastes product, too.</li>
            <li> This is greasy when it goes on, and didn&#x27;t balance the uneven skin tones in face.  </li>
            <li> And after using it for a few weeks, my skin is looking healthier all around, even once I wash it off at night.</li>
            <li> I used this everyday all year.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have to use sunblock everyday and this takes care of everything.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve typically tried BB creams in the past for this purpose but they all make me break out.</li>
            <li> now that winter is here, my pale skin needs some color.</li>
            <li> Remove with washcloth and plain water if you are not fussy.</li>
            <li> It provides sunscreen, and overall continually moisturizes my skin during the harsh cold season and dry summer season also.</li>
            <li> It looked heavy and fake, without actually providing any coverage or evening skin tone.</li>
            <li> After a little searching (Target to the rescue!)</li>
            <li> which is what I usually chose to do since as I said make up</li>
            <li> How can it conceal if it doesn&#x27;t fully fill in wrinkles, especially wrinkles as faint as a fingerprint????</li>
            <li> The bottle is very poorly designed; product builds up on the outside, and then dries up, and has to be removed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m spoiled with Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless Restoratives tinted moisturizer, but it can be hard to find</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s so hard to match my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars if it hadn&#x27;t been so hard to get the pump working.</li>
            <li> A little pressed powder and lipstick, and I&#x27;m done!!</li>
            <li> Some reviews mention how thick the product is.</li>
            <li> I mean, where is the moisturizer in this stuff?</li>
            <li> I still have to use Dermablend on serious blotches but did not expect this Aveeno product to replace it.</li>

            <li> But this moisturizer goes on weird...</li>
            <li> It comes in a Pump bottle which tends to clog, all pumps do, so just shake it a lot each time before you use it and don&#x27;t leave it in a cold place.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to blend in.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good for the price! My skin looks luminous.</li>
            <li> I cannot use liquid foundation. I have tried tons of different products and everything I use, no matter how light, turn orange on my skin after a very short time. I decided to try tinted moisturizer and this seems to blend like I was hoping it would. This is not for someone who needs a lot of coverage. I have normal skin and I don&#x27;t get acne very often so I don&#x27;t need anything full coverage. I tried this and for the first 2 days I used it it seemed to blend well, I would still wipe some off after I went out into the sunlight, but I didn&#x27;t have to remove all of it. This morning I put it on and it wasn&#x27;t even on my skin for 5 minutes and I looked like I was turning into an oompa loompa. No matter how much I tried to blend it around my skin. Maybe I am destined to never wear liquid makeup. :(</li>
            <li> This product feels too heavy when applied and in the heat make my skin feel smothered. Might to great for less humid environment</li>
            <li> I suffer from dermatitis, looked for options to help my complicated skin. it hurt as soon as i put it on. hurt for about 5mins. my face was red for about 5 days. smells horrible. i dont know what to fo with it.</li>
            <li> I do not have good experience with different make up products, most of them make my face get red and itchy.  I started using this a few days ago and I love it.  It evens my skin tone out without even a touch of itchiness.  It is fast to use because you don&#x27;t need to put on lotion.  I do put Almay compressed powder over it to cut down on shine and that&#x27;s it, that&#x27;s my make up routine on a normal day.  It lasts all day and looks much better than not wearing make up at all which is what I usually chose to do since as I said make up would make my face red and itchy.  And this product is $5 cheaper on here than at my local Walgreens and Walmart.</li>
            <li> This is too dark for my skin and as I have dry skin, it makes my skin look flakey.  Maybe it would work for someone that doesn&#x27;t have dry skin.</li>
            <li> It irritated her sensitive skin. She started mixing her makeup with her favorite spf 30 lotion, which works just fine.</li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed in this product. It is too shiny for my liking. I have to use powder. Other than that, it is fine. It smells nice.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lighter makeup to wear during the summer time.  I work out doors, generally and I need something that provides some cover and sunscreen without looking like I spent an hour getting ready to work in the hot Texas sun.  This product provides a fair amount of tint, so if you have very clear skin naturally, this may not be the product for you.  I, however, have some blotchy-ness and acne scars that require more cover.  This product provides the perfect level of cover and sheer in one bottle.  I also really enjoy only having one step: moisturizer, sunscreen and tint in 15 seconds.  I will continue to buy and use this product for the many days I need to look less \\&quot;done up\\&quot; without looking like I just got out of bed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of tinted moisturizers and as a rule I LOVE Aveno prouducts. To due skin cancer and using Renova, I have got to SPF my skin all year.&lt;br /&gt;I love Aveno products &amp; my skin lady uses them after treatment. I am a natural platinum blonde so i go from very pale in the winter to a light tan as the weather warms.&lt;br /&gt;In general, this is a good quality product with adequate coverage &amp; excellent SPF protection &amp;  while transparent it also evens out the complexion. I believe it has a powder base as this seems to sink into large pores and deep lines. TO avoid this, I put 3 drops of a higher SPF &amp;  mix it into the Aveno and then apply. This takes care of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the light and medium and mix the two together to get the perfect shade. I store it mixed in a clean glass baby food jar &amp; capped tight.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very thick and somewhat hard to apply, but it provides excellent coverage to hide blemishes and scars.  It&#x27;s like a thicker liquid foundation.  I have lighter skin with golden undertones and the Fair/Light was not too light at all.  It was actually a little darker than expected.  I have a daily moisturizer that I wear under makeup, so I only use this product for the purpose of a tinted sunscreen as needed.</li>
            <li> I used to use Neutrogena tinted moisturizer, but got away from using it a few years ago. I now need something light to even my skin tone (mid-40s), so I decided to use it again. I searched through two stores and could find only this Aveeno tinted moisturizer. I only wish it went on greasy - the bottle I bought goes on like spackling, or maybe drywall compound. I added a bit of my regular moisturizer over the top and tried to blend it in.  It spread more easily but didn&#x27;t fill in anything, or cover much. When I looked at my hand my finger prints from the tip of my fingers down to where it touched when I was spreading it were in positive relief - concealer on top, regular skin tone underneath. How can it conceal if it doesn&#x27;t fully fill in wrinkles, especially wrinkles as faint as a fingerprint???? I washed it all off and tried another approach, putting on my regular moisturizer first and then a light dab of the Aveeno tinted moisturizer. That went a lot better, but it still spread unevenly. I touched the tip of my two pinkie fingers into my regular moisturizer and tried to smooth the uneven smudges around my eyes.  I happened to brush my fingertips against my lower eyelids. After blinking a couple times, it transferred to my eyes.  Within seconds my eyes were stinging, watering, and were very, very bloodshot. That was the final straw. The store where I bought it said they would give me a full refund, so I took them up on it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;ve gotten my mom, grandmother, and sister hooked on it too!  I used to use a moisturizer then foundation, but now I can combine it into one step!  I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and this product doesn&#x27;t help in that regard. I look very shiny immediately after apply this and feel greasy all day. It will come off easily by sweating or if you get any water on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I suppose it would be great if you have dry skin. The color blends well and helps to even out redness. Even though this isn&#x27;t a foundation, it looks like one if you&#x27;re not careful on the amount you apply.</li>
            <li> I am extremely picky about my moisturizers. Before this product I was a strictly Clinique Moisture Surge kinda girl. To be honest though I still use a base moisturizer underneath this product. The main things I look for in anything I put on my face are: Is it weightless? Does it leave me feeling sticky? Does it have too strong of an odor? This product is one of two products I&#x27;ll use. I use it for it&#x27;s tint and it&#x27;s sunscreen, like I said I still use another moisturizer underneath it, but I have fairly dry skin. It has a scent but it goes away almost instantly when you put it on. It has great sun protection and I now use it every single day.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to blend in. The cream would roll up in little pills. Took a long time to apply to my face. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was SO disappointed in this product.  It is glitter mixed with moisturizer and foundation.  I would be a full-time user of this tinted moisturizer if it did NOT have the glitter.  Oily or Combo skin girls- AVOID THIS! Just make your own tinted moisturizer.  It is cheaper and you control what is in it.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and sensitive/dry skin in general and I was excited to try this product from Aveeno because I love their lotions. This cream dries out my face. :-( I guess I&#x27;m special in that it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Bought this today at Publix (our local grocery) on clearance for $8.00.  I really didnt need a sunscreen, just a tinted moisturizer as I dont like to wear foundation in Fla. in the hot humid season.  I read the other reviews and (1) The texture is due to the spf30 and quickly absorbs into the skin.  (2) Dont buy this if you have very dry skin as it is a lighweight moisturizer.  The fair to light works fine for me.</li>
            <li> I mean, where is the moisturizer in this stuff? And its way too tinted. I&#x27;m spoiled with Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless Restoratives tinted moisturizer, but it can be hard to find so I tried this. What a let down. Did nothing for my skin (moisturize, smooth, etc) and went on like a liquid foundation. It settled into fine lines and was hard to spread around (because my skin was dry underneath this).  I guess if you are looking for a full replacement to your makeup and you don&#x27;t need hardly any moisturizer, this might be ok, but I was unimpressed.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying this by accident without realizing it was tinted. I was very dismayed the first time I used it, especially because it is SO dark &amp; makeup looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**THEN I tried putting on my other moisturizer (Aveeno Active Naturals Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer spf 15) before, &amp; only dabbed the Tinted Moisturizer on after. It works perfectly! With the combination of the two moisturizes (the spf 30 being thicker) my skin is so soft &amp; moisturized! I especially love how my skin has the very subtle, polished look usually only accomplished with makeup. But since I hate makeup this is much better &amp; actually healthy for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin but using only these two products (plus Aveeno Ultra-Calming Moisturizing Cream Cleanser every morning &amp; night) my skin is smooth &amp; soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUESTION: Since it&#x27;s winter &amp; so dry I&#x27;ve even started using the moisturizers at night which my skin seems to really like. But I wanted to try an actual night moisturizer (preferably Aveeno since my skin seems to really like it).&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone have any suggestions for fair, sensitive skin?? THANKS!</li>
            <li> I really like the coverage of this product. It is more of a CC cream than a tinted moisturizer. Great coverage though! I found my go to product!!</li>
            <li> Some reviews mention how thick the product is. It does look thick when I first pump it out, but it melts and blends beautifully into my skin. I use 2 1/2 - 3 pumps and apply it all over my face. This isn&#x27;t a product you dab lightly in spots (like some moisturizers) and then expect it to blend, cover and moisturize your whole face. You need to use a decent amount and smooth it all over your face. It also looks far too light when I first pump it out, but once I apply the product it blends *perfectly* with my skin. I think the description of fair to light is very accurate. If you have more of a light to medium skin tone I would try the medium color (or blend the two). It provides very sheer coverage and provides a subtle brightening effect. It also relieves any tightness or dryness I feel after washing my face. It makes my skin look beautiful. Perfect for the morning when I wash my face and want to put something on, but *not* a heavy foundation. A little concealer under my eyes, some blush, a coat of mascara and lip-gloss and I&#x27;m good to go. I also love how it isn&#x27;t a typical, greasy tinted moisturizer. The more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried end up making my face look like a grease slick. This product is completely different. I absolutely love it and will use it for as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> I have great experiences with aveeno and this just added to it.  Goes on clear, smooth, even and light?  I use it for when I go on long runs or hiking for sunscreen and cover up.</li>
            <li> I have this tinted moisturizer in light/fair and I thought it was decent, but not great. It has a lot of sparkles in it, and I find that they rub off easily. At first I didn&#x27;t notice the sparkles, and thought I was secretly a stripper at night(Sleep stripping?). Turns out it was this product. The bottle is very poorly designed; product builds up on the outside, and then dries up, and has to be removed. It&#x27;s kind of gross. It wastes product, too. I ended up discontinuing use of this product before I ran out, because of how much glitter it contains.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t moisturize, didn&#x27;t even out my skin tone, and kinda burned a little. Not to mention, it made my face so SHINY. Powder could not tone that shine down. I&#x27;ll try something else.</li>
            <li> This is greasy when it goes on, and didn&#x27;t balance the uneven skin tones in face.  It&#x27;s like a blob of melted butter.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the kind of product I normally review, but I am so impressed with it that I decided to do it anyway. At first I wasn&#x27;t quite sure if I liked it, but then I realized 1. I have to use less than I would if it was regular foundation, and 2. I have to \\&quot;set\\&quot; it with pressed powder or it leaves my face shiny. After those two discoveries, WOW! This will leave you with even-toned, healthy-looking skin without giving you \\&quot;make-up face\\&quot;. And after using it for a few weeks, my skin is looking healthier all around, even once I wash it off at night. Fantastic product, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this tinted moisturizer! I was looking for a product that would give me sun protection, moisture, and color...all in one.  This is it!  It matches my skin tone beautifully, without shine. I find that I can do away with face powder, as this product leaves only a subtle, healthy glow to the skin, with the same feel as the pricey \\&quot;mineral\\&quot; makeups. It does not feel thick or heavy on the skin, and gives a perfect base for applying eyebrow pencil, blush, etc. It saves me time in front of the mirror each day, and actually saves me money, when I consider the price of moisturizer with sunscreen, plus liquid makeup, plus face powder! I highly recommend that you give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have light very light skin with lots of freckles. I think most foundations and powders make me look washed out and cakey. But this stuff makes my skin look great.    This is all i wear for a nice even and natural look. It&#x27;s not heavy and a little goes a long way. It evens out my skin tone and helps cover problem areas without looking over done.     The only con is that the pump doesn&#x27;t work very well, but that may just be my bottle.</li>
            <li> I saw a TV commercial for this product a couple months back &amp; thought, \\&quot;that&#x27;s what I need, instead of applying sunscreen &amp; makeup separately!\\&quot;  Not being much of a \\&quot;girly-girl\\&quot;, this was the first time I&#x27;d heard of tinted moisturizers.  After a little searching (Target to the rescue!) I found it.      My skin is prone to breakouts, so I was worried it might cause pimples, but after 2 months of daily use it has not.  In fact, I&#x27;d say my bare skin looks healthier overall.  I also have some mild sun damage/pigmentation, which is why I can&#x27;t go without makeup, and this product covers it right up.  The only thing I add is a touch of concealer on any pimples or really dark spots, and lipstick.  No powder needed.  (I like a somewhat natural look &amp; dislike fussing too much with my appearance).  If I&#x27;m dressing up, I sweep a little blush over my cheeks &amp; eyelids and I look totally finished without being overly \\&quot;made-up\\&quot;, in only a couple of steps. It&#x27;s not shiny, sparkly, or cakey, just NICE!     The only con could be the color -- this shade is perfect for me but I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself the \\&quot;fairest of the fair\\&quot;.  It could be too dark for really light-skinned ladies, and I think this is the lightest shade available.  I hope Aveno never stops making this product, because it took me YEARS to find something that works so well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not CC cream. It&#x27;s just the tinted moisturizer. It&#x27;s not very moisturizing either &#x3D;/ my face feels crispy after using it so I still have to apply some lotion. It&#x27;s also a little dark for me but I&#x27;m very very fair skinned. Good coverage though.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, good for summer</li>
            <li> Really great light tinted moisturizer. Perfect for pale winter skin! Product shipped really quick and as described.</li>
            <li> I like the way this looks on my face.  The tenting is just short of make-up. Unfortunately, the jury is out as I had some breaking out after first few uses.  Not sure if it&#x27;s related to the product or something else.  Will wait to clear up and then try again.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all! Which is surprising because usually Aveeno has really great products, I love their oatmeal baths.  But this moisturizer goes on weird... it does not blend nicely into the skin.  It is too thick and NOT moisturizing enough.  Would not recommend.  I recommend Neutrogena tinted moisture.</li>
            <li> This works great as a makeup and as a moisturizer, make you skin look perfect not too shiny not to matte, it&#x27;s just great if you are looking for a natural look and fair means fair, not chalky white</li>
            <li> It looked heavy and fake, without actually providing any coverage or evening skin tone. Yuck.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product last week from Walmart &amp; love it! I have very fair skin &amp; hate to wear a lot of foundation bc it&#x27;s so hard to match my skin tone. I put this on w a little powder &amp; it&#x27;s perfect! &amp; it looks so natural. Plus it has SPF !&lt;br /&gt;Like I said I&#x27;m Very fair &amp; the light to medium is perfect for me. So I understand people w a darker skin tone would need a darker shade. But I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s coming:-)&lt;br /&gt;I would &amp; will recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product in place of makeup for a while now. I always get compliments on my skin and haven&#x27;t seen a breakout in years! Highly recommend replacing foundation with this. Aveeno is the only tinted moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my face shiny and blends in perfectly with my fair skin tone.</li>
            <li> It covers the red in my complexion. The color is sheer and natural, which is why I like it. It IS a bit shiny, so to counteract shine, I put a little layer of either loose translucent powder on top, or translucent compact powder.</li>
            <li> Different than &amp;#34;same&amp;#34; lotion I bought a year ago. Lighter and less coverage. Also, they offer far fewer shades so I can&#x27;t quite get the right color. Might try something else.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn foundation in five years because 1) I break out super easy, which creates a nasty cycle. 2) I work up such a sweat at work that I end up a mess.&lt;br /&gt;This tinted moisturizer is perfect. It&#x27;s so light that it doesn&#x27;t wash me out and force me to apply eyebrows and rouge. Also hasn&#x27;t brought out my acne prone skin. It sweats off some, but the coverage is so subtle that you don&#x27;t notice big soupy streaks. Amazing.</li>
            <li> Product is not greasy and has a nice tint to it. Works great under my makeup and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or look shiny.</li>
            <li> Great product. I mix it w orher moisturizer bc color is strong. Unscented, smooth, nice.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd tinted moisturizer that I&#x27;ve tried and the first one that I&#x27;ve been pleased with. I&#x27;m fairly light skinned with dark hair and I found that the color works well for me. The formula is a tiny bit thick compared to a traditional moisturizer so I apply moisturizer first and then use this to even out my skin tone. The product works wonderfully. Iapply a cream blush over my ccheeks and then I set it with powder and it looks wonderful all day. The overall look is light, natural, and lovely.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought this, and she has a sexy latina brown skin color in which this product worked out great!!</li>
            <li> Use this moisturizer every day.  Gives me good sun protection and just enough tint to smooth out my complexion just enough.  I really like this stuff.  Essentially my moisturizer and foundation all in one!  I like to keep life simple and this just fits right in.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I both have very fair skin that&#x27;s prone to redness. Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moist is a little too orange and shiny on its own. But mixed with Eucerin Redness Relief moisturizer, it&#x27;s the perfect moisturizer to cover up small imperfections, reduce redness, and provide a natural-looking tone. By itself on my boyfriend, it looks like he&#x27;s wearing some sort of shimmery makeup. But mixed with the Eucerin Redness Relief (which is green in color), it looks very neutral and natural. I also love the SPF 30!</li>
            <li> I like it. Bought it to replace Neutrogena tinted lotion which was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Really light, goes on evenly and blends nicely. Evens out my skin tone and really does have those reflective minerals mentioned :) I have to make a concious effort to use a little bit after having used other moisturisers because this stuff goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have combination acne-prone skin that needs coverage and some moisture without making oily spots even oilier, and make-up always breaks me out and never seems to look good. But I&#x27;m really enjoying this tinted moisturizer. Its creamy and silky, applies smoothly (I have no idea what happened to the bottles the other reviewers used, because this has never felt cakey or dry to me). If anything, this moisturizer is too moisturizing and rich! I use just a little bit, and while it&#x27;s not thick or full coverage like foundation, I get to even my skin tone and minimize my acne without getting break outs. It looks really natural and nice.  One trick though, is to use a light finish/setting powder on top of it, like you would over normal makeup. I tried that, and it gets rid of the oily sheen on my forehead, and helps keep the moisturizer on all-day. It looks great and feels really nice. I&#x27;m so glad I found it! This is the best, most natural looking tinted moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried yet!</li>
            <li> This review is for the CC Cream.  I&#x27;m allergic to aspirin, which means I can&#x27;t use anything with salicylic acid in it.  The CC Cream contains two active ingredients - homosalate and octisalate - that are esters of salicylic acid; after just two uses of the product, my face turned into one massive rash.  It&#x27;s too bad - I like the coverage, and the color is nice and natural, but you absolutely shouldn&#x27;t use this if you have an aspirin allergy.</li>
            <li> I love this product, for its SPF quality as well as the light coverage it provides.  It goes on smoothly and I use it every morning after I wash my face.  It blends seamlessly with my skin color and provides a good base for my makeup.</li>
            <li> Great tinted moisturizer with spf protection.  Much better price than CVS.</li>
            <li> Great for my skin.  This was recommended by a friend and it is fantastic.  Keeps the skin  soft with just a hint of color.  Will recommend and definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> the texture is really think and does not blend really well. It also feels really dry. Feels like a  normal foundation. Nothing really moisturizing about it. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a recommendation in a youtube video - I have tried a variety of BB and regular creams and this one rocks. It isn&#x27;t oily and doesn&#x27;t dry my face out. The coverage is awesome - hides imperfections evens redness, and it last pretty much all day without caking or getting shiny.</li>
            <li> Aveeno has done it again!  Positively Radiant, is just that! My skin looks much more radiant and I love that it has a tint to it.</li>
            <li> Do not feel comfortable wearing this product.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it is something you have to get used to but I keep pushing it back in the drawer.</li>
            <li> made my skin look oily. and the color was a bit too orangey for my skin. Try garnier bb cream instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this product for a one step foundation, moisturizer and sunscreen.  Goes on smooth and sheer.  Not cakey.</li>
            <li> works as a wonderful foundation and sunblock. I like to wear both in the sunny months and this combines those products.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is actually cheaper to buy it on Amazon then elsewhere. It smoothes out your face, and I love it for when I am rushing around in the morning.</li>
            <li> While I like the actual product I don&#x27;t like that every time that I go to use it a portion of what I squeeze out is dry.  I have to separate the dry portion from the rest before applying to my face.</li>
            <li> **Update from my last review: I absolutely love this stuff! Yes, the price has gone up a little, but most things have. I have no complaints about this product, and I have substituted with other products on impulse in order to save money and/or try something different. All that did was solidify that I love this product. Aveeno products are consistently known for being gentle yet effective products. Almost all of my skincare regimen is Aveeno and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It&#x27;s best to purchase from Amazon, especially when you have Prime membership which just makes it even more awesome. I use this as a daily moisturizer and a foundation for makeup. It provides just enough cover up to even my skin tone without leaving residue, buildup, or causing my skin to feel weighed down. Regardless of the weather, it doesn&#x27;t wear off either. It provides sunscreen, and overall continually moisturizes my skin during the harsh cold season and dry summer season also. This product won&#x27;t ever let you down!**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my teens into my early thirties now, I still have combination/oily skin that is incredibly sensitive to the point where it becomes bothersome. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and for good reason!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a quick morning makeup routine that would even out my skin tone, provide sunscreen, Moisturize and of course simple to use. I&#x27;ve tried many, and this is the only product that works best for me. It blends in smoothly (I have very fair skin so that&#x27;s the shade I choose). I use 1 pump and it&#x27;s more than enough to cover my entire face evenly, not too much and not too little. A little pressed powder and lipstick, and I&#x27;m done!! Now, for the important reasons why I chose this brand over all the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makeup  tends to be too heavy, which causes my already oily prone skin to feel weighed down.  Others are too light, fading away into oblivion before I walk out the door in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has multiple benefits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Alittle goes a long way, so the cost really isn&#x27;t an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It contains sunscreen so my skin is protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It&#x27;s dermatologist recommended, so I can trust that it&#x27;s safe for my sensitive skin because  it&#x27;s free from harsh irritants (everything says &#x27;dermatologist recommended&#x27;, so I did research to confirm it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) It&#x27;s hypoallergenic. This ties in with reason #3, but this is a completely separate issue for me. Having sensitive skin requires a product that&#x27;s hypoallergenic. If it&#x27;s truly not, who knows what in it? I don&#x27;t like taking those kinds of risks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years and going this product will always be part of my morning makeup routine.</li>
            <li> I used this everyday all year. It gives my skin a glow and covers differences in your skin. And, it has SPF 30 which is a plus. It is a cover up, but very light in coloring. I don&#x27;t wear any makeup over it.</li>
            <li> This is my absolutely favorite tinted moisturizer for daily use.  It has tiny little &amp;#34;light reflectors&amp;#34; that make you look more awake that you really are.  It&#x27;s really sheer, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars if it hadn&#x27;t been so hard to get the pump working. It was so thick I had to open the bottle up and stir it for quite a while to get it flowing enough to work.</li>
            <li> There are mixed reviews on this. My take, it is very much like a light foundation. I put on their POSITIVELY RADIANT®  Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 15 first and then this on top. If you use it without moisturizer it will go on dry and cake-like.</li>
            <li> perfect in every way including the priceit&#x27;s one layer it&#x27;s all you need keeps its soft naturalnot cakey perfect balance</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really color correct like it should</li>
            <li> Does not do much to conceal wrinkles. But it does help even out skin and provides protection as a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of this BB cream, because I have very pale skin, and this color is too orange for me. Also, there&#x27;s just too much color in it, so it &amp;#34;gets stuck&amp;#34; in my eyebrows, turning them all orange!&lt;br /&gt;I prefer something with less color, like the ones from Covergirl or Maybeline.</li>
            <li> Love this product, just the right amount of coverage. Good color and moisture, wish it had more sunscreen. Love it though.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin (natural redhead) and ordered this in the lightest shade available, &amp;#34;fair to light,&amp;#34; after reading some product reviews from others with fair skin claiming the product went well with their skin tone. Unfortunately, my skin is about a shade too light for this product, which ended up being very obviously the wrong tone when I tried it on my face. I can&#x27;t say much about the quality of the product as I didn&#x27;t keep it on for very long. However, it did seem heavier than I had anticipated it being as I was applying it. I&#x27;d say that when compared with drugstore bb creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past, this tends to apply a bit more thickly.</li>
            <li> Covers well enough and does not cause my skin to break out.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly enough so everything was fine in that respect but I just feel it doesn&#x27;t blend very well. Especially if it mixes with any other product. And the colors are light enough (or probably dark enough) for some people. It&#x27;s just very mediocre. Not awful and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it but somewhere in between.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love the Aveeno Positively Radiant (non-tinted) moisturizer that is SPF 15 and now that winter is here, my pale skin needs some color. I also use the Jergens Natural Glow facial moisturizer, but it just doesn&#x27;t keep my makeup in place throughout the day like Aveeno does. So, I bought this product thinking it was more like a gradual tanner. At first I was taken aback when I saw how thick the lotion is but I am pleasantly surprised. The Fair to Light is perfect for my skin and it evens it out nicely before I apply my daily makeup. I&#x27;ve typically tried BB creams in the past for this purpose but they all make me break out. I&#x27;d highly recommend this over a BB cream. Great product!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It is tinted, but not so much that you look like you have makeup on.  Really nice!</li>
            <li> I had tried several foundations that promised to be light diffusing, light reflecting. In short I was looking for something that would look natural. This isn&#x27;t described as a foundation but that&#x27;s how I use it. Put this on, get excellent even tone with some moisture that isn&#x27;t greasy and that looks natural. Over it I put neutrogena mineral sheer make up and I get such a natural but evened out look its difficult to put into words. Takes a bit to blend, stick with it, give it a minute to \\&quot;settle\\&quot; and you will be pleased. I am very fair and use the light to medium. I also get redness. This manages to tone that down without upsetting my sensitive skin. Will be a permanent fixture in my make up case-- goes with me everywhere. I use tazorac at night so i get lots of dryness. This helps without being greasy but may not be moisturizing enough for everyone. Best part is it controls my oiliness and doesn&#x27;t break down the way some foundations do. And it&#x27;s SPF 30!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat that.  It&#x27;s thicker than other moisturizers but it also has the light makeup in it.  It goes on nicely and is not a heavy coverage light foundation.  Very nice and smooth.  My skin is quite fair and this provides just enough color.</li>
            <li> It gives great sun protection.  The tint is just enough for hose days I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t want to put on foundation.  It gives my skin a nice smooth even tone some would even say it glows ;)</li>
            <li> I buy this repeatedly.  Just enough coverage, and I use it all year.  I put on moisturizer around my eyes first, let it dry, then use this product.  It lasts all day.  I bought some Garnier BB cream to compare.  I returned the BB cream because it did not have enough coverage to even out my skin tone. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been paying $30 a tube for Tarte tinted moisturizer and decided to give this drugstore version a try. I love it! It&#x27;s perfect for every day use and I use my Tarte tube when I want more coverage. My only complaint is that each time you use it, a bit of product dries up in the narrow dispenser overnight and comes out with the new pump. But it&#x27;s easy to remove the clumpy bit.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me as I hate wearing makeup and sorta have dry skin. This gives great moisture, fairly good coverage, and spf all in 1. It no joke makes you look more radiant. I always get compliments on my skin when I have it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note not related to the product itself but more for the seller: I ordered the product New and received an already opened obviously not new product. I expect new when I order new and was let down.</li>
            <li> Love this.  I am 61 years old and find that regular foundation likes to accentuate my wrinkles, so I&#x27;ve gone to using tinted moisturizer and I really like this one.</li>
            <li> It comes in a Pump bottle which tends to clog, all pumps do, so just shake it a lot each time before you use it and don&#x27;t leave it in a cold place. If you put a single small drop on your first and middle finger and pat that on here and there then blend it, you won&#x27;t overuse the product. It is Easy to overuse it, a little goes a very long way. It&#x27;s not like hand lotion it&#x27;s more like the amount of a good serum you would use. Pretend it is Very expensive and start with that amount :) You still get the same coverage whether using a lot or a little. And the coverage is excellent, it really surprised me. I think it is the best I ever bought, next to Dermablend, which is professional grade tattoo hiding strength. This Aveeno is Not transparent, it is opaque. It covers freckles, some age spots, some blotches, with one dab, which is very good for such a light product. Try letting it dry completely before using more, then you can do a dab just here and there where it requires more coverage. I wouldn&#x27;t waste the product using a sponge or cloth or pad to apply it-- your fingers are best, I think so anyway. Completely hypoallergenic, BUT it has some slight smell to it, which the Aveeno lotions do not. My eyes are very sensitive but I use this tint right up to the lash line and it has Never bothered me, even with the slight smell, so I guess that means it is some hypoallergenic smell :) heck, I don&#x27;t know! Just know it doesn&#x27;t bug me at all. Once the product is dry, like 30 seconds or so, it doesn&#x27;t rub off on yr clothes or anything else, and I notice when I remove it at night, there is still a lot of color on the cloth, so it is fer sure lasting all day. I still have to use Dermablend on serious blotches but did not expect this Aveeno product to replace it. Overall, I am extremely pleased with this tinted sunblock moisturizer. It is what I bought to replace Ti-SILC when they messed with the formula, and I notice it is thicker than TiS and also covers better. Remove with washcloth and plain water if you are not fussy.</li>
            <li> Used for several years.  Just the right amount of tint and really take care of my skin.</li>
            <li> I work full time and go to school at night so I was looking for a product that I could throw on in a hurry that was able to stand in place of make up. I have combination skin so a moisturizer was just what I was looking for. At first I LOVED this product! It covered quiet well and was very moisturizing. However, I only wore it for 4-5 hours at a time while I was in class. I later tried it on a weekend and noticed I had some minor break outs. The more I used it the more I broke out. Then I noticed there is SHIMMER in it! If you have acne shimmer will accentuate your break outs. Awful!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Coverage; Not quite as good as make up but able to stand in&lt;br /&gt;Smell; VERY light smell of sun tan lotion, other than that unscented&lt;br /&gt;Feel; It goes on pretty thick but absorbs into the skin well so you don&#x27;t feel too greasy. Heavier than my normal face lotion, though&lt;br /&gt;SPF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;SHIMMER!&lt;br /&gt;Caused break outs</li>
            <li> covers well, so creamy and not drippy at all. pretty color and coverage is excellent. doesn&#x27;t rub off or oil up like makeup. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This tinted sunscreen is great. I&#x27;ve been using the much more expensive Aveda, and I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try Aveeno. It smells nice, goes on easily, and a little goes a long way. I love that the SPF is also much higher than the Aveda SPF. The fair-light shade is perfect for my pinkish skin tone. I&#x27;m so glad I found this!!</li>
            <li> I have to use sunblock everyday and this takes care of everything.  The tint is just enough to give me a smooth glow.  I have been using this for three years.  I think it is a great product.</li>
