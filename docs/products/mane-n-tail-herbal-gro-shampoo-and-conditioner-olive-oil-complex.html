            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my hair feel!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>My hair has never been more beautiful, healthy and luxurious.</li>
            <li>Loved it :)) Need to buy more !</li>
            <li>but but the smell of both the shampoo &amp; conditioner is amazing .</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing smell, hairs growing nicely.</li>
            <li>amazing product, have been using it for a while now</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>I will try and buy more of this because my hair looked so good.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really tell a difference in my hair but smells wonderful !</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never have had problems with any hair product of any kind before</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but that&#x27;s about all it has going for it.</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars instead of one because it smells nice.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner work great at protecting my hair and taming my texture; I don&#x27;t have to use a lot and use it up to 3x per week, especially after swimming and working out -- it would probably be a great summer duo!</li>
            <li>It also has a nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li>They use it on their own hair for growth and softness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the reg kind in the passed</li>
            <li>my hair has so much volume &amp; beautiful!!!!!</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know if this stuff works on humans, but I figured it could not hurt to use on my St.Bernard who has a severe type of dermatitis which no shots, steroids, diet or pill could control.</li>
            <li>Just looking to grow it out nicely.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would help my hair a ton...</li>
            <li>It smells nice and seemed to make my hair shiny</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look nice and it has helped my hair look nicer</li>
            <li>It is a nice combination for my hair.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve used Mane &amp; Tail on my horses and always noticed that this product leaves a nice softness and sheen</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used mane n tail before and loved it but the herbal gro is even better.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to see any change in the length of my hair yet, but it makes my hair feel so healthy!</li>
            <li>The smell of this product is wonderful and makes your hair soft to the touch!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky soft, smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF IS AMAZING MY HAIR HAS NEVER BEEN SO HEALTHY</li>
            <li>This is even better because it smells so nice.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo leaves hair fresh</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my own hair</li>
            <li>I can tell a huge difference and it smells so good</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>Stuff was good, but i like the original mane and tail better.</li>
            <li>I love this product and my order came in very quickly!</li>
            <li>and I can tell a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li>This stuff does everything it says it does, I am so pleased.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a wonderful product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m noticing a bit difference already, even though I change between this one and healthy sexy hair.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it&#x27;s gradually helping.</li>
            <li>but now that I see it.. I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>if ur looking for lengthy healthy feeling hair i would just start taking a biotin vitamin and using oil treatments at night.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>, it makes my hair feel really healthy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m noticing stronger ends and more volume.</li>
            <li>It feels healthy and it&#x27;s getting longer,</li>
            <li>I really love using this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before and it still is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Keeps hair healthy for sure.</li>
            <li>but love the way this transforms your hair</li>
            <li>many noticed not as many pieces were falling in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The conditioner doesn&#x27;t glide through hair like many others..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so  much better.  </li>
            <li>Not even sure if my hair is growing...</li>
            <li>I love these products</li>
            <li>I love the way it strengthens my hair</li>
            <li>and  makes it look so healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with it, my hair looks healthier and stays cleaner longer...will be re-ordering as needed</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The herbal shampoo was okay.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo may work better for someone else, depending on their hair texture and porosity.  </li>
            <li>For my hair, the conditioner only is perfect.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loves the scent and my beard looks and feels healthy</li>
            <li>but I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>just makes it appear to have more texture and volume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe though,</li>
            <li>I love the look and the feel of my hair after using this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I decided to give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, it can be drying but my hair grows like a weed.</li>
            <li>Love love LOVE 😍😍</li>
            <li>the smell is okay</li>
            <li>I absolutely love his shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the health it gave my hair</li>
            <li>Maybe if used a lot more</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nothing that you smell frolicking through the daisys, ok?</li>
            <li>I truly love the feeling of my hair after using this product for about five days now.</li>
            <li>I love this product bc</li>
            <li>I did not notice any hair growth, but maybe it needs more time.</li>
            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>AHHHH I LOVE</li>
            <li>Didnt make it that much better with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a light scent, which I find nice.</li>
            <li>But, im not in love with this one.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, I&#x27;m definitely buying this again.</li>
            <li>it was okay</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m giving it more time to see if it&#x27;s truly beneficial for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I love that it helps grow hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to order more of this stuff</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>Love the way my hair feels after using this product</li>
            <li>The products all work well, they are helping maintain a healthy balance for my hair.</li>
            <li>but I notice my hair grow more</li>
            <li>I tried just the shampoo on her and within a week her dermatitis had cleared up and today her coat is so healthy that we now have people coming up to us</li>
            <li>It made my hair tangle more</li>
            <li>I was expecting my hair to be more conditioned.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff , my hair has grown 5 inches in 2 months.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>On top of all that my hair shines like it used to.  </li>
            <li>Had to switch to make sure it was the set, and it was.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased it again.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps. :)</li>
            <li>I love the product but when I received it the conditioner had somehow opened in the packaging and was all over the bottle</li>
            <li>I used it 4 times and it was not getting better.</li>
            <li>I would recommend a better conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Hair so far is silky smooth and beautiful!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and size of this but please be warned that this shampoo is not for color treated hair and WILL RUIN your dye job.  </li>
            <li>(I have been coloring my hair for years btw) and my hair has never felt softer I love it</li>
            <li>Can probably find them somewhere else cheaper, which I will be doing because I love the shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>Also seems to be helping with the split ends. :)</li>
            <li>I truly love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>An inch in a month is more than my hair has grown</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>but I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>If I can update this, I will when I know for sure...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make magic.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the moisture that is added to my hair and not the oily feeling.</li>

            <li>Really does grow your hair!! :)</li>
            <li>I have used this twice and already notice a huge difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>But now, my waves are relaxed, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my daughter and her hair looks great and has grown quite a bit in a short time.  </li>
            <li>Beware, if you are searching for Sulfate free products.</li>
            <li>She says it makes her hair so smooth and manageable.  </li>
            <li>so I like to make every bit last lol</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and is very conditioning.</li>
            <li>you want an all natural shampoo that smells great, I suppose it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>But all in all I&#x27;m loving it so far and can&#x27;t wait to see more results.</li>
            <li>It smells good and it makes my hair soft</li>
            <li>if your looking for something good get the deep moisturizing one :)</li>
            <li>Smells so good and makes your hair extremely soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does smell wonderful, and I can see why people love it, just not a good fit for everyone.</li>
            <li>I was using the original Mane &#x27;n Tail</li>
            <li>I was really excited because some of the reviews said this shampoo helped them stop shedding, and helped with hair growth.  </li>
            <li>Did not notice significant hair growth.</li>
            <li>Excited to see the results in a months time.  </li>
            <li>I have to use my original conditioner then apply the mane n tail conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li>My opinion was It&#x27;s cheap and full of alcohol and sulfates.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product and start using it.</li>
            <li>Ive been using thid product for 3 months &amp;Nothing amazing so far, advertisers &amp; resellers are more than capable of hyping up, exaggerating any product to push a quick sell, buyer beware, save your $money for a better quality product.</li>
            <li>They are great for my extremely dry hair.</li>
            <li>If you have dry hair, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>The shampoo didn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li>Love this, I was a skeptic even after reading all the positive reviews</li>
            <li>Smells nice and makes my hair soft!</li>
            <li>It always feel dry and course, but after trying this, even after one wash my hair felt so much more healthy!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and silky and the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>I love this set so much because it is infused with olive oil which makes the hair grow.</li>
            <li>It kind of melts like water and does not make your hair soft.</li>
            <li>Cool stuff.</li>
            <li>My friends were going to buy this but thanks to how my order came, they won&#x27;t be satisfied.</li>
            <li>Thanks anyway :)</li>
            <li>It makes your hair so healthy that it really seems to grow faster.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo it really work</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy brown hair and when I used it along with Aussie or Pantene, I saw the best results.</li>
            <li>seems to be a good deal, but when i received the item its only about 3/4 full...</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ll if u think about it 12 dollars for shampoo and conditioner is not bad</li>
            <li>NOT loike the original main and tail which I love.</li>
            <li>Although it does have sulfate and alcohol, somehow it helped my son&#x27;s dry, brittle hair immediately and it smells amazing!  </li>
            <li>I used the original Mane &#x27;n Tail a long time ago and loved it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these really help with Gro-ing hair much at all, but they are nicely scented and leave my hair feeling good enough.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it helps it grow yet, if it does I will update this review, but at any rate I am very happy with it and will make this my regular shampoo and conditioner and as long as it stays available I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>The mane&#x27; n tail shampoo and conditions have your hair smell so nice not greasy and soft not hard have to give it more time to see if it grow my hair try it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is a combo of clean, floral and fresh, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>Her hair is super shiney, thicker and stronger.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me genetically</li>
            <li>I will be a loyal Mane &#x27;n Tail user forever.  </li>
            <li>I liked the herbal smell but this really didn&#x27;t do much for me or my hair.</li>
            <li>I love Main &#x27;n Tail, but something about the texture of this stuff had me glad to return to my normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>Pretty cheap looking stuff however.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very pleased with the initial results.</li>
            <li>my hair doesn&#x27;t grow very fast at all!</li>
            <li>Came quickly and pretty well packaged!</li>
            <li>I am growing out a pixie cut and trying to get to a respectable length before the start of a new school year.</li>
            <li>I have used mane n&#x27; tail in the past and loved it, so I figured I would love this as well.</li>
            <li>Definitely helped with my hair growth for sure!</li>
            <li>My hair has grown an inch since starting this product about a month ago love it!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it,  during the conditioning I pulled out literally 2 hand fulls of hair!  </li>
            <li>I felt results after the first wash!</li>
            <li>recommended this product really works!!</li>
            <li>I recently got highlights and these hair products keep it strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>It actually cleans my hair and makes it smell super nice.</li>
            <li>my hair is so smooth and straight now...</li>
            <li>I did find one that doesn&#x27;t and have been happy with it (with hair that isn&#x27;t as dried out).</li>
            <li>the shampoo smells great and leaves my thick, wavy hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Nice as an extra shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>My hair is getting fuller and I love my natural hair since.  </li>
            <li>my hair is so soft &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li>My luscious flow is golden</li>
            <li>After two times of using it i have noticed getting a lot of dandruff and my hair loss is even worth than before.</li>
            <li>I ordered Mane &#x27;n Tail Gro Shampoo and Conditioner Olive Oil Complex because I always heard great things about the original Mane &#x27;n Tail.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super soft, manageable, &amp; easy to comb.</li>
            <li>Many thanks to you Main and</li>
            <li>If nothing else, my itchy scalp is gone, my hair is not nearly as oily, my hair is softer and more manageable, and my hair just feels lighter!</li>
            <li>But at least it smells good!</li>
            <li>so all I can say is they were right.</li>
            <li>Upon getting these bottles I had to try them right</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but it&#x27;s healthy and moisturized as I don&#x27;t blow dry or heat style.</li>
            <li>but if your like me and use a lot of conditioner it goes fast other wise not a bad product</li>
            <li>Hair is very full of body and soft.</li>
            <li>Bottles are super small and the regular kind works just as good for a LOT cheaper.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure this stuff made my hair grow at much faster rate than normal.</li>
            <li>Id say stick with the original main and tail shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I bought this because many other reviews claimed it helped their hair stay strong and</li>
            <li>We are so amazed how much more superior Mane &amp; Tail is over all the other same type of hair products out on the market.</li>
            <li>I tried the product for the first time and noticed a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>Left my hair clean and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The smell is also so nice and delicate, I love it.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely give these a try if you want to grow your hair NATURALLY, and if you want to smell good in the process.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>This item was shipped very, very fast.</li>
            <li>I had baby fine hair for my young hair and this isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Really see it working!</li>
            <li>My hair has grown an inch in just the first month of use.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Regular more</li>
            <li>After consistent use of this for three months, it started going downhill.  </li>
            <li>Really does the work!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product for someone who is looking to help their hair grow healthy and shiny while they are in the process of growing it out.</li>
            <li>It was an okay product, but I&#x27;d didn&#x27;t last but 2 weeks</li>
            <li>work better for different hair types..</li>
            <li>I wonder if Mane n&#x27; Tail&#x27;s deep conditioner would be a better bet.</li>
            <li>I was very upset when I got my ordered because instead of getting the shampoo &amp; conditioner I got 2 shampoo!</li>
            <li>We received the shampoo in short order and were pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>it leaves my hair so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>but using this after the first shampoo i could feel and see a difference.</li>
            <li>(Are all these 5 star reviews for real?!)</li>
            <li>but it really has!</li>
            <li>which was my first thought with anything herbal.</li>
            <li>The first time I rinsed my hair</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Seems to be helping with the hair growth, Love the shampoo just wished I&#x27;d have looked more closely at the size, pretty small for 14-- for the pair.</li>
            <li>And I recently bought the spray therapy to apply to the top of my head.</li>
            <li>Love the way my scalp feels, I have only been using it for a week</li>
            <li>this is my first time trying the Herbal Gro...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>I swear it makes my hair grow much faster!</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve recently cut my hair again (shaved all around with some length on top) and I&#x27;ve changed my mind about it</li>
            <li>The look of my hair is fuller, and it has definitely grown in length more quickly than normal.</li>
            <li>I buy this specific pair because it has olive oil complex in it, which is wonderful for your hair and makes it smooth, soft, and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if nail growth is common, but it&#x27;s nice!</li>
            <li>I am a hair stylist and tried pretty much everything</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about that but good quality shampoo and conditioner either way.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderfully fresh and clean scent as well!!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li>and it was overall easy to brush.</li>
            <li>If you have super natural curly hair I recommend this.</li>
            <li>My hair has been super soft since I have been using it.</li>
            <li>just yet I love what whether I have my curly or dry it straight</li>
            <li>My hair does feel thicker (I have fine hair), only wish the conditioner was richer.</li>
            <li>Also I recommend the leave in conditioner main n tail herbal gro add some on before blow drying your hair!</li>
            <li>She has very dry brittle hair and this has given her a lot more shine and body.</li>
            <li>It gives your hair a nice shine but it weighs thin, fine hairs</li>
            <li>I received it with a huge white sticker that said &amp;#34;Keep these products together&amp;#34; and a bunch of tape wrapped around it.</li>
            <li>If you want natural results, it takes time and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay shampoo although even after conditioning my hair felt rough and tangled.</li>
            <li>Really adds volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>When it is time to use this one, I lose twice as much hair in the shower.</li>
            <li>I have noticed the conditioning effect, not so much the length.</li>
            <li>but I do feel like my hair is growing fast ish</li>
            <li>like it my hair gro fast</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather up as much as I would like, but that will just take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully I didn&#x27;t pay as much here as her friends at the store, because we gave it away.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo has sulfates in it which are very drying to begin with and</li>
            <li>Our hair was very knotty when using this product and the ends of my hair became</li>
            <li>Also worth a mention because I did not see the ingredients listed on Amazon, the conditioner has wheat protein in it, so if you are celiac or have gluten issues you may want to steer clear of this.</li>
            <li>and I honestly really do like the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It got here fast</li>
            <li>She said &amp;#34;it really works!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and pefect products</li>
            <li>If I end up liking it as much as I hope</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li>absolutely woooooonderful , I got it yesterday &amp; used it yesterday &amp; I am amazed at the shine , bounce , etc .</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t grow much.</li>
            <li>I really like Mane n Tail shampoo n cond.</li>
            <li>Came in on time and my hair is noticeably smoother and much healthier.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it and went back to sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>This really and truly does make your hair grow and glow.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair grow fast and it tames the frizz.</li>
            <li>Company ships fast, got everything just like i was supposed to.</li>
            <li>so i didn&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li>I really recoment</li>
            <li>Fast ship.</li>
            <li>It is costly and dont really like the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>and it really works</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference</li>
            <li>Really doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair except make it feel like straw.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does make my hair grow annd</li>
            <li>I ended up throwing away the shampoo because it really creeped me out.</li>
            <li>Not too much</li>
            <li>This one, not so much.</li>
            <li>On my colored hair it made it SOOOOOO much drier.</li>
            <li>My hair is really growing</li>
            <li>has really helped build volume</li>
            <li>It also works very well.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!</li>
            <li>It has really helped my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>Now that I see the product really works, I do not mind.</li>
            <li>but instead it leaves it very oily.</li>
            <li>I really do like this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I got it today shipped fast with 2 day delivery</li>
            <li>Shampoo really dries out your hair and conditioner does not moisturized.</li>
            <li>Then, it started to get very stringy, and I had a ton of split ends.  </li>
            <li>look to the horses hair which is indeed very course.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Mane &amp; Tail which it does indeed enrich your hair, and adds a look of luster!</li>
            <li>I really like the smell</li>
            <li>and I found that this shampoo keeps the oil under control very well.</li>
            <li>My hair grew an inch noticeably faster at first, but then it returned to normal growth.</li>
            <li>I purchased this a few weeks ago, and have had a good experience so far.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money on this kind of Mane n Tail</li>
            <li>I dye my hair alot, and so far this is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that&#x27;s kept my hair as healthy as before I started dying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you put in the conditioner it states on the bottle to leave in your hair for 1-2 minutes, which normally I don&#x27;t do but decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Combing through my hair after patting most of the water out was really easy and hardly a tangle.</li>
            <li>For $14 u get two large bottles at Kmart and they usually have buy one get one free!!</li>
            <li>I dont wash my hair daily and this product keeps my hair full of body and super soft in between washes.</li>
            <li>And I swear my hair is growing much faster and looks really shiny and smooth when I break out the flat iron.</li>
            <li>stripped the new $500 dye job in the first wash.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely damaged from coloring and bleaching more than 50 times</li>
            <li>I was surprised, but I&#x27;m willing to bet that&#x27;s the detrimental factor in this shampoo/conditioner set.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The conditioner is really watery and makes my hair heavy (because I had to use a whole handful just to be able to run my fingers through)...</li>
            <li>My hair had grown very quickly although I have been using other products that might contribute.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I asked a new stylist to trim off about 2 inches, and she ended up whacking off over four!</li>
            <li>I have tried this product over the last couple of months, and I must say it works great, BUT, only if you switch it on and off with other shampoos.</li>
            <li>and conditioner, I have used mane n tail for years, I really like this new one.</li>
            <li>I will be buying the extra large ones!!</li>
            <li>and it will still look decent.</li>
            <li>No, it doesn&#x27;t make it grow three inches in a week, but it does help a steady growth.</li>
            <li>on hot days it makes my hair more oily than usual.</li>
            <li>Since Wen tends to make my hair lifeless I will use Main &#x27; Tail like once a week.  </li>
            <li>I rated this four stars instead of five because the price is too high.</li>
            <li>, Bernie the high maintenance St.Bernard</li>
            <li>you have growth you want move on to highly moisturizing conditioners with slip/ makes your hair glide like butter.</li>
            <li>Ive use this since high school.had to cut my hair</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s wonderful for a bad haircut</li>
            <li>great product, but expensive for the size</li>
            <li>n Tail is great for growth but the ingredients are scary.</li>
            <li>At least it smells nice.</li>
            <li>Also they both left my hair super soft .</li>
            <li>12 bucks for half shampoo and full conditioner, straight Bullocks!</li>
            <li>I look forward to growing my hair super long with it.</li>
            <li>Daughter cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li>And i have seen new growth in 2wks.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>i have tried the original main n tail and it wasnt the best nor the worst.</li>
            <li>Using this product as well as deep conditioning and regularly applying oils to my scalp has made a huge difference in the look feel and length of my hair.</li>
            <li>The bottles were a bit smaller than expected, which was okay.</li>
            <li>Ok product, expected, bigger bottles.</li>
            <li>I had run out of the shampoo and conditioner thought I could return to the regular mane n tail that I had bought but there was a noticeable difference my hair wasn&#x27;t as smooth and actually started to get frizzy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes hair have dandruff but makes hair very soft</li>
            <li>With me it wasn&#x27;t like magic from one wash to another or like other reviews where it&#x27;s so obvious in a week.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and silky!</li>
            <li>No complaints so far!</li>
            <li>Stopped using it and problem fixed!</li>
            <li>Definitely will be using this as much as I can!</li>
            <li>This makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>Oh my goodness, my hair is SO soft since getting this set!  </li>
            <li>and this is only my first day of use</li>
            <li>I used it the first time it left my hair crispier than a tumble weed.</li>
            <li>After the first use of this product, my hair felt 100 times softer, I have only had for 3 days</li>
            <li>but two thumbs up so far!</li>
            <li>actually had to trim my hair yesterday because it was growing so fast!</li>
            <li>I also bought the normal Main &#x27;n Tail a few months ago, and it seemed to work the same way, but with a better texture.</li>
            <li>As far as new growth, we will just have to see</li>
            <li>Instantly after the first time my scalp isn&#x27;t tight , My hair looks so healthy , and my hair which is usually a frizz bomb on humid days  stayed calm and shiny !  </li>
            <li>at all I paid almost $30 in total with tax and shipping expecting 2 large bottles since for 7.99 at a retail store</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m multi racial (white, black, and Cherokee) and my hair is very curly, so are most mixed race people.</li>
            <li>I always love mane and tail especially when I want my hair to grow a little faster.</li>
            <li>have asian thin fine hair, this combo makes my hair look so soft and smooth but completely kills the volume.</li>
            <li>This shampoo will make your hair feel clean, but if its used all the time by itself, it will dry it out because of the amount of protein in it and not enough &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is so moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>However, my mom loves the product and says it makes her hair soft.</li>
            <li>But, old hair?  </li>
            <li>After just one time my old hair regained the texture of?</li>
            <li>My daughter (age 10) bought this and thinks it makes her hair soft and has gotten longer.</li>
            <li>I have to use a repair shampoo and conditioner at the same  time as I use this product because it really dries out my hair</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>My hair is natural.  </li>
            <li>My hair remained soft to the touch</li>
            <li>I looked at the ingredients and its all chemicals, except near the end where there&#x27;s olive oil etc.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>buy if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>it was so light &amp; fluffy .</li>
            <li>my hair is noticeably smoother, shinier, and SO soft.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair that I am trying to grow out and strengthen.</li>
            <li>It cleans my hair and leaves it feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li>hair seems much healthier after only a week of use .</li>
            <li>it makes it so soft and shiney and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair felt soft and thicker.  </li>
            <li>This product made my hair feel really soft</li>
            <li>only have it 3 stars because the shopping was fast</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>been using this stuff for a long time, very commited buyer!</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>This made me VERY itchy esp on the back of my neck.</li>
            <li>early winter weather</li>
            <li>, I cut my hair in all sorts of styles, and I have naturally curly hair as well.</li>
            <li>My hair is bouncy and soft</li>
            <li>I waited patiently for it to arrive,  and it did arrive early, but I regret using it.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft and gives it body.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily hair and at the end of my washing routine I don&#x27;t put the conditioner on my scalp</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair with body, not limp</li>
            <li>To early to see a change in growth.</li>
            <li>This product makes your hair feel natural to the touch, and look.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell though</li>
            <li>I use it with the strengthening spray and the therapy spray and my hair has never been so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for nearly two months after getting a butchered pixie cut.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As far it helping my hair to grow, I haven&#x27;t noticed a differences.</li>
            <li>I tried everything people told me would work and kind of shampoo that said anything concerning growth, I was tired and than I saw this product on Amazon</li>
            <li>My ends were dry, so I left the conditioner in for a full 3 minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the conditioner was pretty normal, compared to other conditioners on the market.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the original Mane &#x27;n Tail before and while my hair growth did speedup, my hairs dried out.</li>
            <li>It did make my hair really soft and manageable, and even the deep conditioners I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t seem to do that normally.</li>
            <li>First picture was taken on Aug 3rd, second picture taken on Aug 17th.</li>
            <li>Second time I&#x27;m ordering and I&#x27;m ordering two sets of shampoo and conditioner since the first time I bought the bottles actually worked.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to anybody whether it be for regular use or to help improve your hair quality.</li>
            <li>It makes my thick hair very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and it looks amazing and also has grown out a inch and a half in less than a month.!</li>
            <li>I am a natural red head who currently has way too much henna her hair.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I heard so much about this stuff, so I finally tried it, and now I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back.</li>
            <li>Only used the product one time so far but did make my hair supper soft an shinny.</li>
            <li>I wish that they were the larger bottles, but these do last quite a while since you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>I have long hair (below my shoulder blades) mostly because I am too lazy to go to a salon with any regularity...</li>
            <li>made my hair very dry and it began falling out in large amounts after two months use</li>
            <li>I know diet, stress, frequency of shampooing/conditioning plays a role in hair health, but no other shampoo/conditioner gave me headaches like Mane &#x27;n Tail - both the herbal and non-herbal.</li>
            <li>I find this was a major value and</li>
            <li>I have had a major issue with shedding and breakage and hair that won&#x27;t grow.</li>
            <li>the conditioner didn&#x27;t make my hair soft and the shampoo made me hair feel gross and hard- not like the other kind i use by them-&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell, but it cerainly isn&#x27;t bad and is very easy to get used to.</li>
            <li>This product really dries out my hair and ruins the natural waves...</li>
            <li>so I went back to my old ways.</li>
            <li>It seemed to make my thin spots more apparent.  </li>
            <li>So I have THICK and super super tight curly hair.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but this stuff really freaking works!!!</li>
            <li>After my hair dried naturally each day, I found it was actually drier and looked less healthy.</li>
            <li>I dont like the dry coarse feeling really.</li>
            <li>this stuff sucks it leaves my hair feeling even more dry</li>
            <li>The fragrance is really lovely, and I don&#x27;t get sick of it (as I do with many other shampoos).</li>
            <li>I have very thin brittle hair, this stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>Quite pricey but for some it may be worth it, the shampoo smelled good and left my hair feeling soft but the conditioner left my hair feeling dry and like straw allowing for my ends to break :/ weird</li>
            <li>Works wonders although my hair felt a little frizzy at first my hair adapted and soaks it all in.</li>
            <li>I have thick, long hair that gets easily tangled.</li>
            <li>The only thing I could see as a problem is that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t really lather like other shampoos.</li>
            <li>also, I have short hair-it barely touches my shoulders.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will update this after I&#x27;ve tried it out a few times ;)</li>
            <li>a few days ago I used it today for the first time lets start with</li>
            <li>I just recently dyed my hair and it was really dead and killed top to bottom....</li>
            <li>and I was hoping this would help with having super greasy hair lately.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I did not realize it that these bottles are not the large size, just a little smaller than a regular shampoo bottle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you get the other products!</li>
            <li>I have used several other brands and they would leave my hair very soft, but this one leaves it feeling &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34;......</li>
            <li>I have heard that this brand is amazing, but the conditioner actually was thin and dried out my hair.</li>

            <li> My hair has never been more beautiful, healthy and luxurious.</li>

            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really tell a difference in my hair but smells wonderful !</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never have had problems with any hair product of any kind before</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but that&#x27;s about all it has going for it.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars instead of one because it smells nice.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner work great at protecting my hair and taming my texture; I don&#x27;t have to use a lot and use it up to 3x per week, especially after swimming and working out -- it would probably be a great summer duo!</li>
            <li> It also has a nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li> They use it on their own hair for growth and softness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the reg kind in the passed</li>
            <li> my hair has so much volume &amp; beautiful!!!!!</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if this stuff works on humans, but I figured it could not hurt to use on my St.Bernard who has a severe type of dermatitis which no shots, steroids, diet or pill could control.</li>
            <li> Just looking to grow it out nicely.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would help my hair a ton...</li>
            <li> It smells nice and seemed to make my hair shiny</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look nice and it has helped my hair look nicer</li>
            <li> It is a nice combination for my hair.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve used Mane &amp; Tail on my horses and always noticed that this product leaves a nice softness and sheen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mane n tail before and loved it but the herbal gro is even better.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited!!</li>

            <li> Thank you for such a wonderful product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m noticing a bit difference already, even though I change between this one and healthy sexy hair.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it&#x27;s gradually helping.</li>
            <li> but now that I see it.. I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> if ur looking for lengthy healthy feeling hair i would just start taking a biotin vitamin and using oil treatments at night.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> , it makes my hair feel really healthy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m noticing stronger ends and more volume.</li>
            <li> It feels healthy and it&#x27;s getting longer,</li>
            <li> I really love using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it still is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Keeps hair healthy for sure.</li>
            <li> but love the way this transforms your hair</li>
            <li> many noticed not as many pieces were falling in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The conditioner doesn&#x27;t glide through hair like many others..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so  much better.  </li>
            <li> Not even sure if my hair is growing...</li>
            <li> I love these products</li>
            <li> I love the way it strengthens my hair</li>
            <li> and  makes it look so healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with it, my hair looks healthier and stays cleaner longer...will be re-ordering as needed</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The herbal shampoo was okay.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo may work better for someone else, depending on their hair texture and porosity.  </li>
            <li> For my hair, the conditioner only is perfect.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves the scent and my beard looks and feels healthy</li>
            <li> but I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> just makes it appear to have more texture and volume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe though,</li>
            <li> I love the look and the feel of my hair after using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Love love LOVE 😍😍</li>
            <li> the smell is okay</li>
            <li> I absolutely love his shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the health it gave my hair</li>
            <li> Maybe if used a lot more</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nothing that you smell frolicking through the daisys, ok?</li>
            <li> I truly love the feeling of my hair after using this product for about five days now.</li>
            <li> I love this product bc</li>
            <li> I did not notice any hair growth, but maybe it needs more time.</li>
            <li> This product is okay.</li>
            <li> AHHHH I LOVE</li>
            <li> Didnt make it that much better with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a light scent, which I find nice.</li>
            <li> But, im not in love with this one.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, I&#x27;m definitely buying this again.</li>
            <li> it was okay</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m giving it more time to see if it&#x27;s truly beneficial for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I love that it helps grow hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to order more of this stuff</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels after using this product</li>
            <li> The products all work well, they are helping maintain a healthy balance for my hair.</li>
            <li> but I notice my hair grow more</li>
            <li> I tried just the shampoo on her and within a week her dermatitis had cleared up and today her coat is so healthy that we now have people coming up to us</li>
            <li> It made my hair tangle more</li>
            <li> I was expecting my hair to be more conditioned.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff , my hair has grown 5 inches in 2 months.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> On top of all that my hair shines like it used to.  </li>
            <li> Had to switch to make sure it was the set, and it was.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased it again.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps. :)</li>
            <li> I love the product but when I received it the conditioner had somehow opened in the packaging and was all over the bottle</li>
            <li> I used it 4 times and it was not getting better.</li>
            <li> I would recommend a better conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Hair so far is silky smooth and beautiful!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and size of this but please be warned that this shampoo is not for color treated hair and WILL RUIN your dye job.  </li>
            <li> (I have been coloring my hair for years btw) and my hair has never felt softer I love it</li>
            <li> Can probably find them somewhere else cheaper, which I will be doing because I love the shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> Also seems to be helping with the split ends. :)</li>
            <li> I truly love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> An inch in a month is more than my hair has grown</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> but I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> If I can update this, I will when I know for sure...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make magic.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the moisture that is added to my hair and not the oily feeling.</li>
            <li> My hair does have more shine to it.</li>
            <li> but it does smell ok</li>
            <li> more healthy 😄&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Awesome product it definitely surpasses the competition in my book!</li>

            <li> I would stick with their original conditioner!</li>
            <li> When and if I see some growth results I will return for a new review and award 5 stars lol</li>
            <li> can see how this would make some peoples hair greasy by the end of the day, but it is just perfect for someone with extremely dry or damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention it was incredibly strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my hair and the smell is great too.</li>

            <li> my hair is sooo smooth and its like magic for my hair&amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this kind.</li>

            <li> As a male with long hair I never thought shampoo and conditioner would matter, but these products are awesome and I the joy</li>

            <li> My hair feels clean and healthy...</li>
            <li> I have to use another conditioner along with this one because it doesn’t make it easy to comb out my curly hair.</li>

            <li> Makes your hair super healthy.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and my hair is so soft!</li>

            <li> Really does grow your hair!! :)</li>
            <li> I have used this twice and already notice a huge difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> But now, my waves are relaxed, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter and her hair looks great and has grown quite a bit in a short time.  </li>
            <li> Beware, if you are searching for Sulfate free products.</li>
            <li> She says it makes her hair so smooth and manageable.  </li>
            <li> so I like to make every bit last lol</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent and is very conditioning.</li>
            <li> you want an all natural shampoo that smells great, I suppose it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> But all in all I&#x27;m loving it so far and can&#x27;t wait to see more results.</li>
            <li> It smells good and it makes my hair soft</li>
            <li> if your looking for something good get the deep moisturizing one :)</li>
            <li> Smells so good and makes your hair extremely soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does smell wonderful, and I can see why people love it, just not a good fit for everyone.</li>
            <li> I was using the original Mane &#x27;n Tail</li>
            <li> I was really excited because some of the reviews said this shampoo helped them stop shedding, and helped with hair growth.  </li>
            <li> Did not notice significant hair growth.</li>
            <li> Excited to see the results in a months time.  </li>
            <li> I have to use my original conditioner then apply the mane n tail conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> My opinion was It&#x27;s cheap and full of alcohol and sulfates.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product and start using it.</li>
            <li> Ive been using thid product for 3 months &amp;Nothing amazing so far, advertisers &amp; resellers are more than capable of hyping up, exaggerating any product to push a quick sell, buyer beware, save your $money for a better quality product.</li>
            <li> They are great for my extremely dry hair.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> The shampoo didn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li> Love this, I was a skeptic even after reading all the positive reviews</li>
            <li> Smells nice and makes my hair soft!</li>
            <li> It always feel dry and course, but after trying this, even after one wash my hair felt so much more healthy!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and silky and the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this set so much because it is infused with olive oil which makes the hair grow.</li>
            <li> It kind of melts like water and does not make your hair soft.</li>
            <li> Cool stuff.</li>
            <li> My friends were going to buy this but thanks to how my order came, they won&#x27;t be satisfied.</li>
            <li> Thanks anyway :)</li>
            <li> It makes your hair so healthy that it really seems to grow faster.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo it really work</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy brown hair and when I used it along with Aussie or Pantene, I saw the best results.</li>
            <li> seems to be a good deal, but when i received the item its only about 3/4 full...</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ll if u think about it 12 dollars for shampoo and conditioner is not bad</li>
            <li> NOT loike the original main and tail which I love.</li>
            <li> Although it does have sulfate and alcohol, somehow it helped my son&#x27;s dry, brittle hair immediately and it smells amazing!  </li>
            <li> I used the original Mane &#x27;n Tail a long time ago and loved it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these really help with Gro-ing hair much at all, but they are nicely scented and leave my hair feeling good enough.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it helps it grow yet, if it does I will update this review, but at any rate I am very happy with it and will make this my regular shampoo and conditioner and as long as it stays available I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> The mane&#x27; n tail shampoo and conditions have your hair smell so nice not greasy and soft not hard have to give it more time to see if it grow my hair try it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is a combo of clean, floral and fresh, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> Her hair is super shiney, thicker and stronger.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me genetically</li>
            <li> I will be a loyal Mane &#x27;n Tail user forever.  </li>
            <li> I liked the herbal smell but this really didn&#x27;t do much for me or my hair.</li>
            <li> I love Main &#x27;n Tail, but something about the texture of this stuff had me glad to return to my normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> Pretty cheap looking stuff however.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very pleased with the initial results.</li>
            <li> my hair doesn&#x27;t grow very fast at all!</li>
            <li> Came quickly and pretty well packaged!</li>
            <li> I am growing out a pixie cut and trying to get to a respectable length before the start of a new school year.</li>
            <li> I have used mane n&#x27; tail in the past and loved it, so I figured I would love this as well.</li>
            <li> Definitely helped with my hair growth for sure!</li>
            <li> My hair has grown an inch since starting this product about a month ago love it!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it,  during the conditioning I pulled out literally 2 hand fulls of hair!  </li>
            <li> I felt results after the first wash!</li>
            <li> recommended this product really works!!</li>
            <li> I recently got highlights and these hair products keep it strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> It actually cleans my hair and makes it smell super nice.</li>
            <li> my hair is so smooth and straight now...</li>
            <li> I did find one that doesn&#x27;t and have been happy with it (with hair that isn&#x27;t as dried out).</li>
            <li> the shampoo smells great and leaves my thick, wavy hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Nice as an extra shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> My hair is getting fuller and I love my natural hair since.  </li>
            <li> my hair is so soft &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li> My luscious flow is golden</li>
            <li> After two times of using it i have noticed getting a lot of dandruff and my hair loss is even worth than before.</li>
            <li> I ordered Mane &#x27;n Tail Gro Shampoo and Conditioner Olive Oil Complex because I always heard great things about the original Mane &#x27;n Tail.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair super soft, manageable, &amp; easy to comb.</li>
            <li> Many thanks to you Main and</li>
            <li> If nothing else, my itchy scalp is gone, my hair is not nearly as oily, my hair is softer and more manageable, and my hair just feels lighter!</li>
            <li> But at least it smells good!</li>
            <li> so all I can say is they were right.</li>
            <li> Upon getting these bottles I had to try them right</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but it&#x27;s healthy and moisturized as I don&#x27;t blow dry or heat style.</li>
            <li> but if your like me and use a lot of conditioner it goes fast other wise not a bad product</li>
            <li> Hair is very full of body and soft.</li>
            <li> Bottles are super small and the regular kind works just as good for a LOT cheaper.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this stuff made my hair grow at much faster rate than normal.</li>
            <li> Id say stick with the original main and tail shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought this because many other reviews claimed it helped their hair stay strong and</li>
            <li> We are so amazed how much more superior Mane &amp; Tail is over all the other same type of hair products out on the market.</li>
            <li> I tried the product for the first time and noticed a difference right away.  </li>
            <li> Left my hair clean and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The smell is also so nice and delicate, I love it.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely give these a try if you want to grow your hair NATURALLY, and if you want to smell good in the process.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> This item was shipped very, very fast.</li>
            <li> I had baby fine hair for my young hair and this isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Really see it working!</li>
            <li> My hair has grown an inch in just the first month of use.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Regular more</li>
            <li> After consistent use of this for three months, it started going downhill.  </li>
            <li> Really does the work!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for someone who is looking to help their hair grow healthy and shiny while they are in the process of growing it out.</li>
            <li> It was an okay product, but I&#x27;d didn&#x27;t last but 2 weeks</li>
            <li> work better for different hair types..</li>
            <li> I wonder if Mane n&#x27; Tail&#x27;s deep conditioner would be a better bet.</li>
            <li> I was very upset when I got my ordered because instead of getting the shampoo &amp; conditioner I got 2 shampoo!</li>
            <li> We received the shampoo in short order and were pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> it leaves my hair so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> but using this after the first shampoo i could feel and see a difference.</li>
            <li> (Are all these 5 star reviews for real?!)</li>
            <li> but it really has!</li>
            <li> which was my first thought with anything herbal.</li>
            <li> The first time I rinsed my hair</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping with the hair growth, Love the shampoo just wished I&#x27;d have looked more closely at the size, pretty small for 14-- for the pair.</li>
            <li> And I recently bought the spray therapy to apply to the top of my head.</li>
            <li> Love the way my scalp feels, I have only been using it for a week</li>
            <li> this is my first time trying the Herbal Gro...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> I swear it makes my hair grow much faster!</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve recently cut my hair again (shaved all around with some length on top) and I&#x27;ve changed my mind about it</li>
            <li> The look of my hair is fuller, and it has definitely grown in length more quickly than normal.</li>
            <li> I buy this specific pair because it has olive oil complex in it, which is wonderful for your hair and makes it smooth, soft, and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if nail growth is common, but it&#x27;s nice!</li>
            <li> I am a hair stylist and tried pretty much everything</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about that but good quality shampoo and conditioner either way.</li>
            <li> It has a wonderfully fresh and clean scent as well!!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> and it was overall easy to brush.</li>
            <li> If you have super natural curly hair I recommend this.</li>
            <li> My hair has been super soft since I have been using it.</li>
            <li> just yet I love what whether I have my curly or dry it straight</li>
            <li> My hair does feel thicker (I have fine hair), only wish the conditioner was richer.</li>
            <li> Also I recommend the leave in conditioner main n tail herbal gro add some on before blow drying your hair!</li>
            <li> She has very dry brittle hair and this has given her a lot more shine and body.</li>
            <li> It gives your hair a nice shine but it weighs thin, fine hairs</li>
            <li> I received it with a huge white sticker that said &amp;#34;Keep these products together&amp;#34; and a bunch of tape wrapped around it.</li>
            <li> If you want natural results, it takes time and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay shampoo although even after conditioning my hair felt rough and tangled.</li>
            <li> Really adds volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> When it is time to use this one, I lose twice as much hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have noticed the conditioning effect, not so much the length.</li>
            <li> but I do feel like my hair is growing fast ish</li>
            <li> like it my hair gro fast</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather up as much as I would like, but that will just take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully I didn&#x27;t pay as much here as her friends at the store, because we gave it away.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo has sulfates in it which are very drying to begin with and</li>
            <li> Our hair was very knotty when using this product and the ends of my hair became</li>
            <li> Also worth a mention because I did not see the ingredients listed on Amazon, the conditioner has wheat protein in it, so if you are celiac or have gluten issues you may want to steer clear of this.</li>
            <li> and I honestly really do like the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It got here fast</li>
            <li> She said &amp;#34;it really works!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and pefect products</li>
            <li> If I end up liking it as much as I hope</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> absolutely woooooonderful , I got it yesterday &amp; used it yesterday &amp; I am amazed at the shine , bounce , etc .</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t grow much.</li>
            <li> I really like Mane n Tail shampoo n cond.</li>
            <li> Came in on time and my hair is noticeably smoother and much healthier.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and went back to sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> This really and truly does make your hair grow and glow.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair grow fast and it tames the frizz.</li>
            <li> Company ships fast, got everything just like i was supposed to.</li>
            <li> so i didn&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li> I really recoment</li>
            <li> Fast ship.</li>
            <li> It is costly and dont really like the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> and it really works</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference</li>
            <li> Really doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair except make it feel like straw.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does make my hair grow annd</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing away the shampoo because it really creeped me out.</li>
            <li> Not too much</li>
            <li> This one, not so much.</li>
            <li> On my colored hair it made it SOOOOOO much drier.</li>
            <li> My hair is really growing</li>
            <li> has really helped build volume</li>
            <li> It also works very well.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!</li>
            <li> It has really helped my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> Now that I see the product really works, I do not mind.</li>
            <li> but instead it leaves it very oily.</li>
            <li> I really do like this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I got it today shipped fast with 2 day delivery</li>
            <li> Shampoo really dries out your hair and conditioner does not moisturized.</li>
            <li> Then, it started to get very stringy, and I had a ton of split ends.  </li>
            <li> look to the horses hair which is indeed very course.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Mane &amp; Tail which it does indeed enrich your hair, and adds a look of luster!</li>
            <li> I really like the smell</li>
            <li> and I found that this shampoo keeps the oil under control very well.</li>
            <li> My hair grew an inch noticeably faster at first, but then it returned to normal growth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago, and have had a good experience so far.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money on this kind of Mane n Tail</li>
            <li> I dye my hair alot, and so far this is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that&#x27;s kept my hair as healthy as before I started dying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you put in the conditioner it states on the bottle to leave in your hair for 1-2 minutes, which normally I don&#x27;t do but decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Combing through my hair after patting most of the water out was really easy and hardly a tangle.</li>
            <li> For $14 u get two large bottles at Kmart and they usually have buy one get one free!!</li>
            <li> I dont wash my hair daily and this product keeps my hair full of body and super soft in between washes.</li>
            <li> And I swear my hair is growing much faster and looks really shiny and smooth when I break out the flat iron.</li>
            <li> stripped the new $500 dye job in the first wash.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely damaged from coloring and bleaching more than 50 times</li>
            <li> I was surprised, but I&#x27;m willing to bet that&#x27;s the detrimental factor in this shampoo/conditioner set.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The conditioner is really watery and makes my hair heavy (because I had to use a whole handful just to be able to run my fingers through)...</li>
            <li> My hair had grown very quickly although I have been using other products that might contribute.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I asked a new stylist to trim off about 2 inches, and she ended up whacking off over four!</li>
            <li> I have tried this product over the last couple of months, and I must say it works great, BUT, only if you switch it on and off with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> and conditioner, I have used mane n tail for years, I really like this new one.</li>
            <li> I will be buying the extra large ones!!</li>
            <li> and it will still look decent.</li>
            <li> No, it doesn&#x27;t make it grow three inches in a week, but it does help a steady growth.</li>
            <li> on hot days it makes my hair more oily than usual.</li>
            <li> Since Wen tends to make my hair lifeless I will use Main &#x27; Tail like once a week.  </li>
            <li> I rated this four stars instead of five because the price is too high.</li>
            <li> , Bernie the high maintenance St.Bernard</li>
            <li> you have growth you want move on to highly moisturizing conditioners with slip/ makes your hair glide like butter.</li>
            <li> Ive use this since high school.had to cut my hair</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s wonderful for a bad haircut</li>
            <li> great product, but expensive for the size</li>
            <li> n Tail is great for growth but the ingredients are scary.</li>
            <li> At least it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Also they both left my hair super soft .</li>
            <li> 12 bucks for half shampoo and full conditioner, straight Bullocks!</li>
            <li> I look forward to growing my hair super long with it.</li>
            <li> Daughter cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li> And i have seen new growth in 2wks.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> i have tried the original main n tail and it wasnt the best nor the worst.</li>
            <li> Using this product as well as deep conditioning and regularly applying oils to my scalp has made a huge difference in the look feel and length of my hair.</li>
            <li> The bottles were a bit smaller than expected, which was okay.</li>
            <li> Ok product, expected, bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> I had run out of the shampoo and conditioner thought I could return to the regular mane n tail that I had bought but there was a noticeable difference my hair wasn&#x27;t as smooth and actually started to get frizzy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes hair have dandruff but makes hair very soft</li>
            <li> With me it wasn&#x27;t like magic from one wash to another or like other reviews where it&#x27;s so obvious in a week.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and silky!</li>
            <li> No complaints so far!</li>
            <li> Stopped using it and problem fixed!</li>
            <li> Definitely will be using this as much as I can!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, my hair is SO soft since getting this set!  </li>
            <li> and this is only my first day of use</li>
            <li> I used it the first time it left my hair crispier than a tumble weed.</li>
            <li> After the first use of this product, my hair felt 100 times softer, I have only had for 3 days</li>
            <li> but two thumbs up so far!</li>
            <li> actually had to trim my hair yesterday because it was growing so fast!</li>
            <li> I also bought the normal Main &#x27;n Tail a few months ago, and it seemed to work the same way, but with a better texture.</li>
            <li> As far as new growth, we will just have to see</li>
            <li> Instantly after the first time my scalp isn&#x27;t tight , My hair looks so healthy , and my hair which is usually a frizz bomb on humid days  stayed calm and shiny !  </li>
            <li> at all I paid almost $30 in total with tax and shipping expecting 2 large bottles since for 7.99 at a retail store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m multi racial (white, black, and Cherokee) and my hair is very curly, so are most mixed race people.</li>
            <li> I always love mane and tail especially when I want my hair to grow a little faster.</li>
            <li> have asian thin fine hair, this combo makes my hair look so soft and smooth but completely kills the volume.</li>
            <li> This shampoo will make your hair feel clean, but if its used all the time by itself, it will dry it out because of the amount of protein in it and not enough &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is so moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> However, my mom loves the product and says it makes her hair soft.</li>
            <li> But, old hair?  </li>
            <li> After just one time my old hair regained the texture of?</li>
            <li> My daughter (age 10) bought this and thinks it makes her hair soft and has gotten longer.</li>
            <li> I have to use a repair shampoo and conditioner at the same  time as I use this product because it really dries out my hair</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural.  </li>
            <li> My hair remained soft to the touch</li>
            <li> I looked at the ingredients and its all chemicals, except near the end where there&#x27;s olive oil etc.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> buy if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> it was so light &amp; fluffy .</li>
            <li> my hair is noticeably smoother, shinier, and SO soft.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair that I am trying to grow out and strengthen.</li>
            <li> It cleans my hair and leaves it feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li> hair seems much healthier after only a week of use .</li>
            <li> it makes it so soft and shiney and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair felt soft and thicker.  </li>
            <li> This product made my hair feel really soft</li>
            <li> only have it 3 stars because the shopping was fast</li>

            <li> been using this stuff for a long time, very commited buyer!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> This made me VERY itchy esp on the back of my neck.</li>
            <li> early winter weather</li>
            <li> , I cut my hair in all sorts of styles, and I have naturally curly hair as well.</li>
            <li> My hair is bouncy and soft</li>
            <li> I waited patiently for it to arrive,  and it did arrive early, but I regret using it.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft and gives it body.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily hair and at the end of my washing routine I don&#x27;t put the conditioner on my scalp</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair with body, not limp</li>
            <li> To early to see a change in growth.</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair feel natural to the touch, and look.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell though</li>
            <li> I use it with the strengthening spray and the therapy spray and my hair has never been so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for nearly two months after getting a butchered pixie cut.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As far it helping my hair to grow, I haven&#x27;t noticed a differences.</li>
            <li> I tried everything people told me would work and kind of shampoo that said anything concerning growth, I was tired and than I saw this product on Amazon</li>
            <li> My ends were dry, so I left the conditioner in for a full 3 minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the conditioner was pretty normal, compared to other conditioners on the market.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the original Mane &#x27;n Tail before and while my hair growth did speedup, my hairs dried out.</li>
            <li> It did make my hair really soft and manageable, and even the deep conditioners I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t seem to do that normally.</li>
            <li> First picture was taken on Aug 3rd, second picture taken on Aug 17th.</li>
            <li> Second time I&#x27;m ordering and I&#x27;m ordering two sets of shampoo and conditioner since the first time I bought the bottles actually worked.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to anybody whether it be for regular use or to help improve your hair quality.</li>
            <li> It makes my thick hair very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> and it looks amazing and also has grown out a inch and a half in less than a month.!</li>
            <li> I am a natural red head who currently has way too much henna her hair.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I heard so much about this stuff, so I finally tried it, and now I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back.</li>
            <li> Only used the product one time so far but did make my hair supper soft an shinny.</li>
            <li> I wish that they were the larger bottles, but these do last quite a while since you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (below my shoulder blades) mostly because I am too lazy to go to a salon with any regularity...</li>
            <li> made my hair very dry and it began falling out in large amounts after two months use</li>
            <li> I know diet, stress, frequency of shampooing/conditioning plays a role in hair health, but no other shampoo/conditioner gave me headaches like Mane &#x27;n Tail - both the herbal and non-herbal.</li>
            <li> I find this was a major value and</li>
            <li> I have had a major issue with shedding and breakage and hair that won&#x27;t grow.</li>
            <li> the conditioner didn&#x27;t make my hair soft and the shampoo made me hair feel gross and hard- not like the other kind i use by them-&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell, but it cerainly isn&#x27;t bad and is very easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> This product really dries out my hair and ruins the natural waves...</li>
            <li> so I went back to my old ways.</li>
            <li> It seemed to make my thin spots more apparent.  </li>
            <li> So I have THICK and super super tight curly hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this stuff really freaking works!!!</li>
            <li> After my hair dried naturally each day, I found it was actually drier and looked less healthy.</li>
            <li> I dont like the dry coarse feeling really.</li>
            <li> this stuff sucks it leaves my hair feeling even more dry</li>
            <li> The fragrance is really lovely, and I don&#x27;t get sick of it (as I do with many other shampoos).</li>
            <li> I have very thin brittle hair, this stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> Quite pricey but for some it may be worth it, the shampoo smelled good and left my hair feeling soft but the conditioner left my hair feeling dry and like straw allowing for my ends to break :/ weird</li>
            <li> Works wonders although my hair felt a little frizzy at first my hair adapted and soaks it all in.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair that gets easily tangled.</li>
            <li> The only thing I could see as a problem is that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t really lather like other shampoos.</li>
            <li> also, I have short hair-it barely touches my shoulders.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will update this after I&#x27;ve tried it out a few times ;)</li>
            <li> a few days ago I used it today for the first time lets start with</li>
            <li> I just recently dyed my hair and it was really dead and killed top to bottom....</li>
            <li> and I was hoping this would help with having super greasy hair lately.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I did not realize it that these bottles are not the large size, just a little smaller than a regular shampoo bottle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you get the other products!</li>
            <li> I have used several other brands and they would leave my hair very soft, but this one leaves it feeling &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34;......</li>
            <li> I have heard that this brand is amazing, but the conditioner actually was thin and dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 5 1/2 year old nephew when we took him to a different hair salon and they buzzed all of his beautiful long hair off and edged his bangs a complete half circle, he looked like Spock with a bad hair cut!</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel dry and dirty,  just switched back to my previous shampoo and conditioner and my hair feels great once again.</li>
            <li> It left my hair so greasy and flat that I did not continue to use it to see if it actually did improve hair growth.</li>
            <li> My oldest (8) hair doesnt grow so she has a mullet with very thin hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is normal for this product, but the Mane &#x27;n Tail Shampoo I received was very watery, as if it had been watered down.  </li>
            <li> asking how we get her coat so beautiful instead of asking what is wrong with our poor scabby dog.</li>
            <li> I have brunette, thin hair (just lots of it), and it&#x27;s just right!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know if it grows hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this long but it instantly made my hair softer.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> but it left my hair heavy and gross feeling instead of soft.  </li>
            <li> I haven’t used this long enough to tell if it helps with growth.</li>
            <li> I had bleached my hair to remove a darker color I added to the blonde, and it left it very dry and dole.</li>
            <li> I thought they were bigger bottles, so was kind of disappointed for only to 12oz bottles for almost $20 when i can get them locally</li>
            <li> split-ends, never had that happen before since we don&#x27;t use hair dryers or flat irons!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it left my hair dry, frizzy, and tangled the moment I got out of the shower.</li>
            <li> but it did help, only thing is it does leave hair dry</li>
            <li> A little expensive for such small bottles but this specific kind of mane and tale is not sold near me, so I had no choice</li>
            <li> My hair is VERY sensitive, and this was just too harsh for it.</li>
            <li> After my hair dried It was very soft and shinny.  </li>
            <li> After only one week of use, my hair feels fuller, falls out less frequently, and I don&#x27;t have tangles when combing wet.  </li>
            <li> Recently my hair has become very dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it helps with growing his hair since we also have him taking his kiddie vitamins with a high biotin content.</li>
            <li> Only reason I don&#x27;t give 5 stars is I feel as though the bottle could have been a little bigger for the price but no big deal.</li>
            <li> The shampoo provides a nice lather which shocked me.</li>
            <li> and I knew horses has long hair</li>
            <li> He commented on how long my hair was getting.</li>
            <li> My hair stopped growing for a long time and I started using this set</li>
            <li> Not old hair?  </li>
            <li> The bottles are smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> I havent used it for long, but my hair does look healthier.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t harm his scalp and his hair looks shiny and feels soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> my hair feels a bit rough after using it but overall i like it</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet, but will continue using, as it hasn&#x27;t been that long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not terribly sensitive.</li>
            <li> Strange.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from thinning and losing hair for a long time.</li>
            <li> if its all mental or if my hair is actually growing faster and stronger.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t used it that long either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is guaranteed thick and longer hair myself and my daughter hair is so much thicker than ever</li>
            <li> but if you have really thick and dry hair, the conditioner doesn&#x27;t really detangle your hair.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered this long ago!</li>
            <li> It made my hair really dry and brittle had to use my other conditions just to soften it back up</li>
            <li> This product made my hair feel dry.</li>
            <li> My scalp just got too dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> the conditioner did nothing to add moisture to our already dry (curly hair is dry by nature) hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dry.</li>
            <li> It is so dry that I can wash it two times a week</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product if your hair is naturally dry.</li>
            <li> But the shampoo itself is a bit dry.</li>
            <li> I gave the conditioner to my son who has dry frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> Still too dry for hair</li>
            <li> Product made my hair feel sort of dry and brittle</li>
            <li> Made my hair dry even conditioner</li>
            <li> Extremely dry.</li>
            <li> and if that hits the same time as winter it is a free for all on the split ends and crazy frizzies.  </li>
            <li> but I discontinued it because it was leaving my hair dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair dry and creates split ends.</li>
            <li> For anyone whom has brittle, and/or dry hair...</li>
            <li> Leaves hair dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is that the conditioner does not make my hair soft.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve noticed that that too, has not only left my hair manageable, but LESS HAIR HAS BEEN FALLING OUT!  </li>
            <li> People think its weird to use this shampoo and they say its nothing special</li>
            <li> I have been using that for over 6 months and haven&#x27;t missed a single day of using it after a shower.</li>
            <li> My hair has come a long way from up to my ear, 1 and a half years later is now passed my shoulders but do apply heat and product so it breaks off.</li>
            <li> 3months my hair when the from military to foot long locks</li>
            <li> I used both full bottles thinking my hair needed time to adjust, but sadly that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> I normally have frizzy, thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> BUT it also made my hair extremely dry!  </li>
            <li> product makes your hair dry!</li>
            <li> Dry!</li>
            <li> Dry!</li>
            <li> Dry!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain it because I&#x27;ve bought him name brand, much more expensive salon shampoo&#x27;s / conditioners in the past that didn&#x27;t help him at all.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is the size, I was not expecting such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> but I open my package and had 2 extra small bottles</li>
            <li> It makes it soft, shiny a little bit less frizzy.</li>
            <li> (my hair is long) compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> I see reviews talking about bottles are smaller then picture (not true)</li>
            <li> My hair was beginning to be dry and damaged using other shampoos/conditioners and that is why I decided to try this.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt dry my hair out at all like some other hair growth shampoos have.</li>
            <li> Since using this, I stopped using heat everyday, and after a shower while my hair is still damp, I put a tiny tiny pit of coconut oil to help and a little argan oil.</li>
            <li> The leave in creme which I have left a review of, a small bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Gave me headaches everyday, stopped using it, instantly headaches went away.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth yet, but I have only been using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> I do agree with that when my hair was wet</li>
            <li> , it made my hair worse, it feels like straw now and its really frizzy.</li>
            <li> Completely dried out my hair and increased the look of split ends, tangles, and my hair was so oily at the roots and would break at the ends with simply brushing my hair.</li>
            <li> Leave hair tangly and rough</li>
            <li> Shipped as expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as moisturing as I expected.</li>
            <li> Both tops were not tight leaking all over the box with my other product I bought!!!!</li>
            <li> It kinda leaves a weird smell, not bad, but nothing a little body spray can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s sulfate free :(</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling dry and was hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused why its so highly recommended for people use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thickens and strengthens hair but dries it out extremely.</li>
            <li> just like any other shampoo</li>
            <li> I know that there is no magic product that can actually do that, but I was hoping that it would help strengthen my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is just like any other shampoo/conditioner combo that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit worried upon reading other reviews, but I&#x27;m so gla d</li>
            <li> Plus the dog was in extreme discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am wanting to buy this product and saw it the other day and almost did.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about their other shampoos but the herbal gro</li>
            <li> do use this combo with two other mane n tail products.</li>
            <li> My hair did not grow and faster with product than with any other shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I also have extremely oily hair at my roots</li>
            <li> It does dry my hair out a little</li>
            <li> it did feel a little dry</li>
            <li> After trying a few other products, my expectations were not high for the claim that this shampoo/condition helped hair grow.</li>
            <li> But it did make my hair really shiny, probably not good news to some one who has naturally greasy hair or thin hair!</li>
            <li> My hair felt so dry and stiff after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Normally my hair is very dry and thin and has not grown past my collar bone since I can remember.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I have to use a lot of the shampoo to get it to lather and a lot of conditioner to saturate my hair</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> but this is not worth it</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly thick, pretty frizzy hair (but it is thin.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or anything else go that nature.</li>
            <li> If your planning on growing out your hair down to your hips.</li>
            <li> LIKE HOW IT CLEANS, BUT DOES NOT WAY DOWN HAIR &amp; HAVE SEEN GROWTH OF LENGTH.  </li>
            <li> It was already down to my shoulder.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair faithfully once a week and used other Mane n Tail Herbal Grow Products with it to help my hair grow!</li>
            <li> She will no longer be recommending this trash to any other clients!</li>
            <li> My hair is strange so it seems like not very good for me.</li>
            <li> Used with Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Intensive Strengthening Masque and Natrol Biotin pills.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any less shedding in the two weeks I used it.  </li>
            <li> Way overpriced, you can get it for half the cost at some retail stores.  </li>
            <li> my hair has grown about two inches in one and a half week.</li>
            <li> woohoo that it has been less than a year...</li>
            <li> Less breakage, knots and frizz</li>
            <li> Of course now I have less motivation to go to the salon...</li>
            <li> After shampooing it left my hair feeling really stiff and hard.</li>
            <li> Shipping was crazy fast!</li>
            <li> I had previously bought this set a few months ago</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting something that made my hair grow a little bit longer?</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a year of using this shampoo/conditioner combination every day, my hair has been left weak and follicles became clogged.</li>
            <li> I have already noticed little baby hairs popping up everywhere</li>
            <li> A little pissed, is three anyway to contact them?</li>
            <li> Since using these products a little over a month, I noticed a change in my hair.......</li>
            <li> I have noticed a little bit of a difference in hair growth.</li>
            <li> So I just colored it dark!</li>
            <li> it felt a little like straw</li>
            <li> I do think it has made my hair grow a little faster.</li>
            <li> After looking at the ingredients there are herbal ingredients but lots of chemicals and artificial color dyes (yellow #5 and blue #1) too.</li>
            <li> Product came just within a few days</li>
            <li> Especially if you&#x27;re tired of Herbal Essences not being that</li>
            <li> but it definitely dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> I thought it would just be another waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 I was worried to try them because I heard my friends say that Mane &#x27;n Tail products dried their hair out,</li>
            <li> I lost my hair a few years ago</li>
            <li> I will post another review in a few weeks to let people know the results.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now everyday.</li>
            <li> Waste of money did nothing for my gair</li>
            <li> but i think it might be too heavy on the olive oil side</li>
            <li> but ones I dried my hair and straightened it</li>
            <li> but I will update the review in a few weeks</li>
            <li> I felt like I was rubbing heavy conditioner in</li>
            <li> Dried out my hair and made it staticky, and it&#x27;s even humid here in MN as we enter summer.</li>
            <li> I bought them over $35 did not free shipping  </li>
            <li> I thought I would give it the benefit of the doubt and assumed that it was just ridding me of my dead hair, but this continued to happen.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what it&#x27;ll be like in a few months of use.</li>
            <li> this was horrible it dried out my hair so bad very upset glad I only bought the small size because I will never be using this again</li>
            <li> i have such curly hair that its ridiculous!</li>
            <li> However, if you have oily or flat hair in need of volume, this shampoo will make things worse.</li>
            <li> Plus I like it has no strong scent</li>
            <li> Not strong at all</li>
            <li> I am unsure if they have changed the ingredients or I have a bad batch, but this shampoo has dried my hair out so badly only after a few washes I have had to go buy a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> A little drying and made my hair a little hard.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to use an oil to help tame my flyaways, but not anymore.  </li>
            <li> the bottles are small and run out also.</li>
            <li> It is so shiny and soft, and I bleach my hair like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this and was not sure if this was what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying it for the past few weeks, and my hair has grown an inch!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure that it made my hair grow faster though.</li>
            <li> Ill get back at you on that one.</li>
            <li> I feel it has been helping my hair grow faster the past month</li>
            <li> Except based on past reviews.</li>
            <li> so I was anxious.</li>
            <li> I usually use the moisturizing shampoo and condition by mane &#x27;n tail</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair any softer then usual in my opinion</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> and I have seen growth within the past month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never even seen bottle this small sold in stores</li>
            <li> It completely dried out my hair!</li>
            <li> My hair was less frizzy and a lot softer!!</li>
            <li> and after I get my length back, but it certainly rescued me from the worst haircut I have ever had.</li>
            <li> No more dull limp hair!  </li>
            <li> but i had to use so much leave in conditioner while styling my hair. :(  </li>
            <li> However, I have relatively thin hair and this product dried my hair out terribly and left it really</li>
            <li> it was hard to brush</li>
            <li> I had a hard time combing my hair after washing.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time detangling with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It says it has olive oil complex in it</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work and the conditioner sucks.  </li>
            <li> Well i guess i&#x27;m too late</li>
            <li> Lately, I have been going through a transition</li>
            <li> and normally it is thick.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of other products (EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was really disappointed because It is supposed to help your hair grow and make it soft-</li>
            <li> Seriously, it made my hair fall out.</li>
            <li> No matter what, and hour or two after my hair was dry, it just looked greasy and dirty.</li>
            <li> I had bad hair cut recently</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t even look bad at all and its ten times healthier.</li>
            <li> I noticed that instantly and was shocked since I wasn&#x27;t expecting that.</li>
            <li> and we are enjoying a bought of nasty cold windy</li>
            <li> Not sure why it is so expensive on Amazon?</li>
            <li> i dont like it and it make my hair ugly not soft.</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d have waist length thick hair!</li>
            <li> Let it sit in your hair for a half hour before rinse with cold water.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> Bottles are small and dried out my hair :(</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> but since I have naturally thin, oily hair it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all...</li>
            <li> I have curly, frizzy hair which I over bleached and made a million times worse.</li>
            <li> so a lot of thin hair))</li>
            <li> It was exhausting for both our dog and ourselves.</li>
            <li> she immediately noticed the difference, how thin my hair had become</li>
            <li> I have thin curly hair.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic growth spurt in my hair</li>
            <li> Dried my hair out bad.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I recently damaged my hair very badly.</li>
            <li> kinda disappointed :/</li>
            <li> I have to change my review, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> NO NEED TO SPEND A FORTUNE ON EXPENSIVE SHAMPOO &amp; CONDITIONER</li>
            <li> also that it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also smells medicinal like stale hair grease.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately was suckered into buying the shampoo, conditioner, and</li>
            <li> I had a TERRIBLE cut recently</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually the moisturizing one makes my hair feel a little oily (but nothing terrible-</li>
            <li> Cold water closes the hair folic</li>
            <li> I mean alot!!!</li>
            <li> But I swear this shampoo made my thin hair grow faster and thicker!!</li>
            <li> Seriously!!!</li>
            <li> Bad thing is that it dries my hair out really bad.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after a bad haircut to try to grow my hair out quicker.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Made my hair frizzy :(</li>
            <li> My hair is still falling out :(  </li>
            <li> but all i got is 2 conditioners instead of a shampo and a conditioner :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>

            <li> Hate this product.</li>
            <li> I apply it to the hair from the base of hairline to the tips.</li>
            <li> and they hated them...</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> My hair even started shedding terribly.</li>
            <li> it smells horrible  </li>

            <li> My package came horrible!</li>
            <li> My hair looked horrible!</li>
            <li> &amp; I hate it!</li>

            <li> very disappointing!!</li>
            <li> Terrible!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> 3months my hair when the from military to foot long locks</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this stuff made my hair grow at much faster rate than normal. Not crazy about the smell, but it cerainly isn&#x27;t bad and is very easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft. I recently got highlights and these hair products keep it strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> My daughter thinks this helps her hair grow.  I&#x27;m not sure about that but good quality shampoo and conditioner either way.</li>
            <li> I tried everything people told me would work and kind of shampoo that said anything concerning growth, I was tired and than I saw this product on Amazon and I knew horses has long hair and they had to use something. So I said what else can I lose trying another product. This stuff does everything it says it does, I am so pleased.</li>
            <li> My hair feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I was using the original Mane &#x27;n Tail but I seen this on amazon .com  and thought I&#x27;d try it . I love it ! Instantly after the first time my scalp isn&#x27;t tight , My hair looks so healthy , and my hair which is usually a frizz bomb on humid days  stayed calm and shiny !  All after one use !  I look forward to continued use  and younger looking hair !</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! my hair feels great after! I love it</li>
            <li> it made my hair look healthy and full.  I will try and buy more of this because my hair looked so good.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair silky soft, smells wonderful. I have seen growth, and so has my son. He commented on how long my hair was getting. Hair also feels thicker, and stronger. Thank you for such a wonderful product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m noticing a bit difference already, even though I change between this one and healthy sexy hair. If you wanna grow your hair, deffinetly try it out c:</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it&#x27;s gradually helping. With me it wasn&#x27;t like magic from one wash to another or like other reviews where it&#x27;s so obvious in a week. It&#x27;s taken about two months to see the difference but now that I see it.. I LOVE IT. If you want natural results, it takes time and it&#x27;s worth it. Definitely a must have shampoo and conditioner for your hair. (I also take collagen and put Jasmine oil on my hair after I shower) I just died my hair and it looked more damaged before than now!</li>
            <li> thickens and strengthens hair but dries it out extremely. the bottles are small and run out also. I dont like the dry coarse feeling really. if ur looking for lengthy healthy feeling hair i would just start taking a biotin vitamin and using oil treatments at night. thats whats made a difference for me. hope i helped</li>
            <li> Kept using it and still using it...smells good...my hair is so smooth and straight now...I will recommend it to my friends...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me kinda disappointed :/</li>
            <li> My hair felt so dry and stiff after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I like the original better</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner smells great! I love it, it makes my hair feel really healthy</li>
            <li> This product made my hair fall out.  I purchased this to enhance growth, but instead handfuls of hair began to come out.  Not happy.</li>
            <li> I been used it for one week now  and love my hair,it feel great.</li>
            <li> I think this product did make my hair grow.  BUT it also made my hair extremely dry!  So, my hair became very fragile and breakable.  So, I threw it out.</li>
            <li> Worked great for me. Left my hair clean and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Nice as an extra shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> I have very thin brittle hair, this stuff is amazing I&#x27;m noticing stronger ends and more volume. It feels healthy and it&#x27;s getting longer, mind you it takes my hair forever to grow. It kinda leaves a weird smell, not bad, but nothing a little body spray can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> It made my hair fall out and I only wash my hair once a week with it. Never again I would use this.</li>
            <li> Product did not work for me. Dried my hair out bad. May work for some as everyone is different.</li>
            <li> Was leaking when I got it. Everything else was good.</li>
            <li> I dont know what I was expecting since I know there isn&#x27;t a miracle shampoo. I guess I was expecting something that made my hair grow a little bit longer? This didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s an okay shampoo although even after conditioning my hair felt rough and tangled. Just don&#x27;t buy it expecting to make your hair grow an inch in a month.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING MY HAIR HAS NEVER BEEN SO HEALTHY</li>
            <li> My hair is growing! Using this product as well as deep conditioning and regularly applying oils to my scalp has made a huge difference in the look feel and length of my hair.</li>
            <li> I really love using this product. My hair is so moisturized and soft. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of growth with this product</li>
            <li> Horrible. Bottles are small and dried out my hair :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it still is fantastic! I love how soft it makes my hair and the smell is great too.</li>
            <li> Really adds volume to my hair. Hoping to see my hair grow faster.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. It wasn&#x27;t what I thought it should be like. I have heard that this brand is amazing, but the conditioner actually was thin and dried out my hair. My hair even started shedding terribly. Take my advice and don&#x27;t buy this!!</li>
            <li> I only recieved the shampoo.</li>
            <li> This does not work. Junk!!!!</li>
            <li> This has help improve my damage hair and its making my hair smoother and longer. Happy I bought this !!(:</li>
            <li> Keeps hair healthy for sure.</li>
            <li> Never again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo/conditioner were a nightmare. I&#x27;m confused why its so highly recommended for people use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a year of using this shampoo/conditioner combination every day, my hair has been left weak and follicles became clogged. Almost 3 years later my hair is finally in recovery. I know diet, stress, frequency of shampooing/conditioning plays a role in hair health, but no other shampoo/conditioner gave me headaches like Mane &#x27;n Tail - both the herbal and non-herbal.</li>
            <li> Product came just within a few days I couldn&#x27;t really tell a difference in my hair but smells wonderful !</li>
            <li> Really see it working! My hair stopped growing for a long time and I started using this set and I already see a difference after one bottle.</li>
            <li> doesn;t smell great. but love the way this transforms your hair</li>
            <li> I heard so much about this stuff, so I finally tried it, and now I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back. It did make my hair really soft and manageable, and even the deep conditioners I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t seem to do that normally. So props to whoever said I haid a mane like a horse, because I finally went with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is also really good. Especially if you&#x27;re tired of Herbal Essences not being that fab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a combo of clean, floral and fresh, if that makes sense. Not overpowering at all. Beats out my overpriced Nexxus any day.</li>
            <li> Really good shampoo and conditioner fresh and clean smell</li>
            <li> Shampoo smells great...I bought this because many other reviews claimed it helped their hair stay strong and many noticed not as many pieces were falling in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I change my shampoo/conditioner every six days. When it is time to use this one, I lose twice as much hair in the shower. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t glide through hair like many others..also, I have short hair-it barely touches my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;If you want an all natural shampoo that smells great, I suppose it&#x27;s worth it. I will definitely not be stocking up when I&#x27;m through with it.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair feel dry. However, my mom loves the product and says it makes her hair soft. Don&#x27;t know if this is because I have mixed hair and she doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown an inch in just the first month of use. Smells nice and makes my hair soft!</li>
            <li> I have used this and the Regular I prefer the Regular more but this is still a awesome product. Will only use Mane &amp; Tale</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know if it grows hair. But, old hair?  Wonderful:). After just one time my old hair regained the texture of? Not old hair?  I had baby fine hair for my young hair and this isn&#x27;t it&#x27;s so  much better.  I have some hairline thinning so I will have to come back and say whether it corrected that or not.</li>
            <li> great smell and makes hair feel great</li>
            <li> made my hair very dry and it began falling out in large amounts after two months use</li>
            <li> My hair looks great, soft and stronger</li>
            <li> Not even sure if my hair is growing... It runs out so quickly!</li>
            <li> Dries your hair out and leaves a waxy film.</li>
            <li> I have to change my review, unfortunately.  After consistent use of this for three months, it started going downhill.  My scalp just got too dry and itchy.  It seemed to make my thin spots more apparent.  My hair is VERY sensitive, and this was just too harsh for it.</li>
            <li> My daughter (age 10) bought this and thinks it makes her hair soft and has gotten longer. I have noticed the conditioning effect, not so much the length. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> i like the smell but it definitely dried my hair out. to the point where i might just throw out the rest of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I ignored these when I just bought them. I thought it would just be another waste of money. However, I just decided to use and oh! Amazing! They are great for my extremely dry hair. Forget the hype. This works! Six stars!</li>
            <li> This smells soooooooo amazingly good...I love these products</li>
            <li> I used the original Mane &#x27;n Tail a long time ago and loved it. This is even better because it smells so nice. I love the way it strengthens my hair and  makes it look so healthy.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my hair feel so waiting to see how it works. I will give it a month or so.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! But didn&#x27;t see the result yet coz i just had this for a couple days ago</li>
            <li> The lids came lose and run everywhere. The bottles are smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> just like any other shampoo</li>
            <li> Going to order another set! My hair is so soft and silky! Really does the work! I don&#x27;t think I can go back to another shampoo/conditioner!</li>
            <li> this stuff sucks it leaves my hair feeling even more dry it smells horrible  will not buy product again</li>
            <li> I have to use a repair shampoo and conditioner at the same  time as I use this product because it really dries out my hair and I&#x27;ve never have had problems with any hair product of any kind before but I do feel like my hair is growing fast ish</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any growth yet...</li>
            <li> Great smelling product! Hair is softer then a horses mane. Love it! super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair feel like actual horse hair an not in a good way. It did look like it was startin to grow but I just did like how it made my hair feel so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner. It definitely helps your hair grow and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I havent used it for long, but my hair does look healthier.Bad thing is that it dries my hair out really bad.AKA horse hair.It also looks thicker.I recommend putting a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Used with Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Intensive Strengthening Masque and Natrol Biotin pills. First picture was taken on Aug 3rd, second picture taken on Aug 17th.</li>
            <li> I have used Mane&#x27;n&#x27; tail for years, now that I have found the herbal gro..I&#x27;m in love with it, my hair looks healthier and stays cleaner longer...will be re-ordering as needed</li>
            <li> Ich kann sage shampoo und conditioner ist  ausgezeichnet  fantastich,wow.</li>
            <li> It might not work for everyone, but I know it works for me. Especially during the summer. My favorite shampoo of all time!</li>
            <li> I love this set so much because it is infused with olive oil which makes the hair grow. I find this was a major value and no one should pass it up. It will make your hair grow.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My hair has never been more beautiful, healthy and luxurious. I will continue to buy and use this product.</li>
            <li> As a male with long hair I never thought shampoo and conditioner would matter, but these products are awesome and I the joy the feeling that it leaves on my hair after I am done showering. Only reason I don&#x27;t give 5 stars is I feel as though the bottle could have been a little bigger for the price but no big deal.</li>
            <li> Product does not grow hair.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Have been using for 5 months while I grow my pixie cut out and this has definitely helped the process. It leaves my hair soft and silky and the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> I like this product its awesome for maintaining hair growth.</li>
            <li> like it my hair gro fast</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago, and have had a good experience so far. I am trying to grow my hair out, and this is where I decided to start. I haven&#x27;t been able to see any change in the length of my hair yet, but it makes my hair feel so healthy! I normally have frizzy, thick, wavy hair. But now, my waves are relaxed, smooth, and shiny. Also, it smells really good! No complaints so far!</li>
            <li> I have used this twice and already notice a huge difference in my hair.  It is so shiny and soft, and I bleach my hair like crazy.  I usually have to use an oil to help tame my flyaways, but not anymore.  The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather up as much as I would like, but that will just take some getting used to.  The smell is also so nice and delicate, I love it.  I will order the big bottles next time!!</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling dry and was hard to manage.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money on this kind of Mane n Tail</li>
            <li> I tried this product.  My hair is natural.  The herbal shampoo was okay.  A little drying and made my hair a little hard.  However, the conditioner was moisturizing.  The shampoo may work better for someone else, depending on their hair texture and porosity.  For my hair, the conditioner only is perfect.</li>
            <li> It left my hair so greasy and flat that I did not continue to use it to see if it actually did improve hair growth.</li>
            <li> I bought this just for use in my beard.  My girlfriend loves the scent and my beard looks and feels healthy</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who begged me for it because her friends were using it. Thankfully I didn&#x27;t pay as much here as her friends at the store, because we gave it away.  I know so many people gave this excellent reviews, but we don&#x27;t understand why. We both have curly hair and both tried it for a week.  The shampoo has sulfates in it which are very drying to begin with and the conditioner did nothing to add moisture to our already dry (curly hair is dry by nature) hair.  Our hair was very knotty when using this product and the ends of my hair became split-ends, never had that happen before since we don&#x27;t use hair dryers or flat irons!  After looking at the ingredients there are herbal ingredients but lots of chemicals and artificial color dyes (yellow #5 and blue #1) too. Also worth a mention because I did not see the ingredients listed on Amazon, the conditioner has wheat protein in it, so if you are celiac or have gluten issues you may want to steer clear of this. Never again. Oh well, moving on.</li>
            <li> Wife is happy with this product.</li>
            <li> i have such curly hair that its ridiculous! It always feel dry and course, but after trying this, even after one wash my hair felt so much more healthy! Plus it smells sooo good!</li>
            <li> I loveeeee these. &amp;#60;3 I was worried to try them because I heard my friends say that Mane &#x27;n Tail products dried their hair out, and they hated them... but I am so glad that I did. They smell so good, and they are good to my hair. I have noticed growth in my hair, and my nails since using these. I don&#x27;t know if nail growth is common, but it&#x27;s nice! :P I would definitely give these a try if you want to grow your hair NATURALLY, and if you want to smell good in the process. (:</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo and conditioner only about three times because every time i used it I would lose copious amounts of hair. Seriously, it made my hair fall out.</li>
            <li> I definitely like the smell and after using it for a month on a daily basis my hair did grow and felt thicker. My hair remained soft to the touch and it was overall easy to brush.</li>
            <li> I was really excited because some of the reviews said this shampoo helped them stop shedding, and helped with hair growth.  I didn&#x27;t notice any less shedding in the two weeks I used it.  I had to stop using it because it was giving me a horrible rash elsewhere.  I looked at the ingredients and its all chemicals, except near the end where there&#x27;s olive oil etc.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I am a natural red head who currently has way too much henna her hair. My hair is dry. It is so dry that I can wash it two times a week and it will still look decent. I have had a major issue with shedding and breakage and hair that won&#x27;t grow. I had three back to back pregnancies and lost a ton of weight after my youngest. My hair hasn&#x27;t been the same since I was heavier. I have only been using this stuff for a few weeks but my hair feels so much healthier and looks so shiny when I use it. I get compliments on my hair now. I have already noticed little baby hairs popping up everywhere which I can only attribute to this product line. I use this stuff and the spray. I use the spray twice a day and love it too!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo as I&#x27;m in the process of growing my hair out and I was hoping this would help with having super greasy hair lately. It worked for the greasiness but I noticed that when I ran my fingers through my hair I would pull A LOT of strands out after each washing. I lost my hair a few years ago so I freaked out and stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month now. It does dry my hair out a little but since I have naturally thin, oily hair it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all... just makes it appear to have more texture and volume. I am growing out a pixie cut and trying to get to a respectable length before the start of a new school year. I think it&#x27;s boosted my date of growth and would recommend it if that is your goal.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 5 1/2 year old nephew when we took him to a different hair salon and they buzzed all of his beautiful long hair off and edged his bangs a complete half circle, he looked like Spock with a bad hair cut! Not sure if it helps with growing his hair since we also have him taking his kiddie vitamins with a high biotin content. It&#x27;s safe though, it didn&#x27;t harm his scalp and his hair looks shiny and feels soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> This was very nice product. I my use it again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo and conditioner to help me grow out my hair (I recently just chopped my hair in January and decided short hair was not my style). I am taking biotin pills along with this shampoo and conditioner and I honestly really do like the shampoo and conditioner. I believe in conjunction with the biotin pills I am taking that my hair is growing longer. Recently I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from my family members saying my hair looks fuller, shinier, healthier and longer! The smell of this product is wonderful and makes your hair soft to the touch! I would definitely recommend this product for someone who is looking to help their hair grow healthy and shiny while they are in the process of growing it out.</li>
            <li> Daughter cannot live without this product. Good prices.</li>
            <li> Feels &amp; smells wonderful! It&#x27;s definitely helped my hair grow!</li>
            <li> I always love mane and tail especially when I want my hair to grow a little faster. It makes my thick hair very soft and smooth.  I especially love this product because of the smell too!</li>
            <li> Love mane and tail! I started using this shampoo when you could only get it a tack shops. It was wonderful then and is wonderful now. Love the &amp;#34;herbal gro&amp;#34; formula even more than the original formula! Wish I could find larger bottles....</li>
            <li> It got here fast it smells awesome love it</li>
            <li> This product really dries out my hair and ruins the natural waves...gives it a frizzy look.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter and her hair looks great and has grown quite a bit in a short time.  She said &amp;#34;it really works!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Made my hair frizzy :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells great but if your like me and use a lot of conditioner it goes fast other wise not a bad product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this long but it instantly made my hair softer.&lt;br /&gt;Also has an awesome smell.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and pefect products</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I recently damaged my hair very badly. I have curly, frizzy hair which I over bleached and made a million times worse. I remember this product being mentioned a lot when I was younger and decided to give it a try. After one shampoo it left my hair even dryer than it was before. I had to deep condition it just to get it back to what it was before i washed it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product if your hair is naturally dry. I imagine if you have overly greasy hair this product would work wonders for you.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast and I can&#x27;t wait to use this product!! I used it years ago and I remember it worked, but I don&#x27;t remember details so I thought I would see for myself. I&#x27;m growing my hair out and I&#x27;ve heard good things about this product to help it grow. My only worry is it making my hair oily. It says it has olive oil complex in it so we shall see.. I have a lot of hair, but it fine so I&#x27;m hoping it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or anything else go that nature. I will update this after I&#x27;ve tried it out a few times ;) I&#x27;m excited!! Can&#x27;t beat the price! If I end up liking it as much as I hope I do I will be buying the extra large ones!!</li>
            <li> Good brand of shampoo and conditioner. My hair feels good and it seems like it is growing! Nice shine and feel to my hair!</li>
            <li> Just &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;. Did not notice significant hair growth.</li>
            <li> Way overpriced, you can get it for half the cost at some retail stores.  Not sure why it is so expensive on Amazon?</li>
            <li> So I just received this product today . I am trying to make my hair grow out . Well I won&#x27;t see results of growth just yet but but the smell of both the shampoo &amp; conditioner is amazing . I can&#x27;t stop sniffing my hair . Also they both left my hair super soft . I could feel the softness as I lathered in the shampoo it was so light &amp; fluffy . If this also helps my hair grow I will definately be purchasing this product again . Both shampoo &amp; conditioner !</li>
            <li> Great and came within days</li>
            <li> It does help my hair grow but if you have really thick and dry hair, the conditioner doesn&#x27;t really detangle your hair. It kind of melts like water and does not make your hair soft.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair alot, and so far this is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that&#x27;s kept my hair as healthy as before I started dying.&lt;br /&gt;After every wash my hair is noticeably smoother, shinier, and SO soft. It has a wonderfully fresh and clean scent as well!!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> my hair feels a bit rough after using it but overall i like it</li>
            <li> The products themselves, I would imagine, work great. I have not heard any complaints about them from the person who ended up getting them. I searched for &amp;#34;Sulfate-Free Shampoo&amp;#34; and this came up, and the third listed ingredient (after ordering and having them delivered) is a sulfate. Though the product description and actual bottles make no claim to being sulfate-free, Amazon turns them up as a search result. Beware, if you are searching for Sulfate free products.</li>
            <li> I love the look and the feel of my hair after using this product. I will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast, so that&#x27;s a plus. But the shampoo itself is a bit dry. It smells nice, but that&#x27;s about all it has going for it. I didn&#x27;t see any signs of faster hair growth.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair that I am trying to grow out and strengthen. I read the reviews and was very excited to give this shampoo and conditioner a try. Unfortunately it left my hair dry, frizzy, and tangled the moment I got out of the shower. I gave it two stars instead of one because it smells nice. I wonder if I can use this on my dog...</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, on the wavy/curly side which is prone to frizz.  My hair was beginning to be dry and damaged using other shampoos/conditioners and that is why I decided to try this.  This shampoo and conditioner work great at protecting my hair and taming my texture; I don&#x27;t have to use a lot and use it up to 3x per week, especially after swimming and working out -- it would probably be a great summer duo!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this and was not sure if this was what I needed.  I&#x27;m so glad I decided to give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how this would make some peoples hair greasy by the end of the day, but it is just perfect for someone with extremely dry or damaged hair.  Recently my hair has become very dry and brittle.  This is just what I needed.  It cleans my hair and leaves it feeling so soft.  It also has a nice smell to it.  It is even starting to repair the brittle damaged look it has (about 3 shampoos).  Each time I use it my hair looks and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> Literally just received this. Got the product out of it wrapping. The smell is amazing! Now off to use it. I will post another review in a few weeks to let people know the results.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it can be drying but my hair grows like a weed. Pair with a good conditioner to use in between uses and some argon oil and you&#x27;re set. Never thought I&#x27;d have waist length thick hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because a friend of mine recommend to me.  Just started using it hopefully I get the results they got.</li>
            <li> absolutely woooooonderful , I got it yesterday &amp; used it yesterday &amp; I am amazed at the shine , bounce , etc . Love love LOVE 😍😍</li>
            <li> seems to be a good deal, but when i received the item its only about 3/4 full...the smell is okay</li>
            <li> WELL......I can&#x27;t say enough to promote this product....I believe in Mane n Tail / it&#x27;s affordable, it actually WORKS and it&#x27;s wonderful for a bad haircut - your hair will grow so fast you will be amazed and it will be healthy and striking while it grows!</li>
            <li> Gave me headaches everyday, stopped using it, instantly headaches went away.  Smells good though.  Pretty cheap looking stuff however.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love his shampoo &amp; conditioner. I&#x27;ve been trying it for the past few weeks, and my hair has grown an inch! It leaves my hair super soft, manageable, &amp; easy to comb. I give it 2 thumb&#x27;s up.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work and the conditioner sucks.  It does not condition your hair at all.</li>
            <li> My hair is still falling out :(  nice shampoo and conditioner though, seemed to be good for my thining mane.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these really help with Gro-ing hair much at all, but they are nicely scented and leave my hair feeling good enough.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and is so moisturizing !&lt;br /&gt;My hair seems much healthier after only a week of use .</li>
            <li> I love the health it gave my hair but it didn&#x27;t grow much. Maybe if used a lot more</li>
            <li> It was an okay product, but I&#x27;d didn&#x27;t last but 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I order this product at the end of January 2014 and from that time till June 2014 my hair has gotten fuller and longer! I washed my hair faithfully once a week and used other Mane n Tail Herbal Grow Products with it to help my hair grow! I guess it all depends on how you used the product and what else you used with it.</li>
            <li> I really like Mane n Tail shampoo n cond. yes I have seen some difference in my hair growth.BUT it does make my hair feel like straw if I don&#x27;t use the conditioner.then it makes it so soft and shiney and manageable.</li>
            <li> Currently, my hair has thinned out and falling a lot.  I tried the product for the first time and noticed a difference right away.  My hair felt soft and thicker.  Excited to see the results in a months time.  Will post an update then.</li>
            <li> Definitely helped with my hair growth for sure! Just bought some regular mane n tail shampoo and conditioner! Hopefully it&#x27;ll help make my grow even more!</li>
            <li> I feel like this stuff make me lose a lot of hair when I wash it. Stopped using it and problem fixed!</li>
            <li> They sent me two conditioners instead of a shampoo and conditioner. A little pissed, is three anyway to contact them?</li>
            <li> My girls swear by this stuff. They use it on their own hair for growth and softness.</li>
            <li> I love this! Along with hair vitamins my hair has grown about two inches in one and a half week. The only thing you have to get used to is the smell it&#x27;s nothing that you smell frolicking through the daisys, ok? But then again it&#x27;s made for horses but in conclusion I will be repurchasing❤️</li>
            <li> I truly love the feeling of my hair after using this product for about five days now. I am truly impressed! But, I believe the photo is deceiving when showing the size of the bottle; it is smaller than pictured.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair feel really soft and I feel like it made it healthier. I&#x27;m really not sure that it made my hair grow faster though.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter for Xmas and she loves it.  She says it makes her hair so smooth and manageable.  She has very dry brittle hair and this has given her a lot more shine and body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get my hair to grow for months and nothing has worked even close to as good as this.. I rated this four stars instead of five because the price is too high. It&#x27;s cheaper in stores.</li>
            <li> Came in on time and my hair is noticeably smoother and much healthier. Definitely will be using this as much as I can!</li>
            <li> Made my hair grow! Second time I&#x27;m ordering and I&#x27;m ordering two sets of shampoo and conditioner since the first time I bought the bottles actually worked. Smells awesome💖</li>
            <li> The bottles were a bit smaller than expected, which was okay. However, I have relatively thin hair and this product dried my hair out terribly and left it really staticy.&lt;br /&gt;May work better for different hair types..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair longer and remembered this used to be a brand that was recommended for doing that. The fragrance is really lovely, and I don&#x27;t get sick of it (as I do with many other shampoos). And I still think I could use the shampoo. The conditioner, however, after a week of use, is no longer allowed in my shower. My ends were dry, so I left the conditioner in for a full 3 minutes before rinsing. After my hair dried naturally each day, I found it was actually drier and looked less healthy. I finally thought to check the ingredients on the conditioner and noticed the 2nd and 3rd ingredients are different alcohols! I was surprised, but I&#x27;m willing to bet that&#x27;s the detrimental factor in this shampoo/conditioner set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I started checking the ingredients on all conditioners. Come to find out, most of them contain some kind of alcohol within the first 4 ingredients. I did find one that doesn&#x27;t and have been happy with it (with hair that isn&#x27;t as dried out). I wonder if Mane n&#x27; Tail&#x27;s deep conditioner would be a better bet.</li>
            <li> Well i guess i&#x27;m too late but all i got is 2 conditioners instead of a shampo and a conditioner :(</li>
            <li> I love this product bc it is guaranteed thick and longer hair myself and my daughter hair is so much thicker than ever</li>
            <li> It gives your hair a nice shine but it weighs thin, fine hairs down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have asian thin fine hair, this combo makes my hair look so soft and smooth but completely kills the volume.</li>
            <li> I used it for a while but stopped because it was drying my hair out.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Since using these products a little over a month, I noticed a change in my hair.......it&#x27;s growing, finally! My hair is getting fuller and I love my natural hair since.  I can do different styles now that it is fuller.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Described perfectly. Delivered promptly. I&#x27;m very happy &amp; recommend this seller &amp; product.</li>
            <li> I think it did help my hair to grow faster.  I gave the conditioner to my son who has dry frizzy hair.  His hair looks good when he uses it!</li>
            <li> I thought they were bigger bottles, so was kind of disappointed for only to 12oz bottles for almost $20 when i can get them locally i found out for $3 per bottle</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews trying to find a shampoo and conditioner to help grow out my hair.  I know that there is no magic product that can actually do that, but I was hoping that it would help strengthen my hair.  It is just like any other shampoo/conditioner combo that I&#x27;ve tried.  At least it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Ive been using thid product for 3 months &amp;Nothing amazing so far, advertisers &amp; resellers are more than capable of hyping up, exaggerating any product to push a quick sell, buyer beware, save your $money for a better quality product.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair growing and thickening product with time used; I was introduced to it by a friend ..Thank you</li>
            <li> Just got these in the mail! Came quickly and pretty well packaged! I love the smell and works great and leaves my hair silky and smooth and grows it fast. I&#x27;ve used the reg kind in the passed so thought I&#x27;d try this love oil one or whatever! Cool stuff.</li>
            <li> My hair has definitely grown using this product. I&#x27;ve notice really great changes! Not even halfway done with the bottle yet and it&#x27;s been about a month, so i expect great things!!</li>
            <li> I was very upset when I got my ordered because instead of getting the shampoo &amp; conditioner I got 2 shampoo! I had to go to an actual store to get the conditioner. What a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly thick, pretty frizzy hair (but it is thin. so a lot of thin hair)) I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now everyday. It seems to me my hair likes it. It makes it soft, shiny a little bit less frizzy. I did not notice any hair growth, but maybe it needs more time. Also I do not dye my hair so maybe that is why I did not experience dryness of my hair. Plus I like it has no strong scent</li>
            <li> My package came horrible! Learn how to check the bottles properly, yeah? My friends were going to buy this but thanks to how my order came, they won&#x27;t be satisfied. A lot of shampoo was spilled . 12 bucks for half shampoo and full conditioner, straight Bullocks!</li>
            <li> Waste of money did nothing for my gair</li>
            <li> My hair is strange so it seems like not very good for me. Still too dry for hair</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I was a bit worried upon reading other reviews, but I&#x27;m so gla d I bought it. It&#x27;s very good for keeping your hair healthy while growing it out. No, it doesn&#x27;t make it grow three inches in a week, but it does help a steady growth. The only thing I could see as a problem is that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t really lather like other shampoos. I don&#x27;t mind this at all. Definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Amazing smell, hairs growing nicely. Only downside is it doesn&#x27;t lather in well.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and has been falling out a bit.  I tried the more expensive shampoos and have been taking Biotin supplements.  After only one week of use, my hair feels fuller, falls out less frequently, and I don&#x27;t have tangles when combing wet.  It lathers well and the conditioner feels very light and rinses out easily.  Very pleased with this product.  As far as new growth, we will just have to see but I&#x27;m very pleased with the initial results.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo leaves hair fresh</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this stuff really freaking works!!! I battled with biotin, prenatal vitamins , hair finity, oil treatments, you name it. But I swear this shampoo made my thin hair grow faster and thicker!! Love love love!</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel thicker</li>
            <li> Wonderful hair products, a must buy!</li>
            <li> i have extreamly curly hair and cut it short as a do over and wanted a lil help  for it growing, it def has helped! and my curls are beautiful :)</li>
            <li> We received the shampoo in short order and were pleased with the product.  I plan to buy this shampoo again.</li>
            <li> This product is okay. I have noticed a little bit of a difference in hair growth. My hair is a lot thinner and normally it is thick.</li>
            <li> AHHHH I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells so good, and I have seen a huge difference in length since I started using it, and makes it strong and soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s sulfate free :( I just used it to get my hair to grow. Once it grew to my desired length (which took 2-3 months) I stopped using it and went back to sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair, this stuff is great. However, if you have oily or flat hair in need of volume, this shampoo will make things worse. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell wonderful, and I can see why people love it, just not a good fit for everyone.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown so much and feels amazing! Even after dying it a couple of times. Keeps color in too.</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon cause I found it cheaper at my local grocery store lol. but I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for about 2 wks now and I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic growth spurt in my hair just yet I love what whether I have my curly or dry it straight it leaves my hair so soft and smooth I can&#x27;t stop touching my own hair haha. I hope I see some growth cause I had bad hair cut recently and I am wanting to grow my hair out longer. But all in all I&#x27;m loving it so far and can&#x27;t wait to see more results. When and if I see some growth results I will return for a new review and award 5 stars lol</li>
            <li> This really and truly does make your hair grow and glow. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I read that it woul d be 12 oz each, I just didn&#x27;t put that together with an actual size.  great product, but expensive for the size</li>
            <li> I love this product and my order came in very quickly! The only thing is that I wish it was packaged differently. I received it with a huge white sticker that said &amp;#34;Keep these products together&amp;#34; and a bunch of tape wrapped around it. I tried to take it all off and it took off the writing on the bottle and left it all sticky.</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute;e LOVES this product and so do I. Her hair is super shiney, thicker and stronger. We are so amazed how much more superior Mane &amp; Tail is over all the other same type of hair products out on the market. There is no going back now!</li>
            <li> It smells good and it makes my hair soft and I&#x27;ve already noticed my hair is growing!</li>
            <li> My hair has grown an inch since starting this product about a month ago love it!</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair grow fast and it tames the frizz. It also smells great. The only complaint I have is that I have to use a lot of the shampoo to get it to lather and a lot of conditioner to saturate my hair (my hair is long) compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> so far so good! got here 2 days after I ordered it. my hair is so soft &amp; healthy. I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth yet, but I have only been using it for a few days. I love it! definitely reccommend if you want shiner, healthier hair. i&#x27;m considering getting the heat protectant when my next paycheck comes around</li>
            <li> STILL USING IT WILL TAKE TIME TO KNOW THE RESULT</li>
            <li> OK so 2 weeks ago I grabbed the scissors &amp; cut a lot of my hair off!!!! Because I bleached it &amp; it got fried! So I just colored it dark! My hair looked horrible! So I ordered this product &amp; omg!!! It has helped my hair after 1 wash! my hair has so much volume &amp; beautiful!!!!! So good!!! I&#x27;ll definitely buy this til the day I die! Also I recommend the leave in conditioner main n tail herbal gro add some on before blow drying your hair! Its amazing! NO NEED TO SPEND A FORTUNE ON EXPENSIVE SHAMPOO &amp; CONDITIONER LIKE I USE TO DO!</li>
            <li> Company ships fast, got everything just like i was supposed to. Product made my hair feel sort of dry and brittle so i didn&#x27;t use it much. Not sure how well it helps with hair growth since i stopped using it after the first week.</li>
            <li> The smell is Ahhh mazingggg.. I dont know if it works yet or no i only used it twice lol. Ill get back at you on that one.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! If you are looking to grow out your hair, this shampoo and conditioner and Biotin vitamins for you hair ARE THE WAY TO GO!!! Seriously!!! I have the hardest time growing my hair and between this product and Biotin vitamins, my hair is growing like a weed!!</li>
            <li> Smells so good and my hair is so soft!</li>
            <li> works great. I can tell a huge difference and it smells so good</li>
            <li> I Dont like how my hair smells or feels with this</li>
            <li> This is very good Shampoo! It work very good and you can see the result in 5 days! I really recoment</li>
            <li> this was horrible it dried out my hair so bad very upset glad I only bought the small size because I will never be using this again only have it 3 stars because the shopping was fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just basic shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any miraculous difference in my hair but I don&#x27;t think it did any harm either. I like them, will finish them up, but probably won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. After shampooing it left my hair feeling really stiff and hard. Didnt make it that much better with the conditioner. I was disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> So I have THICK and super super tight curly hair. I NEVER thought I could find a product that would work on my hair. i have tried the original main n tail and it wasnt the best nor the worst. but using this after the first shampoo i could feel and see a difference. my hair is sooo smooth and its like magic for my hair&amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> I  think is not bad ,it is not  that goodit eather!</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a light scent, which I find nice. My hair does feel thicker (I have fine hair), only wish the conditioner was richer.</li>
            <li> Only used the product one time so far but did make my hair supper soft an shinny.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the softness this product gives my hair and the smell is wonderful.  I feel it has been helping my hair grow faster the past month so I will continue using it as I grow my pixie into a bob.  It doesnt dry my hair out at all like some other hair growth shampoos have.</li>
            <li> NOT loike the original main and tail which I love. Not crazy about this kind.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift, so don&#x27;t really know how good it is. Except based on past reviews. Fast ship. thank you.</li>
            <li> Ill start by saying that I love mane and tail products.  But, im not in love with this one.  It is costly and dont really like the conditioner.  Id say stick with the original main and tail shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> After trying a few other products, my expectations were not high for the claim that this shampoo/condition helped hair grow. I started using it after completeing my chemotherapy and radiaton treatment so I was anxious. It took about two weeks for me to notice a difference. The look of my hair is fuller, and it has definitely grown in length more quickly than normal. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this combo.</li>
            <li> i dont like it and it make my hair ugly not soft.</li>
            <li> They smelled awesome and it truly works my hair has grown about 3-4 inches in 2 months</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Made my hair grow over an inch in just a month!</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, my hair is SO soft since getting this set!  Not greasy at all!  I have brunette, thin hair (just lots of it), and it&#x27;s just right!  Smells wonderful too!  Of course, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair grow faster, but it DOES make it healthier!  Wonderful product, I&#x27;m definitely buying this again.</li>
            <li> it was okay and i actually found it cheaper at walgreens</li>
            <li> I usually use the moisturizing shampoo and condition by mane &#x27;n tail and I saw this and thought this would be great because I&#x27;m trying to grow out my hair and make it healthier-&lt;br /&gt;Usually the moisturizing one makes my hair feel a little oily (but nothing terrible- it feels healthy and clean) but the herbal gro made my hair feel like straw- the conditioner didn&#x27;t make my hair soft and the shampoo made me hair feel gross and hard- not like the other kind i use by them-&lt;br /&gt;I was really disappointed because It is supposed to help your hair grow and make it soft- but i had to use so much leave in conditioner while styling my hair. :(  anyways- if your looking for something good get the deep moisturizing one :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about a month ago after reading rave reviews. I&#x27;ll say the conditioner has no slip when I apply it in my hair. I have naturally curly hair so I like to try to detangle while I&#x27;m in the shower. I have to use my original conditioner then apply the mane n tail conditioner afterwards. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair any softer then usual in my opinion but I&#x27;m giving it more time to see if it&#x27;s truly beneficial for my hair type. Even so, I don&#x27;t regret this purchase. I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner! I think it smells GREAT! I love that it helps grow hair. I buy this specific pair because it has olive oil complex in it, which is wonderful for your hair and makes it smooth, soft, and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to buy this pair, it&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> the shampoo smells great and leaves my thick, wavy hair nice and soft. The conditioner is really watery and makes my hair heavy (because I had to use a whole handful just to be able to run my fingers through)... I would stick with their original conditioner!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet, but will continue using, as it hasn&#x27;t been that long</li>
            <li> I never take the time to write reviews.. But I am really happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about a month now and my hair had grown about three inches at least!&lt;br /&gt;And it smells so good! I can&#x27;t wait to order more of this stuff it&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
            <li> I had to stop using this product. I have used mane n&#x27; tail in the past and loved it, so I figured I would love this as well. I am unsure if they have changed the ingredients or I have a bad batch, but this shampoo has dried my hair out so badly only after a few washes I have had to go buy a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> Great! Mom and I both use it!</li>
            <li> it leave your hair greasy, it smells great but i think it might be too heavy on the olive oil side i rather got with the orginal</li>
            <li> amazing product, have been using it for a while now and it really works</li>
            <li> Well It&#x27;s too soon to see any growth but I just got my package a few days ago I used it today for the first time lets start with it got here very quickly and was well package !!! I see reviews talking about bottles are smaller then picture (not true) also that it&#x27;s expensive we&#x27;ll if u think about it 12 dollars for shampoo and conditioner is not bad any good or name brand shampoo and conditioner is going to be 6$ and up per bottle ! I saw one review that said it makes your hair feel like straw I do agree with that when my hair was wet it felt a little like straw but ones I dried my hair and straightened it I was impressed my hair looks amazing but again everyone&#x27;s hair type is different and this is only my first day of use but I will update the review in a few weeks I hope this was helpful for someone!!</li>
            <li> Great products at a great prices. And I swear my hair is growing much faster and looks really shiny and smooth when I break out the flat iron. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel great.</li>
            <li> I read how great this stuff was so I decided to try it &amp; I hate it! Thought maybe it would take a while for my hair to get used to but boy was I wrong. I almost finished with the bottles and I just had to stop. Makes hair feel dry and dirty,  just switched back to my previous shampoo and conditioner and my hair feels great once again. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have been using it for a couple of weeks and I am purchasing more today!  I love the way it makes my hair feel.  I don&#x27;t know if it helps it grow yet, if it does I will update this review, but at any rate I am very happy with it and will make this my regular shampoo and conditioner and as long as it stays available I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and i bought this product, it made my hair worse, it feels like straw now and its really frizzy.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim for my daughters. My oldest (8) hair doesnt grow so she has a mullet with very thin hair. I used this ans already her hair has thickened up after only 2 uses. And i have seen new growth in 2wks.</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels after using this product</li>
            <li> The products all work well, they are helping maintain a healthy balance for my hair.</li>
            <li> been using this stuff for a long time, very commited buyer!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me for my son&#x27;s hair twice and I ignored it.  I thought there&#x27;s no way this can be \\&quot;good\\&quot; shampoo because I remember seeing it in grocery stores 40 years ago!  My opinion was It&#x27;s cheap and full of alcohol and sulfates.  Although it does have sulfate and alcohol, somehow it helped my son&#x27;s dry, brittle hair immediately and it smells amazing!  I can&#x27;t explain it because I&#x27;ve bought him name brand, much more expensive salon shampoo&#x27;s / conditioners in the past that didn&#x27;t help him at all.  Thank you Mane &#x27;n Tail!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference</li>
            <li> Really doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair except make it feel like straw.</li>
            <li> Quite pricey but for some it may be worth it, the shampoo smelled good and left my hair feeling soft but the conditioner left my hair feeling dry and like straw allowing for my ends to break :/ weird</li>
            <li> Made my hair dry even conditioner but I notice my hair grow more</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair that gets easily tangled. Great product for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if this stuff works on humans, but I figured it could not hurt to use on my St.Bernard who has a severe type of dermatitis which no shots, steroids, diet or pill could control. It was exhausting for both our dog and ourselves. Plus the dog was in extreme discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried just the shampoo on her and within a week her dermatitis had cleared up and today her coat is so healthy that we now have people coming up to us asking how we get her coat so beautiful instead of asking what is wrong with our poor scabby dog. Plus, there is the best benefit of all in that the dog is the happiest she&#x27;s ever been. So I&#x27;ll be a faithful buyer of this stuff forever. Many thanks to you Main and Tail!!&lt;br /&gt;Love, Bernie the high maintenance St.Bernard</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! People think its weird to use this shampoo and they say its nothing special but i disagree. This stuff really does make my hair grow annd my hair doesn&#x27;t grow very fast at all! Its the only product I can use that I can see the results in!</li>
            <li> It made my hair tangle more it was hard to brush don&#x27;t get this</li>
            <li> I was expecting my hair to be more conditioned.  I had a hard time combing my hair after washing.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is normal for this product, but the Mane &#x27;n Tail Shampoo I received was very watery, as if it had been watered down.  I&#x27;ve never seen shampoo that just trickled out into a watery puddle onto my hand like this one did.  The consistency of the conditioner was pretty normal, compared to other conditioners on the market.  I ended up throwing away the shampoo because it really creeped me out.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF I wont wash my hair with anything else. It actually cleans my hair and makes it smell super nice. I do think it has made my hair grow a little faster. Not like I have measured it or anything, but my hair was to my chin about 5 months ago and now it is to my shoulder.</li>
            <li> I used it the first time it left my hair crispier than a tumble weed. I&#x27;m using it to hack hair growth. I have naturally curly hair. When I apply the conditioner, I use generous amounts of olive oil and coconut oil. My hair came out softer but not the softest it&#x27;s ever been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it to hack growth. Use oil to combat dryness. Let it sit in your hair for a half hour before rinse with cold water.  Cold water closes the hair folic so that moisture locks in. Use it in combination with hair vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you have growth you want move on to highly moisturizing conditioners with slip/ makes your hair glide like butter. Oyin&#x27;s conditioners is a God Send. Oyin is all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mane n Tail is great for growth but the ingredients are scary. It is jam-packed with carcinogens/ things that cause cancers. Hack the growth then get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells medicinal like stale hair grease.</li>
            <li> Really does grow your hair!! :)</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff , my hair has grown 5 inches in 2 months. Amazing!</li>
            <li> My hair feels a lot healthier and thicker! Great product; they sent it in a great amount of time, too.</li>
            <li> Like the herbal but does it actually working it&#x27;s too soon to know.</li>
            <li> Ok product, expected, bigger bottles. Thanks anyway :)</li>
            <li> This made me VERY itchy esp on the back of my neck. I&#x27;m obviously allergic or something. I&#x27;ve NEVER had a reaction like this before. I&#x27;m not terribly sensitive. The shampoo didn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean. I felt like I was rubbing heavy conditioner in but it left my hair heavy and gross feeling instead of soft.  Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells better than the original kind.</li>
            <li> Actually i have been using the LEAVE IN rinse for tangles. It&#x27;s great. I am wanting to buy this product and saw it the other day and almost did. Now I will. But if you see the leave-in rinse for those of you that have fine-hair and it tangles, I&#x27;ve noticed that that too, has not only left my hair manageable, but LESS HAIR HAS BEEN FALLING OUT!  Amazing. I noticed that instantly and was shocked since I wasn&#x27;t expecting that.</li>
            <li> Stuff was good, but i like the original mane and tail better.</li>
            <li> My hair has come a long way from up to my ear, 1 and a half years later is now passed my shoulders but do apply heat and product so it breaks off. I am a hair stylist and tried pretty much everything and this made it grow!!! Not too much but it did help, only thing is it does leave hair dry so I would recommend a moisturizing serum for the ends.</li>
            <li> I have used Mane &#x27;n Tail products before, and loved them. This herbal Gro formula, though, takes that to another level. I have noticed growth in the week I have been using it. I wish that they were the larger bottles, but these do last quite a while since you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and healthy...even on the second day. It smells good, too. I should have ordered this long ago!</li>
            <li> Smells so good and makes your hair extremely soft and manageable. Love this stuff. Would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using 2-3 weeks. Works wonders although my hair felt a little frizzy at first my hair adapted and soaks it all in. Will reorder. Plus I can&#x27;t find it at my local stores in town.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t live up to the hype. (Are all these 5 star reviews for real?!) I have used Mane &#x27;n Tail original formula before and I liked that. This one, not so much. I unfortunately was suckered into buying the shampoo, conditioner, and then the leave in conditioner spray that matches this. Nope. It sucked. Dried out my hair and made it staticky, and it&#x27;s even humid here in MN as we enter summer. Strange. I have fine hair, but it&#x27;s healthy and moisturized as I don&#x27;t blow dry or heat style. Just looking to grow it out nicely. I will be going back to my Nioxin shampoo and cheap-o Suave conditioner. It works way better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually seen a big difference in my hair and I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of other products (EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS) and this is so inexpensive and it actually works!!!</li>
            <li> I bought them over $35 did not free shipping  And the barrel won&#x27;t fall. I can&#x27;t believe that</li>
            <li> product makes your hair dry! Dry! Dry! Dry! Extremely dry.</li>
            <li> If your planning on growing out your hair down to your hips. Then this is for you! Ive use this since high school.had to cut my hair couple of times cause it would grow out alot.I mean alot!!!</li>
            <li> I have long hair (below my shoulder blades) mostly because I am too lazy to go to a salon with any regularity...the last time I went was in January....woohoo that it has been less than a year...that is good for me. Lucky for me genetically I have strong hair which holds up well until about 10 months out and if that hits the same time as winter it is a free for all on the split ends and crazy frizzies.  A family member has been trying to get me to try Mane n Tail for years and I finally gave in about a month ago. In one month the condition of my hair has noticeably improved.  Less breakage, knots and frizz and we are enjoying a bought of nasty cold windy early winter weather so all I can say is they were right. On top of all that my hair shines like it used to.  No more dull limp hair!  I should have listened years ago.  Of course now I have less motivation to go to the salon...Cousin It I might give you a run for your money if I don&#x27;t have to deal with hair issues anymore.</li>
            <li> On my colored hair it made it SOOOOOO much drier. Had to switch to make sure it was the set, and it was. wont buy again</li>
            <li> I just got the products about almost about a month and I can tell a HUGE difference! I am a &amp;#34;dyeaholic&amp;#34;as I like to call myself, I cut my hair in all sorts of styles, and I have naturally curly hair as well. I just recently dyed my hair and it was really dead and killed top to bottom.... It don&#x27;t even look bad at all and its ten times healthier. I&#x27;ve been washing/conditioning my hair every week and it looks amazing and also has grown out a inch and a half in less than a month.! Its amazing! I also got the cream and leave in condition. I highly recommend you get the other products! Works when I wear it curly, straight, or nautural with no additional products ita amazing!</li>
            <li> My hair is really growing</li>
            <li> Best product out there!!</li>
            <li> This product is great! I got exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I used it for a 3 weeks but I discontinued it because it was leaving my hair dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I actually think it started to make my hair stronger, however I had to use another type of conditioner because this one made my hair stringy like I didn&#x27;t use any at all!</li>
            <li> Great product, my hair smells and feels great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m multi racial (white, black, and Cherokee) and my hair is very curly, so are most mixed race people. I have been on a hunt to find a Product that makes my hair feel nourished and I finally found it! This made my curls defined and shine! My hair is bouncy and soft I love it. If you have super natural curly hair I recommend this. My hair has been damaged from my straightening phase and this product makes it feel like I&#x27;ve never touched it with heat!</li>
            <li> I used to use Mane N Tail years ago and I loved the way it made my hair feel. Lately, I have been going through a transition so I went back to my old ways. So far so good. I am glad I purchased it again.</li>
            <li> Hope the quality hasn&#x27;t changed over the years. Looking forward to using it again....</li>
            <li> I like this product. I wish I had gotten a bigger size.  The shampoo is ok but the conditioner is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would help my hair a ton... but it really has! My hair is extremely damaged from coloring and bleaching more than 50 times i&#x27;m my life. It makes my hair super shiney! My hair doesn&#x27;t have split ends but is so damaged, and it helps a ton. It smells nice and clean and helps my hair a lot. Since using this, I stopped using heat everyday, and after a shower while my hair is still damp, I put a tiny tiny pit of coconut oil to help and a little argan oil. Hope this helps. :)&lt;br /&gt;Will update when I see more hair growth! *</li>
            <li> After the first use of this product, my hair felt 100 times softer, I have only had for 3 days so I don&#x27;t know if it actually helps your hair grow or not. but two thumbs up so far!</li>
            <li> I love the product but when I received it the conditioner had somehow opened in the packaging and was all over the bottle :/ i use a TON of conditioner so I like to make every bit last lol</li>
            <li> I have to use another conditioner along with this one because it doesn’t make it easy to comb out my curly hair. I haven’t used this long enough to tell if it helps with growth. Will follow up later.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference.</li>
            <li> The only reason this got a 1 star is because I couldn&#x27;t give it 0. I was so excited to get this product and start using it. My sisters wedding is coming up and I wanted long perfect hair, so this product was recommended by my cousin who is a hair dresser.  I waited patiently for it to arrive,  and it did arrive early, but I regret using it.  The first time I used it,  during the conditioning I pulled out literally 2 hand fulls of hair!  I thought I would give it the benefit of the doubt and assumed that it was just ridding me of my dead hair, but this continued to happen. I used it 4 times and it was not getting better. I am beyond pissed off at this product. Next time I went back to my cousin she immediately noticed the difference, how thin my hair had become and it just felt awful too. She will no longer be recommending this trash to any other clients!</li>
            <li> has really helped build volume</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff 3 weeks ago.  Normally my hair is very dry and thin and has not grown past my collar bone since I can remember.  It now feels fuller and isn&#x27;t breaking off at all!  It&#x27;s grown 2 inches in 3 weeks!!  I will be a loyal Mane &#x27;n Tail user forever.  I would recommend a better conditioner.  I have a hard time detangling with this stuff.  Investing in a leave-in conditioner is a good alternative.  I never write reviews, felt this one was a must!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s in my head or wishful thinking, but I do feel like my hair is a bit longer.  I&#x27;ve only been using this product about a week.  If nothing else, my itchy scalp is gone, my hair is not nearly as oily, my hair is softer and more manageable, and my hair just feels lighter!</li>
            <li> Upon getting these bottles I had to try them right away.&lt;br /&gt;First of all it smells great. Not strong at all which was my first thought with anything herbal. The shampoo provides a nice lather which shocked me. Now I did shampoo my hair twice. The first time I rinsed my hair it did feel a little dry but it didn&#x27;t after the second time. When you put in the conditioner it states on the bottle to leave in your hair for 1-2 minutes, which normally I don&#x27;t do but decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Combing through my hair after patting most of the water out was really easy and hardly a tangle. After my hair dried It was very soft and shinny.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what it&#x27;ll be like in a few months of use.</li>
            <li> Makes hair have dandruff but makes hair very soft</li>
            <li> This item was shipped very, very fast. It also works very well. I will continue using this product for many,many years.</li>
            <li> I LOVE HOW THE DUO CLEANED AND CONDITIONED MY FRIZZY HAIR! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS! I WOULD DEFINATELY PURCHASE THIS AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from thinning and losing hair for a long time. After using this product, not only had my hair started to grow, but it got thicker and fuller. It smells great, its shiny and best of all, its not falling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anybody whether it be for regular use or to help improve your hair quality.</li>
            <li> LIKE HOW IT CLEANS, BUT DOES NOT WAY DOWN HAIR &amp; HAVE SEEN GROWTH OF LENGTH.  COMES W/ SHAMPOO &amp; CONDITONER PACK. :0</li>
            <li> It has really helped my daughters hair. It has a nice scent and is very conditioning. It makes your hair so healthy that it really seems to grow faster. The only thing that I did not realize it that these bottles are not the large size, just a little smaller than a regular shampoo bottle. Now that I see the product really works, I do not mind.</li>
            <li> Great smelling shampoo. Leaves my hair feeling soft and gives it body.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and seemed to make my hair shiny but I don&#x27;t know about making it grow any faster.</li>
            <li> Great! I used to use this shampoo as a child, and it works. I look forward to growing my hair super long with it. Hair so far is silky smooth and beautiful!</li>
            <li> Looove this products for my hair. I have thin curly hair.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and size of this but please be warned that this shampoo is not for color treated hair and WILL RUIN your dye job.  I don&#x27;t know about their other shampoos but the herbal gro stripped the new $500 dye job in the first wash.</li>
            <li> I recieved only the shampoo, and I didn&#x27;t get the conditioner. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo /conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. I felt results after the first wash! And I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks  (I have been coloring my hair for years btw) and my hair has never felt softer I love it</li>
            <li> The mane&#x27; n tail shampoo and conditions have your hair smell so nice not greasy and soft not hard have to give it more time to see if it grow my hair try it.</li>
            <li> Hate this product. Completely dried out my hair and increased the look of split ends, tangles, and my hair was so oily at the roots and would break at the ends with simply brushing my hair. DO NOT USE THIS</li>
            <li> I ordered Mane &#x27;n Tail Gro Shampoo and Conditioner Olive Oil Complex because I always heard great things about the original Mane &#x27;n Tail. I had bleached my hair to remove a darker color I added to the blonde, and it left it very dry and dole. I hoped this would help restore a bit of moisture and shine with the Olive oil...but instead it leaves it very oily. I used both full bottles thinking my hair needed time to adjust, but sadly that wasn&#x27;t the case. No matter what, and hour or two after my hair was dry, it just looked greasy and dirty. I won&#x27;t buy again obviously do to the product, but the shipping was on time and I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the seller.</li>
            <li> It really works! It just takes some time! Shampoo and conditioner smells great, and it makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> I really do like this shampoo and conditioner. It does make my hair feel really strong and I have seen growth within the past month. The only complaint that I have is that the conditioner does not make my hair soft. I don&#x27;t know why. I have used several other brands and they would leave my hair very soft, but this one leaves it feeling &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34;......</li>
            <li> It makes my hair dry and creates split ends.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping with the hair growth, Love the shampoo just wished I&#x27;d have looked more closely at the size, pretty small for 14-- for the pair. Can probably find them somewhere else cheaper, which I will be doing because I love the shampoo/conditioner. Hair is very full of body and soft. Also seems to be helping with the split ends. :)</li>
            <li> i use this on my kids and myself and it works so amazing!! And also smells great :) I recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I truly love this shampoo and conditioner. I had previously bought this set a few months ago and I did see a difference. My hair was less frizzy and a lot softer!! Split ends are almost non existent. The only thing you need to watch for is the amount of conditioner that would work with your type of hair. I have naturally oily hair and at the end of my washing routine I don&#x27;t put the conditioner on my scalp I apply it to the hair from the base of hairline to the tips. I had run out of the shampoo and conditioner thought I could return to the regular mane n tail that I had bought but there was a noticeable difference my hair wasn&#x27;t as smooth and actually started to get frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use this combo with two other mane n tail products. The leave in creme which I have left a review of, a small bit goes a long way. I have been using that for over 6 months and haven&#x27;t missed a single day of using it after a shower. And I recently bought the spray therapy to apply to the top of my head. I have only had that for a week so I haven&#x27;t written a review. So far so good though.</li>
            <li> Love this, I was a skeptic even after reading all the positive reviews but, I am more than happy with this product. An inch in a month is more than my hair has grown (In that time period) since my son was born four years ago.</li>
            <li> Love it! Love the way my scalp feels, I have only been using it for a week but so far so good! Only thing is the size, I was not expecting such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> The bottles are smaller than they appear in the picture.  In the future I will compare the ounces to what I currently have.  I love the shampoo and conditioner. My hair has been super soft since I have been using it.</li>
            <li> This product is way better than the original Mane &#x27;n Tail. I was disappointed about the size but I am pleased with the product. If you are looking into purchasing this item do yourself a favor and buy two.</li>
            <li> After just one use my hair is thicker. But, will it grow faster? That remains to be seen. I have wavy hair and this product put some curls into those waves. I am not complaining. I don&#x27;t always straighten my hair. I had a TERRIBLE cut recently and I just want it to grow faster. If I can update this, I will when I know for sure...</li>
            <li> Mane n Tail is usually a good shampoo this is my first time trying the Herbal Gro... I don;t like it. It left my hair feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> Not the big bottles. But it smells WONDERFUL! I LIKE IT</li>
            <li> Bottles are super small and the regular kind works just as good for a LOT cheaper.</li>
            <li> A little expensive for such small bottles but this specific kind of mane and tale is not sold near me, so I had no choice</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look nice and it has helped my hair look nicer I had a compliment from the job it does.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t make my hair feel as great as I think it could have.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been healthier!</li>
            <li> Both tops were not tight leaking all over the box with my other product I bought!!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make magic. It&#x27;s more like a regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> Leave hair tangly and rough</li>
            <li> Shipped as expected.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo it really work it grow your hair and it keeps shining</li>
            <li> My luscious flow is golden</li>
            <li> and conditioner, I have used mane n tail for years, I really like this new one. Will get it again. Leaves my hair with body, not limp</li>
            <li> Loved it :)) Need to buy more !</li>
            <li> The smell takes some getting used to! My hair did not grow and faster with product than with any other shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I got it today shipped fast with 2 day delivery it smells great and can&#x27;t wait to try it out I will update in about two weaks today is 3/9/15</li>
            <li> It is a nice combination for my hair.  My hair feels great and I will continue to use these products.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I purchased this after a bad haircut to try to grow my hair out quicker. This product is really good quality for your money and leaves my hair super soft and very healthy. My hair had grown very quickly although I have been using other products that might contribute.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice and last a long time. Do recommend even if you aren&#x27;t growing your hair out! Makes your hair super healthy.</li>
            <li> Shampoo really dries out your hair and conditioner does not moisturized. I liked the herbal smell but this really didn&#x27;t do much for me or my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair responded beautifully to it for about 3 weeks.  Then, it started to get very stringy, and I had a ton of split ends.  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I dye my hair every six weeks or so. I love the moisture that is added to my hair and not the oily feeling. I dont wash my hair daily and this product keeps my hair full of body and super soft in between washes. To early to see a change in growth. My hair does have more shine to it. Try it. Its definitely a good product!</li>
            <li> It made my hair really dry and brittle had to use my other conditions just to soften it back up but it does smell ok</li>
            <li> I recently bought both shampoo and conditioner. I have a problem with hair loss, so i decided to try these products. After two times of using it i have noticed getting a lot of dandruff and my hair loss is even worth than before. Save your money and try something else!</li>
            <li> For anyone whom has brittle, and/or dry hair... This product makes your hair feel natural to the touch, and look. I&#x27;ve used everything from Redkin to Paul Mitchell products. Which I still use... However, I&#x27;ve used Mane &amp; Tail on my horses and always noticed that this product leaves a nice softness and sheen look to the horses hair which is indeed very course. Using this product helps the horses hair from splitting and breaking. This formulation is indeed Ph balanced. I highly recommend Mane &amp; Tail which it does indeed enrich your hair, and adds a look of luster!</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my hair feel! I&#x27;ve used the original Mane &#x27;n Tail before and while my hair growth did speedup, my hairs dried out. This blend makes my hair feel silky. I do use both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair feela so awesome</li>
            <li> on hot days it makes my hair more oily than usual. It could just be my hair type though. I really like the smell and hopefully it helps my hair grow. Too early to tell though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mane n tail before and loved it but the herbal gro is even better. I use it with the strengthening spray and the therapy spray and my hair has never been so soft and silky. Def recommend it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite sometime and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet. Smells nice.</li>
            <li> Love it!! My hair is actually growing and looks more healthy 😄&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this product really works!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for nearly two months after getting a butchered pixie cut.&lt;br /&gt;I actually had to trim my hair yesterday because it was growing so fast! It was already down to my shoulder. Not to mention it was incredibly strong and healthy. Awesome product it definitely surpasses the competition in my book!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I don&#x27;t know if its all mental or if my hair is actually growing faster and stronger. But at least it smells good!</li>
            <li> I asked a new stylist to trim off about 2 inches, and she ended up whacking off over four! I started using the shampoo and got 2 inches back in about two months. I also have extremely oily hair at my roots and I found that this shampoo keeps the oil under control very well. I don&#x27;t think I will continue to use the shampoo and after I get my length back, but it certainly rescued me from the worst haircut I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product over the last couple of months, and I must say it works great, BUT, only if you switch it on and off with other shampoos. This shampoo will make your hair feel clean, but if its used all the time by itself, it will dry it out because of the amount of protein in it and not enough &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34;. I have thick wavy brown hair and when I used it along with Aussie or Pantene, I saw the best results.</li>
            <li> Has not done nothing for my hair at all</li>
            <li> I love mane n tail but this is not worth it at all I paid almost $30 in total with tax and shipping expecting 2 large bottles since for 7.99 at a retail store that&#x27;s what u get but I open my package and had 2 extra small bottles.. I&#x27;ve never even seen bottle this small sold in stores very disappointing!! For $14 u get two large bottles at Kmart and they usually have buy one get one free!! But it did make my hair really shiny, probably not good news to some one who has naturally greasy hair or thin hair! Won&#x27;t buy these from here again, in store would be WAAYY cheaper!</li>
            <li> Not at all impressed by this product</li>
            <li> Smells good... but stripped my hair as I washed it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it in my hair, will not purchase again</li>
            <li> My hair grew an inch noticeably faster at first, but then it returned to normal growth. I love Main &#x27;n Tail, but something about the texture of this stuff had me glad to return to my normal shampoo. I also bought the normal Main &#x27;n Tail a few months ago, and it seemed to work the same way, but with a better texture.</li>
            <li> I swear it makes my hair grow much faster!</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Does awesome with my hair!!! 😊😊</li>
            <li> It completely dried out my hair! I would not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo .. Make my hair grow faster n strong ..</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo! I like to alternate it with my Wen. Since Wen tends to make my hair lifeless I will use Main &#x27; Tail like once a week.  As far it helping my hair to grow, I haven&#x27;t noticed a differences. Although I haven&#x27;t used it that long either.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> This helped me gain 6 inches in 4 months last year and I&#x27;ve recently cut my hair again (shaved all around with some length on top) and I&#x27;ve changed my mind about it yet again so I&#x27;m going back to this to gain some length. Shipping was crazy fast!</li>
            <li> Terrible!  Leaves hair dry and tangled. Conditioner does no condition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as moisturing as I expected. It makes my hair even drier than before.  Maybe I should have bought the deep moisturing one.</li>
            <li> Didnt work for my hair</li>
    </ol>
