            <li>Worked great.  </li>

            <li>very fast delivery and very excellent product</li>

            <li>Works great, compatible, charges quickly.</li>
            <li>An excellent replacement part or extra charger if you need it.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>Once I was able to plug it in, it begun charging the shaver fine.</li>
            <li>Product arrived just as advertised, and very quickly.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend as a replacement for my model razor.</li>
            <li>This works just fine on my Panasonic ES8103.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a replacement and am really happy with it 2 months later!</li>
            <li>and I did not have time to return it, so I ended up manually shaving the plastic jack with a knife to force it to fit into the shaver.</li>
            <li>Easy to order and quick delivery, which is needed when you have lost the cord to your razor.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>The original was forgotten at a hotel.</li>
            <li>I lost my original charger while on vacation.</li>
            <li>Works as well as the original and has a longer cord.  </li>
            <li>and I do not notice any difference between the PWR+ model and the Panasonic original.</li>
            <li>I think it takes about 6 hours to do a full charge, something in that range.</li>
            <li>Recently, I lost my charger, so I had to buy one..., and was happy to see a reasonably priced option.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the light letting me know that it has power as I often trip my safety button in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed-hubby lost his shaver power cord and this replacement was exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li>This charger is way more than I expected.</li>
            <li>The joints where the cord meets the recharger plug or plug to fit the razor are solid.</li>
            <li>I really needed a charger</li>
            <li>I purchased this charger as a replacement to the original charger that I left at a hotel accidentally.  </li>
            <li>I got this charger because I left the original charger when i moved.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it (certainly don&#x27;t pay 2x for the OEM charger.)</li>
            <li>I lost the charger cord for my Panasonic ES8103S and after reading some of the reviews for the PWR+, I thought I might have to buy a whole new razor.</li>
            <li>Works as advertised on older electric razor.</li>
            <li>I had tried to buy one a year ago, but the price was so high, it did not make sense.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>Now I have to return it and ended up buying him a new razor too.  </li>
            <li>Works great but ridiculously expense for a little cord.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a little red light on the plug to indicate it&#x27;s plugged in to a live outet.</li>
            <li>I consider myself fortunate to have Amazon to get these hard to find products</li>
            <li>They are clearly built not to work loose.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is the fit is a little too tight but doesn&#x27;t affect the charge or razor.</li>

            <li> I own a couple Panasonic chargers- one for home, and one I keep in my bag for my travels.  The biggest challenge I had was keeping it charged, as I was forever misplacing the charging cord.  I had tried to buy one a year ago, but the price was so high, it did not make sense.  Recently, I lost my charger, so I had to buy one..., and was happy to see a reasonably priced option.  I bought this one from pwr+, and it has worked great. It is a perfect substitute for the OEM version, at a fraction of the price.  There is no functional difference between this and the OEM version.  I highly recommend it (certainly don&#x27;t pay 2x for the OEM charger.)</li>
            <li> Rather a tight fit, have to push quite hard to connect.</li>
            <li> Work well with ES8103S (Panasonic) it is universal plug so you wiggle the plug in place, however, it is not a issue. will recommend to other.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly well!</li>
            <li> very fast delivery and very excellent product</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Bought it a month ago and I can&#x27;t complain.  An excellent replacement part or extra charger if you need it.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Just what I needed 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> I packed my charger in a box when I moved and ordered this one before my battery died. This charger is way more than I expected. It even restored my battery life that seemed to be dwindling.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised on older electric razor.</li>
            <li> Works great but ridiculously expense for a little cord.</li>
            <li> The product works as expected  and was  lower in cost than the OEM model.  Only question that remains is long term reliability. Only time will tell. So far, I am very satisfied. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works great. Does its thing.</li>
            <li> This works just fine on my Panasonic ES8103. There&#x27;s also a little red light on the plug to indicate it&#x27;s plugged in to a live outet. I think it takes about 6 hours to do a full charge, something in that range. I remember one time I came home for lunch as I usually do, and I plugged in my es8103 which was at 6%. I went back to the office, and when I came home from work around 5:45p, it was fully charged.</li>
            <li> Dead on arrival...does not work with my Panasonic shaver even though model was listed as covered.</li>
            <li> This was bought as a replacement recharger. The original was forgotten at a hotel. This replacement fits my electric shaver perfectly. It is solid construction. The joints where the cord meets the recharger plug or plug to fit the razor are solid. They are clearly built not to work loose. I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I lost my original charger while on vacation. I purchased this as a replacement and am really happy with it 2 months later! The cord is longer than the factory which is great for letting it charge on the counter. I also really like the light letting me know that it has power as I often trip my safety button in the bathroom. The only downfall is the fit is a little too tight but doesn&#x27;t affect the charge or razor. I give this a thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Did not fit ES8109 shaver and what I got was different than what was pictured including serial number.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, this charger did not fit my Panasonic ES8103, even though the description of the charger clearly says that it is compatible this model. I really needed a charger and I did not have time to return it, so I ended up manually shaving the plastic jack with a knife to force it to fit into the shaver. Once I was able to plug it in, it begun charging the shaver fine.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware!  I purchased this charger as a replacement to the original charger that I left at a hotel accidentally.  The charger worked for just over a month,  just long enough to past the return period.  Don&#x27;t waste your money,  buy the OEM charger!</li>
            <li> Worked great.  Just what we needed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a Christmas gift to replace the lost cord to my husband&#x27;s Panasonic ES8103 wet/dry razor (listed as compatible.)  He ran upstairs to plug it in just to come down quickly in disappointment because it doesn&#x27;t fit his model as stated.  Now I have to return it and ended up buying him a new razor too.  DO NOT BUY FOR YOUR PANASONIC ES8103 WET/DRY RAZOR-DOESN&#x27;T FIT!!!</li>
            <li> Great product...works as well as the original changer.  Easy to order and quick delivery, which is needed when you have lost the cord to your razor.</li>
            <li> Product arrived just as advertised, and very quickly. Works perfectly for my husband&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li> Works great, compatible, charges quickly. Nothing to complain about. Delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> It was perfect with a great price!  Would recommend does the job!</li>
            <li> Just what was needed!!</li>
            <li> perfect fit! just what i need.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the original and has a longer cord.  Very pleased</li>
            <li> I got this charger because I left the original charger when i moved. This product does eactly what it&#x27;s supposed to and i haven;t had a single problem with it. If you&#x27;re looking for a replacement, look no further.</li>
            <li> Charges razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed-hubby lost his shaver power cord and this replacement was exactly what we needed. I consider myself fortunate to have Amazon to get these hard to find products</li>
            <li> The replacement cord matched perfectly and the seller fulfilled my order expediently.</li>
            <li> I lost the charger cord for my Panasonic ES8103S and after reading some of the reviews for the PWR+, I thought I might have to buy a whole new razor. Fortunately this adapter is a perfect replacement for the OEM. I&#x27;ve used it for six weeks and I do not notice any difference between the PWR+ model and the Panasonic original. Strongly recommend as a replacement for my model razor.</li>
