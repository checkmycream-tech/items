    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with them!</li>
            <li>Great for nail art</li>
            <li>im verry happy with the seller</li>
            <li>They are very cute, but the problem that I found is that after a week the flowers start to turn out brownish color like the metal is coming off.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply on nails and for decoration will be beautiful.</li>
            <li>Love the quality, too!</li>
            <li>They are cute though!</li>
            <li>this product look amazing in the nails</li>
            <li>Nice roses.</li>
            <li>Loving these roses.</li>
            <li>These are shiny and look just like a metal rose.</li>
            <li>These are huge!</li>
            <li>they are cute roses .</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with these decorations .</li>
            <li>Gorgeously shaped and very eye catching</li>
            <li>They were okay.  </li>
            <li>Just do a bit of research if your searching for a better quality.</li>
            <li>Love the size and design</li>
            <li>Strong nail glue is needed, they can fall off</li>
            <li>The shipper was fine</li>
            <li>but then again, they were purchased at a cheap price.  </li>
            <li>The bottom is curved to fit onto the nail without gaps.</li>
            <li>Not only are they a very nice quality, but it came way before the posted delivery dates.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;d be much easier to use if they were better shaped to fit fingernails on the bottom</li>
            <li>Nice and big sit well and look elegant</li>
            <li>but with strong nail glue they are usable and really pretty to boot.</li>
            <li>The product came fast and the little flier are perfect for my nails.</li>
            <li>I think the roses are very pretty</li>
            <li>I love this new addition to my nail art collection.  </li>
            <li>so it isn&#x27;t worth anything to me if I cant use it.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color looks just like the picture and has a slightly curved back for easy application on nails.</li>
            <li>The picture is true to what they really look like.  </li>
            <li>They are all cute; and the crosses actually have a slight curve to fit onto your nails which is really nice because I had wondered about that.</li>
            <li>All came in good shape, it&#x27;s a little bit of a wait to receive them, however they do come from far, cute enough to wait for them, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The petals are scratched, and they are all melded together, which takes away the look of many small petals and ends up looking more like gnarled up metal.</li>
            <li>They are pretty and sits low on the nail, smooth</li>
            <li>I DO NOT use nail glue to attach, I place on sticky top coat and let dry.  </li>
            <li>I then follow with another heavier layer of top coat and let dry.  </li>
            <li>They are a little big to wear on every nail but look great on just one.</li>
            <li>It took awhile to get them which was expected, but I love them and can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll take up your whole nail.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not too big and loud.</li>
            <li>I love these gems and so do my children and other clients.  </li>
            <li>I love the look, the size, everything about these little silver roses.</li>
            <li>BUT I feel I should have been a little more educated on the quality before I purchsed them.  </li>
            <li>4 stars because the size is just a wee bit larger than I like but not to large</li>
            <li>It even came with a free little gift.</li>
            <li>They look a little cheap</li>
            <li>You also must get this to small but cute all at the same time i just love it... must get to mad cute...</li>
            <li>I really wanted to see what it would be like to have roses just like these for nail art, they are inexpensive enough to try even if they didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d have hoped.</li>
            <li>Regarding this purchase I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>They so far have been on my nails for a week and no problems.</li>
            <li>These are really poor quality, bashed up pieces of metal that end up looking somewhat like a rose.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I could say about these is that they are small enough to use as nail art, without over taking the nail; also there are ten pieces as advertised.  </li>
            <li>At first my order was short but they quickly sent out my missing items and they still arrived before expected.  </li>

            <li> they are cute roses . I am satisfied with these decorations . They are a little big to wear on every nail but look great on just one.</li>
            <li> You also must get this to small but cute all at the same time i just love it... must get to mad cute...</li>
            <li> I love the look, the size, everything about these little silver roses. Can&#x27;t wait to use these on my nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so since the last time I ordered the roses.. I reordered them ... and the crosses ... and the stars. They are all cute; and the crosses actually have a slight curve to fit onto your nails which is really nice because I had wondered about that.</li>
            <li> It took awhile to get them which was expected, but I love them and can&#x27;t wait to use them. It even came with a free little gift. Little sticker guides that I can use for design.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Inexpensive, I received all 10 as described&lt;br /&gt;2.) Gorgeously shaped and very eye catching&lt;br /&gt;3.) Small enough for tiny nailbeds, they are the width of my pinky nail which is why I picked these. Anything larger would be too awkward to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Flat, slightly rounded bottoms are convex instead of concave, making them difficult to attach to nailbeds&lt;br /&gt;2.) They are alloy, so they are a little heavy but that is to be expected&lt;br /&gt;3.) Strong nail glue is needed, they can fall off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with them! I really wanted to see what it would be like to have roses just like these for nail art, they are inexpensive enough to try even if they didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d have hoped. They&#x27;d be much easier to use if they were better shaped to fit fingernails on the bottom but with strong nail glue they are usable and really pretty to boot.</li>
            <li> The product came fast and the little flier are perfect for my nails. They are very cute, but the problem that I found is that after a week the flowers start to turn out brownish color like the metal is coming off.I placed them with acrylic powder to keep them long time. Easy to apply on nails and for decoration will be beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s not too big and loud. Love the quality, too!</li>
            <li> These are really poor quality, bashed up pieces of metal that end up looking somewhat like a rose. The bottoms are very scratched, and bumpy, which make them sit like a wobbly four legged chair that had a leg broken off. The petals are scratched, and they are all melded together, which takes away the look of many small petals and ends up looking more like gnarled up metal. In all, I could mistake these for a small ball of aluminum that was crunched up. The only good thing I could say about these is that they are small enough to use as nail art, without over taking the nail; also there are ten pieces as advertised.  0/10 would buy again. What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Nice and big sit well and look elegant</li>
            <li> They were okay.  They look a little cheap but then again, they were purchased at a cheap price.  I think I had something else in mind when purchasing BUT I feel I should have been a little more educated on the quality before I purchsed them.  The shipper was fine so no problems there.  Just do a bit of research if your searching for a better quality.</li>
            <li> All came in good shape, it&#x27;s a little bit of a wait to receive them, however they do come from far, cute enough to wait for them, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Nice roses. Great for nail art</li>
            <li> I never expect great quality of the products that are so inexpensively priced and simply hate when they take a month to deliver from China.  Regarding this purchase I was pleasantly surprised.  Not only are they a very nice quality, but it came way before the posted delivery dates.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> the underside of the flower is hollow so it is hard to glue it down well almost impossible so it isn&#x27;t worth anything to me if I cant use it.</li>
            <li> These are to big for nails, they should be used in decorations cellular or similar things but not for nails</li>
            <li> These are huge! If you have small to average nail beds and/or do not have long nails don&#x27;t purchase this item.  They&#x27;ll take up your whole nail. They are cute though!</li>
            <li> I love this new addition to my nail art collection.  At first my order was short but they quickly sent out my missing items and they still arrived before expected.  I love these gems and so do my children and other clients.  Loving these roses.</li>
            <li> I think the roses are very pretty, I got them for my sister , if she doesn&#x27;t like them I can use them in my craft work.</li>
            <li> Love the size and design</li>
            <li> I Was sent another product</li>
            <li> These are shiny and look just like a metal rose. The bottom is curved to fit onto the nail without gaps.</li>
            <li> i recommend this product to everybody ilove this product look amazing in the nails i rate this with 5 start im verry happy with the seller came on time</li>
            <li> 4 stars because the size is just a wee bit larger than I like but not to large I wont use.  They are pretty and sits low on the nail, smooth so they won&#x27;t snag on anything.  The picture is true to what they really look like.  I DO NOT use nail glue to attach, I place on sticky top coat and let dry.  I then follow with another heavier layer of top coat and let dry.  They so far have been on my nails for a week and no problems.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color looks just like the picture and has a slightly curved back for easy application on nails.</li>
