    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It has been value for money and has been very good on my hair.   </li>
            <li>I bought this product with the conditioner after a great deal of searching and researching.   </li>
            <li>The matching conditioner is great - that I would recommend if you don&#x27;t care that your shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t match.</li>
            <li>but the quality is great</li>
            <li>This would be a great buy for any guys who want an organic shampoo for sure ^_^!</li>
            <li>(I still need a good conditioner too).</li>
            <li>and I loved it from the beginning.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, maybe not quite like a Hawaiian hibiscus or gardenia.  </li>
            <li>I rated it a four because it&#x27;s a good product...</li>
            <li>My hair feels nice and knowing that I&#x27;m not putting chemicals on my hair and scalp is a good feeling.</li>
            <li>Very good clean, but some stripping.</li>
            <li>My hair felt nice and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have tried GPB, Poo and Condish, Honeysuckle Rose Poo and Condish, and now the Island Naturals Poo and Condish.  </li>
            <li>This is good shampoo that is made better when used with conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it with the matching conditioner, which is superb.  </li>
            <li>Also it smells very strong of earth and herbs, and the scent stays with you.</li>
            <li>one more try.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend now love this shampoo also.</li>
            <li>I also ordered the conditioner which worked better</li>
            <li>I love the conditioner, but the shampoo is not as moisturizing as its counterpart.</li>
            <li>Even the person who cuts my hair noticed that my hair looked like it was in better condition than before.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and will be refilling soon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I do like the conditioner better than the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Their okay for me</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s safe, and a steal for the price.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair which is prone to lot of hairfall, dandruff, thinning and to top</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and has become much better texture wise.</li>
            <li>The one good thing was that the shampoo does have a decent lather for a formula without sulfates.  </li>
            <li>My hair does seem healthier and it&#x27;s chemical free</li>
            <li>Aubrey Organics keeps my hair shiny and my scalp flake free.  </li>
            <li>It certainly won&#x27;t \\&quot;fix\\&quot; your hair, but I would say it is the best duo I have probably ever found for dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I was interested in a shampoo that claimed to reduce frizz, and if my hair wasn&#x27;t so frizzy, I probably would have noticed more of a difference.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try something from Aubrey.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel it was clean.  </li>
            <li>I never get the feel clean feeling on my scalp  </li>
            <li>Now, my hair is more manageable and my scalp is much cleaner.    </li>
            <li>Definitely a good investment for low poos/ no poo regimens though.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, it will be better soft my hair.  </li>
            <li>But I love the scent of the Island Natural.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love the natural herbal smell.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find an all natural shampoo that leaves my hair the way shampoos with chemicals do.</li>
            <li>I do like it though because the ingredients are all natural and it did clean my hair like shampoo is supposed to, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because there are many other things to try and this one could have been better.</li>
            <li>This product has been very gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li>To me, it smells a lot like Old Spice which is fine for some folks but not me.</li>
            <li>But my hair smells fine and is pretty soft even sans conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have purchase this before and was pleased but the product didn&#x27;t seem the same and my hair didn&#x27;t respond to it.</li>
            <li>First time I used it, probably I used a bit too much.</li>
            <li>If only amazon sold it with free shipping eligibility ...</li>
            <li>It lathered much better than expected.  </li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t really like the spicy smell to it.</li>
            <li>it is very frizzy and curly.   </li>
            <li>The fact that it has to be shaken very time</li>
            <li>Now nobody wants to use it.:</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is not really &#x27;tropical&#x27; smelling...smells more like....</li>
            <li>Last night, I ordered the Aubrey Organics&#x27;s JAY shampoo which is more moisture than Island Natural.  </li>
            <li>I would come back if I did not find another natural shampoo that worked better.</li>
            <li>Standard hair care products from the store are very drying and full of chemicals that would surprise you.  </li>
            <li>This is my first natural hair cleaner</li>
            <li>I have fine naturally curly hair and each time I used it, it left my hair tangled.</li>
            <li>It is definitely spicy but not necessarily in a way that most women might want.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this line because it is all natural but this line is not for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Really preferred the old formulation it was a gender neutral scent that the whole family could use.  </li>
            <li>and I got the normal conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still worth a try and doesn&#x27;t way my hair down like White Camellia, but I like the smell of the Camellia shampoo and conditioner far better.</li>
            <li>now searching for a new product.</li>
            <li>This probably was a good thing though because it means it is less harsh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for frequent use.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Island Natural Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>So I gave Island Natural Shampoo</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because it is all natural and that is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I bought the Aubrey Organics Island Natural Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I had always heard that natural products did not lather as well, but this was not the case.  </li>
            <li>I have 4b natural hair.</li>
            <li>I believe in using organic products anywhere near my face and hair.  </li>
            <li>Reduced hairfall considerably.   </li>
            <li>And recently, I noticed my hair fallout more than usual when using these synthetic products.  </li>
            <li>Seems to clean well enough without all the harsh surfactants.  </li>
            <li>Makes my coarse hair soft.</li>
            <li>However it made my hair feel soft compare to regular shampoos.</li>
            <li>I only buy from natural companies, actual natural companies</li>
            <li>This shampoo cleans nicely however it is very thin</li>
            <li>It will not dry your hair out.  </li>
            <li>good conditioner but a little expensive.</li>

            <li> good conditioner but a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I have long wavy, sometimes freezy hair and need something that moisturizes without weighing down and at the same time really cleans.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other natural shampoos that do lather</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy, frizzy, coarse, and dry.</li>
            <li> So strange considering</li>
            <li> It cleaned my hair well, and I am considering purchasing the Conditioner, as my hair tends to be dry at times.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a shampoo that would help with my staticy, dry winter hair.</li>
            <li> I also tried the Blue Green Algae Mask and the Primrose Tangle-Go Hair Conditioner and Detangler, and the White Camellia and Jasmine Shine Conditioner Spray.</li>
            <li> And while it didn&#x27;t make my hair worse or dry out my hair, it didn&#x27;t do much to help it.</li>
            <li> I like that it does not contain Lauryl Sulfate and many of the other ingredients that are bad for our health and enviornment.  </li>
            <li> I do not like the idea that by using a shampoo, I am killing fish and other wildlife.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this new formula.</li>
            <li> My hair is less dry and less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> You will even find that it is not at all harsh as other shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners when you just test it in your hand.   </li>
            <li> and it just did not clean it.</li>
            <li> However I was a little disappointed because it left my hair very tangled</li>
            <li> This time, I used little bit and focused on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> Pro: still gets my hair clean&lt;br /&gt;Con: Smells like something a little kid would use.  </li>
            <li> I switched to organic products but was not happy with several of the brands I tried.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, course, slight wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I also thought  I bought the conditioner for dry, kinky curly thin hair</li>
            <li> While this product works allright, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m overly fond of the smell.</li>
            <li> It was hard to work into my hair.</li>
            <li> My scalp has no more residual!</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviews it has a very faint smell and the shampoo + conditioner</li>
            <li> Very thick shampoo.   </li>
            <li> Really awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have thick, course, slight wavy hair.  I have used SLS shampoo and synthetic conditioner. And recently, I noticed my hair fallout more than usual when using these synthetic products.  I began to seach on the internet and found out that synthetic shampoos and conditioners can clog hair follicles and lead to hair fallout.  I came across Aubrey Organics and read the reviews here.  I decided to try Island Natural Shampoo.  First time I used it, probably I used a bit too much. I dried my hair so much that I didn&#x27;t want to use it anymore.  Then I switched back to my SLS shampoo.  My hair felt nice and manageable. HOWEVER, my scalp got itchy and had the white residual buildup on my scalp.  So I gave Island Natural Shampoo one more try.  This time, I used little bit and focused on the scalp.  My scalp has no more residual! The white foam from SLS shampoo actually stays on the scalp and clog my follicles.  Now, my hair is more manageable and my scalp is much cleaner.    Last night, I ordered the Aubrey Organics&#x27;s JAY shampoo which is more moisture than Island Natural.  Hopefully, it will be better soft my hair.  But I love the scent of the Island Natural. It has a spicy ginger scent.  My boyfriend now love this shampoo also.</li>
            <li> Makes my coarse hair soft. (I still need a good conditioner too). Not oily at all (like the conditioners) &amp; I love the natural herbal smell. If only amazon sold it with free shipping eligibility ...</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleans nicely however it is very thin and I need to use a lot to get any sort of lather. Also it smells very strong of earth and herbs, and the scent stays with you.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because it is all natural and that is what I was looking for. However I was a little disappointed because it left my hair very tangled and I didn&#x27;t feel it was clean.  I also ordered the conditioner which worked better but still my hair was a mix of knots and a greasy feeling. I haven&#x27;t been able to find an all natural shampoo that leaves my hair the way shampoos with chemicals do. I have long wavy, sometimes freezy hair and need something that moisturizes without weighing down and at the same time really cleans. This one wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy, frizzy, coarse, and dry. I thought this shampoo would help with those things. And while it didn&#x27;t make my hair worse or dry out my hair, it didn&#x27;t do much to help it. I was interested in a shampoo that claimed to reduce frizz, and if my hair wasn&#x27;t so frizzy, I probably would have noticed more of a difference. It didn&#x27;t lather at all for me. This probably was a good thing though because it means it is less harsh. I&#x27;ve used other natural shampoos that do lather but this one is different. I do like it though because the ingredients are all natural and it did clean my hair like shampoo is supposed to, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because there are many other things to try and this one could have been better.</li>
            <li> I love the conditioner, but the shampoo is not as moisturizing as its counterpart. Very good clean, but some stripping. Definitely a good investment for low poos/ no poo regimens though.</li>
            <li> I bought the Aubrey Organics Island Natural Shampoo.  I like the scent.  It smells like AllSpice, which is one of the ingredients listed.  It lathered much better than expected.  I had always heard that natural products did not lather as well, but this was not the case.  I like that it does not contain Lauryl Sulfate and many of the other ingredients that are bad for our health and enviornment.  I do not like the idea that by using a shampoo, I am killing fish and other wildlife.  It cleaned my hair well, and I am considering purchasing the Conditioner, as my hair tends to be dry at times.</li>
            <li> While this product works allright, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m overly fond of the smell. It is definitely spicy but not necessarily in a way that most women might want. To me, it smells a lot like Old Spice which is fine for some folks but not me. It&#x27;s still worth a try and doesn&#x27;t way my hair down like White Camellia, but I like the smell of the Camellia shampoo and conditioner far better. This would be a great buy for any guys who want an organic shampoo for sure ^_^!</li>
            <li> I have 4b natural hair. It didn&#x27;t help remove any frizz out of my hair. I also didn&#x27;t really like the spicy smell to it. However it made my hair feel soft compare to regular shampoos.</li>
            <li> My hair feels nice and knowing that I&#x27;m not putting chemicals on my hair and scalp is a good feeling.</li>
            <li> I have purchase this before and was pleased but the product didn&#x27;t seem the same and my hair didn&#x27;t respond to it. I will not order again.</li>
            <li> I recently started using this shampoo, but have been using the conditioner for awhile.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.  I believe in using organic products anywhere near my face and hair.  Standard hair care products from the store are very drying and full of chemicals that would surprise you.  We don&#x27;t need all this exposure to chemicals, which include plastics.  This is not benign stuff!  I switched to organic products but was not happy with several of the brands I tried.  I found this product and I loved it from the beginning.  This will help the health of your hair.  It will not dry your hair out.  I highly recommend it with the matching conditioner, which is superb.  Leave the conditioner in for a few minutes in the shower and it really helps detangle.  My hair is less dry and less frizzy.  Even the person who cuts my hair noticed that my hair looked like it was in better condition than before.  It certainly won&#x27;t \\&quot;fix\\&quot; your hair, but I would say it is the best duo I have probably ever found for dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Smells good, maybe not quite like a Hawaiian hibiscus or gardenia.  Very thick shampoo.   Seems to clean well enough without all the harsh surfactants.  Overall, I like the Aubrey  Organics line and what it stands for.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this line because it is all natural but this line is not for me.  I have tried several of aubrey products and it doesn&#x27;t work well with my hair and neither one of my daughters.  We are african americans and maybe this product is not for us.  It doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as I thought.  I am not saying that this product is not for everyone it is just not for me and my family.  I won&#x27;t be trying anything else from Aubrey Organics.  I have tried GPB, Poo and Condish, Honeysuckle Rose Poo and Condish, and now the Island Naturals Poo and Condish.  None of which works well.  I also tried the Blue Green Algae Mask and the Primrose Tangle-Go Hair Conditioner and Detangler, and the White Camellia and Jasmine Shine Conditioner Spray.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with the conditioner after a great deal of searching and researching.   It has been value for money and has been very good on my hair.   I have fine hair which is prone to lot of hairfall, dandruff, thinning and to top it is very frizzy and curly.   This product has been very gentle on my hair. Reduced hairfall considerably.   Unlike other reviews it has a very faint smell and the shampoo + conditioner actually works wonders for your hair. You will even find that it is not at all harsh as other shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners when you just test it in your hand.   You do not have to use a lot of it either.   My hair is soft and has become much better texture wise. I love this product and will be refilling soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for several months now and I will probably look for another when it runs out. I have found adding water into the bottle makes the shampoo easier to use. It was hard to work into my hair. The fact that it has to be shaken very time I use it means I can&#x27;t put it in the dispenser on the wall. My hair does seem healthier and it&#x27;s chemical free (I&#x27;m using the conditioner too). I do like the conditioner better than the shampoo. This is my first natural hair cleaner so it&#x27;s competing with chemical shampoos I have grown up using. I would come back if I did not find another natural shampoo that worked better.</li>
            <li> Pro: still gets my hair clean&lt;br /&gt;Con: Smells like something a little kid would use.  I am almost 40 I don&#x27;t want to walk around smelling fruity.  I don&#x27;t want the scent to stay in my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really preferred the old formulation it was a gender neutral scent that the whole family could use.  Now nobody wants to use it.:(</li>
            <li> Aubrey Organics keeps my hair shiny and my scalp flake free.  This is good shampoo that is made better when used with conditioner.  It&#x27;s gentle enough for frequent use.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I never get the feel clean feeling on my scalp  there&#x27;s alway residue yuck</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo. I have been searching for a shampoo that would help with my staticy, dry winter hair. I only buy from natural companies, actual natural companies so I was excited to try something from Aubrey. I have fine naturally curly hair and each time I used it, it left my hair tangled. So strange considering this doesn&#x27;t happen with any shampoo. It also makes my hair feel like it is coated with something. Really awful. I shook the bottle well, as the directions say. I would not recommend it at all, I cannot even use the rest of the bottle.The one good thing was that the shampoo does have a decent lather for a formula without sulfates.  The matching conditioner is great - that I would recommend if you don&#x27;t care that your shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t match.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo. I thought I purchased the conditioner and god the shampoo instead. I also thought  I bought the conditioner for dry, kinky curly thin hair and I got the normal conditioner. We&#x27;re using them of course. Their okay for me but my husband loves them so I gave it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I rated it a four because it&#x27;s a good product...works well, it&#x27;s safe, and a steal for the price.  It is not really &#x27;tropical&#x27; smelling...smells more like....carrots.  But my hair smells fine and is pretty soft even sans conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this new formula. now searching for a new product.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product because it left residue in my hair. The same with the conditioner. I have brown/long hair and it just did not clean it. My hair was always oily.</li>
            <li> good conditioner but a little expensive. found it at vitamin shoppe for a lower price.  but the quality is great</li>
