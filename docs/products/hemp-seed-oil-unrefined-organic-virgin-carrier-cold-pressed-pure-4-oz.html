            <li> This is my first time using this oil and I like it. It does what I expected it to do. I make my own oil and butter mixtures for my hair and skin. The only thing I think would be beneficial is if the bottle listed shelf life and storage information. From my understanding you have to place this oil in the fridge. Otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> i have roseca and red skin.  i tried coconut unrefined oil which worked great but i developed nodules.  this oil has reduced the redness, provided moisture to my skin without an oily feeling and it appears that it has the nodules under control.  i use this oil as part of my oil cleansing method routine.</li>
            <li> Of a dozen pre-shave oils I&#x27;ve tried, Hemp Seed oil is best. Reminds me of college too. :)</li>
            <li> One of the very best moisturizers I have found, and it also healed some spider bites that were slow to heal.</li>

            <li> GREAT PRODUCT LOVE  IT!</li>

            <li> i love its everyday uses..... Mostly for lube</li>
            <li> I used this to oil cleanse my skin.  I loved the way it made my skin feel.  I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference with acne, but it did work as a great moisturizer for those dry spots, especially in the cold and dry winter months.</li>
            <li> This is but one ingredient in a skin cleansing recipe I use. Hard to rate just one ingredient when it is mixed with several others before use. I really like this recipe it went into as my skin has shown great improvement doing oil cleansing instead of soap! My pores have gotten smaller, I have less breakouts and dry skin patches, and smoother softer skin!</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>

            <li> I like the benefits of the product the most.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I use it alone, and as a carrier oil for essentials.</li>
            <li> This oil soothes my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the product did not have a safety seal cap. Because the safety seal was missing on hemp oil bottle, I don&#x27;t feel safe using the product. Therefore, I give it one star.</li>
            <li> very nice product. i use it for my hair and it is great sofar.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing.  I&#x27;ve had multiple skin cancers and am using this twice daily to heal small areas that could become skin cancer on my face.  I had one basal cell removed from my face and don&#x27;t want any more cutting done on my face unless it&#x27;s a melanoma.  Hemp seed oil is supposed to heal basal and squamous cell skin cancers.  I told some of my girlfriends and they&#x27;re buying it now also.</li>
            <li> I love this oil I use it on everything!! great for hair and as an salad dressing</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and without any leaking in the box and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I used this brand of Hemp seed oil for the first time to put in my body butter and hair moisturizer, I am very pleased! Great quality oil and value!</li>
            <li> I use this hemp seed with grape seed, pumpkin seed and  broage seed oils for oil cleansing for my face.  All but the pumpkin seed are from H&amp;B Oils.  I am in my mid-30s and prior to using oil cleansing have had problems with acne.  And have used many, many prescription meds to help with this.  Not until using oil cleansing has the acne been under control.  I believe it&#x27;s the quality of the oils purchased here that have helped!</li>
            <li> fantastic product and value.</li>
            <li> Something not right about oil. I&#x27;ve used hemp plenty of times. I threw this one out.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair moisturized</li>
            <li> I like the product.  I use it on my hair and skin, but the way the product was shipped was a greasy mess with no label.</li>
            <li> I got this Hemp seed oil for my face. i have been using a lot of natural products on my face lately and this has been the best! I use this as my base oil and add other oils to it such as Almond, Rosehip, Evening Primrose, Vitamin E, Tea Tree oil and other essential oils and it has worked wonders! I have blemish free skin now, FINALLY!! Yaay!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for use on my orange peel  blackhead prone skin.  Was absolutely amazed at how well it worked for me. I&#x27;ve tried every product out there for over 20 years with no success and after only 4 days of using hemp oil at night as my moisturizer I have no blackheads and the pores have shrunk significantly.  Excellent quality and the smell is pleasant to me although some people don&#x27;t like it.  My routine is about a tsp each night rubbed in to already cleaned skin for about 5 minutes and don&#x27;t wash off. I use the H&amp;B jojoba oil after washing my face each morning and leave that on all day.</li>
            <li> MY SECOND ORDER, SUPER GREAT PRODUCT....GLAD I FOUND PRODUCT ON AMAZON....</li>
