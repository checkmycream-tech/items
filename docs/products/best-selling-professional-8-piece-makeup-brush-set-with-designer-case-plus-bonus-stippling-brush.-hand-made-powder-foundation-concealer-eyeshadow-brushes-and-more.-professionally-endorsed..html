            <li>“Absolutely fantastic set of brushes.</li>
            <li>These brushes look fabulous as described, and came promptly.</li>
            <li>Fantastic brushes , the softest brushes ever used.</li>
            <li>Had a great experience and will be using again in the future! !!! .</li>
            <li>They took to the make up very well and applied on my face nice and even.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to clean and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and the bristles seem to be good quality.</li>
            <li>Cons: The big brushes are not as dense as my Sigma brushes, but I am sure that I will find good use for them, applying foundation, powder, etc.</li>
            <li>These brushes are nice and soft and I absolutely love the case that it comes in, it is magnetic</li>
            <li>Soft, durable and good looking as well.</li>
            <li>Bigger brushes aren&#x27;t great for darker colors, because it&#x27;s so easy for it to get out of hand so quickly.  </li>
            <li>The handles are white and made of wood I believe, very nice</li>
            <li>Additionally, each brush is individually labeled to help identify what part of your face/which product would be best suited for that particular brush.</li>
            <li>of my other favorites in this set is the detail brush, it&#x27;s the perfect size for getting just the right amount of shadow on your lids.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, nice quality, overall happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Will update when I use it for a few weeks but super impressed!!</li>
            <li>and so I&#x27;m really excited to now have a stippling brush in my beauty tool</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes are very visually appealing and pretty to look at, making me feel pampered</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>So far very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The concealer brush didn&#x27;t work too well to apply my concealer, I think a small stippling brush for concealer works best for me.</li>
            <li>Love this brushes excelent quality and the case is pretty.</li>
            <li>To me this is absolutely the most important brush to include in a multi set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li>The handles are comfortable and bright white.</li>
            <li>cannot say enough about these brushes, I use to own Channel brushes and I truly like these brushes better at a cost of one Channel brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that these brushes are cruelty free- an absolute MUST for me.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and the brush heads are nice and full.  </li>
            <li>boy is that true.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really love this set and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>is good quality and will totally recommend this.</li>
            <li>Comes with an insert that gives full details on what each brush should be used for.</li>
            <li>After following care instructions for these and using them daily, they still look wonderful.</li>
            <li>Tried them all and better than my high end.</li>
            <li>I actually began wearing makeup more because I liked playing with the brushes so much,  </li>
            <li>As a beauty blogger, I try out a pretty wide variety of makeup brushes, always looking for a great quality foundation brush.</li>
            <li>I had other impressive experience with Founder (Ms. Candy) ; she&#x27;s very caring your concerns and questions related to products; and make you feel satisfied.</li>
            <li>When they arrived in the mail I noticed the box was very professional and appealing to the eye.</li>
            <li>:) They dont shed and are soft!</li>
            <li>Little of your time for a great product.</li>
            <li>My face looked smooth and the powder was very well blended.</li>
            <li>Love them, soft bristles feel like cotton balls</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive with hair brushes but with this product I&#x27;m falling in love.</li>
            <li>; You make us beautiful everyday!</li>
            <li>It’s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>, it is well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always nice to have extra brushes for travel etc!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any bristle shedding and have washed them twice so far, following the instructions.  </li>
            <li>They are super high quality!!</li>
            <li>Up until now, I had not found the right one for me, nor the right</li>
            <li>They came with a beautiful white leather looking case so you can put the brushes back in the box and cover them up.  </li>
            <li>Using a stipling brush is supposed to give you a more airbrushed look without leaving streaks like when using broad strokes can.  </li>
            <li>The case is really useful for when I have to travel with, and it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li>Love the feel of the powder brush, the stippling brush is not ao cool , takes a lot of product  especially when used with cream to powder, another limitation is the white colour, should create more colour options.</li>
            <li>The white handles give them a nice rich classy look.  </li>
            <li>After using these brushes for a few weeks, i was convinced that these brushes provided more of a better look with my make-up if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>They are very well made, easy to use and very soft.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a quality set of brushes at a phenomenal price, look no further.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a first time I have those brushes as a set.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!”</li>
            <li>I love all the smaller brushes for lips and eyes!</li>
            <li>I love the white leather box it came in</li>
            <li>paint brushes for the first time.</li>
            <li>THANKS TO THESE BRUSHES!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My favorite one is the Powder Brush but a close second is the Angled one to put on eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>when i first got them  I washed them in baby shampoo as instructed and the smell was gone.</li>
            <li>Most of them are too big for my eyes.</li>
            <li>There are so many different make up brushes out there</li>
            <li>I love the sleek look of these brushes and the white tips.  </li>
            <li>I cannot possibly say enough good things.</li>
            <li>Another plus I love is that each brush is engraved with its title (ie blush, blending, powder) which is very helpful so that I don&#x27;t need to keep going back and checking what brush I should be using.</li>
            <li>love that the brushes have the uses printed straight on each individual brush</li>
            <li>They pick up and apply powder very well, but most of them are just too big for painting the details of my makeup.  </li>
            <li>Super soft bristles and brushes for everything you can imagine!</li>
            <li>They are nice and thick , the white handles on these seem nice and durable.</li>
            <li>I wish some of the brushes were a little more dense and full like some of my designer brushes but</li>
            <li>and they are super soft.</li>
            <li>Super soft and sturdy unlike some ends that jiggle and wiggle when your washing and wringing them out.</li>
            <li>Simple n easy to understand.</li>
            <li>The foundation worked just as well as more expensive ones I have owned, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>like I said these work just fine especially when considering the price.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>and you really can tell a difference in quality between each set.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, the brushes glide across the skin, delivering the product (whether powder, cream or liquid) efficiently and without absorbing and therfore wasting any of it.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are very well made</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li>brush as a purpose and it is easily accomplished with these brushes.  </li>
            <li>Very conscientious seller kept me well informed.  </li>
            <li>Items were very well packaged and delivered on time.  </li>
            <li>My wife really likes these brushes.  </li>
            <li>They are very well made.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had brushes that really poked my skin &amp; that is not the case with these.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>Very versatile set and no shedding.</li>
            <li>Another thing I liked is that the larger brushes, which sometimes get out of shape, have a netting that so after you wash them you can slide the brushes back into the netting to keep their shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything expected and exactly as described by seller, love my new brush set</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>If you want new brushes, these are the real deal!</li>
            <li>They got great reviews and they have a satisfaction guarantee, so don&#x27;t be afraid to try them, they may be perfect for you, others seemed to love them, and I am disappointed that I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>These seem to evenly distribute make-up much better than other brushes I&#x27;ve used, too.</li>
            <li>It also provided me more of a variety then my other set with the sizes.</li>
            <li>For those of you who swear by high end brushes and cosmetics, I am coming from using MAC brushes and I like these just as much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These brushes are made very well and in high quality.  </li>
            <li>They have held up very well since I bought them and have lost no fibers when I wash them per the directions.&lt;br /&gt;The whole unit looks very classy on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>These was her first set a professional make up brushes.</li>
            <li>and I have already used twice as much makeup as I normally would if I weren&#x27;t using these brushes.</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft and gentle but still get the job done!</li>
            <li>This is my first complete set</li>
            <li>One thing love about these brushes are the brush names down at the bottom.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 14 year old freshman and highshool and makeup is so fun for me,and because I have sensitive skin I have to pay close attention to what I put on my face</li>
            <li>I have several other brush sets and this is now my favorite!</li>
            <li>I needed a decent set of makeup brushes and now I have them.</li>
            <li>They are very soft, and apply makeup very well.</li>
            <li>Now onto the brushes, the bristles are very soft and and seem to be secured very well to the handle.</li>
            <li>and it is hard to know which ones are good and which ones are cheap and not worth buying.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I have not received any compensation for writing this post.</li>
            <li>I washed the brushes first and they dry pretty fast</li>
            <li>I was wary of buying makeup brushes from Amazon but after spending a bit of time searching for a brand that had decent reviews and a great price I figured I would take the plunge.</li>
            <li>Each brush is great, the bronzer brush is great, my last bronzer brush was so awful that I just didn&#x27;t use bronzer.</li>
            <li>So you definitely need a good small shadow brush to use with those tricky colors that you just want a touch of.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a waste of money; I&#x27;d rather use my fingers to apply the makeup to my face, that way I use what I want...not more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I do not have a very elaborate makeup plan, but I am still disappointed with most of the eye brushes.</li>
            <li>No shedding, very full and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Far exceeded my expectations for the price!”</li>
            <li>really really soft set of brushes!</li>
            <li>I love doing business with small family run businesses, but for my products and my needs they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>They are soft and have instructions with uses and washing.</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft.</li>
            <li>I cleaned them before I used them and none of the bristles fell off so far.  </li>
            <li>IT JUST NEVER SEEMED NATURAL.</li>
            <li>THE BRISTLES ARE SO SOFT TO THE TOUCH</li>
            <li>I was SO surprised to see that</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised when I received the makeup brush set in the mail.</li>
            <li>brush is so soft but yet still dense.  </li>
            <li>I completely recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li>I washed them as the enclosed instructions suggested and they feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the quality</li>
            <li>I HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH A NATURAL FINISH FROM A MAKE UP BRUSH</li>
            <li>I decided to try these with some regular makeup (it was old makeup that I no longer use).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a makeup artist, but this set has everything I need to apply liquid and powder foundation (Bare Minerals), finishing powder, blush, bronzer if I&#x27;m feeling peppy, eye shadow and liner.</li>
            <li>These brushes seem very study, I think they will last for a long time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really had a set of brushes, more like an odd collection of a few at-one-time decent brushes scattered in my bathroom drawers.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are soft and have not shed a single hair since I received them.</li>

            <li> I was so impressed to see the complete set.</li>

            <li> When I first received my package of makeup brushes there was a very strong odor but be you, beautifully emailed me the day before letting me know about and and telling me how to clean it step by step</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft, yet are very good at applying make-up.</li>
            <li> No way am I giving them up! :)</li>

            <li> brushes really are absolutely great quality brushes.  </li>
            <li> Will choose better brushes from MAC or Bobbi Brown</li>
            <li> They are incredibly well made, soft, and the case they came in doubles as TWO make up brush holders.</li>
            <li> Many sets don&#x27;t include a foundation brush, but this one DOES.</li>
            <li> “I love this brush set</li>

            <li> I love the information this company has included with the brushes.</li>

            <li> I am ordering several more sets as they will make great gifts!</li>
            <li> These brushes are nice, they work well and the price point is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the magnet case it comes in.</li>
            <li> These are definitely good and worth buying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been reaching for these more than I reach for my MAC brushes.  </li>
            <li> so Glad</li>
            <li> LOVE them.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the box I realized the brushes came in a white leather storage case, the case is square with magnetic closure, the case is very nice and the brushes fit great, they aren&#x27;t crammed or squished.</li>

            <li> Clean easy too!</li>
            <li> So impressed that when I was looking for a special gift for a dear friend that lives in Peru, it was this set of brushes without a second thought.  </li>
            <li> and they are more precise.  </li>
            <li> They are soft yet sturdy for great application.</li>
            <li> They clean very well, no smell that I have come across and the case is very nice.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am super happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> so the case closes super easy acting as both a brush holder and on the go makeup brush case, this case was well designed, very impressed with it.</li>
            <li> AND, the seller is super easy to work with!</li>
            <li> They literally glide across your skin and are so easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t shed and they come in a carrying pouch for easy travel.</li>
            <li> The casing makes storage so neat and easy.</li>
            <li> Beautiful white box for storage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are stored in a beautiful white leather magnetic case.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> and they come in a white magnetic beautiful leather case box.  </li>
            <li> Honestly if they had it to where can break  5 and go straight to 10 stars I would!</li>
            <li> I loved how good of a deal they were compared to other make up brush sets!</li>
            <li> I kind of knew these were great quality brushes from the smell of first opening the box because it&#x27;s similar to when you open up a very nice set of (canvas)</li>
            <li> They get a HUGE A++++ from me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They get a HUGE A++++ from me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Such a great idea.</li>
            <li> , this makes it a great gift option for beginner&#x27;s just learning about using the different types of brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> “Absolutely fantastic set of brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes look fabulous as described, and came promptly.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brushes , the softest brushes ever used.</li>
            <li> Had a great experience and will be using again in the future! !!! .</li>
            <li> They took to the make up very well and applied on my face nice and even.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to clean and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and the bristles seem to be good quality.</li>
            <li> Cons: The big brushes are not as dense as my Sigma brushes, but I am sure that I will find good use for them, applying foundation, powder, etc.</li>
            <li> These brushes are nice and soft and I absolutely love the case that it comes in, it is magnetic</li>
            <li> Soft, durable and good looking as well.</li>
            <li> Bigger brushes aren&#x27;t great for darker colors, because it&#x27;s so easy for it to get out of hand so quickly.  </li>
            <li> The handles are white and made of wood I believe, very nice</li>
            <li> Additionally, each brush is individually labeled to help identify what part of your face/which product would be best suited for that particular brush.</li>
            <li> of my other favorites in this set is the detail brush, it&#x27;s the perfect size for getting just the right amount of shadow on your lids.  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, nice quality, overall happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Will update when I use it for a few weeks but super impressed!!</li>
            <li> and so I&#x27;m really excited to now have a stippling brush in my beauty tool</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes are very visually appealing and pretty to look at, making me feel pampered</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> So far very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The concealer brush didn&#x27;t work too well to apply my concealer, I think a small stippling brush for concealer works best for me.</li>
            <li> Love this brushes excelent quality and the case is pretty.</li>
            <li> To me this is absolutely the most important brush to include in a multi set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li> The handles are comfortable and bright white.</li>
            <li> cannot say enough about these brushes, I use to own Channel brushes and I truly like these brushes better at a cost of one Channel brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that these brushes are cruelty free- an absolute MUST for me.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and the brush heads are nice and full.  </li>
            <li> boy is that true.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I really love this set and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> is good quality and will totally recommend this.</li>
            <li> Comes with an insert that gives full details on what each brush should be used for.</li>
            <li> After following care instructions for these and using them daily, they still look wonderful.</li>
            <li> Tried them all and better than my high end.</li>
            <li> I actually began wearing makeup more because I liked playing with the brushes so much,  </li>
            <li> As a beauty blogger, I try out a pretty wide variety of makeup brushes, always looking for a great quality foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I had other impressive experience with Founder (Ms. Candy) ; she&#x27;s very caring your concerns and questions related to products; and make you feel satisfied.</li>
            <li> When they arrived in the mail I noticed the box was very professional and appealing to the eye.</li>
            <li> :) They dont shed and are soft!</li>
            <li> Little of your time for a great product.</li>
            <li> My face looked smooth and the powder was very well blended.</li>
            <li> Love them, soft bristles feel like cotton balls</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive with hair brushes but with this product I&#x27;m falling in love.</li>
            <li> ; You make us beautiful everyday!</li>
            <li> It’s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> , it is well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always nice to have extra brushes for travel etc!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any bristle shedding and have washed them twice so far, following the instructions.  </li>
            <li> They are super high quality!!</li>
            <li> Up until now, I had not found the right one for me, nor the right</li>
            <li> They came with a beautiful white leather looking case so you can put the brushes back in the box and cover them up.  </li>
            <li> Using a stipling brush is supposed to give you a more airbrushed look without leaving streaks like when using broad strokes can.  </li>
            <li> The case is really useful for when I have to travel with, and it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of the powder brush, the stippling brush is not ao cool , takes a lot of product  especially when used with cream to powder, another limitation is the white colour, should create more colour options.</li>
            <li> The white handles give them a nice rich classy look.  </li>
            <li> After using these brushes for a few weeks, i was convinced that these brushes provided more of a better look with my make-up if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> They are very well made, easy to use and very soft.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a quality set of brushes at a phenomenal price, look no further.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a first time I have those brushes as a set.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot!”</li>
            <li> I love all the smaller brushes for lips and eyes!</li>
            <li> I love the white leather box it came in</li>
            <li> paint brushes for the first time.</li>
            <li> THANKS TO THESE BRUSHES!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My favorite one is the Powder Brush but a close second is the Angled one to put on eye shadow.  </li>
            <li> when i first got them  I washed them in baby shampoo as instructed and the smell was gone.</li>
            <li> Most of them are too big for my eyes.</li>
            <li> There are so many different make up brushes out there</li>
            <li> I love the sleek look of these brushes and the white tips.  </li>
            <li> I cannot possibly say enough good things.</li>
            <li> Another plus I love is that each brush is engraved with its title (ie blush, blending, powder) which is very helpful so that I don&#x27;t need to keep going back and checking what brush I should be using.</li>
            <li> love that the brushes have the uses printed straight on each individual brush</li>
            <li> They pick up and apply powder very well, but most of them are just too big for painting the details of my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Super soft bristles and brushes for everything you can imagine!</li>
            <li> They are nice and thick , the white handles on these seem nice and durable.</li>
            <li> I wish some of the brushes were a little more dense and full like some of my designer brushes but</li>
            <li> and they are super soft.</li>
            <li> Super soft and sturdy unlike some ends that jiggle and wiggle when your washing and wringing them out.</li>
            <li> Simple n easy to understand.</li>
            <li> The foundation worked just as well as more expensive ones I have owned, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> like I said these work just fine especially when considering the price.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> and you really can tell a difference in quality between each set.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the brushes glide across the skin, delivering the product (whether powder, cream or liquid) efficiently and without absorbing and therfore wasting any of it.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are very well made</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> brush as a purpose and it is easily accomplished with these brushes.  </li>
            <li> Very conscientious seller kept me well informed.  </li>
            <li> Items were very well packaged and delivered on time.  </li>
            <li> My wife really likes these brushes.  </li>
            <li> They are very well made.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had brushes that really poked my skin &amp; that is not the case with these.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Very versatile set and no shedding.</li>
            <li> Another thing I liked is that the larger brushes, which sometimes get out of shape, have a netting that so after you wash them you can slide the brushes back into the netting to keep their shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything expected and exactly as described by seller, love my new brush set</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> If you want new brushes, these are the real deal!</li>
            <li> They got great reviews and they have a satisfaction guarantee, so don&#x27;t be afraid to try them, they may be perfect for you, others seemed to love them, and I am disappointed that I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> These seem to evenly distribute make-up much better than other brushes I&#x27;ve used, too.</li>
            <li> It also provided me more of a variety then my other set with the sizes.</li>
            <li> For those of you who swear by high end brushes and cosmetics, I am coming from using MAC brushes and I like these just as much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These brushes are made very well and in high quality.  </li>
            <li> They have held up very well since I bought them and have lost no fibers when I wash them per the directions.&lt;br /&gt;The whole unit looks very classy on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> These was her first set a professional make up brushes.</li>
            <li> and I have already used twice as much makeup as I normally would if I weren&#x27;t using these brushes.</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft and gentle but still get the job done!</li>
            <li> This is my first complete set</li>
            <li> One thing love about these brushes are the brush names down at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 14 year old freshman and highshool and makeup is so fun for me,and because I have sensitive skin I have to pay close attention to what I put on my face</li>
            <li> I have several other brush sets and this is now my favorite!</li>
            <li> I needed a decent set of makeup brushes and now I have them.</li>
            <li> They are very soft, and apply makeup very well.</li>
            <li> Now onto the brushes, the bristles are very soft and and seem to be secured very well to the handle.</li>
            <li> and it is hard to know which ones are good and which ones are cheap and not worth buying.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I have not received any compensation for writing this post.</li>
            <li> I washed the brushes first and they dry pretty fast</li>
            <li> I was wary of buying makeup brushes from Amazon but after spending a bit of time searching for a brand that had decent reviews and a great price I figured I would take the plunge.</li>
            <li> Each brush is great, the bronzer brush is great, my last bronzer brush was so awful that I just didn&#x27;t use bronzer.</li>
            <li> So you definitely need a good small shadow brush to use with those tricky colors that you just want a touch of.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money; I&#x27;d rather use my fingers to apply the makeup to my face, that way I use what I want...not more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I do not have a very elaborate makeup plan, but I am still disappointed with most of the eye brushes.</li>
            <li> No shedding, very full and fluffy.</li>
            <li> Far exceeded my expectations for the price!”</li>
            <li> really really soft set of brushes!</li>
            <li> I love doing business with small family run businesses, but for my products and my needs they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> They are soft and have instructions with uses and washing.</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft.</li>
            <li> I cleaned them before I used them and none of the bristles fell off so far.  </li>
            <li> IT JUST NEVER SEEMED NATURAL.</li>
            <li> THE BRISTLES ARE SO SOFT TO THE TOUCH</li>
            <li> I was SO surprised to see that</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised when I received the makeup brush set in the mail.</li>
            <li> brush is so soft but yet still dense.  </li>
            <li> I completely recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> I washed them as the enclosed instructions suggested and they feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality</li>
            <li> I HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH A NATURAL FINISH FROM A MAKE UP BRUSH</li>
            <li> I decided to try these with some regular makeup (it was old makeup that I no longer use).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup artist, but this set has everything I need to apply liquid and powder foundation (Bare Minerals), finishing powder, blush, bronzer if I&#x27;m feeling peppy, eye shadow and liner.</li>
            <li> These brushes seem very study, I think they will last for a long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really had a set of brushes, more like an odd collection of a few at-one-time decent brushes scattered in my bathroom drawers.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are soft and have not shed a single hair since I received them.</li>
            <li> I am not a makeup professional, nor do I wear makeup daily other than a touch of concealer and a swipe of lip color and even that isn&#x27;t every day.  </li>
            <li> THE FINISH DIDN&#x27;T SEEM TO BE EVEN WITH FOUNDATION SPONGES, AND OTHER BRUSHES DIDN&#x27;T LEAVE A NATURAL LOOK.</li>
            <li> I know these brushes are going to last a long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for a few days, and there has been no shedding so far.</li>
            <li> I can tell this is going to be a set that lasts a long time!The set</li>
            <li> Each set has been so vastly different from each other</li>
            <li> These brushes are awsome, please make other styles of brushes in larger kits that are needed.</li>
            <li> I had minimal fallout when I washed the brushes!&lt;br</li>
            <li> YET THEY FIRM ENOUGH TO APPLY.</li>
            <li> I have no use for my other makeup brushes since receiving these.</li>
            <li> The holder that you get is also extremely well made and provides a gorgeous place for you to store your brushes away from dust and other nasty stuffs!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the other comments fool you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try out a few different brands of brushes lately.  </li>
            <li> They take less make up</li>
            <li> I find to be using less of my powder foundation with these.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s less waste</li>
            <li> I desperately needed a new brush set.</li>
            <li> Instead of numbers and not knowing the difference between a blending brush and an eye shadow brush makes it difficult to get the proper look with these brushes they have at the end of the brush what each brush is called!!</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, I literally said &amp;#34;wow.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting</li>
            <li> The big brushes are not too bad but the smaller one are really difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it can be confusing as to which brush is for which feature, so I find this</li>
            <li> I have not had any annoying fall out and they appear to be of high quality and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Not such a bad buy!</li>
            <li> Just disappointed that the price when down from 39.99 to 34.99 5 days after I purchased</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time trying to apply my mineral foundation evenly and the eyeshadow bushes seemed to &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; for my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed by the small brushes, however, that are supposedly for applying eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> I made my eye make-up looks dirty and unclean.</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These brushes are beautiful and excellent quality.</li>
            <li> For years now I was looking for good make up brushes, until I came across these. It has a wonderful case to carry and hold the brushes when you&#x27;re not using them. I use them every day and my make up look flawless. I gift a set to my stepdaughter Christmas last year. These was her first set a professional make up brushes. She was very excited when she opened her gift, she loved it and kept on thanking me for them. The are very easy to clean and care for also. This was a very good buy and I do recommend them.</li>
            <li> Love them, soft bristles feel like cotton balls</li>
            <li> I am not a makeup professional, nor do I wear makeup daily other than a touch of concealer and a swipe of lip color and even that isn&#x27;t every day.  Then I purchased this set....  These are the softest brushes ever.  They literally glide across your skin and are so easy to handle.  I actually began wearing makeup more because I liked playing with the brushes so much,  I was thoroughly impressed.  So impressed that when I was looking for a special gift for a dear friend that lives in Peru, it was this set of brushes without a second thought.  What&#x27;s amazing beyond the quality is the price.  If you are looking for a quality set of brushes at a phenomenal price, look no further.</li>
            <li> Received these today. I cannot possibly say enough good things. If you want new brushes, these are the real deal! The packaging is impeccable. Beautiful white box for storage. The brushes come individually wrapped. They are soft and have instructions with uses and washing. I am so impressed by these. They would also make a very impressive gift. I&#x27;ll be keeping these myself though. No way am I giving them up! :)</li>
            <li> I tried out these brushes today and absolutely love it!! Each brush so amazing! My favorite ones are the foundation and blush brush. Gives a beautiful smooth and even finishing. I just wish it would include a lip brush too.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the box it comes in. Such a great idea. It keeps the brushes neat and in upright position. I like that its magnetic and all. Absolutely Great Product</li>
            <li> These were so awesome! I loved how good of a deal they were compared to other make up brush sets!</li>
            <li> I desperately needed a new brush set. This is perfect. It has ALL the brushes I use and they are super soft. Clean easy too! If you are looking for a brush set to upgrade, go with these. You wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft. It&#x27;s a first time I have those brushes as a set. My skin is sensitive with hair brushes but with this product I&#x27;m falling in love. I had other impressive experience with Founder (Ms. Candy) ; she&#x27;s very caring your concerns and questions related to products; and make you feel satisfied. Thank you &amp;#34;Be You, Beautifully.&amp;#34; You make us beautiful everyday!</li>
            <li> Got these for a gift so haven&#x27;t used them but they look great</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these. I&#x27;m just now getting into applying makeup and these are wonderful. Also, the box is great.</li>
            <li> “Very soft brushes with wonderful application. It’s worth every penny. Thanks a lot!”</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for a gift.</li>
            <li> I was wary of buying makeup brushes from Amazon but after spending a bit of time searching for a brand that had decent reviews and a great price I figured I would take the plunge. I am happy to announce that these brushes are of wonderful quality and feel super soft on the face. I have not had any annoying fall out and they appear to be of high quality and sturdy. Another plus I love is that each brush is engraved with its title (ie blush, blending, powder) which is very helpful so that I don&#x27;t need to keep going back and checking what brush I should be using. The box they are kept in is very nice and magnetic so it stays together well and doubles as a standing brush case, love it! Overall, I am super happy with my purchase! For those of you who swear by high end brushes and cosmetics, I am coming from using MAC brushes and I like these just as much. Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> WOW!!! What an amazing brush set! Without a doubt salon quality! Super soft bristles and brushes for everything you can imagine! I love all the smaller brushes for lips and eyes! This is by far the best brush set I have found online! I received a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li> Wonderful makeup brushes, soft and good quality.  I cleaned them before I used them and none of the bristles fell off so far.  Just disappointed that the price when down from 39.99 to 34.99 5 days after I purchased</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try out a few different brands of brushes lately.  Each set has been so vastly different from each other and you really can tell a difference in quality between each set.  All of been really great sets, but there have been some standouts from each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set for starters is absolutely GORGEOUS!  From the handles on the brushes themselves to the bristles, these are gorgeous brushes.  The holder that you get is also extremely well made and provides a gorgeous place for you to store your brushes away from dust and other nasty stuffs!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes really are absolutely great quality brushes.  The standout for this set is the bonus stippling brush that&#x27;s included.  It is just a great brush.  Using it with your foundation, you dot the foundation versus using &amp;#34;strokes&amp;#34; like a paint brush.  Using a stipling brush is supposed to give you a more airbrushed look without leaving streaks like when using broad strokes can.  I&#x27;m just now getting used to using a brush for my foundation and so I&#x27;m really excited to now have a stippling brush in my beauty tool arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the brushes have the uses printed straight on each individual brush, this makes it a great gift option for beginner&#x27;s just learning about using the different types of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my other favorites in this set is the detail brush, it&#x27;s the perfect size for getting just the right amount of shadow on your lids.  Bigger brushes aren&#x27;t great for darker colors, because it&#x27;s so easy for it to get out of hand so quickly.  So you definitely need a good small shadow brush to use with those tricky colors that you just want a touch of.  The blending brush also is a great brush!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are really soft brushes and they look great sitting on any vanity or sink!!  They also had a stretchy thing over them to help with their shape and I found they were easy to remove and to reuse for when storing!!  I had minimal fallout when I washed the brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m just so uber impressed with these!  I wasn&#x27;t anticipating a lot when I got them, afterall when you&#x27;ve tried brush sets before you just kinda don&#x27;t get all that stoked but I have to say I was surprised at how impressed I was with these!!  They came sealed inside a box with a plastic seal around the box, and then the brushes were also sealed inside another plastic bag, so you can definitely be rest assured that you are getting untainted brushes! They get a HUGE A++++ from me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Review Sample Providedhed the brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m just so uber impressed with these!  I wasn&#x27;t anticipating a lot when I got them, afterall when you&#x27;ve tried brush sets before you just kinda don&#x27;t get all that stoked but I have to say I was surprised at how impressed I was with these!!

            <li> Okay I have always heard great brushes make a difference....boy is that true.  They take less make up so there&#x27;s less waste and they are more precise.  Super soft and sturdy unlike some ends that jiggle and wiggle when your washing and wringing them out.</li>
            <li> The big brushes are not too bad but the smaller one are really difficult to apply. I made my eye make-up looks dirty and unclean. Will choose better brushes from MAC or Bobbi Brown</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautifully put together set, I&#x27;ll give it that. I love the white leather box it came in and the brushes look like they are good quality. I can&#x27;t stand that these brushes soak up my makeup though. I&#x27;ve been using these for just over a week and I have already used twice as much makeup as I normally would if I weren&#x27;t using these brushes. It&#x27;s a waste of money; I&#x27;d rather use my fingers to apply the makeup to my face, that way I use what I want...not more.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. They are incredibly well made, soft, and the case they came in doubles as TWO make up brush holders. I have no use for my other makeup brushes since receiving these. Each brush is great, the bronzer brush is great, my last bronzer brush was so awful that I just didn&#x27;t use bronzer. Now I can&#x27;t live without it. The shadow brushes are really nice too. They are soft yet sturdy for great application. I fully intend to purchase a set of these as a gift for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> As a beauty blogger, I try out a pretty wide variety of makeup brushes, always looking for a great quality foundation brush. Up until now, I had not found the right one for me, nor the right set!&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m getting ahead of myself.&lt;br /&gt;First off, I LOVE the box this comes in! Instead of cheap plastic, these awesome brushes come housed in a nice cream colored display box that reminds me of a mini armoire!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another wonderful feature is the different available brushes. Many sets don&#x27;t include a foundation brush, but this one DOES. To me this is absolutely the most important brush to include in a multi set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each brush has the intended use stamped on the handle. A MUST have in my opinion! Sometimes it can be confusing as to which brush is for which feature, so I find this invaluable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are very visually appealing and pretty to look at, making me feel pampered and ..yes, glamorous. ( I admit it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the brushes glide across the skin, delivering the product (whether powder, cream or liquid) efficiently and without absorbing and therfore wasting any of it.  The foundation worked just as well as more expensive ones I have owned, and I absolutely love it! I do appreciate receiving this in exchange for my unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really love this set and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM!! They are super high quality!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are very well made &amp; I like that they are labeled. They wash up very nicely.</li>
            <li> These are really nice quality makeup brushes. they don&#x27;t shed and they come in a carrying pouch for easy travel.</li>
            <li> “Absolutely fantastic set of brushes. Far exceeded my expectations for the price!”</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes. They are very well made, easy to use and very soft. Makeup doesn&#x27;t stick to them.  The quality of the material is impressive.  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> These brushes are awsome, please make other styles of brushes in larger kits that are needed. Love this brand! Tried them all and better than my high end.</li>
            <li> This brush set is amazing! The brushes are so soft and apply my makeup beautifully.</li>
            <li> “I love this brush set</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh! I&#x27;m so in love with this brushes.. Thank you again guys. You never disappoint me with this product. I&#x27;m so loving it. I need to use it always. :)</li>
            <li> Awesome quality brushes, very impressive set. Haven&#x27;t had any shedding problems even after several washes. The storage box is really nice and convienient also. Highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality brushes and very very affordable!</li>
            <li> really really soft set of brushes! love them for my face and eyes</li>
            <li> Love love love my brushes</li>
            <li> Can I just say how much I love these brushes??? They have held up very well since I bought them and have lost no fibers when I wash them per the directions.&lt;br /&gt;The whole unit looks very classy on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Good brushes get the job done.</li>
            <li> Can I just say the quality is amazing for the price? I love these brushes! They&#x27;re so soft, yet are very good at applying make-up. I find to be using less of my powder foundation with these. The case is really useful for when I have to travel with, and it&#x27;s pretty. I like the magnetic close on it too. I kind of knew these were great quality brushes from the smell of first opening the box because it&#x27;s similar to when you open up a very nice set of (canvas) paint brushes for the first time. I&#x27;ve been using them for a few days, and there has been no shedding so far. These seem to evenly distribute make-up much better than other brushes I&#x27;ve used, too. Oh, and I wasn&#x27;t so sure about the eyeliner brush, but I tried it anyways. Turns out, it&#x27;s not so flimsy that it&#x27;s all over the place, but not too rigid that you can&#x27;t curve the lines the way you want it. It&#x27;s the perfect balance in my opinion - a happy medium.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE THE BEST BRUSHES I HAVE EVER USED. THEY ARE WELL MADE AND LOOK  GREAT. I HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH A NATURAL FINISH FROM A MAKE UP BRUSH LIKE I GOT WHEN USING THESE BRUSHES. I WAS CONSIDERING GETTING AND AIR BRUSH SINCE IT SEEMED NO MATTER HOW I APPLIED MY MAKE UP IT JUST NEVER SEEMED NATURAL. IF I USED MY FINGERS I GET FINGER PRINT LINES, THE FINISH DIDN&#x27;T SEEM TO BE EVEN WITH FOUNDATION SPONGES, AND OTHER BRUSHES DIDN&#x27;T LEAVE A NATURAL LOOK. I WAS OFFERED THESE BRUSHES AT A DISCOUNT PRICE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW, AND I AM SO THANKFUL. I FEEL SO CONFIDENT IN MY MAKE UP NOW THANKS TO THESE BRUSHES! THE BRISTLES ARE SO SOFT TO THE TOUCH YET THEY FIRM ENOUGH TO APPLY. I HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS SATISFIED WITH A MAKE UP APPLICATION TOOL.</li>
            <li> These brushes look fabulous as described, and came promptly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Recieved 2 days after ordering. I have used them one time and absolutely love them. The packaging is very nice. The brushes are soft and the bristles seem to be good quality. So far very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This makeup brush set is divine!  They look - and feel delicious using them!  And the fact that they come in this wonderful standing white case (which is too pretty to hide) is a great bonus! They are soft and do a perfect job of putting on the right amount of makeup and blending beautifully!  Everyone who wears makeup needs a set a these.  They are essential!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each brush as a purpose and it is easily accomplished with these brushes.  I wear Bare Minerals Makeup and these brushes are perfect for putting it on.  My favorite one is the Powder Brush but a close second is the Angled one to put on eye shadow.  I have never been the best at putting on makeup, but these brushes make it a joy for me now.  I actually look forward to putting it on.  Do yourself a favor and get yourself a set!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing brush set and i am so happy to get it. The case is very nice and durable. The two pieces are each magnetized to hold the case shut when they aren&#x27;t in use. I was so impressed to see the complete set. They are nice and thick , the white handles on these seem nice and durable. when i first got them  I washed them in baby shampoo as instructed and the smell was gone. I love the information this company has included with the brushes. They offer care instructions as well as a breakdown of each brush. It was quite impressive.After using these brushes for a few weeks, i was convinced that these brushes provided more of a better look with my make-up if that makes sense. It also provided me more of a variety then my other set with the sizes. After following care instructions for these and using them daily, they still look wonderful. I have not noticed any shedding of the fibers of these brushes which is very nice. I can tell this is going to be a set that lasts a long time!The set is good quality and will totally recommend this.I have places them on my dresses Mirror&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Great brushes and beatiful packaging!</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes! I adore these! :) They dont shed and are soft!</li>
            <li> Very conscientious seller kept me well informed.  The brushes look beautiful and the container is the best looking container I&#x27;ve seen and the magnetic closing is ingenious!  Items were very well packaged and delivered on time.  I washed the brushes first and they dry pretty fast and I did not notice any hair fall out.  The brushes, however, don&#x27;t work for me.  I had a difficult time trying to apply my mineral foundation evenly and the eyeshadow bushes seemed to &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; for my eyes.  The concealer brush didn&#x27;t work too well to apply my concealer, I think a small stippling brush for concealer works best for me. The detail brush is excellent, but the liner brush has hairs which splay so it irritated my eyes when trying to use. The powder brush seems really nice.  I tried the blush brush but couldn&#x27;t get enough product to release on my cheeks.  The denser kabuki style brushes seem to work better with my blush and my bronzer to burnish in the product.  Just my personal preference for blush.  I might suggest using the foundation brush for applying finishing powder close under the eyes because its tapered shape seemed to work for me.  All in all, great seller, great square container, well packaged and delivered promptly!  I love doing business with small family run businesses, but for my products and my needs they didn&#x27;t work. They got great reviews and they have a satisfaction guarantee, so don&#x27;t be afraid to try them, they may be perfect for you, others seemed to love them, and I am disappointed that I didn&#x27;t. Update: I decided to try these with some regular makeup (it was old makeup that I no longer use). These brushes did a good job with &amp;#34;non-mineral&amp;#34; makeup, so if you are not a mineral makeup wearer, these will be super!  I still prefer a kabuki for any blush, although I used this type of blush brush before I discover kabuki brushes!  This container is so great that it is worth the price even if you don&#x27;t use all the brushes.  AND, the seller is super easy to work with!</li>
            <li> These are very nice brushes. They are very soft, and apply makeup very well. One plus is that they come with reusable web wrappers on the bigger brushes. The wrappers hold the bristles intact during shipping. After washing the brush, these wrappers can be reused to mold the bristles into the proper shape during drying.  The customer support is also excellent. I received two follow-up emails from the company, explaining how to use and care for their brushes.  I especially like the case that they ship in. It is a solid, two-piece box that can be opened and deployed as a brush holder.  Cons: The big brushes are not as dense as my Sigma brushes, but I am sure that I will find good use for them, applying foundation, powder, etc. I am disappointed by the small brushes, however, that are supposedly for applying eye makeup.  Most of them are too big for my eyes. They pick up and apply powder very well, but most of them are just too big for painting the details of my makeup.  I do not have a very elaborate makeup plan, but I am still disappointed with most of the eye brushes.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brushes , the softest brushes ever used. The casing makes storage so neat and easy. Please go ahead and buy this, it is well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. High quality, no shedding...and the best part? They come with what the brush is written on the ends! I was SO surprised to see that and I can now practice without having to print out a sheet to see which brush should be used with what. OMG. The handles are comfortable and bright white. I love white...so clean! They clean very well, no smell that I have come across and the case is very nice. Beautiful set of brushes for everyday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> When I first received my package of makeup brushes there was a very strong odor but be you, beautifully emailed me the day before letting me know about and and telling me how to clean it step by step so I wasn&#x27;t surprised. I&#x27;m a 14 year old freshman and highshool and makeup is so fun for me,and because I have sensitive skin I have to pay close attention to what I put on my face and I can honestly say these brushes are what I&#x27;ve needed all along And my skin looks beautiful and flawless!</li>
            <li> “In love with these brushes! They are extremely soft and gentle but still get the job done! Will definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love it!  The brushes are well made.  The size is perfect even for traveling.  The case comes in handy.  It a perfect set with the 8 basic brushes you need.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They come packaged wonderfully and would make a really nice gift. The brushes themselves are soft and have not shed a single hair since I received them. They apply product beautifully and do a wonderful job of blending. They hold up great to washing and seem like they will be the perfect addition to my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised when I received the makeup brush set in the mail. The brushes really are beautiful and the designer case they come in is spectacular! You can&#x27;t beat the price. I am ordering several more sets as they will make great gifts!</li>
            <li> “Very nice set of brushes. I will be buying my daughter a set soon.”</li>
            <li> These Brushes are amazing!!!! I&#x27;m in love with the eyeliner brush! Winged liner is a cinch now :0)</li>
            <li> My wife really likes these brushes.  They are very well made.</li>
            <li> love them! comparable to my mac brushes.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Beautiful Brushes&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are the best I have ever used! Beautiful case and bushes are so soft! Love them!!</li>
            <li> I think makeup brushes are so important when it comes to applying a beautiful makeup look. These brushes are nice, they work well and the price point is fantastic. I wish some of the brushes were a little more dense and full like some of my designer brushes but like I said these work just fine especially when considering the price. These brushes are nice and soft and I absolutely love the case that it comes in, it is magnetic so the case closes super easy acting as both a brush holder and on the go makeup brush case, this case was well designed, very impressed with it. Super fast shipping, nice quality, overall happy with this purchase. It&#x27;s always nice to have extra brushes for travel etc!</li>
            <li> I am loving this brush set. I have several other brush sets and this is now my favorite! The brushes are great quality. No shedding, very full and fluffy. Nice quality bristles. Definitely like that each brush is labeled for its use. Nothing is more important to a beauty routine than a good set of brushes for flawless makeup application And these are just that. They also come with a super nice case to hold them. I am so impressed! I am happy to recieve these brushes to review. I would highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> AMAZING product. Absolutely love the magnet case it comes in. Beautiful soft brushes with a great selection. Will update when I use it for a few weeks but super impressed!!</li>
            <li> Ordered this product and everything about it is amazing! The brushes are great quality, the holder is beautiful and cannot say enough about the customer service! I have never ordered anything from here before where the business sends you a courtesy email with care instructions of their product and personally thanking you for your purchase. Alot of people had complaints about the smell. It took 5 minutes to wash the brushes and the smell was gone! Little of your time for a great product. Don&#x27;t let the other comments fool you! Had a great experience and will be using again in the future! !!! .</li>
            <li> Soft, durable and good looking as well. The brushes blend beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;They are stored in a beautiful white leather magnetic case.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> These are some really good makeup brushes!!!  I have to say these are some of my favorite brushes that I own and I own a lot of make up brushes.  There are so many different make up brushes out there and it is hard to know which ones are good and which ones are cheap and not worth buying.  These are definitely good and worth buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get 9 brushes(1 is a bonus brush) and they come in a white magnetic beautiful leather case box.  The case box is two parts, when you pull it apart or put it back on you can here the magnets.  You can use the case box as two brush holders.  On each holder it says Be You, Beautifully.  The holders look beautiful and would look really nice on any make up desk/vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes that you get are, a powder brush, an angled blush/contour brush, a foundation brush, a concealer brush, a all over angled eye shadow-crease brush, a blending eye shadow brush, a detail eye shadow brush, a eyeliner brush and a bonus brush which is a stippling brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each brush is so soft but yet still dense.  I washed my brushes before I used them and had no problems with any hairs coming out.  They took to the make up very well and applied on my face nice and even.  The handles feel great in my hand and easy to use.  The company offered care instructions with the brushes, which I love that about them, they want the consumer to be happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are made very well and in high quality.  I have been reaching for these more than I reach for my MAC brushes.  The white handles give them a nice rich classy look.  I completely recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful brushes, I am so pleased with my purchase.  They came with a beautiful white leather looking case so you can put the brushes back in the box and cover them up.  I particularly liked that, I don&#x27;t like my brushes setting out.  I washed them as the enclosed instructions suggested and they feel so soft.  Another thing I liked is that the larger brushes, which sometimes get out of shape, have a netting that so after you wash them you can slide the brushes back into the netting to keep their shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough about these brushes, I use to own Channel brushes and I truly like these brushes better at a cost of one Channel brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> I needed a decent set of makeup brushes and now I have them. Impressive set, doesn&#x27;t shed, easy to handle. This set would be great for gift giving also as it is nicely packaged. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I have not received any compensation for writing this post.

            <li> Oh I&#x27;m in Love! Absolutely Love this Awesome set of brushes. Came Wonderfully packaged &amp; in a timely manner.  They come in a beautiful box. It&#x27;s a set of 8 brushes with a bonus 9th brush. Comes with an insert that gives full details on what each brush should be used for. So it&#x27;s great If you have no experience with brushes, they made it so Simple n easy to understand. I&#x27;m so so Glad I got to try these out for an honest unbiased opinion. The bristles are really soft. I&#x27;ve had brushes that really poked my skin &amp; that is not the case with these. The application of my powder and blush was flawless. My face looked smooth and the powder was very well blended. The quality of the brushes is great. To achieve great results you have to use great products. I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think these brushes would be as good as they are for what they are priced they apply beautifully I have a lot of Mac brushes and I can say they match up the same. A must try product</li>
            <li> Made well, quality and great price.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. They don&#x27;t shed and they are very easy to clean. LOVE them.</li>
            <li> Love this brushes excelent quality and the case is pretty.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of the powder brush, the stippling brush is not ao cool , takes a lot of product  especially when used with cream to powder, another limitation is the white colour, should create more colour options. Not such a bad buy!</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness!!! I am so impressed with these brushes! They are so soft, so dense, so wonderful. I love the design and everything about them! One thing love about these brushes are the brush names down at the bottom.  Instead of numbers and not knowing the difference between a blending brush and an eye shadow brush makes it difficult to get the proper look with these brushes they have at the end of the brush what each brush is called!! That was VERY impressive for me! The case is beautiful and perfect for brush holders like the seller stated! These brushes pick up the makeup products and really does an amazing job with getting you that look you&#x27;re trying to get! Honestly if they had it to where can break  5 and go straight to 10 stars I would!</li>
            <li> This makeup brush set is amazing! I am extremely impressed with the quality for these brushes. When they arrived in the mail I noticed the box was very professional and appealing to the eye. Upon opening the box I realized the brushes came in a white leather storage case, the case is square with magnetic closure, the case is very nice and the brushes fit great, they aren&#x27;t crammed or squished. Now onto the brushes, the bristles are very soft and and seem to be secured very well to the handle. The handles are white and made of wood I believe, very nice and they feel great in your hand. I know these brushes are going to last a long time! I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for about a week now and have received several compliments on my makeup from coworkers. I didn&#x27;t change how I applied my makeup or my brand of makeup, just the brushes. I received these brushes at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and I&#x27;m so glad I got to try these out, they are awesome!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing set of makeup brushes. This set comes in a beautiful carrying box, which can sit on a makeup table and have the brushes stand upright in it.  I love the sleek look of these brushes and the white tips.  Additionally, each brush is individually labeled to help identify what part of your face/which product would be best suited for that particular brush. I absolutely love the quality and look of these brushes and feel these would also be an amazing gift for  a friend or loved one.</li>
            <li> I love them,  the box they came in is also nice and strong.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful brushes and they come in a great container that can be used for storage. Very versatile set and no shedding. Love these!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and I like the fact that they came individually packed within the faux magnetic leather case. I will buy another set as a gift it&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li> These are so nice and I love the box they came in!  They look great on my vanity</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, I literally said &amp;#34;wow.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting but I was so impressed with the size and packaging. This is gift quality. I love that these brushes are cruelty free- an absolute MUST for me. The brushes are excellent and bristles are soft, without being flimsy. They are easy to clean and don&#x27;t shed. I&#x27;m not a makeup artist, but this set has everything I need to apply liquid and powder foundation (Bare Minerals), finishing powder, blush, bronzer if I&#x27;m feeling peppy, eye shadow and liner. I&#x27;ve never really had a set of brushes, more like an odd collection of a few at-one-time decent brushes scattered in my bathroom drawers. This is my first complete set and I love it. I&#x27;m sure it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Wow!  Now these are AMAZING brushes!  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything you can&#x27;t do with this set.  The bristles are very soft and the brush heads are nice and full.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any bristle shedding and have washed them twice so far, following the instructions.  They work equally well with creams, liquids, and powders.</li>
            <li> Everything expected and exactly as described by seller, love my new brush set</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes, packaged well in a nice storage box</li>
            <li> These brushes seem very study, I think they will last for a long time!</li>
