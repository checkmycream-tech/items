            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>and it works great!</li>
            <li>Defense Soap works Great !!!</li>
            <li>The label indicates 480 loads when at best you get 16.</li>
            <li>Been using defense soap for years now, was very happy when they came out with this product.  </li>
            <li>Loved it!</li>
            <li>this is really great to use on all the laundry</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>but things seemed to come out great</li>
            <li>This stuff works great.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work well with my laundry and has good suds.  </li>
            <li>Good product and Prompt service.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s Geart pleasant smell, to put it nicely</li>
            <li>The label does make it seem more preventative than problem solving, so I thought maybe it was protecting the clothes from getting dirtier and smellier.</li>
            <li>but I was mostly using it for mildew and prevention.</li>
            <li>Will probably use more often than once</li>
            <li>Just ordered 2 more bottles :)</li>
            <li>more mildew smell.</li>
            <li>we are all okay.  </li>
            <li>Glad to see on Amazon now.  </li>
            <li>To me, the most loads you can wash and treat is 16.</li>
            <li>I feel a lot better knowing this has antibacterial properties to help me protect myself and my family from the germs I carry home with me.</li>
            <li>one of my friends noticed it on my washed and was like you shouldn&#x27;t use cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>using Defense seems to have made a significant difference for her.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff....adding it to the rinse really does work.</li>
            <li>After receiving countless emails to review this product I&#x27;m going to honestly review it.</li>
            <li>I use it every couple of loads (putting 1/2 a dose in the fabric softening compartment of my washing machine) and it keeps my clothes smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>and I have used the whole bottle on about 4 loads of laundry seeing as it takes about 3 caps full to do a load.</li>
            <li>However, I tried just adding it to the rinse cycle of the first wash (without doing the second wash) and it did not work as well (ie, the items I had treated started smelling up again more quickly).</li>
            <li>First off</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not even sure if it actually works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really sucked because my clothing would smell like mildew, even fresh out of the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure this is a good product at all.</li>
            <li>10 lbs of clothes isn&#x27;t much so you pretty much have to use 4 oz per load.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s much cheaper</li>
            <li>However I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in items not holding on to smells as much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using it as a preventative wash to prevent bacterial and fungal growth, but I don&#x27;t really have much faith that it&#x27;s doing anything.</li>
            <li>I am very susceptible of ringworm.</li>
            <li>I have tried all the brands on the market and my wife was at her wits end sending me all diferent kinds on brands, I researched this stuff and orded it, the soap got here fast</li>
            <li>It works really well on our sons sports gear like his football girdle, pants, cup shorts, wrestling singlet, rash guards, etc.</li>
            <li>you should wash the clothes first on a full cycle, then wash them again on a second full cycle without detergent and add this liquid on the rinse portion of the second cycle.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used it several times and I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference.</li>
            <li>We live in Hawaii and this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that gets the mildew smell out of our towels and the sweaty yuk scent out of my husbands tri gear~!</li>
            <li>The Defense Soap Laundry seems to make my super soft cotton towels a little rough, but with lower heat drying this is minimized.</li>
            <li>If you wash your workout clothes in this it really does help keep the odors down, especially if you leave your gym bag in your trunk.  </li>

            <li> a little pricey</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to tell whether it&#x27;s actually antibacterial or not.</li>
            <li> Got this item to wash my son&#x27;s sport equipment  in order to avoid fungal infections caused by excessive sweating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive to use for long periods.  </li>
            <li> My sheets would itch, and now at least it takes longer to start itching.  </li>
            <li> Our first baby came to us with a nasty fungal infection.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> Expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> So when my cloths started to smell bad i researched this product.</li>
            <li> That just a bad way to claim on your label that it treats up to 480 loads.</li>
            <li> Bought this because my pets and I were passing around ringworm :(  </li>
            <li> and I use this product to wash my dirty shrubs!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive to use for long periods.  The bottle is small.  It&#x27;s not clear at all what chemicals create antimicrobial defense and how.  I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27;t work.  I used it for a month and I think it works well.  But I recommend dropping a small bit of Tea Tree Oil into your wash instead, it&#x27;s highly antimicrobial, you can tell it thoroughly coats your clothes because of it&#x27;s scent, it&#x27;s much cheaper and you can buy it at walmart.</li>
            <li> I got this for 2 reasons. 1) hoping that it would help some of my sweaters and workout gear and 2) sanitizing clothes (particularly socks, undergarments, and workout gear). I&#x27;ve used it several times and I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference. It didn&#x27;t reduce the smell of mildew or sweat in already soiled clothes. The label does make it seem more preventative than problem solving, so I thought maybe it was protecting the clothes from getting dirtier and smellier. However I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in items not holding on to smells as much. It&#x27;s difficult to tell whether it&#x27;s actually antibacterial or not. All I can go on is smell. I&#x27;m still using it as a preventative wash to prevent bacterial and fungal growth, but I don&#x27;t really have much faith that it&#x27;s doing anything. It&#x27;s really difficult to rate this because I&#x27;m not sure even if it was working that I would notice much of a difference. Either way, it&#x27;s a lot of extra money for something I&#x27;m not sure is working. Maybe if I had a big fungal issue it&#x27;s value would be clearer but I was mostly using it for mildew and prevention. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be reordering.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff....adding it to the rinse really does work. We live in Hawaii and this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that gets the mildew smell out of our towels and the sweaty yuk scent out of my husbands tri gear~! Awesome!</li>
            <li> My husband and son both get staph infections this is really great to use on all the laundry so there is no question of contaminating anyone else!!!</li>
            <li> After receiving countless emails to review this product I&#x27;m going to honestly review it. First off it&#x27;s expensive and I&#x27;m not even sure if it actually works. I looks like water and as almost no smell. It comes with 32oz and I have used the whole bottle on about 4 loads of laundry seeing as it takes about 3 caps full to do a load. Personally I won&#x27;t but it again as all my clothes are still in the same condition and have the same smell. Even the deodorant that was in the armpits of my shirts still had the scent. I&#x27;m not sure this is a good product at all. It looks like it came from the dollar store one of my friends noticed it on my washed and was like you shouldn&#x27;t use cheap stuff. So yeah not sure it it actually worked but I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> Expensive for the amount you get. Works well to keep fungus in check, but has a funny smell (faint, but present. It is added through the softener dispenser, so the washing machine adds it at the end of the rinse cycle. I think this is what makes for the smell. Can&#x27;t rinse it twice, because that defeats the purpose of the &amp;#34;fungus guard&amp;#34; Just have to live with the smell.</li>
            <li> Much better than the super expensive grapefruit seed extract I was using in my laundry for years.  Will probably use more often than once every 20-30 washes that they advise--more like every other wash--it still cuts my candida/yeast problem way down.  My sheets would itch, and now at least it takes longer to start itching.  I can only use polyester bedding because cotton gets itchy with candida.  Just ordered 2 more bottles :)</li>
            <li> I used this laundry protector after I started fostering kittens for our local Animal Rescue. Our first baby came to us with a nasty fungal infection. I used this for all bedding and toys that he played with and it works great! I will be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> Seems to work well with my laundry and has good suds.  Even though it is advertised as antibacterial soap, the label does not say that.  Instead it says it controls germs.  I called the seller regarding this and they said the label had to be changed due to government regulations.</li>
            <li> My front end washing machine seemed to have build up some mold. I tried scrubbing the mold away and nothing seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really sucked because my clothing would smell like mildew, even fresh out of the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this stuff (I use their soap and body wash, too, having learned about it doing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu) to see what would happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more mildew smell. I don&#x27;t use it with every load. I use it every couple of loads (putting 1/2 a dose in the fabric softening compartment of my washing machine) and it keeps my clothes smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> This product, along with the German product Pursel will kill just about anything without causing skin irritation. The Defense Soap Laundry seems to make my super soft cotton towels a little rough, but with lower heat drying this is minimized. Apparently the usual use of this product is for sports equipment,but for me, it&#x27;s to keep me well after a long illness. Recommend. See my other reviews for other get well slow products lol.</li>
            <li> Got this item to wash my son&#x27;s sport equipment  in order to avoid fungal infections caused by excessive sweating. Loved it!</li>
            <li> Good product and Prompt service.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Bought this because my pets and I were passing around ringworm :(  Between washing with this and meds... we are all okay.  I am very susceptible of ringworm.</li>
            <li> I have two cats that were peeing on my blankets and towels due to feline interstitial cystitis. I used this in the rinse cycle and the smell disappeared.  Also removes mold/milder odors from sweaty workout clothes that have been lying around.</li>
            <li> The small sheet of instructions that ship with the bottle say that if you have an older, regular washer (without the separate dispensing cups for detergent, etc., not an HE washer) you should wash the clothes first on a full cycle, then wash them again on a second full cycle without detergent and add this liquid on the rinse portion of the second cycle. I wasn&#x27;t expecting this extra step and cost for a second wash. However, I tried just adding it to the rinse cycle of the first wash (without doing the second wash) and it did not work as well (ie, the items I had treated started smelling up again more quickly). Since it does work well if you do this extra step, I&#x27;ll keep using it. But it is a little more time consuming if you don&#x27;t have a newer washer.</li>
            <li> I work in a country not known for it&#x27;s Geart pleasant smell, to put it nicely this place smells. So when my cloths started to smell bad i researched this product. Defense Soap works Great !!! I have tried all the brands on the market and my wife was at her wits end sending me all diferent kinds on brands, I researched this stuff and orded it, the soap got here fast and i was amazed to find that my cloths stop picking up the foul smell from the area, DEFAC and laundry.</li>
            <li> a little pricey but I will give it a try</li>
            <li> only used once but things seemed to come out great</li>
            <li> Bought before from defense soap.  Glad to see on Amazon now.  Hope it becomes a Prime item.  This stuff works great.  If you wash your workout clothes in this it really does help keep the odors down, especially if you leave your gym bag in your trunk.  Unlike another posted comment, I have found that it seems to make the towels softer, not scratchy.  We have even washed the kids sneakers in it to help with the odors.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Returned item.  Description is for the bar soap.  I contacted Amazon several times to have them correct it.</li>
            <li> The label indicates 480 loads when at best you get 16. Says to use 2 oz for up to 10 lbs of clothes. 4 oz for heavier loads. 10 lbs of clothes isn&#x27;t much so you pretty much have to use 4 oz per load. This is a 32 oz bottle so I only got 8 loads with it. They are implying you get 480 loads, but that&#x27;s because they say it will protect your clothes for up to 30 washing before you need to use it again. Only a lab could prove if that&#x27;s true so I&#x27;m not challanging that part or dinging them for saying that it lasts that long. To me, the most loads you can wash and treat is 16. Not 480. 16 X 30 &#x3D; 480 so they are counting the 30 loads in which you don&#x27;t even use it. That just a bad way to claim on your label that it treats up to 480 loads. I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if they explained that in the description or made the label big enough to read on the listing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dental hygienist and I use this product to wash my dirty shrubs! I feel a lot better knowing this has antibacterial properties to help me protect myself and my family from the germs I carry home with me.</li>
            <li> Been using defense soap for years now, was very happy when they came out with this product.  It works really well on our sons sports gear like his football girdle, pants, cup shorts, wrestling singlet, rash guards, etc.</li>
            <li> We have a problem here in that a family member is highly susceptible to microbial infections.  Washing clothes, sheets, towels, etc. using Defense seems to have made a significant difference for her.  We&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> That said it was not what I was looking for - I wanted something similar to Canestan anti-fungal wash for all clothes.</li>
