            <li>Thank you so much Amazon!!;-)</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>recommend more of the same scents</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted....</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really go into how I first encountered this perfume</li>
            <li>This is her favorite and she can&#x27;t buy it in the stores anymore for a long time.</li>
            <li>I decided not to purchase the perfume this time because it is a much smaller bottle that spills easily if the bottle is turned on its side by accident.  </li>
            <li>gift for daughter, she absolutely loves this perfume</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I purchased this perfume due to all of the rave reviews, but its just ok.</li>
            <li>CLASSIC cologne spray which is dramatic and absolutely unforgettable.</li>
            <li>I used to have this perfume when I was young, one of my first perfume along Channel.</li>
            <li>Lou Lou by Cacharel for Women bought for my mother, true to French perfumes without any rigging.</li>
            <li>I have purchased the more expensive and potent perfume version before, and this is very close to the perfume scent of Lou Lou.  </li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t seem like the original and has a strange after scent to it.</li>
            <li>It was one of my favorites from high school.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Transportation is the normal time.</li>
            <li>He is very sensitive to scents and hates everything.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased it at Dillard&#x27;s in 1990, but then it left the shelves</li>
            <li>i just love this perfume its a blast from the past</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this fragrance in time past for  many years, I have not purchased it in quite a while</li>
            <li>the smell is BARELY</li>
            <li>A little longer than expected to received, but well worth the wait!</li>
            <li>When sounds and sights no longer bring back the memories, you&#x27;d be surprised at how your nose will yank these back to the present as if you were a possessor of a time machine.</li>
            <li>I discovered this perfume several years ago in a major department store and then shortly thereafter it was no longer imported.  </li>
            <li>disappointed, it didn&#x27;t have that amazing scent of real Lou Lou.</li>
            <li>It smells a bit odd and the scent wears off really fast.</li>

            <li> disappointed, it didn&#x27;t have that amazing scent of real Lou Lou.</li>
            <li> It smells a bit odd and the scent wears off really fast.</li>
            <li> Sent did not last as long as the a perfume that you buy at macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> None of the perfumes on amazon last long.</li>
            <li> so long she use it, never change the smell,</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t original and smelled weird</li>
            <li> While my Channel ones are a must have for me, this little one is always comforting without being too fancy, heavy, or too young&#x27;ish&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Too bad; my husband  and I love it on test paper/card.  </li>
            <li> Just as I expected.</li>
            <li> This is really weak Perfume,if I had not thrown the box away that it came in,I would send it back to Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Nothing like spending$ 30  on &amp;#34;watered&amp;#34; down perfume!</li>
            <li> I would like to buy the bigger bottle but to expensive.</li>
            <li> AWEFUL, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I sprayed on a normal amount of it and it smelled so bad...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> But i guess i bought this one because it is hard to find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible smelling cheap knock off.</li>
            <li> This is one scent I can wear without hearing my husband&#x27;s complaint.  </li>

            <li> my mother is a fan of this perfume will charm the gift!</li>
            <li> gift for daughter, she absolutely loves this perfume</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume due to all of the rave reviews, but its just ok. It smells a bit odd and the scent wears off really fast. I don&#x27;t know what the original smells like but I dont think its this.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected. Great</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know they still made this. It was one of my favorites from high school. I found my old bottle and still liked it.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  Smells just like the original.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift (chosen by the recipient) for a dear friend.  It should have a 5 star rate for our friend, but I would&lt;br /&gt;Prefer another fragrance.  It is a Cacharel for women and my niece love it .</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS ITEM.  Need Not type more.  Will order more.  I would like to buy the bigger bottle but to expensive.</li>
            <li> I used to have this perfume when I was young, one of my first perfume along Channel. Now that I&#x27;m in the States I didn&#x27;t found this perfume in sephora etc. as I used to in France. I was glad to find it here and still appreciate this clean and warm fragrance so much! While my Channel ones are a must have for me, this little one is always comforting without being too fancy, heavy, or too young&#x27;ish&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I knew what I was looking for and found it on Amazon.  Buying through Amazon is easy, the products are as described, and the shipping is super fast.  What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> This perfume is the best you&#x27;ll ever wear. I first purchased it at Dillard&#x27;s in 1990, but then it left the shelves and I could not find it any longer in stores. I saw it here on Amazon and this is my second order. This is the only perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled or worn that remains on your clothing and furniture for days on end. The smell is wonderful and soft with a touch of sweetness. It works great in all seasons and you can smell the fragrant aroma linger among you while you wear it. Every breeze that hits you allows the perfume to fill the air. Everyone will ask, what are you wearing? Even the hottest or most humid day can&#x27;t erase this scent. It&#x27;s a MUST have!</li>
            <li> It feels like I&#x27;m fulfilling my fantasy of a 3some when she wears it. Ah, memories! When sounds and sights no longer bring back the memories, you&#x27;d be surprised at how your nose will yank these back to the present as if you were a possessor of a time machine. Sweet, sensual, but not sickening. I hope Cacharel will bring it back.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t original and smelled weird</li>
            <li> My sister love it for over 20 years so long she use it, never change the smell,</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really go into how I first encountered this perfume but it has remained my favorite ever since. This is how a woman should smell.</li>
            <li> Very Beautiful scent, gardenia-type opening; but doesn&#x27;t go quite right on me.  Too bad; my husband  and I love it on test paper/card.  This is an individual body chemistry issue.  I would recommend people try it for themselves.  Once again if this came under my email (jst madeline @aol.com) could you change ID to Madelilne instead of Brad.</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments on this fragrance. Sometimes I am asked what it is and where to buy it.</li>
            <li> I always got this perfume on cruises as I couldn&#x27;t buy it any longer in the USA.  The last cruise I couldn&#x27;t find it and some one said to go to Amazon and am thrilled to have my 2 bottles of Lou Loul</li>
            <li> This is my mom&#x27;s favorite perfume. It&#x27;s been no longer sold in Vietnam so i had to buy it at amazon. We love it.&lt;br /&gt;Linh Phan</li>
            <li> Outstanding product, great price, arrived right on time.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is impossible to find in the stores anymore but I am grateful for the opportunity to purchase on-line.  I discovered this perfume several years ago in a major department store and then shortly thereafter it was no longer imported.  I am terrible at describing the smell other than Spicy but not as much as the Opium perfume but runs along that line.</li>
            <li> Hoped to be able to purchase the 72percent Vol -but still happy. The smell is refreshing and unique!</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume, loooove the lou lou</li>
            <li> CLASSIC cologne spray which is dramatic and absolutely unforgettable. The most amazing fragrance from the late 80s is still available to enjoy again. No complaints about this purchase - it&#x27;s wonderful. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this subtly sweet  perfume that is so elegant yet flirty fun. I get so many compliments when I wear this and am so glad to have found it on amazon. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> If I could, I would rate it \\&quot;no star\\&quot;...AWEFUL, don&#x27;t waste your money! I sprayed on a normal amount of it and it smelled so bad... I had to take a shower. The scent does NOT linger as I read in the reviews. It smells NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL OF YEARS AGO THAT I LOVED. And it lasts about 15 minutes after you spray it on....lingering....not a scent left on your skin! Who wrote those reviews? The Sellers...&lt;br /&gt;AND IT IS NOT RETURNABLE, it is a Hazard if WE ship it back, BUT, it is NOT A HAZARD for THEM to ship it to us. What a racket/scam...&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed, it didn&#x27;t have that amazing scent of real Lou Lou. This is a horrible smelling cheap knock off. I bought it for the great reviews and that it was genuine Lou Lou. Buyer Beware. I am beyond livid that I can not return it??? What is that about??? What a scam... very bad shopping experience from Amazon....terrible Customer Service. I hope they get rich off the 30.00 or so dollars that they make off this... Not even a Credit to Buy something else on Amazon!!!  Just like that!&lt;br /&gt;They lost a customer.&lt;br /&gt;I never wrote a review, but this experience will go viral for me. Great job, Amazon....not.</li>
            <li> Years ago I was given a sample of this fragrance.  I started wearing it and everywhere I went people told me how pleasant it was.  I keep buying it and it still suits me 30 years later in my &#x27;60s.  A bit floral, just charming. I see stores sell it but I love the delivery of course.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my best friend of 40 years. This is her favorite and she can&#x27;t buy it in the stores anymore for a long time. It&#x27;s my surprise for her on every birthday.</li>
            <li> This is really weak Perfume,if I had not thrown the box away that it came in,I would send it back to Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time I ordered this perfume.The first time I received it,it smelled,like loulou,&lt;br /&gt;Sweet and strong....this time however,neither my husband  or&lt;br /&gt; myself can smell anything....the smell is BARELY THERE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a fake!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt; Nothing like spending$ 30  on &amp;#34;watered&amp;#34; down perfume! Not happy!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my order and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This has been my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume for many years. I buy one for her on her birthday practically every year.</li>
            <li> Great smell, great deal!!  I am so happy that I found it on amazon.  It has a very deep put amazing smell.  I love wear it at night time and most definitely on summer night!  I have received plenty of compliments!  Thanks :-)</li>
            <li> Good product. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Lou Lou by Cacharel for Women bought for my mother, true to French perfumes without any rigging. Transportation is the normal time. everyone is happy :)&lt;br /&gt;ვუყიდე დედაჩემს ,  ნამდვილი ფრანგული  სუნამოა ყოველგვარი გაყალბებების გარეშე. ტრანსპორტირებაც  ნორმალურ დროში. ყველა კმაოფილია :)</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance for the price.  I have purchased the more expensive and potent perfume version before, and this is very close to the perfume scent of Lou Lou.  I am so glad to have found this scent again.  People recognize it when I wear it and ask where I got it from because it is a favorite of many.  This is one scent I can wear without hearing my husband&#x27;s complaint.  He is very sensitive to scents and hates everything.  I decided not to purchase the perfume this time because it is a much smaller bottle that spills easily if the bottle is turned on its side by accident.  I lost several bottles of Lou Lou that way perfume just when moving.  I wish they would secure the perfume bottles like they do this one.</li>
            <li> lou lou by Cacharel for women, bougth for my wife, wonderful fragance that stay on she all day, it the favorite for her</li>
            <li> Sent did not last as long as the a perfume that you buy at macy&#x27;s. None of the perfumes on amazon last long. But i guess i bought this one because it is hard to find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> love my perfum, smells so pretty</li>
            <li> I have used the original Lou Lou when Cacharel had a perfume fair.. it&#x27;s very different from the one I purchased here. This one doesn&#x27;t seem like the original and has a strange after scent to it.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years.  Besides my nickname is LULU</li>
            <li> She loves it.... I get it for her every year</li>
            <li> I used to wear Lou Lou about 20 years ago.  Then they stopped selling it in the US. Imagine my surprise when I saw that Amazon had it.  This perfume has a very light flowery smell; nothing overwhelming. Whenever I wear it, I get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> i just love this perfume its a blast from the past and i still use it you must give it a try</li>
            <li> It was a Mothers Day Gift for my mom. She as well as I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I used to use this Perfume almost 19 years ago when I was still in Indonesia (I got it from my ex when he was working in France&#x27;s cruse line. I have been searching for it since then. It was so a wonderful feel when I saw it in amazon. I love it...Thank you so much Amazon!!;-)</li>
            <li> Product is great! Daughter received it for xmas and loves it! I put a drop of this great stuff on my cats head and she still smells wonderful after a week. I put it on her head so she could not lick it off.</li>
            <li> This is the cologne that I receive the most complements on by  both men &amp; women.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  One my favorites.</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for more years than I care to count.  The Amazon price was very good value.</li>
            <li> A little longer than expected to received, but well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles and i am very satisfied for this product.&lt;br /&gt;Its delicius, dont do it to buy this perfum</li>
            <li> I love Lou Lou however this one smells a bit more Alcohol than the Lou Lou I used to have. I gave it to a a friend of mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this fragrance in time past for  many years, I have not purchased it in quite a while but I&#x27;m tremendously pleased that I purchased it again.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes of all times. Wonderful fragrance that stays with you all day. Sorry they don&#x27;t make the perfume anymore because that was an even better fragrance. But still is the one I remember.</li>
            <li> I used to wear LouLou when I was much younger and living abroad, but then was unable to find it at any retailer for many years. When I wear it perfect strangers stop and ask me what it is, it&#x27;s so unique.</li>
            <li> my wife &amp; me we loved it ...... it show up in short time in great condition, we missed it since she used to wear it 17 years ago when we start our relation - it is the history</li>
