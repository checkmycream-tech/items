            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I like my Lanza much better</li>
            <li>The toner of the shampoo doesn&#x27;t do much but it does lather very nicely.</li>
            <li>It came in a fairly timely manner and seems to be the real stuff!</li>
            <li>These big sized ones didn&#x27;t come with pumps, but I found some cheap here on Amazon that work perfectly.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is good too, not thin like the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair.</li>
            <li>Cruelty free and fabulous hair</li>
            <li>Great for blonde hair even if you color your hair.</li>
            <li>had my blonde hair for about 3 months already and the color still looks great</li>
            <li>The shampoo is phosphate free (to lessen color fade)</li>
            <li>I have several varieties in my shower at a time, but always go back to this one as I love the smell the best.</li>
            <li>Considering how much I have lightened my hair, this really does a good job at making it feel like hair again.</li>
            <li>i did not care for super smooth</li>
            <li>far as my hair is concerned, it has never been softer, more silky, or more manageable.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>The conditioner is a little bit drying to my hair but still a great combo!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>This alone makes it worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner, but I can&#x27;t find it around here for anywhere near this price.  </li>
            <li>and this keeps it feeling soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>My package came right on time.</li>
            <li>right after</li>
            <li>The price is right for this grerat shampoo-</li>
            <li>I used to have my hair colored dark burgundy, and i used their color care with olive oil line and loved it.</li>
            <li>So it is super gentle on your skin and hair.</li>
            <li>i colored my hair blond and this cambo just will not let my hair go dull or lose the collor sach a great product.</li>
            <li>With my hair recently dyed almost-platinum, my stylist recommended a blonde-specific shampoo, so I was glad that Pureology makes one.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many others and this product is the only one that leaves my hair silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is a light blue color and is very runny, i&#x27;m assuming because it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>You will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>The seller packed it with care and shipped fast!</li>
            <li>and it smelled funny</li>
            <li>I bought this to maintain my blonde,  after reading so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I have grey hair AND scalp psoriasis and have found that Pureology&#x27;s Perfect 4 Platinum shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t aggravate my psoriasis while at the same time keep my hair from looking yellow.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is good by itself, but I use the masque by Pureology as well when I do my hair, but only once a week, and I leave it on for an hour with a shower cap on to keep it moist, and to contain the masque from getting onto pillow cases and such.  </li>
            <li>totally worth the cost - and so much cheaper here than a salon or at Ulta - (not sold in normal retail stores)</li>
            <li>In fact, you&#x27;ll need to use a good deep conditioner to avoid dry, brittle, lack luster hair.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the way it smells.</li>
            <li>color lasts so much longer when I use this product</li>
            <li>Conditioner also does not provide much moisturizing benefit.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo left my hair feeling stripped as if I had used a deep cleanser instead of adding any kind of moisture.</li>
            <li>but I will be going back to the original formula I started with.</li>
            <li>Now I am a platinum blonde, and with a combination of this and the Perfect 10 5 minute miracle for blondes, my fried hair is MUCH less fried, in fact, it is actually quite soft.</li>
            <li>I have eczema on my feet and hands, so I have changed all my skin products to sulfate free and as natural as possible (since the shampoo washes off you and onto your feet before draining) and it is doing SO much</li>
            <li>I did not notice if my blonde was becoming brassy or stayed &#x27;blonde&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I used my normal Redken S/C</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive scalp</li>
            <li>For my heavy and fine hair the shampoo did not do anything that another salon product could do.</li>
            <li>I am giving 4 stars because the conditioner felt a little light compared to the shampoo</li>
            <li>love this shampoo and conditioner - have been using it solid for a little over 4 years - my hair used to shed allot but now, I could probably count the amount of hair strands I lose in the shower -</li>
            <li>My hair is professionally colored with low-lites and hi-lites.</li>
            <li>and the hair feel so soft i dont need a conditioner even.</li>
            <li>Wow, I was won over.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend, especially if you color treat your hair to lighter than your natural color.</li>
            <li>There is definitely a difference when you use purology, my hair is soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>In the end, I had clean hair that was in desperate need of a light weight conditioner.</li>
            <li>never going back to my old shampoo and conditioner again</li>
            <li>/&gt;Three stars because cost is too high and is not a wonderful product for fine bleached (hi-lited) hair.</li>
            <li>I have never disliked a single product of theirs.</li>
            <li>so I will mix in a normal shampoo every other week to prevent build up.</li>

            <li> so I will mix in a normal shampoo every other week to prevent build up.</li>
            <li> last for a long time becouse its so concentrated, i have long hair and bottle 8 oz lasting me 2 months already.</li>
            <li> The products with a deeper purple tint (like Paul Mitchell Platinum) do make my grey hair look whiter, but I&#x27;d rather use one set of shampoo &amp; conditioner instead of one set to keep my grey hair from looking yellow and another to keep my psoriasis in check.</li>
            <li> The reason it is so expensive is it is 100% SULFATE FREE.</li>
            <li> I can finally run my fingers through my hair when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> Back then I used the pink Pureology bottles and then began using the lavender ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my hair was still dry and yucky.</li>
            <li> I tried the Strength Cure formula and could not live without it.</li>
            <li> and I have literally tried every single product on the market</li>
            <li> Then I watched my mom&#x27;s hair go from frizzy and dull to soft with lots of body.</li>
            <li> I have thick naturally curly hair that I highlight blond.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so the bottles last a long time, even the ones that look small.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s Pureology, you can&#x27;t go wrong there.  </li>
            <li> You use such a small amount compared to other shampoos and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if I use the conditioner, my hair isn&#x27;t as dry as some other expensive brands have left it.</li>
            <li> Shampoo seems to be very drying with continued use &amp; conditioner is not much more than an expensive de-tangler.  </li>
            <li> I usually purchase the 8 oz bottles from my salon in a package that is around 70</li>
            <li> i fill small bottles with this.</li>

            <li> Cruelty free and fabulous hair it is perfect match for me.</li>
            <li> It really is the best shampoo/conditioner.  I have fine hair and I have literally tried every single product on the market and it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> Great for blonde hair even if you color your hair.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo and conditioner - have been using it solid for a little over 4 years - my hair used to shed allot but now, I could probably count the amount of hair strands I lose in the shower - totally worth the cost - and so much cheaper here than a salon or at Ulta - (not sold in normal retail stores)</li>
            <li> Nothing to say. Product is great.</li>
            <li> I love Pureology. I have a very sensitive scalp and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it itching (or worse) since I started using their shampoo and conditioner. This alone makes it worth the price. With my hair recently dyed almost-platinum, my stylist recommended a blonde-specific shampoo, so I was glad that Pureology makes one. Considering how much I have lightened my hair, this really does a good job at making it feel like hair again. I also really like the way it smells. A little goes a long way, so the bottles last a long time, even the ones that look small. These big sized ones didn&#x27;t come with pumps, but I found some cheap here on Amazon that work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Costly, but a great product.</li>
            <li> great product and it was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I have received great recommendations on this product.  It was a great price and delivered very quickly.  It leaves my hair very smooth and shiney</li>
            <li> This is one of the most amazing hair products on the market!  I have never received so many compliments on my hair!  One lady commented that my hair made me look 25 again! (Trust me I am more than twice that age)</li>
            <li> Love loveee&lt;br /&gt;Great price&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quick&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pureology for a while now on my highlighted hair and love the results. It keeps the hair from going brassy.</li>
            <li> Have used both for years. Need I say more?</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, but I can&#x27;t find it around here for anywhere near this price.  I figure it will last me months and months.</li>
            <li> This is is the only shampoo and conditioner I will ever use. I have thick naturally curly hair that I highlight blond.Pureology is the best!</li>
            <li> this is great stuff! i did not care for super smooth but i tried this and its awesome!seems like allot of money...but it lasts me 10 months value? yes!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo .. The conditioner is a little bit drying to my hair but still a great combo!&lt;br /&gt;My color lasts so much longer when I use this product and I don&#x27;t have to visit my hairdresser as often!&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent price!!!</li>
            <li> its worth the money!!! had my blonde hair for about 3 months already and the color still looks great never going back to my old shampoo and conditioner again</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, and great service.</li>
            <li> My hair is professionally colored with low-lites and hi-lites. I have a lot of fine hair. I bought this to maintain my blonde,  after reading so many positive reviews. The smell is amazing and lasts throughout the day. For my heavy and fine hair the shampoo did not do anything that another salon product could do. i.e. Redken, Biolage, Matrix&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo left my hair feeling stripped as if I had used a deep cleanser instead of adding any kind of moisture. I did not notice if my blonde was becoming brassy or stayed &#x27;blonde&#x27;.  In the end, I had clean hair that was in desperate need of a light weight conditioner. Bummer, indeed, but now I know.&lt;br /&gt;Three stars because cost is too high and is not a wonderful product for fine bleached (hi-lited) hair.</li>
            <li> Purology is simply a magical company.  I have never disliked a single product of theirs. I used to have my hair colored dark burgundy, and i used their color care with olive oil line and loved it. Now I am a platinum blonde, and with a combination of this and the Perfect 10 5 minute miracle for blondes, my fried hair is MUCH less fried, in fact, it is actually quite soft. I do love the smell too.</li>
            <li> I have grey hair AND scalp psoriasis and have found that Pureology&#x27;s Perfect 4 Platinum shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t aggravate my psoriasis while at the same time keep my hair from looking yellow. The products with a deeper purple tint (like Paul Mitchell Platinum) do make my grey hair look whiter, but I&#x27;d rather use one set of shampoo &amp; conditioner instead of one set to keep my grey hair from looking yellow and another to keep my psoriasis in check. Bonus is that these products smell great!</li>
            <li> Love the product.  My hair is shinny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of my hair after using Pureology. It&#x27;s just a terrific product and will continue to use it for years to come. I have several varieties in my shower at a time, but always go back to this one as I love the smell the best. Amazon gives us a great price too!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! I color my hair about every 8 weeks and this keeps it feeling soft and healthy. The shampoo is phosphate free (to lessen color fade) so I will mix in a normal shampoo every other week to prevent build up. The Perfect 4 Platinum also smells AMAZING and lasts the scent always lasts until your next wash.  Love Pureology!</li>
            <li> Love it, great pricing, saved 50% over purchasing in the salon.</li>
            <li> Shampoo seems to be very drying with continued use &amp; conditioner is not much more than an expensive de-tangler.  Conditioner also does not provide much moisturizing benefit.  In fact, you&#x27;ll need to use a good deep conditioner to avoid dry, brittle, lack luster hair.  I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love Pureolgy Shampoo and I also love that I can order it online and have it shipped to my house. It came in a fairly timely manner and seems to be the real stuff! (-: Thankyou!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. I&#x27;ve tried all these expensive and organic product but this one tops them all. Makes my hair like silk. I can finally run my fingers through my hair when it&#x27;s wet. This product is a must for color treated blondes.</li>
            <li> NOTHING makes my hair feel as silky and healthy as Pureology!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner on the market.  I have tried so many others and this product is the only one that leaves my hair silky and shiny.  I would highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s Pureology, you can&#x27;t go wrong there.  Secondly, the shampoo is purple, which means it will keep the brassiness out of your blonde locks.  The conditioner is good by itself, but I use the masque by Pureology as well when I do my hair, but only once a week, and I leave it on for an hour with a shower cap on to keep it moist, and to contain the masque from getting onto pillow cases and such.  If you want rejuvenated hair, go with ANY Pureology brand, but for blondes, this one is a must have.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. The reason it is so expensive is it is 100% SULFATE FREE. So it is super gentle on your skin and hair. I have eczema on my feet and hands, so I have changed all my skin products to sulfate free and as natural as possible (since the shampoo washes off you and onto your feet before draining) and it is doing SO much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as my hair is concerned, it has never been softer, more silky, or more manageable. I highly recommend, especially if you color treat your hair to lighter than your natural color. That is what it is designed for, color treated hair to keep it from going brassy or fading.</li>
            <li> I received this item in perfect time. I tried the Strength Cure formula and could not live without it. I searched online and found the platinum formula since I have my hair bleached and decided to try this out. I like it but I don&#x27;t love it like I loved the Hydrate formula. The shampoo is a light blue color and is very runny, i&#x27;m assuming because it is sulfate free. The toner of the shampoo doesn&#x27;t do much but it does lather very nicely. There is definitely a difference when you use purology, my hair is soft and manageable! The conditioner is good too, not thin like the shampoo. I like it,  but I will be going back to the original formula I started with.</li>
            <li> i colored my hair blond and this cambo just will not let my hair go dull or lose the collor sach a great product. and the hair feel so soft i dont need a conditioner even. last for a long time becouse its so concentrated, i have long hair and bottle 8 oz lasting me 2 months already.</li>
            <li> This duo is such a bargain. My package came right on time. I usually purchase the 8 oz bottles from my salon in a package that is around 70 and that&#x27;s with a discount so I lucked out with this. I am giving 4 stars because the conditioner felt a little light compared to the shampoo</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair looking great.  This size bottle will last forever.  You use such a small amount compared to other shampoos and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it... You will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo and conditioner! I put foils of bleach on my hair every 8-10 weeks and my hair has never been softer and feels great! I also have to use Unite Toner Blonda (great product too!), but that&#x27;s another story! I&#x27;ve been using this Platinum for a year now, Amazon most def has the BEST deal for it! The seller packed it with care and shipped fast! Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I did not care for this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blond who gets bleach blond highlights about every 10-12 weeks. I used my normal Redken S/C right after and my hair was still dry and yucky. I ordered the Perfect 4 Platinum and used it this morning...such a difference!!! This stuff is amazing. Never going back to another shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li> I guess I don&#x27;t get why it&#x27;s so expensive...it has done nothing different to my hair. I like my Lanza much better</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo I won&#x27;t use anything else! My hair used to be thin and falling out sence I&#x27;ve started using this shampoo my hair is thinker</li>
            <li> The price is right for this grerat shampoo- i fill small bottles with this.</li>
            <li> I became a fan of Pureology when I was visiting my son and used my daughter-in-law&#x27;s supply. Wow, I was won over. Back then I used the pink Pureology bottles and then began using the lavender ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying out these yellow bottles. I have highlights and lowlights and the Perfect 4 Platinum seems to work well with the color and if I use the conditioner, my hair isn&#x27;t as dry as some other expensive brands have left it. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and it smells great! About a year ago I got the moisturizing line and it smelled funny so I was hesitant to try Pureology again. Then I watched my mom&#x27;s hair go from frizzy and dull to soft with lots of body. I&#x27;m glad I tried it again!</li>
