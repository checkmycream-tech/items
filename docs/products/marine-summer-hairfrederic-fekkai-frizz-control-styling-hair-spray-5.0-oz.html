            <li> I highly recommend this hair product for all ages for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t make you&#x27;re hair flat and keep it all day.</li>
            <li> I have long curly-wavy hair, and this didn&#x27;t prevent any amount of frizz whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I even used it in tandem with the matching cream, and I still had dry frizzy locks, even when air drying.</li>
            <li> but leaves my hair feeling somewhat dry.  </li>
            <li> , then dry, then wet.  </li>
            <li> I used it in the BVIs since I knew my hair would be wet</li>
            <li> I saw and read other reviews and agree with everyone who has used this product</li>
            <li> I moved from Southern CA, where there is no humidity, to NYC, with ridiculous humidity.</li>
            <li> Though it is supposed to be a \\&quot;summer\\&quot; product, she uses it all year round.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair BULLET PROOF from humidity, if you can get past the (sunscreen) smell</li>
            <li> I live in S. Florida, so this product got a work out in summer&#x27;s humidity, and FAILED miserably.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> This product made my hair stiff and smelled awful.</li>

            <li> It does not work as well as its predecessor but better than nothing.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter loves this spray.She has very curly (bordering on frizzy) hair. She sprays this on after she washes her hair and it really keeps it under control. A great additional benefit is that it smells great! Though it is supposed to be a \\&quot;summer\\&quot; product, she uses it all year round.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair stiff and smelled awful. I am returning it.</li>

            <li> Smells great (like a Caribbean beach!) but leaves my hair feeling somewhat dry.  It does give you beach-y waves tho!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of Fekkai hair products but they keep discontinuing the ones I like best.</li>
            <li> Works great on humid days; just don&#x27;t spray too much or your hair may look oily.  Also helps keep fly-away bangs in place.</li>

            <li> I used it in the BVIs since I knew my hair would be wet, then dry, then wet.  It made my hair really soft for an hour and then really coarse.  It didn&#x27;t work on Frizz at all either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hispanic and have wavy hair. I moved from Southern CA, where there is no humidity, to NYC, with ridiculous humidity. This Frizz Control has been a life saver!
