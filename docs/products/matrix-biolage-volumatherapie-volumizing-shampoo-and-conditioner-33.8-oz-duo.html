            <li>me, Biologe has just kept my hair healthy for about four years.</li>

            <li>No strange stipulations, easy option if you like the product and great pricing, comparable to salons and license required beauty stores within $10.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves hair clean and not dry or fly away.  </li>
            <li>It stays clean and controlled.  </li>
            <li>It did not lather up or make my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li>The large size bottles are more economical.</li>
            <li>this item shipped quickly and will purchase again from seller.</li>
            <li>and I got exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li>you have fine or damaged hair, I highly recommend that you try this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Great product for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and have very fine hair that always seems to be greasy by the end of the day I recommend this product because not only does it add volume to your hair it also balances out the amount of oil in your hair.</li>
            <li>Even my gray hairs are soft and easy to tame.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yummy rich new formula.</li>
            <li>My hair is actually softer and more hydrated with this set.  </li>
            <li>I like to switch up my shampoos because they stop working, but this shampoo is one of my alternates, that really provides my hair with shine &amp; body!</li>
            <li>I always take a small bottle when I travel because the stuff in hotels is NEVER as nice as this shampoo!</li>
            <li>These products leave my hair clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair full and soft.  </li>
            <li>so I could easily pin it up in a bun or French twist to keep it from driving me</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced compared to buying from store or salon.</li>
            <li>Packaged really well.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Great body for thin hair.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo really cleans and conditioner really conditions.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t review household products very often at all, but am today I am startled by the person who said this didn&#x27;t do anything for their hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had fine, flyaway hair and had been keeping it long</li>
            <li>This does a decent job</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>When you do find it, it&#x27;s priced ridiculously high.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.  </li>
            <li>I feel it is worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time &amp; is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly 5 years and any time I change, my hair gets obviously less clean and buoyant.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why anyone would pay nearly $40 for a product they haven&#x27;t tried before so</li>
            <li>It did not make my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I finally found a Shampoo and Conditioner I really like.</li>
            <li>(I have dry hair) for a long time, but decided to try the Volumatherapie Shampoo and Conditioner to see if it could provide some volume for my very straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Biolage completely healed one of my adult kids&#x27; hair, which was a dry and frizzled mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> She has curly dry hair and this is her only choice for shampoo</li>
            <li> also I have long hair &amp; only need a little shampoo and conditioner to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find at normal stores and it&#x27;s only in select salons</li>
            <li> I do not find it watery at all, unlike the other reviewer.  </li>

            <li> This comes from just an ordinary woman who uses Biolage.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Reasonably priced compared to buying from store or salon. Very light fragrance and volumizing shampoo does its job plus the conditioner. Packaged really well.</li>
            <li> I have used the Biolage Hydratherapy Shampoo and Conditioner (I have dry hair) for a long time, but decided to try the Volumatherapie Shampoo and Conditioner to see if it could provide some volume for my very straight hair.  I love them!  My hair is actually softer and more hydrated with this set.  And it has more body.  I do not find it watery at all, unlike the other reviewer.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Works well on my hair. Holds my hair nicely in place, and does a great job of thickening my otherwise thinning hair.</li>
            <li> My wife has very fine hair so she looks for ways to make it thicker. This does a decent job and she absolutely loves it. Was recommended by our hairdresser.</li>
            <li> Got this for my girl. Now she makes me sandwiches.</li>
            <li> I like to switch up my shampoos because they stop working, but this shampoo is one of my alternates, that really provides my hair with shine &amp; body!</li>
            <li> Always thought the more expensive products didn&#x27;t make a difference...until now. There is a definite difference in the volume of my hair using this product. I feel it is worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used  Matrix Amplify Volumizing Shampoo and Conditioner for many years. I love it. However,the Matrix Biolage Volumatherapie Shampoo and Conditioner are watery. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the seller or the product.. tossed it out. Rarely do I get a bad deal on Amazon. This one is a don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had fine, flyaway hair and had been keeping it long so I could easily pin it up in a bun or French twist to keep it from driving me nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, using both this shampoo and conditioner from Biolage, I have my hair in a bob and wash it almost every day.  It stays clean and controlled.  I use nothing else, except sometimes a little holding spray on my bangs.  Even my gray hairs are soft and easy to tame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have fine or damaged hair, I highly recommend that you try this stuff.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> All the previous reviews refer to the product itself...I don&#x27;t know why anyone would pay nearly $40 for a product they haven&#x27;t tried before so none of those helped me when I made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll review what I wish others would have which is the product packaging and delivery. I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly 5 years and any time I change, my hair gets obviously less clean and buoyant. It&#x27;s difficult to find at normal stores and it&#x27;s only in select salons so it&#x27;s hard to find. When you do find it, it&#x27;s priced ridiculously high. Usually you find the smaller bottles for about $23 per bottle. I didn&#x27;t think to look here until my husband suggested it. The packaging is great and it came on time, so you&#x27;re getting exactly what you pay for it. No strange stipulations, easy option if you like the product and great pricing, comparable to salons and license required beauty stores within $10. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, and I am especially pleased to be able to purchase this in large size format at a great price.  Bought plastic pump tops to go with these bottles.  This shampoo leaves hair clean and not dry or fly away.  I always take a small bottle when I travel because the stuff in hotels is NEVER as nice as this shampoo!</li>
            <li> Biologe has become my FAVORITE choice for shampoo and conditioner. I couldn&#x27;t tell you how many times and how many products I&#x27;ve tried in order to find one that is truly the best choice for my hair. If you&#x27;re like me and have very fine hair that always seems to be greasy by the end of the day I recommend this product because not only does it add volume to your hair it also balances out the amount of oil in your hair. I recommend this product for both volume and nutrilization of your hair.</li>
            <li> Great product for thin, fine hair. Much better price on Amazon than at the hair dressers!</li>
            <li> It did not make my hair soft and shiny. It did not lather up or make my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li> Love it and cheaper then the store</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff. It is my job to keep her in stock. She has curly dry hair and this is her only choice for shampoo</li>
            <li> These products leave my hair clean and soft.  I like using this product.  The large size bottles are more economical.</li>
            <li> I love them! They remind me of going to Fantastic Sams when I was a kid because that&#x27;s what they used :) I love this product and I got exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li> Great value, gives my hair amazing body.This is 64 ounces for the price of 24 if I bought the same product at Target.</li>
            <li> Yummy rich new formula. Been using this stuff for years and switch good brands here and there. My all time favorite scent too. Great deal!</li>
            <li> Came on time and as described</li>
            <li> Great fragrance..lathers and rinses well.  Great body for thin hair.  Makes your hair full and soft.  Recommend highly.  Great price.</li>
            <li> LOVE this shampoo been using it for years. Helps with thin flat lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> As good as advertised. Shampoo really cleans and conditioner really conditions. Adds volume and shine as promised. Large size is a great value too,</li>
            <li> I just received the set, i have not used it yet, however my first thought about it before using it, is IT STINKS.</li>
            <li> This comes from just an ordinary woman who uses Biolage. I don&#x27;t review household products very often at all, but am today I am startled by the person who said this didn&#x27;t do anything for their hair. Biolage completely healed one of my adult kids&#x27; hair, which was a dry and frizzled mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, Biologe has just kept my hair healthy for about four years. I can&#x27;t fathom any reason I would change brands.</li>
            <li> great combo for plumping up your clean, shiny locks; the fragrance is light and attractive and results are worth it!</li>
            <li> This product is not exactly what i thought it would be. Its actually drying to my hair and I don&#x27;t get the volume that the product suggests you get when using it. I probably will not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I finally found a Shampoo and Conditioner I really like. this item shipped quickly and will purchase again from seller. also I have long hair &amp; only need a little shampoo and conditioner to wash your hair. Lasts a long time &amp; is worth the money.</li>
